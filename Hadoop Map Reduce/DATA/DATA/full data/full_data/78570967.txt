78570967	the battle of life      chapter i  part the first    once upon a time it matters little when and in stalwart england  it matters little where a fierce battle was fought  it was fought  upon a long summer day when the waving grass was green  many a  wild flower formed by the almighty hand to be a perfumed goblet for  the dew felt its enamelled cup filled high with blood that day  and shrinking dropped  many an insect deriving its delicate colour  from harmless leaves and herbs was stained anew that day by dying  men and marked its frightened way with an unnatural track  the  painted butterfly took blood into the air upon the edges of its  wings  the stream ran red  the trodden ground became a quagmire  whence from sullen pools collected in the prints of human feet and  horses hoofs the one prevailing hue still lowered and glimmered  at the sun  heaven keep us from a knowledge of the sights the moon beheld upon  that field when coming up above the black line of distant rising ground softened and blurred at the edge by trees she rose into  the sky and looked upon the plain strewn with upturned faces that  had once at mothers breasts sought mothers eyes or slumbered  happily  heaven keep us from a knowledge of the secrets whispered  afterwards upon the tainted wind that blew across the scene of that  days work and that nights death and suffering  many a lonely  moon was bright upon the battleground and many a star kept  mournful watch upon it and many a wind from every quarter of the  earth blew over it before the traces of the fight were worn away  they lurked and lingered for a long time but survived in little  things for nature far above the evil passions of men soon  recovered her serenity and smiled upon the guilty battleground as  she had done before when it was innocent  the larks sang high  above it the swallows skimmed and dipped and flitted to and fro  the shadows of the flying clouds pursued each other swiftly over  grass and corn and turnipfield and wood and over roof and church spire in the nestling town among the trees away into the bright  distance on the borders of the sky and earth where the red sunsets  faded  crops were sown and grew up and were gathered in the  stream that had been crimsoned turned a watermill men whistled at  the plough gleaners and haymakers were seen in quiet groups at  work sheep and oxen pastured boys whooped and called in fields  to scare away the birds smoke rose from cottage chimneys sabbath  bells rang peacefully old people lived and died the timid  creatures of the field the simple flowers of the bush and garden  grew and withered in their destined terms  and all upon the fierce  and bloody battleground where thousands upon thousands had been  killed in the great fight  but there were deep green patches in  the growing corn at first that people looked at awfully  year  after year they reappeared and it was known that underneath those  fertile spots heaps of men and horses lay buried  indiscriminately enriching the ground  the husbandmen who  ploughed those places shrunk from the great worms abounding there  and the sheaves they yielded were for many a long year called  the battle sheaves and set apart and no one ever knew a battle  sheaf to be among the last load at a harvest home  for a long  time every furrow that was turned revealed some fragments of the  fight  for a long time there were wounded trees upon the battle ground and scraps of hacked and broken fence and wall where  deadly struggles had been made and trampled parts where not a leaf  or blade would grow  for a long time no village girl would dress  her hair or bosom with the sweetest flower from that field of  death  and after many a year had come and gone the berries  growing there were still believed to leave too deep a stain upon  the hand that plucked them  the seasons in their course however though they passed as lightly  as the summer clouds themselves obliterated in the lapse of time  even these remains of the old conflict and wore away such  legendary traces of it as the neighbouring people carried in their  minds until they dwindled into old wives tales dimly remembered  round the winter fire and waning every year  where the wild  flowers and berries had so long remained upon the stem untouched  gardens arose and houses were built and children played at  battles on the turf  the wounded trees had long ago made christmas  logs and blazed and roared away  the deep green patches were no  greener now than the memory of those who lay in dust below  the  ploughshare still turned up from time to time some rusty bits of  metal but it was hard to say what use they had ever served and  those who found them wondered and disputed  an old dinted  corselet and a helmet had been hanging in the church so long  that the same weak halfblind old man who tried in vain to make  them out above the whitewashed arch had marvelled at them as a  baby  if the host slain upon the field could have been for a  moment reanimated in the forms in which they fell each upon the  spot that was the bed of his untimely death gashed and ghastly  soldiers would have stared in hundreds deep at household door and  window and would have risen on the hearths of quiet homes and  would have been the garnered store of barns and granaries and  would have started up between the cradled infant and its nurse and  would have floated with the stream and whirled round on the mill  and crowded the orchard and burdened the meadow and piled the  rickyard high with dying men  so altered was the battleground  where thousands upon thousands had been killed in the great fight  nowhere more altered perhaps about a hundred years ago than in  one little orchard attached to an old stone house with a  honeysuckle porch where on a bright autumn morning there were  sounds of music and laughter and where two girls danced merrily  together on the grass while some halfdozen peasant women standing  on ladders gathering the apples from the trees stopped in their  work to look down and share their enjoyment  it was a pleasant  lively natural scene a beautiful day a retired spot and the two  girls quite unconstrained and careless danced in the freedom and  gaiety of their hearts  if there were no such thing as display in the world my private  opinion is and i hope you agree with me that we might get on a  great deal better than we do and might be infinitely more  agreeable company than we are  it was charming to see how these  girls danced  they had no spectators but the applepickers on the  ladders  they were very glad to please them but they danced to  please themselves or at least you would have supposed so and you  could no more help admiring than they could help dancing  how  they did dance  not like operadancers  not at all  and not like madame anybodys  finished pupils  not the least  it was not quadrille dancing nor  minuet dancing nor even countrydance dancing  it was neither in  the old style nor the new style nor the french style nor the  english style  though it may have been by accident a trifle in  the spanish style which is a free and joyous one i am told  deriving a delightful air of offhand inspiration from the  chirping little castanets  as they danced among the orchard trees  and down the groves of stems and back again and twirled each other  lightly round and round the influence of their airy motion seemed  to spread and spread in the sunlighted scene like an expanding  circle in the water  their streaming hair and fluttering skirts  the elastic grass beneath their feet the boughs that rustled in  the morning air  the flashing leaves the speckled shadows on the  soft green ground  the balmy wind that swept along the landscape  glad to turn the distant windmill cheerily  everything between  the two girls and the man and team at plough upon the ridge of  land where they showed against the sky as if they were the last  things in the world  seemed dancing too  at last the younger of the dancing sisters out of breath and  laughing gaily threw herself upon a bench to rest  the other  leaned against a tree hard by  the music a wandering harp and  fiddle left off with a flourish as if it boasted of its  freshness though the truth is it had gone at such a pace and  worked itself to such a pitch of competition with the dancing that  it never could have held on half a minute longer  the apple pickers on the ladders raised a hum and murmur of applause and  then in keeping with the sound bestirred themselves to work again  like bees  the more actively perhaps because an elderly gentleman who was  no other than doctor jeddler himself  it was doctor jeddlers  house and orchard you should know and these were doctor jeddlers  daughters  came bustling out to see what was the matter and who  the deuce played music on his property before breakfast  for he  was a great philosopher doctor jeddler and not very musical  music and dancing today said the doctor stopping short and  speaking to himself  i thought they dreaded today  but its a  world of contradictions  why grace why marion he added  aloud is the world more mad than usual this morning  make some allowance for it father if it be replied his younger  daughter marion going close to him and looking into his face  for its somebodys birthday  somebodys birthday puss replied the doctor  dont you know  its always somebodys birthday  did you never hear how many new  performers enter on this  ha ha ha  its impossible to speak  gravely of it  on this preposterous and ridiculous business called  life every minute  no father  no not you of course youre a woman  almost said the doctor   bytheby and he looked into the pretty face still close to  his i suppose its your birthday  no  do you really father cried his pet daughter pursing up  her red lips to be kissed  there  take my love with it said the doctor imprinting his  upon them and many happy returns of the  the idea  of the day   the notion of wishing happy returns in such a farce as this said  the doctor to himself is good  ha ha ha  doctor jeddler was as i have said a great philosopher and the  heart and mystery of his philosophy was to look upon the world as  a gigantic practical joke as something too absurd to be considered  seriously by any rational man  his system of belief had been in  the beginning part and parcel of the battleground on which he  lived as you shall presently understand  well  but how did you get the music asked the doctor   poultrystealers of course  where did the minstrels come from  alfred sent the music said his daughter grace adjusting a few  simple flowers in her sisters hair with which in her admiration  of that youthful beauty she had herself adorned it halfanhour  before and which the dancing had disarranged  oh  alfred sent the music did he returned the doctor  yes  he met it coming out of the town as he was entering early   the men are travelling on foot and rested there last night and as  it was marions birthday and he thought it would please her he  sent them on with a pencilled note to me saying that if i thought  so too they had come to serenade her  ay ay said the doctor carelessly he always takes your  opinion  and my opinion being favourable said grace goodhumouredly and  pausing for a moment to admire the pretty head she decorated with  her own thrown back and marion being in high spirits and  beginning to dance i joined her  and so we danced to alfreds  music till we were out of breath  and we thought the music all the  gayer for being sent by alfred  didnt we dear marion  oh i dont know grace  how you tease me about alfred  tease you by mentioning your lover said her sister  i am sure i dont much care to have him mentioned said the  wilful beauty stripping the petals from some flowers she held and  scattering them on the ground  i am almost tired of hearing of  him and as to his being my lover    hush  dont speak lightly of a true heart which is all your own  marion cried her sister even in jest  there is not a truer  heart than alfreds in the world  nono said marion raising her eyebrows with a pleasant air of  careless consideration perhaps not  but i dont know that  theres any great merit in that  i  i dont want him to be so  very true  i never asked him  if he expects that i   but dear  grace why need we talk of him at all just now  it was agreeable to see the graceful figures of the blooming  sisters twined together lingering among the trees conversing  thus with earnestness opposed to lightness yet with love  responding tenderly to love  and it was very curious indeed to see  the younger sisters eyes suffused with tears and something  fervently and deeply felt breaking through the wilfulness of what  she said and striving with it painfully  the difference between them in respect of age could not exceed  four years at most but grace as often happens in such cases when  no mother watches over both the doctors wife was dead seemed  in her gentle care of her young sister and in the steadiness of  her devotion to her older than she was and more removed in  course of nature from all competition with her or participation  otherwise than through her sympathy and true affection in her  wayward fancies than their ages seemed to warrant  great  character of mother that even in this shadow and faint reflection  of it purifies the heart and raises the exalted nature nearer to  the angels  the doctors reflections as he looked after them and heard the  purport of their discourse were limited at first to certain merry  meditations on the folly of all loves and likings and the idle  imposition practised on themselves by young people who believed  for a moment that there could be anything serious in such bubbles  and were always undeceived  always  but the homeadorning selfdenying qualities of grace and her  sweet temper so gentle and retiring yet including so much  constancy and bravery of spirit seemed all expressed to him in the  contrast between her quiet household figure and that of his younger  and more beautiful child and he was sorry for her sake  sorry for  them both  that life should be such a very ridiculous business as  it was  the doctor never dreamed of inquiring whether his children or  either of them helped in any way to make the scheme a serious one   but then he was a philosopher  a kind and generous man by nature he had stumbled by chance over  that common philosophers stone much more easily discovered than  the object of the alchemists researches which sometimes trips up  kind and generous men and has the fatal property of turning gold  to dross and every precious thing to poor account  britain cried the doctor  britain  holloa  a small man with an uncommonly sour and discontented face emerged  from the house and returned to this call the unceremonious  acknowledgment of now then  wheres the breakfast table said the doctor  in the house returned britain  are you going to spread it out here as you were told last night  said the doctor  dont you know that there are gentlemen coming   that theres business to be done this morning before the coach  comes by  that this is a very particular occasion  i couldnt do anything dr jeddler till the women had done  getting in the apples could i said britain his voice rising  with his reasoning so that it was very loud at last  well have they done now replied the doctor looking at his  watch and clapping his hands  come make haste wheres  clemency  here am i mister said a voice from one of the ladders which a  pair of clumsy feet descended briskly  its all done now  clear  away gals  everything shall be ready for you in half a minute  mister  with that she began to bustle about most vigorously presenting as  she did so an appearance sufficiently peculiar to justify a word  of introduction  she was about thirty years old and had a sufficiently plump and  cheerful face though it was twisted up into an odd expression of  tightness that made it comical  but the extraordinary homeliness  of her gait and manner would have superseded any face in the  world  to say that she had two left legs and somebody elses  arms and that all four limbs seemed to be out of joint and to  start from perfectly wrong places when they were set in motion is  to offer the mildest outline of the reality  to say that she was  perfectly content and satisfied with these arrangements and  regarded them as being no business of hers and that she took her  arms and legs as they came and allowed them to dispose of  themselves just as it happened is to render faint justice to her  equanimity  her dress was a prodigious pair of selfwilled shoes  that never wanted to go where her feet went blue stockings a  printed gown of many colours and the most hideous pattern  procurable for money and a white apron  she always wore short  sleeves and always had by some accident grazed elbows in which  she took so lively an interest that she was continually trying to  turn them round and get impossible views of them  in general a  little cap placed somewhere on her head though it was rarely to be  met with in the place usually occupied in other subjects by that  article of dress but from head to foot she was scrupulously  clean and maintained a kind of dislocated tidiness  indeed her  laudable anxiety to be tidy and compact in her own conscience as  well as in the public eye gave rise to one of her most startling  evolutions which was to grasp herself sometimes by a sort of  wooden handle part of her clothing and familiarly called a busk  and wrestle as it were with her garments until they fell into a  symmetrical arrangement  such in outward form and garb was clemency newcome who was  supposed to have unconsciously originated a corruption of her own  christian name from clementina but nobody knew for the deaf old  mother a very phenomenon of age whom she had supported almost  from a child was dead and she had no other relation who now  busied herself in preparing the table and who stood at intervals  with her bare red arms crossed rubbing her grazed elbows with  opposite hands and staring at it very composedly until she  suddenly remembered something else she wanted and jogged off to  fetch it  here are them two lawyers acoming mister said clemency in a  tone of no very great goodwill  ah cried the doctor advancing to the gate to meet them  good  morning good morning  grace my dear  marion  here are messrs  snitchey and craggs  wheres alfred  hell be back directly father no doubt said grace  he had so  much to do this morning in his preparations for departure that he  was up and out by daybreak  good morning gentlemen  ladies said mr snitchey for self and craggs who bowed  good morning  miss to marion i kiss your hand  which he  did  and i wish you  which he might or might not for he didnt  look at first sight like a gentleman troubled with many warm  outpourings of soul in behalf of other people a hundred happy  returns of this auspicious day  ha ha ha laughed the doctor thoughtfully with his hands in his  pockets  the great farce in a hundred acts  you wouldnt i am sure said mr snitchey standing a small  professional blue bag against one leg of the table cut the great  farce short for this actress at all events doctor jeddler  no returned the doctor  god forbid  may she live to laugh at  it as long as she can laugh and then say with the french wit  the farce is ended draw the curtain  the french wit said mr snitchey peeping sharply into his blue  bag was wrong doctor jeddler and your philosophy is altogether  wrong depend upon it as i have often told you  nothing serious  in life  what do you call law  a joke replied the doctor  did you ever go to law asked mr snitchey looking out of the  blue bag  never returned the doctor  if you ever do said mr snitchey perhaps youll alter that  opinion  craggs who seemed to be represented by snitchey and to be  conscious of little or no separate existence or personal  individuality offered a remark of his own in this place  it  involved the only idea of which he did not stand seized and  possessed in equal moieties with snitchey but he had some  partners in it among the wise men of the world  its made a great deal too easy said mr craggs  law is asked the doctor  yes said mr craggs everything is  everything appears to me  to be made too easy nowadays  its the vice of these times  if  the world is a joke i am not prepared to say it isnt it ought  to be made a very difficult joke to crack  it ought to be as hard  a struggle sir as possible  thats the intention  but its  being made far too easy  we are oiling the gates of life  they  ought to be rusty  we shall have them beginning to turn soon  with a smooth sound  whereas they ought to grate upon their  hinges sir  mr craggs seemed positively to grate upon his own hinges as he  delivered this opinion to which he communicated immense effect   being a cold hard dry man dressed in grey and white like a  flint with small twinkles in his eyes as if something struck  sparks out of them  the three natural kingdoms indeed had each a  fanciful representative among this brotherhood of disputants for  snitchey was like a magpie or raven only not so sleek and the  doctor had a streaked face like a winterpippin with here and  there a dimple to express the peckings of the birds and a very  little bit of pigtail behind that stood for the stalk  as the active figure of a handsome young man dressed for a  journey and followed by a porter bearing several packages and  baskets entered the orchard at a brisk pace and with an air of  gaiety and hope that accorded well with the morning these three  drew together like the brothers of the sister fates or like the  graces most effectually disguised or like the three weird prophets  on the heath and greeted him  happy returns alf said the doctor lightly  a hundred happy returns of this auspicious day mr heathfield  said snitchey bowing low  returns craggs murmured in a deep voice all alone  why what a battery exclaimed alfred stopping short and one   two  three  all foreboders of no good in the great sea before  me  i am glad you are not the first i have met this morning  i  should have taken it for a bad omen  but grace was the first   sweet pleasant grace  so i defy you all  if you please mister i was the first you know said clemency  newcome  she was walking out here before sunrise you remember   i was in the house  thats true  clemency was the first said alfred  so i defy  you with clemency  ha ha ha  for self and craggs said snitchey  what a  defiance  not so bad a one as it appears may be said alfred shaking  hands heartily with the doctor and also with snitchey and craggs  and then looking round  where are the  good heavens  with a start productive for the moment of a closer partnership  between jonathan snitchey and thomas craggs than the subsisting  articles of agreement in that wise contemplated he hastily betook  himself to where the sisters stood together and  however i  neednt more particularly explain his manner of saluting marion  first and grace afterwards than by hinting that mr craggs may  possibly have considered it too easy  perhaps to change the subject dr jeddler made a hasty move  towards the breakfast and they all sat down at table  grace  presided but so discreetly stationed herself as to cut off her  sister and alfred from the rest of the company  snitchey and  craggs sat at opposite corners with the blue bag between them for  safety the doctor took his usual position opposite to grace   clemency hovered galvanically about the table as waitress and the  melancholy britain at another and a smaller board acted as grand  carver of a round of beef and a ham  meat said britain approaching mr snitchey with the carving  knife and fork in his hands and throwing the question at him like  a missile  certainly returned the lawyer  do you want any to craggs  lean and well done replied that gentleman  having executed these orders and moderately supplied the doctor  he seemed to know that nobody else wanted anything to eat he  lingered as near the firm as he decently could watching with an  austere eye their disposition of the viands and but once relaxing  the severe expression of his face  this was on the occasion of mr  craggs whose teeth were not of the best partially choking when  he cried out with great animation i thought he was gone  now alfred said the doctor for a word or two of business  while we are yet at breakfast  while we are yet at breakfast said snitchey and craggs who  seemed to have no present idea of leaving off  although alfred had not been breakfasting and seemed to have quite  enough business on his hands as it was he respectfully answered  if you please sir  if anything could be serious the doctor began in such a    farce as this sir hinted alfred  in such a farce as this observed the doctor it might be this  recurrence on the eve of separation of a double birthday which  is connected with many associations pleasant to us four and with  the recollection of a long and amicable intercourse  thats not to  the purpose  ah yes yes dr jeddler said the young man  it is to the  purpose  much to the purpose as my heart bears witness this  morning and as yours does too i know if you would let it speak   i leave your house today i cease to be your ward today we part  with tender relations stretching far behind us that never can be  exactly renewed and with others dawning  yet before us he  looked down at marion beside him fraught with such considerations  as i must not trust myself to speak of now  come come he added  rallying his spirits and the doctor at once theres a serious  grain in this large foolish dustheap doctor  let us allow to day that there is one  today cried the doctor  hear him  ha ha ha  of all days  in the foolish year  why on this day the great battle was fought  on this ground  on this ground where we now sit where i saw my  two girls dance this morning where the fruit has just been  gathered for our eating from these trees the roots of which are  struck in men not earth  so many lives were lost that within my  recollection generations afterwards a churchyard full of bones  and dust of bones and chips of cloven skulls has been dug up from  underneath our feet here  yet not a hundred people in that battle  knew for what they fought or why not a hundred of the  inconsiderate rejoicers in the victory why they rejoiced  not  half a hundred people were the better for the gain or loss  not  halfadozen men agree to this hour on the cause or merits and  nobody in short ever knew anything distinct about it but the  mourners of the slain  serious too said the doctor laughing   such a system  but all this seems to me said alfred to be very serious  serious cried the doctor  if you allowed such things to be  serious you must go mad or die or climb up to the top of a  mountain and turn hermit  besides  so long ago said alfred  long ago returned the doctor  do you know what the world has  been doing ever since  do you know what else it has been doing   i dont  it has gone to law a little observed mr snitchey stirring his  tea  although the way out has been always made too easy said his  partner  and youll excuse my saying doctor pursued mr snitchey  having been already put a thousand times in possession of my  opinion in the course of our discussions that in its having gone  to law and in its legal system altogether i do observe a serious  side  now really a something tangible and with a purpose and  intention in it    clemency newcome made an angular tumble against the table  occasioning a sounding clatter among the cups and saucers  heyday whats the matter there exclaimed the doctor  its this evilinclined blue bag said clemency always tripping  up somebody  with a purpose and intention in it i was saying resumed  snitchey that commands respect  life a farce dr jeddler  with  law in it  the doctor laughed and looked at alfred  granted if you please that war is foolish said snitchey   there we agree  for example  heres a smiling country pointing  it out with his fork once overrun by soldiers  trespassers every  man of em  and laid waste by fire and sword  he he he  the  idea of any man exposing himself voluntarily to fire and sword   stupid wasteful positively ridiculous you laugh at your fellow creatures you know when you think of it  but take this smiling  country as it stands  think of the laws appertaining to real  property to the bequest and devise of real property to the  mortgage and redemption of real property to leasehold freehold  and copyhold estate think said mr snitchey with such great  emotion that he actually smacked his lips of the complicated laws  relating to title and proof of title with all the contradictory  precedents and numerous acts of parliament connected with them  think of the infinite number of ingenious and interminable chancery  suits to which this pleasant prospect may give rise and  acknowledge dr jeddler that there is a green spot in the scheme  about us  i believe said mr snitchey looking at his partner  that i speak for self and craggs  mr craggs having signified assent mr snitchey somewhat  freshened by his recent eloquence observed that he would take a  little more beef and another cup of tea  i dont stand up for life in general he added rubbing his hands  and chuckling its full of folly full of something worse   professions of trust and confidence and unselfishness and all  that  bah bah bah  we see what theyre worth  but you mustnt  laugh at life youve got a game to play a very serious game  indeed  everybodys playing against you you know and youre  playing against them  oh its a very interesting thing  there  are deep moves upon the board  you must only laugh dr jeddler  when you win  and then not much  he he he  and then not much  repeated snitchey rolling his head and winking his eye as if he  would have added you may do this instead  well alfred cried the doctor what do you say now  i say sir replied alfred that the greatest favour you could  do me and yourself too i am inclined to think would be to try  sometimes to forget this battlefield and others like it in that  broader battlefield of life on which the sun looks every day  really im afraid that wouldnt soften his opinions mr alfred  said snitchey  the combatants are very eager and very bitter in  that same battle of life  theres a great deal of cutting and  slashing and firing into peoples heads from behind  there is  terrible treading down and trampling on  it is rather a bad  business  i believe mr snitchey said alfred there are quiet victories  and struggles great sacrifices of self and noble acts of heroism  in it  even in many of its apparent lightnesses and contradictions   not the less difficult to achieve because they have no earthly  chronicle or audience  done every day in nooks and corners and in  little households and in mens and womens hearts  any one of  which might reconcile the sternest man to such a world and fill  him with belief and hope in it though twofourths of its people  were at war and another fourth at law and thats a bold word  both the sisters listened keenly  well well said the doctor i am too old to be converted even  by my friend snitchey here or my good spinster sister martha  jeddler who had what she calls her domestic trials ages ago and  has led a sympathising life with all sorts of people ever since  and who is so much of your opinion only shes less reasonable and  more obstinate being a woman that we cant agree and seldom  meet  i was born upon this battlefield  i began as a boy to  have my thoughts directed to the real history of a battlefield   sixty years have gone over my head and i have never seen the  christian world including heaven knows how many loving mothers and  good enough girls like mine here anything but mad for a battle field  the same contradictions prevail in everything  one must  either laugh or cry at such stupendous inconsistencies and i  prefer to laugh  britain who had been paying the profoundest and most melancholy  attention to each speaker in his turn seemed suddenly to decide in  favour of the same preference if a deep sepulchral sound that  escaped him might be construed into a demonstration of risibility   his face however was so perfectly unaffected by it both before  and afterwards that although one or two of the breakfast party  looked round as being startled by a mysterious noise nobody  connected the offender with it  except his partner in attendance clemency newcome who rousing him  with one of those favourite joints her elbows inquired in a  reproachful whisper what he laughed at  not you said britain  who then  humanity said britain  thats the joke  what between master and them lawyers hes getting more and more  addleheaded every day cried clemency giving him a lunge with  the other elbow as a mental stimulant  do you know where you  are  do you want to get warning  i dont know anything said britain with a leaden eye and an  immovable visage  i dont care for anything  i dont make out  anything  i dont believe anything  and i dont want anything  although this forlorn summary of his general condition may have  been overcharged in an access of despondency benjamin britain   sometimes called little britain to distinguish him from great as  we might say young england to express old england with a decided  difference  had defined his real state more accurately than might  be supposed  for serving as a sort of man miles to the doctors  friar bacon and listening day after day to innumerable orations  addressed by the doctor to various people all tending to show that  his very existence was at best a mistake and an absurdity this  unfortunate servitor had fallen by degrees into such an abyss of  confused and contradictory suggestions from within and without  that truth at the bottom of her well was on the level surface as  compared with britain in the depths of his mystification  the only  point he clearly comprehended was that the new element usually  brought into these discussions by snitchey and craggs never served  to make them clearer and always seemed to give the doctor a  species of advantage and confirmation  therefore he looked upon  the firm as one of the proximate causes of his state of mind and  held them in abhorrence accordingly  but this is not our business alfred said the doctor  ceasing  to be my ward as you have said today and leaving us full to the  brim of such learning as the grammar school down here was able to  give you and your studies in london could add to that and such  practical knowledge as a dull old country doctor like myself could  graft upon both you are away now into the world  the first term  of probation appointed by your poor father being over away you go  now your own master to fulfil his second desire  and long before  your three years tour among the foreign schools of medicine is  finished youll have forgotten us  lord youll forget us easily  in six months  if i do  but you know better why should i speak to you said  alfred laughing  i dont know anything of the sort returned the doctor  what do  you say marion  marion trifling with her teacup seemed to say  but she didnt  say it  that he was welcome to forget if he could  grace pressed  the blooming face against her cheek and smiled  i havent been i hope a very unjust steward in the execution of  my trust pursued the doctor but i am to be at any rate  formally discharged and released and what not this morning and  here are our good friends snitchey and craggs with a bagful of  papers and accounts and documents for the transfer of the  balance of the trust fund to you i wish it was a more difficult  one to dispose of alfred but you must get to be a great man and  make it so and other drolleries of that sort which are to be  signed sealed and delivered  and duly witnessed as by law required said snitchey pushing  away his plate and taking out the papers which his partner  proceeded to spread upon the table and self and crags having been  cotrustees with you doctor in so far as the fund was concerned  we shall want your two servants to attest the signatures  can you  read mrs newcome  i ant married mister said clemency  oh  i beg your pardon  i should think not chuckled snitchey  casting his eyes over her extraordinary figure  you can read  a little answered clemency  the marriage service night and morning eh observed the lawyer  jocosely  no said clemency  too hard  i only reads a thimble  read a thimble echoed snitchey  what are you talking about  young woman  clemency nodded  and a nutmeggrater  why this is a lunatic a subject for the lord high chancellor  said snitchey staring at her   if possessed of any property stipulated craggs  grace however interposing explained that each of the articles in  question bore an engraved motto and so formed the pocket library  of clemency newcome who was not much given to the study of books  oh thats it is it miss grace said snitchey  yes yes  ha ha ha  i thought our friend was an idiot  she  looks uncommonly like it he muttered with a supercilious glance   and what does the thimble say mrs newcome  i ant married mister observed clemency  well newcome  will that do said the lawyer  what does the  thimble say newcome  how clemency before replying to this question held one pocket  open and looked down into its yawning depths for the thimble which  wasnt there  and how she then held an opposite pocket open and  seeming to descry it like a pearl of great price at the bottom  cleared away such intervening obstacles as a handkerchief an end  of wax candle a flushed apple an orange a lucky penny a cramp  bone a padlock a pair of scissors in a sheath more expressively  describable as promising young shears a handful or so of loose  beads several balls of cotton a needlecase a cabinet collection  of curlpapers and a biscuit all of which articles she entrusted  individually and separately to britain to hold  is of no  consequence  nor how in her determination to grasp this pocket by the throat  and keep it prisoner for it had a tendency to swing and twist  itself round the nearest corner she assumed and calmly  maintained an attitude apparently inconsistent with the human  anatomy and the laws of gravity  it is enough that at last she  triumphantly produced the thimble on her finger and rattled the  nutmeggrater  the literature of both those trinkets being  obviously in course of wearing out and wasting away through  excessive friction  thats the thimble is it young woman said mr snitchey  diverting himself at her expense  and what does the thimble say  it says replied clemency reading slowly round as if it were a  tower forget and forgive  snitchey and craggs laughed heartily  so new said snitchey   so easy said craggs  such a knowledge of human nature in it  said snitchey  so applicable to the affairs of life said  craggs  and the nutmeggrater inquired the head of the firm  the grater says returned clemency do as you  wold  be  done  by  do or youll be done brown you mean said mr snitchey  i dont understand retorted clemency shaking her head vaguely   i ant no lawyer  i am afraid that if she was doctor said mr snitchey turning  to him suddenly as if to anticipate any effect that might  otherwise be consequent on this retort shed find it to be the  golden rule of half her clients  they are serious enough in that   whimsical as your world is  and lay the blame on us afterwards   we in our profession are little else than mirrors after all mr  alfred but we are generally consulted by angry and quarrelsome  people who are not in their best looks and its rather hard to  quarrel with us if we reflect unpleasant aspects  i think said  mr snitchey that i speak for self and craggs  decidedly said craggs  and so if mr britain will oblige us with a mouthful of ink  said mr snitchey returning to the papers well sign seal and  deliver as soon as possible or the coach will be coming past  before we know where we are  if one might judge from his appearance there was every probability  of the coach coming past before mr britain knew where he was for  he stood in a state of abstraction mentally balancing the doctor  against the lawyers and the lawyers against the doctor and their  clients against both and engaged in feeble attempts to make the  thimble and nutmeggrater a new idea to him square with anybodys  system of philosophy and in short bewildering himself as much as  ever his great namesake has done with theories and schools  but  clemency who was his good genius  though he had the meanest  possible opinion of her understanding by reason of her seldom  troubling herself with abstract speculations and being always at  hand to do the right thing at the right time  having produced the  ink in a twinkling tendered him the further service of recalling  him to himself by the application of her elbows with which gentle  flappers she so jogged his memory in a more literal construction  of that phrase than usual that he soon became quite fresh and  brisk  how he laboured under an apprehension not uncommon to persons in  his degree to whom the use of pen and ink is an event that he  couldnt append his name to a document not of his own writing  without committing himself in some shadowy manner or somehow  signing away vague and enormous sums of money and how he  approached the deeds under protest and by dint of the doctors  coercion and insisted on pausing to look at them before writing  the cramped hand to say nothing of the phraseology being so much  chinese to him and also on turning them round to see whether  there was anything fraudulent underneath and how having signed  his name he became desolate as one who had parted with his  property and rights i want the time to tell  also how the blue  bag containing his signature afterwards had a mysterious interest  for him and he couldnt leave it also how clemency newcome in  an ecstasy of laughter at the idea of her own importance and  dignity brooded over the whole table with her two elbows like a  spread eagle and reposed her head upon her left arm as a  preliminary to the formation of certain cabalistic characters  which required a deal of ink and imaginary counterparts whereof  she executed at the same time with her tongue  also how having  once tasted ink she became thirsty in that regard as tame tigers  are said to be after tasting another sort of fluid and wanted to  sign everything and put her name in all kinds of places  in  brief the doctor was discharged of his trust and all its  responsibilities and alfred taking it on himself was fairly  started on the journey of life  britain said the doctor  run to the gate and watch for the  coach  time flies alfred  yes sir yes returned the young man hurriedly  dear grace a  moment  marion  so young and beautiful so winning and so much  admired dear to my heart as nothing else in life is  remember  i  leave marion to you  she has always been a sacred charge to me alfred  she is doubly  so now  i will be faithful to my trust believe me  i do believe it grace  i know it well  who could look upon your  face and hear your voice and not know it  ah grace  if i had  your wellgoverned heart and tranquil mind how bravely i would  leave this place today  would you she answered with a quiet smile  and yet grace  sister seems the natural word  use it she said quickly  i am glad to hear it  call me  nothing else  and yet sister then said alfred marion and i had better have  your true and steadfast qualities serving us here and making us  both happier and better  i wouldnt carry them away to sustain  myself if i could  coach upon the hilltop exclaimed britain  time flies alfred said the doctor  marion had stood apart with her eyes fixed upon the ground but  this warning being given her young lover brought her tenderly to  where her sister stood and gave her into her embrace  i have been telling grace dear marion he said that you are  her charge my precious trust at parting  and when i come back and  reclaim you dearest and the bright prospect of our married life  lies stretched before us it shall be one of our chief pleasures to  consult how we can make grace happy how we can anticipate her  wishes how we can show our gratitude and love to her how we can  return her something of the debt she will have heaped upon us  the younger sister had one hand in his the other rested on her  sisters neck  she looked into that sisters eyes so calm  serene and cheerful with a gaze in which affection admiration  sorrow wonder almost veneration were blended  she looked into  that sisters face as if it were the face of some bright angel   calm serene and cheerful the face looked back on her and on her  lover  and when the time comes as it must one day said alfred  i  wonder it has never come yet but grace knows best for grace is  always right  when she will want a friend to open her whole heart  to and to be to her something of what she has been to us  then  marion how faithful we will prove and what delight to us to know  that she our dear good sister loves and is loved again as we  would have her  still the younger sister looked into her eyes and turned not   even towards him  and still those honest eyes looked back so  calm serene and cheerful on herself and on her lover  and when all that is past and we are old and living as we  must together  close together  talking often of old times  said alfred  these shall be our favourite times among them  this  day most of all and telling each other what we thought and felt  and hoped and feared at parting and how we couldnt bear to say  good bye    coach coming through the wood cried britain  yes  i am ready  and how we met again so happily in spite of  all well make this day the happiest in all the year and keep it  as a treble birthday  shall we dear  yes interposed the elder sister eagerly and with a radiant  smile  yes  alfred dont linger  theres no time  say good  bye to marion  and heaven be with you  he pressed the younger sister to his heart  released from his  embrace she again clung to her sister and her eyes with the same  blended look again sought those so calm serene and cheerful  farewell my boy said the doctor  to talk about any serious  correspondence or serious affections and engagements and so forth  in such a  ha ha ha  you know what i mean  why that of course  would be sheer nonsense  all i can say is that if you and marion  should continue in the same foolish minds i shall not object to  have you for a soninlaw one of these days  over the bridge cried britain  let it come said alfred wringing the doctors hand stoutly   think of me sometimes my old friend and guardian as seriously as  you can  adieu mr snitchey  farewell mr craggs  coming down the road cried britain  a kiss of clemency newcome for long acquaintance sake  shake  hands britain  marion dearest heart good bye  sister grace  remember  the quiet household figure and the face so beautiful in its  serenity were turned towards him in reply but marions look and  attitude remained unchanged  the coach was at the gate  there was a bustle with the luggage   the coach drove away  marion never moved  he waves his hat to you my love said grace  your chosen  husband darling  look  the younger sister raised her head and for a moment turned it   then turning back again and fully meeting for the first time  those calm eyes fell sobbing on her neck  oh grace  god bless you  but i cannot bear to see it grace   it breaks my heart    chapter ii  part the second    snitchey and craggs had a snug little office on the old battle  ground where they drove a snug little business and fought a great  many small pitched battles for a great many contending parties   though it could hardly be said of these conflicts that they were  running fights  for in truth they generally proceeded at a snails  pace  the part the firm had in them came so far within the general  denomination that now they took a shot at this plaintiff and now  aimed a chop at that defendant now made a heavy charge at an  estate in chancery and now had some light skirmishing among an  irregular body of small debtors just as the occasion served and  the enemy happened to present himself  the gazette was an  important and profitable feature in some of their fields as in  fields of greater renown and in most of the actions wherein they  showed their generalship it was afterwards observed by the  combatants that they had had great difficulty in making each other  out or in knowing with any degree of distinctness what they were  about in consequence of the vast amount of smoke by which they  were surrounded  the offices of messrs snitchey and craggs stood convenient with  an open door down two smooth steps in the marketplace so that  any angry farmer inclining towards hot water might tumble into it  at once  their special councilchamber and hall of conference was  an old backroom upstairs with a low dark ceiling which seemed  to be knitting its brows gloomily in the consideration of tangled  points of law  it was furnished with some highbacked leathern  chairs garnished with great goggleeyed brass nails of which  every here and there two or three had fallen out  or had been  picked out perhaps by the wandering thumbs and forefingers of  bewildered clients  there was a framed print of a great judge in  it every curl in whose dreadful wig had made a mans hair stand on  end  bales of papers filled the dusty closets shelves and  tables and round the wainscot there were tiers of boxes padlocked  and fireproof with peoples names painted outside which anxious  visitors felt themselves by a cruel enchantment obliged to spell  backwards and forwards and to make anagrams of while they sat  seeming to listen to snitchey and craggs without comprehending one  word of what they said  snitchey and craggs had each in private life as in professional  existence a partner of his own  snitchey and craggs were the best  friends in the world and had a real confidence in one another but  mrs snitchey by a dispensation not uncommon in the affairs of  life was on principle suspicious of mr craggs and mrs craggs  was on principle suspicious of mr snitchey  your snitcheys  indeed the latter lady would observe sometimes to mr craggs  using that imaginative plural as if in disparagement of an  objectionable pair of pantaloons or other articles not possessed  of a singular number i dont see what you want with your  snitcheys for my part  you trust a great deal too much to your  snitcheys i think and i hope you may never find my words come  true  while mrs snitchey would observe to mr snitchey of  craggs that if ever he was led away by man he was led away by  that man and that if ever she read a double purpose in a mortal  eye she read that purpose in craggss eye  notwithstanding this  however they were all very good friends in general  and mrs  snitchey and mrs craggs maintained a close bond of alliance  against the office which they both considered the blue chamber  and common enemy full of dangerous because unknown machinations  in this office nevertheless snitchey and craggs made honey for  their several hives  here sometimes they would linger of a fine  evening at the window of their councilchamber overlooking the old  battleground and wonder but that was generally at assize time  when much business had made them sentimental at the folly of  mankind who couldnt always be at peace with one another and go to  law comfortably  here days and weeks and months and years  passed over them  their calendar the gradually diminishing number  of brass nails in the leathern chairs and the increasing bulk of  papers on the tables  here nearly three years flight had thinned  the one and swelled the other since the breakfast in the orchard  when they sat together in consultation at night  not alone but with a man of about thirty or that time of life  negligently dressed and somewhat haggard in the face but well made wellattired and welllooking who sat in the armchair of  state with one hand in his breast and the other in his  dishevelled hair pondering moodily  messrs snitchey and craggs  sat opposite each other at a neighbouring desk  one of the  fireproof boxes unpadlocked and opened was upon it a part of its  contents lay strewn upon the table and the rest was then in course  of passing through the hands of mr snitchey who brought it to the  candle document by document looked at every paper singly as he  produced it shook his head and handed it to mr craggs who  looked it over also shook his head and laid it down  sometimes  they would stop and shaking their heads in concert look towards  the abstracted client  and the name on the box being michael  warden esquire we may conclude from these premises that the name  and the box were both his and that the affairs of michael warden  esquire were in a bad way  thats all said mr snitchey turning up the last paper   really theres no other resource  no other resource  all lost spent wasted pawned borrowed and sold eh said the  client looking up  all returned mr snitchey  nothing else to be done you say  nothing at all  the client bit his nails and pondered again  and i am not even personally safe in england  you hold to that  do you  in no part of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland  replied mr snitchey  a mere prodigal son with no father to go back to no swine to  keep and no husks to share with them  eh pursued the client  rocking one leg over the other and searching the ground with his  eyes  mr snitchey coughed as if to deprecate the being supposed to  participate in any figurative illustration of a legal position   mr craggs as if to express that it was a partnership view of the  subject also coughed  ruined at thirty said the client  humph  not ruined mr warden returned snitchey  not so bad as that   you have done a good deal towards it i must say but you are not  ruined  a little nursing    a little devil said the client  mr craggs said snitchey will you oblige me with a pinch of  snuff  thank you sir  as the imperturbable lawyer applied it to his nose with great  apparent relish and a perfect absorption of his attention in the  proceeding the client gradually broke into a smile and looking  up said  you talk of nursing  how long nursing  how long nursing repeated snitchey dusting the snuff from his  fingers and making a slow calculation in his mind  for your  involved estate sir  in good hands s and cs say  six or  seven years  to starve for six or seven years said the client with a fretful  laugh and an impatient change of his position  to starve for six or seven years mr warden said snitchey  would be very uncommon indeed  you might get another estate by  showing yourself the while  but we dont think you could do it   speaking for self and craggs  and consequently dont advise it  what do you advise  nursing i say repeated snitchey  some few years of nursing by  self and craggs would bring it round  but to enable us to make  terms and hold terms and you to keep terms you must go away you  must live abroad  as to starvation we could ensure you some  hundreds ayear to starve upon even in the beginning  i dare say  mr warden  hundreds said the client  and i have spent thousands  that retorted mr snitchey putting the papers slowly back into  the castiron box there is no doubt about  no doubt about he  repeated to himself as he thoughtfully pursued his occupation  the lawyer very likely knew his man at any rate his dry shrewd  whimsical manner had a favourable influence on the clients moody  state and disposed him to be more free and unreserved  or  perhaps the client knew his man and had elicited such  encouragement as he had received to render some purpose he was  about to disclose the more defensible in appearance  gradually  raising his head he sat looking at his immovable adviser with a  smile which presently broke into a laugh  after all he said my ironheaded friend    mr snitchey pointed out his partner  self and  excuse me   craggs  i beg mr craggss pardon said the client  after all my iron headed friends he leaned forward in his chair and dropped his  voice a little you dont know half my ruin yet  mr snitchey stopped and stared at him  mr craggs also stared  i am not only deep in debt said the client but i am deep in     not in love cried snitchey  yes said the client falling back in his chair and surveying  the firm with his hands in his pockets  deep in love  and not with an heiress sir said snitchey  not with an heiress  nor a rich lady  nor a rich lady that i know of  except in beauty and merit  a single lady i trust said mr snitchey with great expression  certainly  its not one of dr jeddlers daughters said snitchey suddenly  squaring his elbows on his knees and advancing his face at least a  yard  yes returned the client  not his younger daughter said snitchey  yes returned the client  mr craggs said snitchey much relieved will you oblige me  with another pinch of snuff  thank you  i am happy to say it  dont signify mr warden shes engaged sir shes bespoke  my  partner can corroborate me  we know the fact  we know the fact repeated craggs  why so do i perhaps returned the client quietly  what of  that  are you men of the world and did you never hear of a woman  changing her mind  there certainly have been actions for breach said mr snitchey  brought against both spinsters and widows but in the majority of  cases    cases interposed the client impatiently  dont talk to me of  cases  the general precedent is in a much larger volume than any  of your law books  besides do you think i have lived six weeks in  the doctors house for nothing  i think sir observed mr snitchey gravely addressing himself  to his partner that of all the scrapes mr wardens horses have  brought him into at one time and another  and they have been  pretty numerous and pretty expensive as none know better than  himself and you and i  the worst scrape may turn out to be if  he talks in this way this having ever been left by one of them at  the doctors garden wall with three broken ribs a snapped collar bone and the lord knows how many bruises  we didnt think so much  of it at the time when we knew he was going on well under the  doctors hands and roof but it looks bad now sir  bad  it looks  very bad  doctor jeddler too  our client mr craggs  mr alfred heathfield too  a sort of client mr snitchey said  craggs  mr michael warden too a kind of client said the careless  visitor and no bad one either  having played the fool for ten or  twelve years  however mr michael warden has sown his wild oats  now  theres their crop in that box and he means to repent and  be wise  and in proof of it mr michael warden means if he can  to marry marion the doctors lovely daughter and to carry her  away with him  really mr craggs snitchey began  really mr snitchey and mr craggs partners both said the  client interrupting him you know your duty to your clients and  you know well enough i am sure that it is no part of it to  interfere in a mere love affair which i am obliged to confide to  you  i am not going to carry the young lady off without her own  consent  theres nothing illegal in it  i never was mr  heathfields bosom friend  i violate no confidence of his  i love  where he loves and i mean to win where he would win if i can  he cant mr craggs said snitchey evidently anxious and  discomfited  he cant do it sir  she dotes on mr alfred  does she returned the client  mr craggs she dotes on him sir persisted snitchey  i didnt live six weeks some few months ago in the doctors  house for nothing and i doubted that soon observed the client   she would have doted on him if her sister could have brought it  about but i watched them  marion avoided his name avoided the  subject  shrunk from the least allusion to it with evident  distress  why should she mr craggs you know  why should she sir  inquired snitchey  i dont know why she should though there are many likely  reasons said the client smiling at the attention and perplexity  expressed in mr snitcheys shining eye and at his cautious way of  carrying on the conversation and making himself informed upon the  subject but i know she does  she was very young when she made  the engagement  if it may be called one i am not even sure of  that  and has repented of it perhaps  perhaps  it seems a  foppish thing to say but upon my soul i dont mean it in that  light  she may have fallen in love with me as i have fallen in  love with her  he he  mr alfred her old playfellow too you remember mr  craggs said snitchey with a disconcerted laugh knew her almost  from a baby  which makes it the more probable that she may be tired of his  idea calmly pursued the client and not indisposed to exchange  it for the newer one of another lover who presents himself or is  presented by his horse under romantic circumstances has the not  unfavourable reputation  with a country girl  of having lived  thoughtlessly and gaily without doing much harm to anybody and  who for his youth and figure and so forth  this may seem foppish  again but upon my soul i dont mean it in that light  might  perhaps pass muster in a crowd with mr alfred himself  there was no gainsaying the last clause certainly and mr  snitchey glancing at him thought so  there was something  naturally graceful and pleasant in the very carelessness of his  air  it seemed to suggest of his comely face and wellknit  figure that they might be greatly better if he chose  and that  once roused and made earnest but he never had been earnest yet  he could be full of fire and purpose  a dangerous sort of  libertine thought the shrewd lawyer to seem to catch the spark  he wants from a young ladys eyes  now observe snitchey he continued rising and taking him by  the button and craggs taking him by the button also and  placing one partner on either side of him so that neither might  evade him  i dont ask you for any advice  you are right to keep  quite aloof from all parties in such a matter which is not one in  which grave men like you could interfere on any side  i am  briefly going to review in halfadozen words my position and  intention and then i shall leave it to you to do the best for me  in money matters that you can  seeing that if i run away with  the doctors beautiful daughter as i hope to do and to become  another man under her bright influence it will be for the  moment more chargeable than running away alone  but i shall soon  make all that up in an altered life  i think it will be better not to hear this mr craggs said  snitchey looking at him across the client  i think not said craggs  both listened attentively  well  you neednt hear it replied their client  ill mention  it however  i dont mean to ask the doctors consent because he  wouldnt give it me  but i mean to do the doctor no wrong or harm  because besides there being nothing serious in such trifles as he  says i hope to rescue his child my marion from what i see  i  know  she dreads and contemplates with misery  that is the  return of this old lover  if anything in the world is true it is  true that she dreads his return  nobody is injured so far  i am  so harried and worried here just now that i lead the life of a  flyingfish  i skulk about in the dark i am shut out of my own  house and warned off my own grounds but that house and those  grounds and many an acre besides will come back to me one day as  you know and say and marion will probably be richer  on your  showing who are never sanguine  ten years hence as my wife than  as the wife of alfred heathfield whose return she dreads remember  that and in whom or in any man my passion is not surpassed  who  is injured yet  it is a fair case throughout  my right is as good  as his if she decide in my favour and i will try my right by her  alone  you will like to know no more after this and i will tell  you no more  now you know my purpose and wants  when must i  leave here  in a week said snitchey  mr craggs  in something less i should say responded craggs  in a month said the client after attentively watching the two  faces  this day month  today is thursday  succeed or fail on  this day month i go  its too long a delay said snitchey much too long  but let it  be so  i thought hed have stipulated for three he murmured to  himself  are you going  good night sir  good night returned the client shaking hands with the firm  youll live to see me making a good use of riches yet  henceforth  the star of my destiny is marion  take care of the stairs sir replied snitchey for she dont  shine there  good night  good night  so they both stood at the stairhead with a pair of officecandles  watching him down  when he had gone away they stood looking at  each other  what do you think of all this mr craggs said snitchey  mr craggs shook his head  it was our opinion on the day when that release was executed  that there was something curious in the parting of that pair i  recollect said snitchey  it was said mr craggs  perhaps he deceives himself altogether pursued mr snitchey  locking up the fireproof box and putting it away or if he  dont a little bit of fickleness and perfidy is not a miracle mr  craggs  and yet i thought that pretty face was very true  i  thought said mr snitchey putting on his greatcoat for the  weather was very cold drawing on his gloves and snuffing out one  candle that i had even seen her character becoming stronger and  more resolved of late  more like her sisters  mrs craggs was of the same opinion returned craggs  id really give a trifle tonight observed mr snitchey who was  a goodnatured man if i could believe that mr warden was  reckoning without his host but lightheaded capricious and  unballasted as he is he knows something of the world and its  people he ought to for he has bought what he does know dear  enough and i cant quite think that  we had better not  interfere  we can do nothing mr craggs but keep quiet  nothing returned craggs  our friend the doctor makes light of such things said mr  snitchey shaking his head  i hope he maynt stand in need of his  philosophy  our friend alfred talks of the battle of life he  shook his head again i hope he maynt be cut down early in the  day  have you got your hat mr craggs  i am going to put the  other candle out  mr craggs replying in the affirmative mr  snitchey suited the action to the word and they groped their way  out of the councilchamber now dark as the subject or the law in  general   my story passes to a quiet little study where on that same night  the sisters and the hale old doctor sat by a cheerful fireside   grace was working at her needle  marion read aloud from a book  before her  the doctor in his dressinggown and slippers with  his feet spread out upon the warm rug leaned back in his easy chair and listened to the book and looked upon his daughters  they were very beautiful to look upon  two better faces for a  fireside never made a fireside bright and sacred  something of  the difference between them had been softened down in three years  time and enthroned upon the clear brow of the younger sister  looking through her eyes and thrilling in her voice was the same  earnest nature that her own motherless youth had ripened in the  elder sister long ago  but she still appeared at once the lovelier  and weaker of the two still seemed to rest her head upon her  sisters breast and put her trust in her and look into her eyes  for counsel and reliance  those loving eyes so calm serene and  cheerful as of old  and being in her own home read marion from the book her  home made exquisitely dear by these remembrances she now began to  know that the great trial of her heart must soon come on and could  not be delayed  o home our comforter and friend when others fall  away to part with whom at any step between the cradle and the  grave  marion my love said grace  why puss exclaimed her father whats the matter  she put her hand upon the hand her sister stretched towards her  and read on her voice still faltering and trembling though she  made an effort to command it when thus interrupted  to part with whom at any step between the cradle and the grave  is always sorrowful  o home so true to us so often slighted in  return be lenient to them that turn away from thee and do not  haunt their erring footsteps too reproachfully  let no kind looks  no wellremembered smiles be seen upon thy phantom face  let no  ray of affection welcome gentleness forbearance cordiality  shine from thy white head  let no old loving word or tone rise  up in judgment against thy deserter but if thou canst look harshly  and severely do in mercy to the penitent  dear marion read no more tonight said grace for she was  weeping  i cannot she replied and closed the book  the words seem all  on fire  the doctor was amused at this and laughed as he patted her on the  head  what overcome by a storybook said doctor jeddler  print and  paper  well well its all one  its as rational to make a  serious matter of print and paper as of anything else  but dry  your eyes love dry your eyes  i dare say the heroine has got  home again long ago and made it up all round  and if she hasnt  a real home is only four walls and a fictitious one mere rags and  ink  whats the matter now  its only me mister said clemency putting in her head at the  door  and whats the matter with you said the doctor  oh bless you nothing ant the matter with me returned clemency   and truly too to judge from her wellsoaped face in which there  gleamed as usual the very soul of goodhumour which ungainly as  she was made her quite engaging  abrasions on the elbows are not  generally understood it is true to range within that class of  personal charms called beautyspots  but it is better going  through the world to have the arms chafed in that narrow passage  than the temper  and clemencys was sound and whole as any  beautys in the land  nothing ant the matter with me said clemency entering but   come a little closer mister  the doctor in some astonishment complied with this invitation  you said i wasnt to give you one before them you know said  clemency  a novice in the family might have supposed from her extraordinary  ogling as she said it as well as from a singular rapture or  ecstasy which pervaded her elbows as if she were embracing  herself that one in its most favourable interpretation meant a  chaste salute  indeed the doctor himself seemed alarmed for the  moment but quickly regained his composure as clemency having had  recourse to both her pockets  beginning with the right one going  away to the wrong one and afterwards coming back to the right one  again  produced a letter from the postoffice  britain was riding by on a errand she chuckled handing it to  the doctor and see the mail come in and waited for it  theres  a h in the corner  mr alfreds on his journey home i bet  we  shall have a wedding in the house  there was two spoons in my  saucer this morning  oh luck how slow he opens it  all this she delivered by way of soliloquy gradually rising  higher and higher on tiptoe in her impatience to hear the news  and making a corkscrew of her apron and a bottle of her mouth  at  last arriving at a climax of suspense and seeing the doctor still  engaged in the perusal of the letter she came down flat upon the  soles of her feet again and cast her apron as a veil over her  head in a mute despair and inability to bear it any longer  here  girls cried the doctor  i cant help it  i never could  keep a secret in my life  there are not many secrets indeed  worth being kept in such a  well never mind that  alfreds  coming home my dears directly  directly exclaimed marion  what  the storybook is soon forgotten said the doctor  pinching her cheek  i thought the news would dry those tears   yes  let it be a surprise he says here  but i cant let it be  a surprise  he must have a welcome  directly repeated marion  why perhaps not what your impatience calls directly returned  the doctor but pretty soon too  let us see  let us see  today  is thursday is it not  then he promises to be here this day  month  this day month repeated marion softly  a gay day and a holiday for us said the cheerful voice of her  sister grace kissing her in congratulation  long looked forward  to dearest and come at last  she answered with a smile a mournful smile but full of sisterly  affection  as she looked in her sisters face and listened to the  quiet music of her voice picturing the happiness of this return  her own face glowed with hope and joy  and with a something else a something shining more and more  through all the rest of its expression for which i have no name   it was not exultation triumph proud enthusiasm  they are not so  calmly shown  it was not love and gratitude alone though love and  gratitude were part of it  it emanated from no sordid thought for  sordid thoughts do not light up the brow and hover on the lips  and move the spirit like a fluttered light until the sympathetic  figure trembles  dr jeddler in spite of his system of philosophy  which he was  continually contradicting and denying in practice but more famous  philosophers have done that  could not help having as much  interest in the return of his old ward and pupil as if it had been  a serious event  so he sat himself down in his easychair again  stretched out his slippered feet once more upon the rug read the  letter over and over a great many times and talked it over more  times still  ah  the day was said the doctor looking at the fire when you  and he grace used to trot about arminarm in his holiday time  like a couple of walking dolls  you remember  i remember she answered with her pleasant laugh and plying her  needle busily  this day month indeed mused the doctor  that hardly seems a  twelve month ago  and where was my little marion then  never far from her sister said marion cheerily however  little  grace was everything to me even when she was a young  child herself  true puss true returned the doctor  she was a staid little  woman was grace and a wise housekeeper and a busy quiet  pleasant body bearing with our humours and anticipating our  wishes and always ready to forget her own even in those times  i  never knew you positive or obstinate grace my darling even then  on any subject but one  i am afraid i have changed sadly for the worse since laughed  grace still busy at her work  what was that one father  alfred of course said the doctor  nothing would serve you but  you must be called alfreds wife so we called you alfreds wife  and you liked it better i believe odd as it seems now than  being called a duchess if we could have made you one  indeed said grace placidly  why dont you remember inquired the doctor  i think i remember something of it she returned but not much   its so long ago  and as she sat at work she hummed the burden  of an old song which the doctor liked  alfred will find a real wife soon she said breaking off and  that will be a happy time indeed for all of us  my three years  trust is nearly at an end marion  it has been a very easy one  i  shall tell alfred when i give you back to him that you have loved  him dearly all the time and that he has never once needed my good  services  may i tell him so love  tell him dear grace replied marion that there never was a  trust so generously nobly steadfastly discharged and that i have  loved you all the time dearer and dearer every day and o how  dearly now  nay said her cheerful sister returning her embrace i can  scarcely tell him that we will leave my deserts to alfreds  imagination  it will be liberal enough dear marion like your  own  with that she resumed the work she had for a moment laid down  when her sister spoke so fervently  and with it the old song the  doctor liked to hear  and the doctor still reposing in his easy chair with his slippered feet stretched out before him on the rug  listened to the tune and beat time on his knee with alfreds  letter and looked at his two daughters and thought that among the  many trifles of the trifling world these trifles were agreeable  enough  clemency newcome in the meantime having accomplished her mission  and lingered in the room until she had made herself a party to the  news descended to the kitchen where her coadjutor mr britain  was regaling after supper surrounded by such a plentiful  collection of bright potlids wellscoured saucepans burnished  dinnercovers gleaming kettles and other tokens of her  industrious habits arranged upon the walls and shelves that he  sat as in the centre of a hall of mirrors  the majority did not  give forth very flattering portraits of him certainly nor were  they by any means unanimous in their reflections as some made him  very longfaced others very broadfaced some tolerably well looking others vastly illlooking according to their several  manners of reflecting  which were as various in respect of one  fact as those of so many kinds of men  but they all agreed that  in the midst of them sat quite at his ease an individual with a  pipe in his mouth and a jug of beer at his elbow who nodded  condescendingly to clemency when she stationed herself at the same  table  well clemmy said britain how are you by this time and whats  the news  clemency told him the news which he received very graciously  a  gracious change had come over benjamin from head to foot  he was  much broader much redder much more cheerful and much jollier in  all respects  it seemed as if his face had been tied up in a knot  before and was now untwisted and smoothed out  therell be another job for snitchey and craggs i suppose he  observed puffing slowly at his pipe  more witnessing for you and  me perhaps clemmy  lor replied his fair companion with her favourite twist of her  favourite joints  i wish it was me britain  wish what was you  agoing to be married said clemency  benjamin took his pipe out of his mouth and laughed heartily   yes youre a likely subject for that he said  poor clem   clemency for her part laughed as heartily as he and seemed as much  amused by the idea  yes she assented im a likely subject for  that ant i  youll never be married you know said mr britain resuming his  pipe  dont you think i ever shall though said clemency in perfect  good faith  mr britain shook his head  not a chance of it  only think said clemency  well  i suppose you mean to  britain one of these days dont you  a question so abrupt upon a subject so momentous required  consideration  after blowing out a great cloud of smoke and  looking at it with his head now on this side and now on that as if  it were actually the question and he were surveying it in various  aspects mr britain replied that he wasnt altogether clear about  it but  yees  he thought he might come to that at last  i wish her joy whoever she may be cried clemency  oh shell have that said benjamin safe enough  but she wouldnt have led quite such a joyful life as she will  lead and wouldnt have had quite such a sociable sort of husband  as she will have said clemency spreading herself half over the  table and staring retrospectively at the candle if it hadnt  been for  not that i went to do it for it was accidental i am  sure  if it hadnt been for me now would she britain  certainly not returned mr britain by this time in that high  state of appreciation of his pipe when a man can open his mouth  but a very little way for speaking purposes and sitting  luxuriously immovable in his chair can afford to turn only his  eyes towards a companion and that very passively and gravely   oh  im greatly beholden to you you know clem  lor how nice that is to think of said clemency  at the same time bringing her thoughts as well as her sight to  bear upon the candlegrease and becoming abruptly reminiscent of  its healing qualities as a balsam she anointed her left elbow with  a plentiful application of that remedy  you see ive made a good many investigations of one sort and  another in my time pursued mr britain with the profundity of a  sage having been always of an inquiring turn of mind and ive  read a good many books about the general rights of things and  wrongs of things for i went into the literary line myself when i  began life  did you though cried the admiring clemency  yes said mr britain  i was hid for the best part of two years  behind a bookstall ready to fly out if anybody pocketed a volume  and after that i was light porter to a stay and mantua maker in  which capacity i was employed to carry about in oilskin baskets  nothing but deceptions  which soured my spirits and disturbed my  confidence in human nature and after that i heard a world of  discussions in this house which soured my spirits fresh and my  opinion after all is that as a safe and comfortable sweetener of  the same and as a pleasant guide through life theres nothing  like a nutmeggrater  clemency was about to offer a suggestion but he stopped her by  anticipating it  combined he added gravely with a thimble  do as you wold you know and cetrer eh observed clemency  folding her arms comfortably in her delight at this avowal and  patting her elbows  such a short cut ant it  im not sure said mr britain that its what would be  considered good philosophy  ive my doubts about that but it  wears well and saves a quantity of snarling which the genuine  article dont always  see how you used to go on once yourself you know said  clemency  ah said mr britain  but the most extraordinary thing clemmy  is that i should live to be brought round through you  thats the  strange part of it  through you  why i suppose you havent so  much as half an idea in your head  clemency without taking the least offence shook it and laughed  and hugged herself and said no she didnt suppose she had  im pretty sure of it said mr britain  oh  i dare say youre right said clemency  i dont pretend to  none  i dont want any  benjamin took his pipe from his lips and laughed till the tears  ran down his face  what a natural you are clemmy he said  shaking his head with an infinite relish of the joke and wiping  his eyes  clemency without the smallest inclination to dispute  it did the like and laughed as heartily as he  i cant help liking you said mr britain youre a regular good  creature in your way so shake hands clem  whatever happens ill  always take notice of you and be a friend to you  will you returned clemency  well thats very good of you  yes yes said mr britain giving her his pipe to knock the  ashes out of it ill stand by you  hark  thats a curious  noise  noise repeated clemency  a footstep outside  somebody dropping from the wall it sounded  like said britain  are they all abed upstairs  yes all abed by this time she replied  didnt you hear anything  no  they both listened but heard nothing  i tell you what said benjamin taking down a lantern  ill  have a look round before i go to bed myself for satisfactions  sake  undo the door while i light this clemmy  clemency complied briskly but observed as she did so that he  would only have his walk for his pains that it was all his fancy  and so forth  mr britain said very likely but sallied out  nevertheless armed with the poker and casting the light of the  lantern far and near in all directions  its as quiet as a churchyard said clemency looking after him  and almost as ghostly too  glancing back into the kitchen she cried fearfully as a light  figure stole into her view whats that  hush said marion in an agitated whisper  you have always loved  me have you not  loved you child  you may be sure i have  i am sure  and i may trust you may i not  there is no one else  just now in whom i can trust  yes said clemency with all her heart  there is some one out there pointing to the door whom i must  see and speak with tonight  michael warden for gods sake  retire  not now  clemency started with surprise and trouble as following the  direction of the speakers eyes she saw a dark figure standing in  the doorway  in another moment you may be discovered said marion  not now   wait if you can in some concealment  i will come presently  he waved his hand to her and was gone  dont go to bed  wait  here for me said marion hurriedly  i have been seeking to  speak to you for an hour past  oh be true to me  eagerly seizing her bewildered hand and pressing it with both her  own to her breast  an action more expressive in its passion of  entreaty than the most eloquent appeal in words  marion  withdrew as the light of the returning lantern flashed into the  room  all still and peaceable  nobody there  fancy i suppose said  mr britain as he locked and barred the door  one of the effects  of having a lively imagination  halloa  why whats the matter  clemency who could not conceal the effects of her surprise and  concern was sitting in a chair  pale and trembling from head to  foot  matter she repeated chafing her hands and elbows nervously  and looking anywhere but at him  thats good in you britain  that is  after going and frightening one out of ones life with  noises and lanterns and i dont know what all  matter  oh yes  if youre frightened out of your life by a lantern clemmy said  mr britain composedly blowing it out and hanging it up again  that apparitions very soon got rid of  but youre as bold as  brass in general he said stopping to observe her and were  after the noise and the lantern too  what have you taken into your  head  not an idea eh  but as clemency bade him good night very much after her usual  fashion and began to bustle about with a show of going to bed  herself immediately little britain after giving utterance to the  original remark that it was impossible to account for a womans  whims bade her good night in return and taking up his candle  strolled drowsily away to bed  when all was quiet marion returned  open the door she said and stand there close beside me while  i speak to him outside  timid as her manner was it still evinced a resolute and settled  purpose such as clemency could not resist  she softly unbarred  the door  but before turning the key looked round on the young  creature waiting to issue forth when she should open it  the face was not averted or cast down but looking full upon her  in its pride of youth and beauty  some simple sense of the  slightness of the barrier that interposed itself between the happy  home and honoured love of the fair girl and what might be the  desolation of that home and shipwreck of its dearest treasure  smote so keenly on the tender heart of clemency and so filled it  to overflowing with sorrow and compassion that bursting into  tears she threw her arms round marions neck  its little that i know my dear cried clemency very little  but i know that this should not be  think of what you do  i have thought of it many times said marion gently  once more urged clemency  till tomorrow  marion shook her  head  for mr alfreds sake said clemency with homely earnestness   him that you used to love so dearly once  she hid her face upon the instant in her hands repeating once  as if it rent her heart  let me go out said clemency soothing her  ill tell him what  you like  dont cross the doorstep tonight  im sure no good  will come of it  oh it was an unhappy day when mr warden was  ever brought here  think of your good father darling  of your  sister  i have said marion hastily raising her head  you dont know  what i do  i must speak to him  you are the best and truest  friend in all the world for what you have said to me but i must  take this step  will you go with me clemency she kissed her on  her friendly face or shall i go alone  sorrowing and wondering clemency turned the key and opened the  door  into the dark and doubtful night that lay beyond the  threshold marion passed quickly holding by her hand  in the dark night he joined her and they spoke together earnestly  and long and the hand that held so fast by clemeneys now  trembled now turned deadly cold now clasped and closed on hers  in the strong feeling of the speech it emphasised unconsciously   when they returned he followed to the door and pausing there a  moment seized the other hand and pressed it to his lips  then  stealthily withdrew  the door was barred and locked again and once again she stood  beneath her fathers roof  not bowed down by the secret that she  brought there though so young but with that same expression on  her face for which i had no name before and shining through her  tears  again she thanked and thanked her humble friend and trusted to  her as she said with confidence implicitly  her chamber safely  reached she fell upon her knees and with her secret weighing on  her heart could pray  could rise up from her prayers so tranquil and serene and bending  over her fond sister in her slumber look upon her face and smile   though sadly  murmuring as she kissed her forehead how that grace  had been a mother to her ever and she loved her as a child  could draw the passive arm about her neck when lying down to rest   it seemed to cling there of its own will protectingly and  tenderly even in sleep  and breathe upon the parted lips god  bless her  could sink into a peaceful sleep herself but for one dream in  which she cried out in her innocent and touching voice that she  was quite alone and they had all forgotten her  a month soon passes even at its tardiest pace  the month  appointed to elapse between that night and the return was quick of  foot and went by like a vapour  the day arrived  a raging winter day that shook the old house  sometimes as if it shivered in the blast  a day to make home  doubly home  to give the chimneycorner new delights  to shed a  ruddier glow upon the faces gathered round the hearth and draw  each fireside group into a closer and more social league against  the roaring elements without  such a wild winter day as best  prepares the way for shutout night for curtained rooms and  cheerful looks for music laughter dancing light and jovial  entertainment  all these the doctor had in store to welcome alfred back  they  knew that he could not arrive till night and they would make the  night air ring he said as he approached  all his old friends  should congregate about him  he should not miss a face that he had  known and liked  no  they should every one be there  so guests were bidden and musicians were engaged and tables  spread and floors prepared for active feet and bountiful  provision made of every hospitable kind  because it was the  christmas season and his eyes were all unused to english holly and  its sturdy green the dancingroom was garlanded and hung with it  and the red berries gleamed an english welcome to him peeping from  among the leaves  it was a busy day for all of them  a busier day for none of them  than grace who noiselessly presided everywhere and was the  cheerful mind of all the preparations  many a time that day as  well as many a time within the fleeting month preceding it did  clemency glance anxiously and almost fearfully at marion  she  saw her paler perhaps than usual but there was a sweet composure  on her face that made it lovelier than ever  at night when she was dressed and wore upon her head a wreath that  grace had proudly twined about it  its mimic flowers were alfreds  favourites as grace remembered when she chose them  that old  expression pensive almost sorrowful and yet so spiritual high  and stirring sat again upon her brow enhanced a hundredfold  the next wreath i adjust on this fair head will be a marriage  wreath said grace or i am no true prophet dear  her sister smiled and held her in her arms  a moment grace  dont leave me yet  are you sure that i want  nothing more  her care was not for that  it was her sisters face she thought  of and her eyes were fixed upon it tenderly  my art said grace can go no farther dear girl nor your  beauty  i never saw you look so beautiful as now  i never was so happy she returned  ay but there is a greater happiness in store  in such another  home as cheerful and as bright as this looks now said grace  alfred and his young wife will soon be living  she smiled again  it is a happy home grace in your fancy  i  can see it in your eyes  i know it will be happy dear  how glad  i am to know it  well cried the doctor bustling in  here we are all ready for  alfred eh  he cant be here until pretty late  an hour or so  before midnight  so therell be plenty of time for making merry  before he comes  hell not find us with the ice unbroken  pile up  the fire here britain  let it shine upon the holly till it winks  again  its a world of nonsense puss true lovers and all the  rest of it  all nonsense but well be nonsensical with the rest  of em and give our true lover a mad welcome  upon my word said  the old doctor looking at his daughters proudly im not clear  tonight among other absurdities but that im the father of two  handsome girls  all that one of them has ever done or may do  may do dearest  father  to cause you pain or grief forgive her said marion  forgive her now when her heart is full  say that you forgive  her  that you will forgive her  that she shall always share your  love and  and the rest was not said for her face was hidden on  the old mans shoulder  tut tut tut said the doctor gently  forgive  what have i to  forgive  heyday if our true lovers come back to flurry us like  this we must hold em at a distance we must send expresses out to  stop em short upon the road and bring em on a mile or two a day  until were properly prepared to meet em  kiss me puss   forgive  why what a silly child you are  if you had vexed and  crossed me fifty times a day instead of not at all id forgive  you everything but such a supplication  kiss me again puss   there  prospective and retrospective  a clear score between us   pile up the fire here  would you freeze the people on this bleak  december night  let us be light and warm and merry or ill not  forgive some of you  so gaily the old doctor carried it  and the fire was piled up and  the lights were bright and company arrived and a murmuring of  lively tongues began and already there was a pleasant air of  cheerful excitement stirring through all the house  more and more company came flocking in  bright eyes sparkled upon  marion smiling lips gave her joy of his return sage mothers  fanned themselves and hoped she mightnt be too youthful and  inconstant for the quiet round of home impetuous fathers fell into  disgrace for too much exaltation of her beauty daughters envied  her sons envied him innumerable pairs of lovers profited by the  occasion all were interested animated and expectant  mr and mrs craggs came arm in arm but mrs snitchey came alone   why whats become of him inquired the doctor  the feather of a bird of paradise in mrs snitcheys turban  trembled as if the bird of paradise were alive again when she said  that doubtless mr craggs knew  she was never told  that nasty office said mrs craggs  i wish it was burnt down said mrs snitchey  hes  hes  theres a little matter of business that keeps my  partner rather late said mr craggs looking uneasily about him  ohh  business  dont tell me said mrs snitchey  we know what business means said mrs craggs  but their not knowing what it meant was perhaps the reason why  mrs snitcheys bird of paradise feather quivered so portentously  and why all the pendant bits on mrs craggss earrings shook like  little bells  i wonder you could come away mr craggs said his wife  mr craggs is fortunate im sure said mrs snitchey  that office so engrosses em said mrs craggs  a person with an office has no business to be married at all  said mrs snitchey  then mrs snitchey said within herself that that look of hers  had pierced to craggss soul and he knew it and mrs craggs  observed to craggs that his snitcheys were deceiving him behind  his back and he would find it out when it was too late  still mr craggs without much heeding these remarks looked  uneasily about until his eye rested on grace to whom he  immediately presented himself  good evening maam said craggs  you look charmingly  your   miss  your sister miss marion is she    oh shes quite well mr craggs  yes  i  is she here asked craggs  here  dont you see her yonder  going to dance said grace  mr craggs put on his spectacles to see the better looked at her  through them for some time coughed and put them with an air of  satisfaction in their sheath again and in his pocket  now the music struck up and the dance commenced  the bright fire  crackled and sparkled rose and fell as though it joined the dance  itself in right good fellowship  sometimes it roared as if it  would make music too  sometimes it flashed and beamed as if it  were the eye of the old room  it winked too sometimes like a  knowing patriarch upon the youthful whisperers in corners   sometimes it sported with the hollyboughs and shining on the  leaves by fits and starts made them look as if they were in the  cold winter night again and fluttering in the wind  sometimes its  genial humour grew obstreperous and passed all bounds and then it  cast into the room among the twinkling feet with a loud burst a  shower of harmless little sparks and in its exultation leaped and  bounded like a mad thing up the broad old chimney  another dance was near its close when mr snitchey touched his  partner who was looking on upon the arm  mr craggs started as if his familiar had been a spectre  is he gone he asked  hush  he has been with me said snitchey for three hours and  more  he went over everything  he looked into all our  arrangements for him and was very particular indeed  he  humph  the dance was finished  marion passed close before him as he  spoke  she did not observe him or his partner but looked over  her shoulder towards her sister in the distance as she slowly made  her way into the crowd and passed out of their view  you see  all safe and well said mr craggs  he didnt recur  to that subject i suppose  not a word  and is he really gone  is he safe away  he keeps to his word  he drops down the river with the tide in  that shell of a boat of his and so goes out to sea on this dark  night  a daredevil he is  before the wind  theres no such  lonely road anywhere else  thats one thing  the tide flows he  says an hour before midnight  about this time  im glad its  over  mr snitchey wiped his forehead which looked hot and  anxious  what do you think said mr craggs about    hush replied his cautious partner looking straight before him   i understand you  dont mention names and dont let us seem to  be talking secrets  i dont know what to think and to tell you  the truth i dont care now  its a great relief  his selflove  deceived him i suppose  perhaps the young lady coquetted a  little  the evidence would seem to point that way  alfred not  arrived  not yet said mr craggs  expected every minute  good mr snitchey wiped his forehead again  its a great  relief  i havent been so nervous since weve been in partnership   i intend to spend the evening now mr craggs  mrs craggs and mrs snitchey joined them as he announced this  intention  the bird of paradise was in a state of extreme  vibration and the little bells were ringing quite audibly  it has been the theme of general comment mr snitchey said mrs  snitchey  i hope the office is satisfied  satisfied with what my dear asked mr snitchey  with the exposure of a defenceless woman to ridicule and remark  returned his wife  that is quite in the way of the office that  is  i really myself said mrs craggs have been so long accustomed  to connect the office with everything opposed to domesticity that  i am glad to know it as the avowed enemy of my peace  there is  something honest in that at all events  my dear urged mr craggs your good opinion is invaluable but  i never avowed that the office was the enemy of your peace  no said mrs craggs ringing a perfect peal upon the little  bells  not you indeed  you wouldnt be worthy of the office if  you had the candour to  as to my having been away tonight my dear said mr snitchey  giving her his arm the deprivation has been mine im sure but  as mr craggs knows    mrs snitchey cut this reference very short by hitching her husband  to a distance and asking him to look at that man  to do her the  favour to look at him  at which man my dear said mr snitchey  your chosen companion im no companion to you mr snitchey  yes yes you are my dear he interposed  no no im not said mrs snitchey with a majestic smile  i  know my station  will you look at your chosen companion mr  snitchey at your referee at the keeper of your secrets at the  man you trust at your other self in short  the habitual association of self with craggs occasioned mr  snitchey to look in that direction  if you can look that man in the eye this night said mrs  snitchey and not know that you are deluded practised upon made  the victim of his arts and bent down prostrate to his will by some  unaccountable fascination which it is impossible to explain and  against which no warning of mine is of the least avail all i can  say is  i pity you  at the very same moment mrs craggs was oracular on the cross  subject  was it possible she said that craggs could so blind  himself to his snitcheys as not to feel his true position  did he  mean to say that he had seen his snitcheys come into that room and  didnt plainly see that there was reservation cunning treachery  in the man would he tell her that his very action when he wiped  his forehead and looked so stealthily about him didnt show that  there was something weighing on the conscience of his precious  snitcheys if he had a conscience that wouldnt bear the light   did anybody but his snitcheys come to festive entertainments like a  burglar  which by the way was hardly a clear illustration of  the case as he had walked in very mildly at the door  and would  he still assert to her at noonday it being nearly midnight that  his snitcheys were to be justified through thick and thin against  all facts and reason and experience  neither snitchey nor craggs openly attempted to stem the current  which had thus set in but both were content to be carried gently  along it until its force abated  this happened at about the same  time as a general movement for a country dance when mr snitchey  proposed himself as a partner to mrs craggs and mr craggs  gallantly offered himself to mrs snitchey and after some such  slight evasions as why dont you ask somebody else and youll  be glad i know if i decline and i wonder you can dance out of  the office but this jocosely now each lady graciously accepted  and took her place  it was an old custom among them indeed to do so and to pair off  in like manner at dinners and suppers for they were excellent  friends and on a footing of easy familiarity  perhaps the false  craggs and the wicked snitchey were a recognised fiction with the  two wives as doe and roe incessantly running up and down  bailiwicks were with the two husbands  or perhaps the ladies had  instituted and taken upon themselves these two shares in the  business rather than be left out of it altogether  but certain  it is that each wife went as gravely and steadily to work in her  vocation as her husband did in his and would have considered it  almost impossible for the firm to maintain a successful and  respectable existence without her laudable exertions  but now the bird of paradise was seen to flutter down the middle  and the little bells began to bounce and jingle in poussette and  the doctors rosy face spun round and round like an expressive  pegtop highly varnished and breathless mr craggs began to doubt  already whether country dancing had been made too easy like the  rest of life and mr snitchey with his nimble cuts and capers  footed it for self and craggs and halfadozen more  now too the fire took fresh courage favoured by the lively wind  the dance awakened and burnt clear and high  it was the genius of  the room and present everywhere  it shone in peoples eyes it  sparkled in the jewels on the snowy necks of girls it twinkled at  their ears as if it whispered to them slyly it flashed about their  waists it flickered on the ground and made it rosy for their feet  it bloomed upon the ceiling that its glow might set off their  bright faces and it kindled up a general illumination in mrs  craggss little belfry  now too the lively air that fanned it grew less gentle as the  music quickened and the dance proceeded with new spirit and a  breeze arose that made the leaves and berries dance upon the wall  as they had often done upon the trees and the breeze rustled in  the room as if an invisible company of fairies treading in the  footsteps of the good substantial revellers were whirling after  them  now too no feature of the doctors face could be  distinguished as he spun and spun and now there seemed a dozen  birds of paradise in fitful flight and now there were a thousand  little bells at work and now a fleet of flying skirts was ruffled  by a little tempest when the music gave in and the dance was  over  hot and breathless as the doctor was it only made him the more  impatient for alfreds coming  anything been seen britain  anything been heard  too dark to see far sir  too much noise inside the house to  hear  thats right  the gayer welcome for him  how goes the time  just twelve sir  he cant be long sir  stir up the fire and throw another log upon it said the doctor   let him see his welcome blazing out upon the night  good boy   as he comes along  he saw it  yes  from the chaise he caught the light as he turned  the corner by the old church  he knew the room from which it  shone  he saw the wintry branches of the old trees between the  light and him  he knew that one of those trees rustled musically  in the summer time at the window of marions chamber  the tears were in his eyes  his heart throbbed so violently that  he could hardly bear his happiness  how often he had thought of  this time  pictured it under all circumstances  feared that it  might never come  yearned and wearied for it  far away  again the light  distinct and ruddy kindled he knew to give him  welcome and to speed him home  he beckoned with his hand and  waved his hat and cheered out loud as if the light were they  and they could see and hear him as he dashed towards them through  the mud and mire triumphantly  stop  he knew the doctor and understood what he had done  he  would not let it be a surprise to them  but he could make it one  yet by going forward on foot  if the orchardgate were open he  could enter there if not the wall was easily climbed as he knew  of old and he would be among them in an instant  he dismounted from the chaise and telling the driver  even that  was not easy in his agitation  to remain behind for a few minutes  and then to follow slowly ran on with exceeding swiftness tried  the gate scaled the wall jumped down on the other side and stood  panting in the old orchard  there was a frosty rime upon the trees which in the faint light  of the clouded moon hung upon the smaller branches like dead  garlands  withered leaves crackled and snapped beneath his feet  as he crept softly on towards the house  the desolation of a  winter night sat brooding on the earth and in the sky  but the  red light came cheerily towards him from the windows figures  passed and repassed there and the hum and murmur of voices greeted  his ear sweetly  listening for hers  attempting as he crept on to detach it from  the rest and half believing that he heard it  he had nearly  reached the door when it was abruptly opened and a figure coming  out encountered his  it instantly recoiled with a halfsuppressed  cry  clemency he said dont you know me  dont come in she answered pushing him back  go away  dont  ask me why  dont come in  what is the matter he exclaimed  i dont know  i  i am afraid to think  go back  hark  there was a sudden tumult in the house  she put her hands upon her  ears  a wild scream such as no hands could shut out was heard  and grace  distraction in her looks and manner  rushed out at the  door  grace  he caught her in his arms  what is it  is she dead  she disengaged herself as if to recognise his face and fell down  at his feet  a crowd of figures came about them from the house  among them was  her father with a paper in his hand  what is it cried alfred grasping his hair with his hands and  looking in an agony from face to face as he bent upon his knee  beside the insensible girl  will no one look at me  will no one  speak to me  does no one know me  is there no voice among you  all to tell me what it is  there was a murmur among them  she is gone  gone he echoed  fled my dear alfred said the doctor in a broken voice and  with his hands before his face  gone from her home and us  to night  she writes that she has made her innocent and blameless  choice  entreats that we will forgive her  prays that we will not  forget her  and is gone  with whom  where  he started up as if to follow in pursuit but when they gave way  to let him pass looked wildly round upon them staggered back and  sunk down in his former attitude clasping one of graces cold  hands in his own  there was a hurried running to and fro confusion noise disorder  and no purpose  some proceeded to disperse themselves about the  roads and some took horse and some got lights and some conversed  together urging that there was no trace or track to follow  some  approached him kindly with the view of offering consolation some  admonished him that grace must be removed into the house and that  he prevented it  he never heard them and he never moved  the snow fell fast and thick  he looked up for a moment in the  air and thought that those white ashes strewn upon his hopes and  misery were suited to them well  he looked round on the whitening  ground and thought how marions footprints would be hushed and  covered up as soon as made and even that remembrance of her  blotted out  but he never felt the weather and he never stirred    chapter iii  part the third    the world had grown six years older since that night of the return   it was a warm autumn afternoon and there had been heavy rain  the  sun burst suddenly from among the clouds and the old battle ground sparkling brilliantly and cheerfully at sight of it in one  green place flashed a responsive welcome there which spread along  the country side as if a joyful beacon had been lighted up and  answered from a thousand stations  how beautiful the landscape kindling in the light and that  luxuriant influence passing on like a celestial presence  brightening everything  the wood a sombre mass before revealed  its varied tints of yellow green brown red  its different forms  of trees with raindrops glittering on their leaves and twinkling  as they fell  the verdant meadowland bright and glowing seemed  as if it had been blind a minute since and now had found a sense  of sight wherewith to look up at the shining sky  cornfields  hedgerows fences homesteads and clustered roofs the steeple of  the church the stream the watermill all sprang out of the  gloomy darkness smiling  birds sang sweetly flowers raised their  drooping heads fresh scents arose from the invigorated ground the  blue expanse above extended and diffused itself already the suns  slanting rays pierced mortally the sullen bank of cloud that  lingered in its flight and a rainbow spirit of all the colours  that adorned the earth and sky spanned the whole arch with its  triumphant glory  at such a time one little roadside inn snugly sheltered behind a  great elmtree with a rare seat for idlers encircling its capacious  bole addressed a cheerful front towards the traveller as a house  of entertainment ought and tempted him with many mute but  significant assurances of a comfortable welcome  the ruddy sign board perched up in the tree with its golden letters winking in  the sun ogled the passerby from among the green leaves like a  jolly face and promised good cheer  the horsetrough full of  clear fresh water and the ground below it sprinkled with droppings  of fragrant hay made every horse that passed prick up his ears   the crimson curtains in the lower rooms and the pure white  hangings in the little bedchambers above beckoned come in with  every breath of air  upon the bright green shutters there were  golden legends about beer and ale and neat wines and good beds  and an affecting picture of a brown jug frothing over at the top   upon the windowsills were flowering plants in bright red pots  which made a lively show against the white front of the house and  in the darkness of the doorway there were streaks of light which  glanced off from the surfaces of bottles and tankards  on the doorstep appeared a proper figure of a landlord too for  though he was a short man he was round and broad and stood with  his hands in his pockets and his legs just wide enough apart to  express a mind at rest upon the subject of the cellar and an easy  confidence  too calm and virtuous to become a swagger  in the  general resources of the inn  the superabundant moisture  trickling from everything after the late rain set him off well   nothing near him was thirsty  certain topheavy dahlias looking  over the palings of his neat wellordered garden had swilled as  much as they could carry  perhaps a trifle more  and may have  been the worse for liquor but the sweetbriar roses wall flowers the plants at the windows and the leaves on the old tree  were in the beaming state of moderate company that had taken no  more than was wholesome for them and had served to develop their  best qualities  sprinkling dewy drops about them on the ground  they seemed profuse of innocent and sparkling mirth that did good  where it lighted softening neglected corners which the steady rain  could seldom reach and hurting nothing  this village inn had assumed on being established an uncommon  sign  it was called the nutmeggrater  and underneath that  household word was inscribed up in the tree on the same flaming  board and in the like golden characters by benjamin britain  at a second glance and on a more minute examination of his face  you might have known that it was no other than benjamin britain  himself who stood in the doorway  reasonably changed by time but  for the better a very comfortable host indeed  mrs b said mr britain looking down the road is rather  late  its teatime  as there was no mrs britain coming he strolled leisurely out into  the road and looked up at the house very much to his satisfaction   its just the sort of house said benjamin i should wish to  stop at if i didnt keep it  then he strolled towards the gardenpaling and took a look at the  dahlias  they looked over at him with a helpless drowsy hanging  of their heads  which bobbed again as the heavy drops of wet  dripped off them  you must be looked after said benjamin  memorandum not to  forget to tell her so  shes a long time coming  mr britains better half seemed to be by so very much his better  half that his own moiety of himself was utterly cast away and  helpless without her  she hadnt much to do i think said ben  there were a few  little matters of business after market but not many  oh here we  are at last  a chaisecart driven by a boy came clattering along the road   and seated in it in a chair with a large wellsaturated umbrella  spread out to dry behind her was the plump figure of a matronly  woman with her bare arms folded across a basket which she carried  on her knee several other baskets and parcels lying crowded around  her and a certain bright good nature in her face and contented  awkwardness in her manner as she jogged to and fro with the motion  of her carriage which smacked of old times even in the distance   upon her nearer approach this relish of bygone days was not  diminished and when the cart stopped at the nutmeggrater door a  pair of shoes alighting from it slipped nimbly through mr  britains open arms and came down with a substantial weight upon  the pathway which shoes could hardly have belonged to any one but  clemency newcome  in fact they did belong to her and she stood in them and a rosy  comfortablelooking soul she was  with as much soap on her glossy  face as in times of yore but with whole elbows now that had grown  quite dimpled in her improved condition  youre late clemmy said mr britain  why you see ben ive had a deal to do she replied looking  busily after the safe removal into the house of all the packages  and baskets  eight nine ten  wheres eleven  oh my baskets  eleven  its all right  put the horse up harry and if he coughs  again give him a warm mash tonight  eight nine ten  why  wheres eleven  oh forgot its all right  hows the children  ben  hearty clemmy hearty  bless their precious faces said mrs britain unbonneting her  own round countenance for she and her husband were by this time in  the bar and smoothing her hair with her open hands  give us a  kiss old man  mr britain promptly complied  i think said mrs britain applying herself to her pockets and  drawing forth an immense bulk of thin books and crumpled papers  a  very kennel of dogsears  ive done everything  bills all  settled  turnips sold  brewers account looked into and paid   bacco pipes ordered  seventeen pound four paid into the bank   doctor heathfields charge for little clem  youll guess what that  is  doctor heathfield wont take nothing again ben  i thought he wouldnt returned ben  no  he says whatever family you was to have ben hed never put  you to the cost of a halfpenny  not if you was to have twenty  mr britains face assumed a serious expression and he looked hard  at the wall  ant it kind of him said clemency  very returned mr britain  its the sort of kindness that i  wouldnt presume upon on any account  no retorted clemency  of course not  then theres the pony   he fetched eight pound two and that ant bad is it  its very good said ben  im glad youre pleased exclaimed his wife  i thought you  would be and i think thats all and so no more at present from  yours and cetrer c britain  ha ha ha there  take all the  papers and lock em up  oh  wait a minute  heres a printed  bill to stick on the wall  wet from the printers  how nice it  smells  whats this said ben looking over the document  i dont know replied his wife  i havent read a word of it  to be sold by auction read the host of the nutmeggrater  unless previously disposed of by private contract  they always put that said clemency  yes but they dont always put this he returned  look here  mansion c  offices c shrubberies c ring fence  c messrs snitchey and craggs c ornamental portion of the  unencumbered freehold property of michael warden esquire  intending to continue to reside abroad  intending to continue to reside abroad repeated clemency  here it is said britain  look  and it was only this very day that i heard it whispered at the old  house that better and plainer news had been half promised of her  soon said clemency shaking her head sorrowfully and patting her  elbows as if the recollection of old times unconsciously awakened  her old habits  dear dear dear  therell be heavy hearts ben  yonder  mr britain heaved a sigh and shook his head and said he couldnt  make it out  he had left off trying long ago  with that remark  he applied himself to putting up the bill just inside the bar  window  clemency after meditating in silence for a few moments  roused herself cleared her thoughtful brow and bustled off to  look after the children  though the host of the nutmeggrater had a lively regard for his  goodwife it was of the old patronising kind and she amused him  mightily  nothing would have astonished him so much as to have  known for certain from any third party that it was she who managed  the whole house and made him by her plain straightforward thrift  goodhumour honesty and industry a thriving man  so easy it is  in any degree of life as the world very often finds it to take  those cheerful natures that never assert their merit at their own  modest valuation and to conceive a flippant liking of people for  their outward oddities and eccentricities whose innate worth if  we would look so far might make us blush in the comparison  it was comfortable to mr britain to think of his own  condescension in having married clemency  she was a perpetual  testimony to him of the goodness of his heart and the kindness of  his disposition and he felt that her being an excellent wife was  an illustration of the old precept that virtue is its own reward  he had finished wafering up the bill and had locked the vouchers  for her days proceedings in the cupboard  chuckling all the time  over her capacity for business  when returning with the news that  the two master britains were playing in the coachhouse under the  superintendence of one betsey and that little clem was sleeping  like a picture she sat down to tea which had awaited her  arrival on a little table  it was a very neat little bar with  the usual display of bottles and glasses a sedate clock right to  the minute it was halfpast five everything in its place and  everything furbished and polished up to the very utmost  its the first time ive sat down quietly today i declare said  mrs britain taking a long breath as if she had sat down for the  night but getting up again immediately to hand her husband his  tea and cut him his breadandbutter how that bill does set me  thinking of old times  ah said mr britain handling his saucer like an oyster and  disposing of its contents on the same principle  that same mr michael warden said clemency shaking her head at  the notice of sale lost me my old place  and got you your husband said mr britain  well  so he did retorted clemency and many thanks to him  mans the creature of habit said mr britain surveying her  over his saucer  i had somehow got used to you clem and i found  i shouldnt be able to get on without you  so we went and got made  man and wife  ha ha  we  whod have thought it  who indeed cried clemency  it was very good of you ben  no no no replied mr britain with an air of selfdenial   nothing worth mentioning  oh yes it was ben said his wife with great simplicity im  sure i think so and am very much obliged to you  ah looking  again at the bill when she was known to be gone and out of  reach dear girl i couldnt help telling  for her sake quite as  much as theirs  what i knew could i  you told it anyhow observed her husband  and dr jeddler pursued clemency putting down her teacup and  looking thoughtfully at the bill in his grief and passion turned  me out of house and home  i never have been so glad of anything in  all my life as that i didnt say an angry word to him and hadnt  any angry feeling towards him even then for he repented that  truly afterwards  how often he has sat in this room and told me  over and over again he was sorry for it  the last time only  yesterday when you were out  how often he has sat in this room  and talked to me hour after hour about one thing and another in  which he made believe to be interested  but only for the sake of  the days that are gone by and because he knows she used to like  me ben  why how did you ever come to catch a glimpse of that clem  asked her husband  astonished that she should have a distinct  perception of a truth which had only dimly suggested itself to his  inquiring mind  i dont know im sure said clemency blowing her tea to cool  it  bless you i couldnt tell you if you was to offer me a  reward of a hundred pound  he might have pursued this metaphysical subject but for her  catching a glimpse of a substantial fact behind him in the shape  of a gentleman attired in mourning and cloaked and booted like a  rider on horseback who stood at the bardoor  he seemed attentive  to their conversation and not at all impatient to interrupt it  clemency hastily rose at this sight  mr britain also rose and  saluted the guest  will you please to walk upstairs sir   theres a very nice room upstairs sir  thank you said the stranger looking earnestly at mr britains  wife  may i come in here  oh surely if you like sir returned clemency admitting him  what would you please to want sir  the bill had caught his eye and he was reading it  excellent property that sir observed mr britain  he made no answer but turning round when he had finished  reading looked at clemency with the same observant curiosity as  before  you were asking me  he said still looking at her   what you would please to take sir answered clemency stealing a  glance at him in return  if you will let me have a draught of ale he said moving to a  table by the window and will let me have it here without being  any interruption to your meal i shall be much obliged to you  he  sat down as he spoke without any further parley and looked out at  the prospect  he was an easy wellknit figure of a man in the  prime of life  his face much browned by the sun was shaded by a  quantity of dark hair and he wore a moustache  his beer being set  before him he filled out a glass and drank goodhumouredly to  the house adding as he put the tumbler down again  its a new house is it not  not particularly new sir replied mr britain  between five and six years old said clemency speaking very  distinctly  i think i heard you mention dr jeddlers name as i came in  inquired the stranger  that bill reminds me of him for i happen  to know something of that story by hearsay and through certain  connexions of mine  is the old man living  yes hes living sir said clemency  much changed  since when sir returned clemency with remarkable emphasis and  expression  since his daughter  went away  yes hes greatly changed since then said clemency  hes grey  and old and hasnt the same way with him at all but i think hes  happy now  he has taken on with his sister since then and goes to  see her very often  that did him good directly  at first he was  sadly broken down and it was enough to make ones heart bleed to  see him wandering about railing at the world but a great change  for the better came over him after a year or two and then he began  to like to talk about his lost daughter and to praise her ay and  the world too and was never tired of saying with the tears in his  poor eyes how beautiful and good she was  he had forgiven her  then  that was about the same time as miss graces marriage   britain you remember  mr britain remembered very well  the sister is married then returned the stranger  he paused for  some time before he asked to whom  clemency narrowly escaped oversetting the teaboard in her emotion  at this question  did you never hear she said  i should like to hear he replied as he filled his glass again  and raised it to his lips  ah  it would be a long story if it was properly told said  clemency resting her chin on the palm of her left hand and  supporting that elbow on her right hand as she shook her head and  looked back through the intervening years as if she were looking  at a fire  it would be a long story i am sure  but told as a short one suggested the stranger  told as a short one repeated clemency in the same thoughtful  tone and without any apparent reference to him or consciousness  of having auditors what would there be to tell  that they  grieved together and remembered her together like a person dead  that they were so tender of her never would reproach her called  her back to one another as she used to be and found excuses for  her  every one knows that  im sure i do  no one better added  clemency wiping her eyes with her hand  and so suggested the stranger  and so said clemency taking him up mechanically and without  any change in her attitude or manner they at last were married   they were married on her birthday  it comes round again tomorrow   very quiet very humble like but very happy  mr alfred said  one night when they were walking in the orchard grace shall our  weddingday be marions birthday  and it was  and they have lived happily together said the stranger  ay said clemency  no two people ever more so  they have had  no sorrow but this  she raised her head as with a sudden attention to the circumstances  under which she was recalling these events and looked quickly at  the stranger  seeing that his face was turned toward the window  and that he seemed intent upon the prospect she made some eager  signs to her husband and pointed to the bill and moved her mouth  as if she were repeating with great energy one word or phrase to  him over and over again  as she uttered no sound and as her dumb  motions like most of her gestures were of a very extraordinary  kind this unintelligible conduct reduced mr britain to the  confines of despair  he stared at the table at the stranger at  the spoons at his wife  followed her pantomime with looks of deep  amazement and perplexity  asked in the same language was it  property in danger was it he in danger was it she  answered her  signals with other signals expressive of the deepest distress and  confusion  followed the motions of her lips  guessed half aloud  milk and water monthly warning mice and walnuts  and  couldnt approach her meaning  clemency gave it up at last as a hopeless attempt and moving her  chair by very slow degrees a little nearer to the stranger sat  with her eyes apparently cast down but glancing sharply at him now  and then waiting until he should ask some other question  she had  not to wait long for he said presently  and what is the after history of the young lady who went away   they know it i suppose  clemency shook her head  ive heard she said that doctor  jeddler is thought to know more of it than he tells  miss grace  has had letters from her sister saying that she was well and  happy and made much happier by her being married to mr alfred   and has written letters back  but theres a mystery about her life  and fortunes altogether which nothing has cleared up to this  hour and which    she faltered here and stopped  and which  repeated the stranger  which only one other person i believe could explain said  clemency drawing her breath quickly  who may that be asked the stranger  mr michael warden answered clemency almost in a shriek  at  once conveying to her husband what she would have had him  understand before and letting michael warden know that he was  recognised  you remember me sir said clemency trembling with emotion i  saw just now you did  you remember me that night in the garden   i was with her  yes  you were he said  yes sir returned clemency  yes to be sure  this is my  husband if you please  ben my dear ben run to miss grace  run  to mr alfred  run somewhere ben  bring somebody here  directly  stay said michael warden quietly interposing himself between  the door and britain  what would you do  let them know that you are here sir answered clemency clapping  her hands in sheer agitation  let them know that they may hear of  her from your own lips let them know that she is not quite lost  to them but that she will come home again yet to bless her father  and her loving sister  even her old servant even me she struck  herself upon the breast with both hands with a sight of her sweet  face  run ben run  and still she pressed him on towards the  door and still mr warden stood before it with his hand stretched  out not angrily but sorrowfully  or perhaps said clemency running past her husband and catching  in her emotion at mr wardens cloak perhaps shes here now  perhaps shes close by  i think from your manner she is  let me  see her sir if you please  i waited on her when she was a little  child  i saw her grow to be the pride of all this place  i knew  her when she was mr alfreds promised wife  i tried to warn her  when you tempted her away  i know what her old home was when she  was like the soul of it and how it changed when she was gone and  lost  let me speak to her if you please  he gazed at her with compassion not unmixed with wonder  but he  made no gesture of assent  i dont think she can know pursued clemency how truly they  forgive her how they love her what joy it would be to them to  see her once more  she may be timorous of going home  perhaps if  she sees me it may give her new heart  only tell me truly mr  warden is she with you  she is not he answered shaking his head  this answer and his manner and his black dress and his coming  back so quietly and his announced intention of continuing to live  abroad explained it all  marion was dead  he didnt contradict her yes she was dead  clemency sat down  hid her face upon the table and cried  at that moment a greyheaded old gentleman came running in  quite  out of breath and panting so much that his voice was scarcely to  be recognised as the voice of mr snitchey  good heaven mr warden said the lawyer taking him aside what  wind has blown    he was so blown himself that he couldnt get  on any further until after a pause when he added feebly you  here  an illwind i am afraid he answered  if you could have heard  what has just passed  how i have been besought and entreated to  perform impossibilities  what confusion and affliction i carry  with me  i can guess it all  but why did you ever come here my good sir  retorted snitchey  come  how should i know who kept the house  when i sent my  servant on to you i strolled in here because the place was new to  me and i had a natural curiosity in everything new and old in  these old scenes and it was outside the town  i wanted to  communicate with you first before appearing there  i wanted to  know what people would say to me  i see by your manner that you  can tell me  if it were not for your confounded caution i should  have been possessed of everything long ago  our caution returned the lawyer speaking for self and craggs   deceased here mr snitchey glancing at his hatband shook his  head how can you reasonably blame us mr warden  it was  understood between us that the subject was never to be renewed and  that it wasnt a subject on which grave and sober men like us i  made a note of your observations at the time could interfere  our  caution too  when mr craggs sir went down to his respected  grave in the full belief    i had given a solemn promise of silence until i should return  whenever that might be interrupted mr warden and i have kept  it  well sir and i repeat it returned mr snitchey we were bound  to silence too  we were bound to silence in our duty towards  ourselves and in our duty towards a variety of clients you among  them who were as close as wax  it was not our place to make  inquiries of you on such a delicate subject  i had my suspicions  sir but it is not six months since i have known the truth and  been assured that you lost her  by whom inquired his client  by doctor jeddler himself sir who at last reposed that  confidence in me voluntarily  he and only he has known the whole  truth years and years  and you know it said his client  i do sir replied snitchey and i have also reason to know that  it will be broken to her sister tomorrow evening  they have given  her that promise  in the meantime perhaps youll give me the  honour of your company at my house being unexpected at your own   but not to run the chance of any more such difficulties as you  have had here in case you should be recognised  though youre a  good deal changed i think i might have passed you myself mr  warden  we had better dine here and walk on in the evening  its  a very good place to dine at mr warden  your own property by thebye  self and craggs deceased took a chop here sometimes  and had it very comfortably served  mr craggs sir said  snitchey shutting his eyes tight for an instant and opening them  again was struck off the roll of life too soon  heaven forgive me for not condoling with you returned michael  warden passing his hand across his forehead but im like a man  in a dream at present  i seem to want my wits  mr craggs  yes   i am very sorry we have lost mr craggs  but he looked at  clemency as he said it and seemed to sympathise with ben  consoling her  mr craggs sir observed snitchey didnt find life i regret  to say as easy to have and to hold as his theory made it out or  he would have been among us now  its a great loss to me  he was  my right arm my right leg my right ear my right eye was mr  craggs  i am paralytic without him  he bequeathed his share of  the business to mrs craggs her executors administrators and  assigns  his name remains in the firm to this hour  i try in a  childish sort of a way to make believe sometimes hes alive   you may observe that i speak for self and craggs  deceased sir   deceased said the tenderhearted attorney waving his pocket handkerchief  michael warden who had still been observant of clemency turned to  mr snitchey when he ceased to speak and whispered in his ear  ah poor thing said snitchey shaking his head  yes  she was  always very faithful to marion  she was always very fond of her   pretty marion  poor marion  cheer up mistress  you are married  now you know clemency  clemency only sighed and shook her head  well well  wait till tomorrow said the lawyer kindly  tomorrow cant bring back the dead to life mister said  clemency sobbing  no  it cant do that or it would bring back mr craggs  deceased returned the lawyer  but it may bring some soothing  circumstances it may bring some comfort  wait till tomorrow  so clemency shaking his proffered hand said she would and  britain who had been terribly cast down at sight of his despondent  wife which was like the business hanging its head said that was  right and mr snitchey and michael warden went upstairs and  there they were soon engaged in a conversation so cautiously  conducted that no murmur of it was audible above the clatter of  plates and dishes the hissing of the fryingpan the bubbling of  saucepans the low monotonous waltzing of the jack  with a  dreadful click every now and then as if it had met with some mortal  accident to its head in a fit of giddiness  and all the other  preparations in the kitchen for their dinner   tomorrow was a bright and peaceful day and nowhere were the  autumn tints more beautifully seen than from the quiet orchard of  the doctors house  the snows of many winter nights had melted  from that ground the withered leaves of many summer times had  rustled there since she had fled  the honeysuckle porch was  green again the trees cast bountiful and changing shadows on the  grass the landscape was as tranquil and serene as it had ever  been but where was she  not there  not there  she would have been a stranger sight in her  old home now even than that home had been at first without her   but a lady sat in the familiar place from whose heart she had  never passed away in whose true memory she lived unchanging  youthful radiant with all promise and all hope in whose affection   and it was a mothers now there was a cherished little daughter  playing by her side  she had no rival no successor upon whose  gentle lips her name was trembling then  the spirit of the lost girl looked out of those eyes  those eyes  of grace her sister sitting with her husband in the orchard on  their weddingday and his and marions birthday  he had not become a great man he had not grown rich he had not  forgotten the scenes and friends of his youth he had not fulfilled  any one of the doctors old predictions  but in his useful  patient unknown visiting of poor mens homes and in his watching  of sick beds and in his daily knowledge of the gentleness and  goodness flowering the bypaths of this world not to be trodden  down beneath the heavy foot of poverty but springing up elastic  in its track and making its way beautiful he had better learned  and proved in each succeeding year the truth of his old faith   the manner of his life though quiet and remote had shown him how  often men still entertained angels unawares as in the olden time  and how the most unlikely forms  even some that were mean and ugly  to the view and poorly clad  became irradiated by the couch of  sorrow want and pain and changed to ministering spirits with a  glory round their heads  he lived to better purpose on the altered battleground perhaps  than if he had contended restlessly in more ambitious lists and he  was happy with his wife dear grace  and marion  had he forgotten her  the time has flown dear grace he said since then they had  been talking of that night and yet it seems a long long while  ago  we count by changes and events within us  not by years  yet we have years to count by too since marion was with us  returned grace  six times dear husband counting tonight as  one we have sat here on her birthday and spoken together of that  happy return so eagerly expected and so long deferred  ah when  will it be  when will it be  her husband attentively observed her as the tears collected in her  eyes and drawing nearer said  but marion told you in that farewell letter which she left for  you upon your table love and which you read so often that years  must pass away before it could be  did she not  she took a letter from her breast and kissed it and said yes  that through these intervening years however happy she might be  she would look forward to the time when you would meet again and  all would be made clear and that she prayed you trustfully and  hopefully to do the same  the letter runs so does it not my  dear  yes alfred  and every other letter she has written since  except the last  some months ago  in which she spoke of you and  what you then knew and what i was to learn tonight  he looked towards the sun then fast declining and said that the  appointed time was sunset  alfred said grace laying her hand upon his shoulder earnestly  there is something in this letter  this old letter which you say  i read so often  that i have never told you  but tonight dear  husband with that sunset drawing near and all our life seeming to  soften and become hushed with the departing day i cannot keep it  secret  what is it love  when marion went away she wrote me here that you had once left  her a sacred trust to me and that now she left you alfred such a  trust in my hands  praying and beseeching me as i loved her and  as i loved you not to reject the affection she believed she knew  she said you would transfer to me when the new wound was healed  but to encourage and return it    and make me a proud and happy man again grace  did she say  so  she meant to make myself so blest and honoured in your love was  his wifes answer as he held her in his arms  hear me my dear he said  no  hear me so  and as he  spoke he gently laid the head she had raised again upon his  shoulder  i know why i have never heard this passage in the  letter until now  i know why no trace of it ever showed itself in  any word or look of yours at that time  i know why grace although  so true a friend to me was hard to win to be my wife  and knowing  it my own i know the priceless value of the heart i gird within  my arms and thank god for the rich possession  she wept but not for sorrow as he pressed her to his heart   after a brief space he looked down at the child who was sitting  at their feet playing with a little basket of flowers and bade her  look how golden and how red the sun was  alfred said grace raising her head quickly at these words   the sun is going down  you have not forgotten what i am to know  before it sets  you are to know the truth of marions history my love he  answered  all the truth she said imploringly  nothing veiled from me  any more  that was the promise  was it not  it was he answered  before the sun went down on marions birthday  and you see it  alfred  it is sinking fast  he put his arm about her waist and looking steadily into her  eyes rejoined  that truth is not reserved so long for me to tell dear grace  it  is to come from other lips  from other lips she faintly echoed  yes  i know your constant heart i know how brave you are i know  that to you a word of preparation is enough  you have said truly  that the time is come  it is  tell me that you have present  fortitude to bear a trial  a surprise  a shock  and the  messenger is waiting at the gate  what messenger she said  and what intelligence does he bring  i am pledged he answered her preserving his steady look to  say no more  do you think you understand me  i am afraid to think she said  there was that emotion in his face despite its steady gaze which  frightened her  again she hid her own face on his shoulder  trembling and entreated him to pause  a moment  courage my wife  when you have firmness to receive the  messenger the messenger is waiting at the gate  the sun is  setting on marions birthday  courage courage grace  she raised her head and looking at him told him she was ready   as she stood and looked upon him going away her face was so like  marions as it had been in her later days at home that it was  wonderful to see  he took the child with him  she called her back   she bore the lost girls name  and pressed her to her bosom   the little creature being released again sped after him and  grace was left alone  she knew not what she dreaded or what hoped but remained there  motionless looking at the porch by which they had disappeared  ah what was that emerging from its shadow standing on its  threshold  that figure with its white garments rustling in the  evening air its head laid down upon her fathers breast and  pressed against it to his loving heart  o god was it a vision  that came bursting from the old mans arms and with a cry and  with a waving of its hands and with a wild precipitation of itself  upon her in its boundless love sank down in her embrace  oh marion marion  oh my sister  oh my hearts dear love   oh joy and happiness unutterable so to meet again  it was no dream no phantom conjured up by hope and fear but  marion sweet marion  so beautiful so happy so unalloyed by care  and trial so elevated and exalted in her loveliness that as the  setting sun shone brightly on her upturned face she might have  been a spirit visiting the earth upon some healing mission  clinging to her sister who had dropped upon a seat and bent down  over her  and smiling through her tears  and kneeling close  before her with both arms twining round her and never turning for  an instant from her face  and with the glory of the setting sun  upon her brow and with the soft tranquillity of evening gathering  around them  marion at length broke silence her voice so calm  low clear and pleasant welltuned to the time  when this was my dear home grace as it will be now again    stay my sweet love  a moment  o marion to hear you speak  again  she could not bear the voice she loved so well at first  when this was my dear home grace as it will be now again i  loved him from my soul  i loved him most devotedly  i would have  died for him though i was so young  i never slighted his  affection in my secret breast for one brief instant  it was far  beyond all price to me  although it is so long ago and past and  gone and everything is wholly changed i could not bear to think  that you who love so well should think i did not truly love him  once  i never loved him better grace than when he left this very  scene upon this very day  i never loved him better dear one than  i did that night when i left here  her sister bending over her could look into her face and hold  her fast  but he had gained unconsciously said marion with a gentle  smile another heart before i knew that i had one to give him   that heart  yours my sister  was so yielded up in all its  other tenderness to me was so devoted and so noble that it  plucked its love away and kept its secret from all eyes but mine   ah what other eyes were quickened by such tenderness and  gratitude  and was content to sacrifice itself to me  but i  knew something of its depths  i knew the struggle it had made  i  knew its high inestimable worth to him and his appreciation of  it let him love me as he would  i knew the debt i owed it  i had  its great example every day before me  what you had done for me i  knew that i could do grace if i would for you  i never laid my  head down on my pillow but i prayed with tears to do it  i never  laid my head down on my pillow but i thought of alfreds own words  on the day of his departure and how truly he had said for i knew  that knowing you that there were victories gained every day in  struggling hearts to which these fields of battle were nothing   thinking more and more upon the great endurance cheerfully  sustained and never known or cared for that there must be every  day and hour in that great strife of which he spoke my trial  seemed to grow light and easy  and he who knows our hearts my  dearest at this moment and who knows there is no drop of  bitterness or grief  of anything but unmixed happiness  in mine  enabled me to make the resolution that i never would be alfreds  wife  that he should be my brother and your husband if the  course i took could bring that happy end to pass but that i never  would grace i then loved him dearly dearly be his wife  o marion  o marion  i had tried to seem indifferent to him and she pressed her  sisters face against her own but that was hard and you were  always his true advocate  i had tried to tell you of my  resolution but you would never hear me you would never understand  me  the time was drawing near for his return  i felt that i must  act before the daily intercourse between us was renewed  i knew  that one great pang undergone at that time would save a  lengthened agony to all of us  i knew that if i went away then  that end must follow which has followed and which has made us both  so happy grace  i wrote to good aunt martha for a refuge in her  house  i did not then tell her all but something of my story and  she freely promised it  while i was contesting that step with  myself and with my love of you and home mr warden brought here  by an accident became for some time our companion  i have sometimes feared of late years that this might have been  exclaimed her sister and her countenance was ashypale  you  never loved him  and you married him in your selfsacrifice to  me  he was then said marion drawing her sister closer to her on  the eve of going secretly away for a long time  he wrote to me  after leaving here told me what his condition and prospects really  were and offered me his hand  he told me he had seen i was not  happy in the prospect of alfreds return  i believe he thought my  heart had no part in that contract perhaps thought i might have  loved him once and did not then perhaps thought that when i tried  to seem indifferent i tried to hide indifference  i cannot tell   but i wished that you should feel me wholly lost to alfred   hopeless to him  dead  do you understand me love  her sister looked into her face attentively  she seemed in doubt  i saw mr warden and confided in his honour charged him with my  secret on the eve of his and my departure  he kept it  do you  understand me dear  grace looked confusedly upon her  she scarcely seemed to hear  my love my sister said marion recall your thoughts a moment  listen to me  do not look so strangely on me  there are  countries dearest where those who would abjure a misplaced  passion or would strive against some cherished feeling of their  hearts and conquer it retire into a hopeless solitude and close  the world against themselves and worldly loves and hopes for ever   when women do so they assume that name which is so dear to you and  me and call each other sisters  but there may be sisters grace  who in the broad world out of doors and underneath its free sky  and in its crowded places and among its busy life and trying to  assist and cheer it and to do some good  learn the same lesson  and who with hearts still fresh and young and open to all  happiness and means of happiness can say the battle is long past  the victory long won  and such a one am i  you understand me  now  still she looked fixedly upon her and made no reply  oh grace dear grace said marion clinging yet more tenderly and  fondly to that breast from which she had been so long exiled if  you were not a happy wife and mother  if i had no little namesake  here  if alfred my kind brother were not your own fond husband   from whence could i derive the ecstasy i feel tonight  but as i  left here so i have returned  my heart has known no other love  my hand has never been bestowed apart from it  i am still your  maiden sister unmarried unbetrothed  your own loving old marion  in whose affection you exist alone and have no partner grace  she understood her now  her face relaxed  sobs came to her  relief and falling on her neck she wept and wept and fondled her  as if she were a child again  when they were more composed they found that the doctor and his  sister good aunt martha were standing near at hand with alfred  this is a weary day for me said good aunt martha smiling  through her tears as she embraced her nieces for i lose my dear  companion in making you all happy and what can you give me in  return for my marion  a converted brother said the doctor  thats something to be sure retorted aunt martha in such a  farce as    no pray dont said the doctor penitently  well i wont replied aunt martha  but i consider myself ill  used  i dont know whats to become of me without my marion after  we have lived together halfadozen years  you must come and live here i suppose replied the doctor  we  shant quarrel now martha  or you must get married aunt said alfred  indeed returned the old lady i think it might be a good  speculation if i were to set my cap at michael warden who i hear  is come home much the better for his absence in all respects  but  as i knew him when he was a boy and i was not a very young woman  then perhaps he mightnt respond  so ill make up my mind to go  and live with marion when she marries and until then it will not  be very long i dare say to live alone  what do you say  brother  ive a great mind to say its a ridiculous world altogether and  theres nothing serious in it observed the poor old doctor  you might take twenty affidavits of it if you chose anthony  said his sister but nobody would believe you with such eyes as  those  its a world full of hearts said the doctor hugging his  youngest daughter and bending across her to hug grace  for he  couldnt separate the sisters and a serious world with all its  folly  even with mine which was enough to have swamped the whole  globe and it is a world on which the sun never rises but it looks  upon a thousand bloodless battles that are some setoff against the  miseries and wickedness of battlefields and it is a world we need  be careful how we libel heaven forgive us for it is a world of  sacred mysteries and its creator only knows what lies beneath the  surface of his lightest image   you would not be the better pleased with my rude pen if it  dissected and laid open to your view the transports of this family  long severed and now reunited  therefore i will not follow the  poor doctor through his humbled recollection of the sorrow he had  had when marion was lost to him nor will i tell how serious he  had found that world to be in which some love deepanchored is  the portion of all human creatures nor how such a trifle as the  absence of one little unit in the great absurd account had  stricken him to the ground  nor how in compassion for his  distress his sister had long ago revealed the truth to him by  slow degrees and brought him to the knowledge of the heart of his  selfbanished daughter and to that daughters side  nor how alfred heathfield had been told the truth too in the  course of that then current year and marion had seen him and had  promised him as her brother that on her birthday in the  evening grace should know it from her lips at last  i beg your pardon doctor said mr snitchey looking into the  orchard but have i liberty to come in  without waiting for permission he came straight to marion and  kissed her hand quite joyfully  if mr craggs had been alive my dear miss marion said mr  snitchey he would have had great interest in this occasion  it  might have suggested to him mr alfred that our life is not too  easy perhaps  that taken altogether it will bear any little  smoothing we can give it but mr craggs was a man who could endure  to be convinced sir  he was always open to conviction  if he  were open to conviction now i  this is weakness  mrs snitchey  my dear  at his summons that lady appeared from behind the door  you are among old friends  mrs snitchey having delivered her congratulations took her  husband aside  one moment mr snitchey said that lady  it is not in my  nature to rake up the ashes of the departed  no my dear returned her husband  mr craggs is    yes my dear he is deceased said snitchey  but i ask you if you recollect pursued his wife that evening  of the ball  i only ask you that  if you do and if your memory  has not entirely failed you mr snitchey and if you are not  absolutely in your dotage i ask you to connect this time with that   to remember how i begged and prayed you on my knees    upon your knees my dear said mr snitchey  yes said mrs snitchey confidently and you know it  to  beware of that man  to observe his eye  and now to tell me  whether i was right and whether at that moment he knew secrets  which he didnt choose to tell  mrs snitchey returned her husband in her ear madam  did you  ever observe anything in my eye  no said mrs snitchey sharply  dont flatter yourself  because madam that night he continued twitching her by the  sleeve it happens that we both knew secrets which we didnt  choose to tell and both knew just the same professionally  and so  the less you say about such things the better mrs snitchey and  take this as a warning to have wiser and more charitable eyes  another time  miss marion i brought a friend of yours along with  me  here  mistress  poor clemency with her apron to her eyes came slowly in escorted  by her husband the latter doleful with the presentiment that if  she abandoned herself to grief the nutmeggrater was done for  now mistress said the lawyer checking marion as she ran  towards her and interposing himself between them whats the  matter with you  the matter cried poor clemency  when looking up in wonder  and in indignant remonstrance and in the added emotion of a great  roar from mr britain and seeing that sweet face so well  remembered close before her she stared sobbed laughed cried  screamed embraced her held her fast released her fell on mr  snitchey and embraced him much to mrs snitcheys indignation  fell on the doctor and embraced him fell on mr britain and  embraced him and concluded by embracing herself throwing her  apron over her head and going into hysterics behind it  a stranger had come into the orchard after mr snitchey and had  remained apart near the gate without being observed by any of the  group for they had little spare attention to bestow and that had  been monopolised by the ecstasies of clemency  he did not appear  to wish to be observed but stood alone with downcast eyes and  there was an air of dejection about him though he was a gentleman  of a gallant appearance which the general happiness rendered more  remarkable  none but the quick eyes of aunt martha however remarked him at  all but almost as soon as she espied him she was in conversation  with him  presently going to where marion stood with grace and  her little namesake she whispered something in marions ear at  which she started and appeared surprised but soon recovering from  her confusion she timidly approached the stranger in aunt  marthas company and engaged in conversation with him too  mr britain said the lawyer putting his hand in his pocket and  bringing out a legallooking document while this was going on i  congratulate you  you are now the whole and sole proprietor of  that freehold tenement at present occupied and held by yourself as  a licensed tavern or house of public entertainment and commonly  called or known by the sign of the nutmeggrater  your wife lost  one house through my client mr michael warden and now gains  another  i shall have the pleasure of canvassing you for the  county one of these fine mornings  would it make any difference in the vote if the sign was altered  sir asked britain  not in the least replied the lawyer  then said mr britain handing him back the conveyance just  clap in the words and thimble will you be so good and ill  have the two mottoes painted up in the parlour instead of my wifes  portrait  and let me said a voice behind them it was the strangers   michael wardens let me claim the benefit of those inscriptions   mr heathfield and dr jeddler i might have deeply wronged you  both  that i did not is no virtue of my own  i will not say that  i am six years wiser than i was or better  but i have known at  any rate that term of selfreproach  i can urge no reason why you  should deal gently with me  i abused the hospitality of this  house and learnt by my own demerits with a shame i never have  forgotten yet with some profit too i would fain hope from one  he glanced at marion to whom i made my humble supplication for  forgiveness when i knew her merit and my deep unworthiness  in a  few days i shall quit this place for ever  i entreat your pardon   do as you would be done by  forget and forgive   time  from whom i had the latter portion of this story and with  whom i have the pleasure of a personal acquaintance of some five andthirty years duration  informed me leaning easily upon his  scythe that michael warden never went away again and never sold  his house but opened it afresh maintained a golden means of  hospitality and had a wife the pride and honour of that  countryside whose name was marion  but as i have observed that  time confuses facts occasionally i hardly know what weight to give  to his authority
