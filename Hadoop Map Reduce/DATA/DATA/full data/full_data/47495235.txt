evidence of john ruskin monday april 6 1857   114 chairman has your attention been turned to the desirableness of uniting sculpture with painting under the same roofyes  what is your opinion on the subjecti think it almost essential that they should be united if a national gallery is to be of service in teaching the course of art  sculpture of all kinds or only ancient sculptureof all kinds  do you think that the sculpture in the british museum should be in the same building with the pictures in the national gallery that is to say making an application of your principle to that particular caseyes certainly i think so for several reasonschiefly because i think the taste of the nation can only be rightly directed by having always sculpture and painting visible together many of the highest and best points of painting i think can only be discerned after some discipline of the eye by sculpture that is one very essential reason i think that after looking at sculpture one feels the grace of composition infinitely more and one also feels how that grace of composition was reached by the painter  do you consider that if works of sculpture and works of painting were placed in the same gallery the same light would be useful for both of themi understood your question only to refer to their collection under the same roof i should be sorry to see them in the same room  you would not mix them up in the way in which they are mixed up in the florentine gallery for instancenot at all i think on the contrary that the one diverts the mind from the other and that although the one is an admirable discipline you should take some time for the examination of sculpture and pass afterwards into the painting room and so on you should not be disturbed while looking at paintings by the whiteness of the sculpture  you do not then approve for example of the way in which the famous room the tribune at florence is arrangedno i think it is merely arranged for showfor showing how many rich things can be got together  115 mr cockerell then you do not regard sculpture as a proper decorative portion of the national gallery of picturesyou do not admit the term decorationno i should not use that term of the sculpture which it was the object of the gallery to exhibit it might be added of course supposing it became a part of the architecture but not as independentnot as a thing to be contemplated separately in the room and not as a part of the room as a part of the room of course modern sculpture might be added but i have never thought that it would be necessary  you do not consider that sculpture would be a repose after contemplating painting for some timei should not feel it so myself  116 dean of st pauls when you speak of removing the sculpture of the british museum and of uniting it with the pictures of the national gallery do you comprehend the whole range of the sculpture in the british museum commencing with the egyptian and going down through its regular series of gradation to the decline of the artyes because my great hope respecting the national gallery is that it may become a perfectly consecutive chronological arrangement and it seems to me that it is one of the chief characteristics of a national gallery that it should be so  then you consider that one great excellence of the collection at the british museum is that it does present that sort of history of the art of sculpturei consider it rather its weakness that it does not  then you would go down furtheri would  you are perhaps acquainted with the ivories which have been recently purchased therei am not  supposing there were a fine collection of byzantine ivories you would consider that they were an important link in the general historycertainly  would you unite the whole of that pagan sculpture with what you call the later christian art of paintingi should be glad to see it donethat is to say i should be glad to see the galleries of painting and sculpture collaterally placed and the gallery of sculpture beginning with the pagan art and proceeding to the christian art but not necessarily associating the painting with the sculpture of each epoch because the painting is so deficient in many of the periods where the sculpture is rich that you could not carry them on collaterallyyou must have your painting gallery and your sculpture gallery  you would be sorry to take any portion of the sculpture from the collection in the british museum and to associate it with any collection of paintingyes i should think it highly inexpedient my whole object would be that it might be associated with a larger collection a collection from other periods and not be subdivided and it seems to be one of the chief reasons advanced in order to justify removing that collection that it cannot be much more enlargedthat you cannot at present put other sculpture with it  supposing that the collection of ancient pagan art could not be united with the national gallery of pictures with which would you associate the mediæval sculpture supposing we were to retain any considerable amount of sculpturewith the painting  the mediæval art you would associate with the painting supposing you could not put the whole togetheryes  117 chairman do you approve of protecting pictures by glassyes in every case i do not know of what size a pane of glass can be manufactured but i have never seen a picture so large but that i should be glad to see it under glass even supposing it were possible which i suppose it is not the great paul veronese in the gallery of the louvre i think would be more beautiful under glass  independently of the preservationindependently of the preservation i think it would be more beautiful it gives an especial delicacy to light colors and does little harm to dark colorsthat is it benefits delicate pictures most and its injury is only to very dark pictures  have you ever considered the propriety of covering the sculpture with glassi have never considered it i did not know until a very few days ago that sculpture was injured by exposure to our climate and our smoke  professor faraday but you would cover the pictures independently of the preservation you would cover them absolutely for the artistic effect the improvement of the picturenot necessarily so because to some persons there might be an objectionable character in having to avoid the reflection more scrupulously than otherwise i should not press for it on that head only the advantage gained is not a great one it is only felt by very delicate eyes as far as i know many persons would not perceive that there was a difference and that is caused by the very slight color in the glass which perhaps some persons might think it expedient to avoid altogether  do you put it down to the absolute tint in the glass like a glazing or do you put it down to a sort of reflection is the effect referable to the color in the glass or to some kind of optic action which the most transparent glass might producei do not know but i suppose it to be referable to the very slight tint in the glass  118 dean of st pauls is it not the case when ladies with very brilliant dresses look at pictures through glass that the reflection of the color of their dresses is so strong as greatly to disturb the enjoyment and the appreciation of the picturescertainly but i should ask the ladies to stand a little aside and look at the pictures one by one there is that disadvantage  i am supposing a crowded roomof course the object of a national gallery is that it should be crowdedthat as large a number of the public should have access to it as possiblethere would of course be certain limited hours and the gallery would be liable to get filled with the public in great numbersit would be disadvantageous certainly but not so disadvantageous as to balance the much greater advantage of preservation i imagine that in fact glass is essential it is not merely an expedient thing but an essential thing to the safety of the pictures for twenty or thirty years  do you consider it essential as regards the atmosphere of london or of this country generallyi speak of london only i have no experience of other parts but i have this experience in my own collection i kept my pictures for some time without glass and i found the deterioration definite within a very short perioda period of a couple of years  you mean at denmark hillyes that deterioration on pictures of the class i refer to is not to be afterwards remediedthe thing suffers foreveryou cannot get into the interstices  professor faraday you consider that the picture is permanently injured by the dirtyes  that no cleaning can restore it to what it wasnothing can restore it to what it was i think because the operation of cleaning must scrape away some of the grains of paint  therefore if you have two pictures one in a dirtier place and one in a cleaner place no attention will put the one in the dirtier place on a level with that in the cleaner placei think nevermore  119 chairman i see that in your notes on the turner collection you recommended that the large upright pictures would have great advantage in having a room to themselves do you mean each of the large pictures or a whole collection of large picturessupposing very beautiful pictures of a large size it would depend entirely on the value and size of the picture supposing we ever acquired such large pictures as titians assumption or raphaels transfiguration those pictures ought to have a room to themselves and to have a gallery round them  do you mean that each of them should have a roomyes  dean of st pauls have you been recently at dresdenno i have never been at dresden  then you do not know the position of the great holbein and of the madonna de s sisto there which have separate roomsno  mr cockerell are you acquainted with the munich galleryno  do you know the plans of itno  then you have not seen perhaps the most recent arrangements adopted by that learned people the germans with regard to the exhibition of picturesi have not been into germany for twenty years  120 that subject has been handled by them in an original manner and they have constructed galleries at munich at dresden and i believe at st petersburg upon a new principle and a very judicious principle you have not had opportunities of considering thatno i have never considered that because i always supposed that there was no difficulty in producing a beautiful gallery or an efficient one i never thought that there could be any question about the form which such a gallery should take or that it was a matter of consideration the only difficulty with me was thisthe persuading or hoping to persuade a nation that if it had pictures at all it should have those pictures on the line of the eye that it was not well to have a noble picture many feet above the eye merely for the glory of the room then i think that as soon as you decide that a picture is to be seen it is easy to find out the way of showing it to say that it should have such and such a room with such and such a light not a raking light as i heard sir charles eastlake express it the other day but rather an oblique and soft light and not so near the picture as to catch the eye painfully that may be easily obtained and i think that all other questions after that are subordinate  dean of st pauls your proposition would require a great extent of wallan immense extent of wall  121 chairman i see you state in the pamphlet to which i have before alluded that it is of the highest importance that the works of each master should be kept together would not such an arrangement increase very much the size of the national galleryi think not because i have only supposed in my plan that at the utmost two lines of pictures should be admitted on the walls of the room that being so you would be always able to put all the works of any master together without any inconvenience or difficulty in fitting them to the size of the room supposing that you put the large pictures high on the walls then it might be a question of course whether such and such a room or compartment of the gallery would hold the works of a particular master but supposing the pictures were all on a continuous line you would only stop with a and begin with b  then you would only have them on one level and one linein general that seems to me the commonsense principle  mr richmond then you disapprove of the whole of the european hanging of pictures in galleriesi think it very beautiful sometimes but not to be imitated it produces most noble rooms no one can but be impressed with the first room at the louvre where you have the most noble venetian pictures one mass of fire on the four walls but then none of the details of those pictures can be seen  dean of st pauls there you have a very fine general effect but you lose the effect of the beauties of each individual pictureyou lose all the beauties all the higher merits you get merely your general idea it is a perfectly splendid room of which a great part of the impression depends upon the consciousness of the spectator that it is so costly  122 would you have those galleries in themselves richly decoratednot richly but pleasantly  brilliantly but not too brightlynot too brightly i have not gone into that question it being out of my way but i think generally that great care should be taken to give a certain splendora certain gorgeous effectso that the spectator may feel himself among splendid things so that there shall be no discomfort or meagerness or want of respect for the things which are being shown  123 mr richmond then do you think that art would be more worthily treated and the public taste and artists better served by having even a smaller collection of works so arranged than by a much larger one merely housed and hung four or five deep as in an auction roomyes but you put a difficult choice before me because i do think it a very important thing that we should have many pictures totally new results might be obtained from a large gallery in which the chronological arrangement was perfect and whose curators prepared for that chronological arrangement by leaving gaps to be filled by future acquisition taking the greatest pains in the selection of the examples that they should be thoroughly characteristic giving a greater price for a picture which was thoroughly characteristic and expressive of the habits of a nation because it appears to me that one of the main uses of art at present is not so much as art but as teaching us the feelings of nations history only tells us what they did art tells us their feelings and why they did it whether they were energetic and fiery or whether they were as in the case of the dutch imitating minor things quiet and cold all those expressions of feeling cannot come out of history even the contemporary historian does not feel them he does not feel what his nation is but get the works of the same master together the works of the same nation together and the works of the same century together and see how the thing will force itself upon everyones observation  124 then you would not exclude the genuine work of inferior mastersnot by any means  you would have the whole as far as you could obtain ityes as far as it was characteristic but i think you can hardly call an inferior master one who does in the best possible way the thing he undertakes to do and i would not take any master who did not in some way excel for instance i would not take a mere imitator of cuyp among the dutch but cuyp himself has done insuperable things in certain expressions of sunlight and repose vander heyden and others may also be mentioned as firstrate in inferior lines  taking from the rise of art to the time of raphael would you in the national gallery include examples of all those masters whose names have come down to the most learned of usno  where would you draw the line and where would you begin to leave outi would only draw the line when i was purchasing a picture i think that a person might always spend his money better by making an effort to get one noble picture than five or six second or thirdrate pictures provided only that you had examples of the best kind of work produced at that time i would not have secondrate pictures multitudes of masters among the disciples of giotto might be named you might have one or two pictures of giotto and one or two pictures of the disciples of giotto  then you would rather depend upon the beauty of the work itself if the work were beautiful you would admit itcertainly  but if it were only historically interesting would you then reject itnot in the least i want it historically interesting but i want as good an example as i can have of that particular manner  would it not be historically interesting if it were the only picture known of that particular master who was a follower of giotto for instance supposing a work of cennino cennini were brought to light and had no real merit in it as a work of art would it not be the duty of the authorities of a national gallery to seize upon that picture and pay perhaps rather a large price for itcertainly all documentary art i should include  then what would you excludemerely that which is inferior and not documentary merely another example of the same kind of thing  then you would not multiply examples of the same masters if inferior men but you would have one of each there is no man i suppose whose memory has come down to us after three or four centuries but has something worth preserving in his worksomething peculiar to himself which perhaps no other person has ever done and you would retain one example of such would you noti would if it was in my power but i would rather with given funds make an effort to get perfect examples  then you think that the artistic element should govern the archæological in the selectionyes and the archæological in the arrangement  125 dean of st pauls when you speak of arranging the works of one master consecutively would you pay any regard or not to the subjects you must be well aware that many painters for instance correggio and others painted very incongruous subjects would you rather keep them together than disperse the works of those painters to a certain degree according to their subjectsi would most certainly keep them together i think it an important feature of the master that he did paint incongruously and very possibly the character of each picture would be better understood by seeing them together the relations of each are sometimes essential to be seen  mr richmond do you think that the preservation of these works is one of the first and most important things to be provided forit would be so with me in purchasing a picture i would pay double the price for it if i thought it was likely to be destroyed where it was  in a note you wrote to me the other day i find this passage the art of a nation i think one of the most important points of its history and a part which if once destroyed no history will ever supply the place ofand the first idea of a national gallery is that it should be a library of art in which the rudest efforts are in some cases hardly less important than the noblest is that your opinionperfectly that seems somewhat inconsistent with what i have been saying but i mean there the noblest efforts of the time at which they are produced i would take the greatest pains to get an example of eleventh century work though the painting is perfectly barbarous at that time  126 you have much to do with the education of the working classes in art as far as you are able to tell us what is your experience with regard to their liking and disliking in artdo comparatively uneducated persons prefer the art up to the time of raphael or down from the time of raphaelwe will take the bolognese school or the early florentine schoolwhich do you think a working man would feel the greatest interest in looking ati cannot tell you because my working men would not be allowed to look at a bolognese picture i teach them so much love of detail that the moment they see a detail carefully drawn they are caught by it the main thing which has surprised me in dealing with these men is the exceeding refinement of their mindsso that in a moment i can get carpenters and smiths and ordinary workmen and various classes to give me a refinement which i cannot get a young lady to give me when i give her a lesson for the first time whether it is the habit of work which makes them go at it more intensely or whether it is as i rather think that as the feminine mind looks for strength the masculine mind looks for delicacy and when you take it simply and give it its choice it will go to the most refined thing i do not know  dean of st pauls can you see any perceptible improvement in the state of the public mind and taste in that respect since these measures have been adoptedthere has not been time to judge of that  127 do these persons who are taking an interest in art come from different parts of londonyes  of course the distance which they would have to come would be of very great importanceyes  therefore one of the great recommendations of a gallery if you wish it to have an effect upon the public mind in that respect would be its accessibility both with regard to the time consumed in going there and to the cheapness as i may call it of accessmost certainly  you would therefore consider that the more central the situation putting all other points out of consideration the greater advantage it would be to the publicyes there is this however to be said that a central situation involves the crowding of the room with parties wholly uninterested in the mattera situation more retired will generally be serviceable enough for the real student  would not that very much depend upon its being in a thoroughfare there might be a central situation which would not be so complete a thoroughfare as to tempt persons to go in who were not likely to derive advantage from iti think that if this gallery were made so large and so beautiful as we are proposing it would be rather a resort rather a lounge every day and all day long provided it were accessible  128 would not that a good deal depend upon its being in a public thoroughfare if it were in a thoroughfare a great many persons might pass in who would be driven in by accident or driven in by caprice if they passed it but if it were at a little distance from a thoroughfare it would be less crowded with those persons who are not likely to derive much advantage from itquite so but there would always be an advantage in attracting a crowd it would always extend its educational ability in its being crowded but it would seem to me that all that is necessary for a noble museum of the best art should be more or less removed and that a collection solely for the purpose of education and for the purpose of interesting people who do not care much about art should be provided in the very heart of the population if possible that pictures not of great value but of sufficient value to interest the public and of merit enough to form the basis of early education and to give examples of all art should be collected in the popular gallery but that all the precious things should be removed and put into the great gallery where they would be safest irrespectively altogether of accessibility  chairman then you would in fact have not one but two galleriestwo only  129 professor faraday and you would seem to desire purposely the removal of the true and head gallery to some distance so as to prevent the great access of personsyes  thinking that all those who could make a real use of a gallery would go to that oneyes my opinion in that respect has been altered within these few days from the fact having been brought to my knowledge of sculpture being much deteriorated by the atmosphere and the total impossibility of protecting sculpture pictures i do not care about for i can protect them but not sculpture  dean of st pauls whence did you derive that knowledgei forget who told me it was some authority i thought conclusive and therefore took no special note of  130 chairman do you not consider that it is rather prejudicial to art that there should be a gallery notoriously containing no firstrate works of art but secondrate or thirdrate worksno i think it rather valuable as an expression of the means of education that there should be early lessons in artthat there should be this sort of art selected especially for first studies and also that there should be a recognition of the exceeding preciousness of some other art i think that portions of it should be set aside as interesting but not unreplaceable but that other portions should be set aside as being things as to which the function of the nation was chiefly to take care of those things not for itself merely but for all its descendants and setting the example of taking care of them for ever  you do not think then that there would be any danger in the studying or the copying of works which notoriously were not the best workson the contrary i think it would be better that works not altogether the best should be first submitted i never should think of giving the best work myself to a student to copyit is hopeless he would not feel its beautieshe would merely blunder over it i am perfectly certain that that cannot be serviceable in the particular branch of art which i profess namely landscapepainting i know that i must give more or less of bad examples  mr richmond but you would admit nothing into this second gallery which was not good or true of its kindnothing which was not good or true of its kind but only inferior in value to the others  and if there were any other works which might be deposited there with perfect safety say precious drawings which might be protected by glass you would not object to exhibit those to the unselected multitudenot in the least i should be very glad to do so provided i could spare them from the grand chronological arrangement  do you think that a very interesting supplementary exhibition might be got up say at trafalgar square and retained thereyes and all the more useful because you would put few works and you could make it complete in seriesand because on a small scale you would have the entire series by selecting a few works you would have an epitome of the grand gallery the divisions of the chronology being all within the compartment of a wall which in the great gallery would be in a separate division of the building  131 mr cockerell do you contemplate the possibility of excellent copies being exhibited of the most excellent works both of sculpture and of paintingi have not contemplated that possibility i have a great horror of copies of any kind except only of sculpture i have great fear of copies of painting i think people generally catch the worst parts of the painting and leave the best  but you would select the artist who should make the copy there are persons whose whole talent is concentrated in the power of imitation of a given picture and a great talent it isi have never in my life seen a good copy of a good picture  chairman have you not seen any of the german copies of some of the great italian masters which are generally esteemed very admirable worksi have not much studied the works of the copyists i have not observed them much never having yet found an exception to that rule which i have mentioned when i came across a copyist in the gallery of the vatican or in the gallery at florence i had a horror of the mischief and the scandal and the libel upon the master from the supposition that such a thing as that in any way resembled his work and the harm that it would do to the populace among whom it was shown  mr richmond you look upon it as you would upon coining bad money and circulating it doing mischiefyes it is mischievous  mr cockerell but you admit engravingsyou admit photographs of these works which are imitations in another languageyes in abstract terms they are rather descriptions of the paintings than copiesthey are rather measures and definitions of themthey are hints and tables of the pictures rather than copies of them they do not pretend to the same excellence in any way  you speak as a connoisseur how would the common eye of the public agree with you in that opinioni think it would not agree with me nevertheless if i were taking some of my workmen into the national gallery i should soon have some hope of making them understand in what excellence consisted if i could point to a genuine work but i should have no such hope if i had only copies of these pictures  132 do you hold much to the archæological chronological and historical series and teaching of picturesyes  are you of opinion that that is essential to the creative teaching with reference to our future schoolsno i should think not essential at all the teaching of the future artist i should think might be accomplished by very few pictures of the class which that particular artist wished to study i think that the chronological arrangement is in nowise connected with the general efficiency of the gallery as a matter of study for the artist but very much so as a means of study not for persons interested in painting merely but for those who wish to examine the general history of nations and i think that painting should be considered by that class of persons as containing precious evidence it would be part of the philosophers work to examine the art of a nation as well as its poetry  you consider that art speaks a language and tells a tale which no written document can effectyes and far more precious the whole soul of a nation generally goes with its art it may be urged by an ambitious king to become a warrior nation it may be trained by a single leader to become a great warrior nation and its character at that time may materially depend upon that one man but in its art all the mind of the nation is more or less expressed it can be said that was what the peasant sought to when he went into the city to the cathedral in the morningthat was the sort of book the poor person read or learned inthe sort of picture he prayed to all which involves infinitely more important considerations than common history  133 dean of st pauls when you speak of your objections to copies of pictures do you carry that objection to casts of sculpturenot at all  supposing there could be no complete union of the great works of sculpture in a country with the great works of painting in that country would you consider that a good selection of casts comprising the great remains of sculpture of all ages would be an important addition to a public galleryi should be very glad to see it  if you could not have it of originals you would wish very much to have a complete collection of casts of course selected from all the finest sculptures in the worldcertainly  mr richmond would you do the same with architecturewould you collect the remains of architecture as far as they are to be collected and unite them with sculpture and paintingi should think that architecture consisted as far as it was portable very much in sculpture in saying that i mean that in the different branches of sculpture architecture is involvedthat is to say you would have the statues belonging to such and such a division of a building then if you had casts of those statues you would necessarily have those casts placed exactly in the same position as the original statuesit involves the buildings surrounding them and the elevationit involves the whole architecture  in addition to that would you have original drawings of architecture and models of great buildings and photographs if they could be made permanent of the great buildings as well as the moldings and casts of the moldings and the members as far as you could obtain themquite so  would you also include in the national gallery what may be called the handicraft of a nationworks for domestic use or ornament for instance we know that there were some saltcellars designed for one of the popes would you have those if they came to useverything pots and pans and saltcellars and knives  you would have everything that had an interesting art element in ityes  dean of st pauls in short a modern pompeian galleryyes i know how much greater extent that involves but i think that you should include all the iron work and china and pottery and so on i think that all works in metal all works in clay all works in carved wood should be included of course that involves much it involves all the coinsit involves an immense extent  134 supposing it were impossible to concenter in one great museum the whole of these things where should you prefer to draw the line would you draw the line between what i may call the ancient pagan world and the modern christian world and so leave to what may be called the ancient world all the ancient sculpture and any fragments of ancient painting which there might beall the vases all the ancient bronzes and in short everything which comes down to a certain period do you think that that would be the best division or should you prefer any division which takes special arts and keeps those arts togetheri should like the pagan and christian division i think it very essential that wherever the sculpture of a nation was there its iron work should bethat wherever its iron work was there its pottery should be and so on  and you would keep the mediæval works together in whatever form those mediæval works existedyes i should not at all feel injured by having to take a cabdrive from one century to another century  or from the ancient to the modern worldno  mr richmond if it were found convenient to keep separate the pagan and the christian art with which would you associate the mediævalby christian and pagan art i mean before christ and after christ  then the mediæval would come with the paintingsyes and also the mahomedan and all the pagan art which was after christ i should associate as part and a most essential part because it seems to me that the history of christianity is complicated perpetually with that which christianity was effecting therefore it is a matter of date not of christianity everything before christ i should be glad to see separated or you may take any other date that you like  but the inspiration of the two schoolsthe pagan and the christianseems so different that there would be no great violence done to the true theory of a national gallery in dividing these two would there if each were made complete in itselfthat is to say taking the spirit of the world after christianity was in it and the spirit of the world before christianity was in it  dean of st pauls the birth of christ you say is the commencement of christian artyes  then christian influence began and of course that would leave a small debatable ground particularly among the ivories for instance which we must settle according to circumstanceswide of any debatable ground all the art of a nation which had never heard of christianity the hindoo art and so on would i suppose if of the christian era go into the christian gallery  i was speaking rather of the transition period which of course there must beyes  mr cockerell there must be a distinction between the terms museum and gallery what are the distinctions which you would draw in the present casei should think museum was the right name of the whole building a gallery is i think merely a room in a museum adapted for the exhibition of works in a series whose effect depends upon their collateral showing forth  135 there are certainly persons who would derive their chief advantage from the historical and chronological arrangement which you propose but there are others who look alone for the beautiful and who say i have nothing to do with your pedantry i desire to have the beautiful before me show me those complete and perfect works which are received and known as the works of phidias and the great greek masters as far as we possess them and the works of the great italian painters i have not time nor does my genius permit that i should trouble myself with those details there is a large class who are guided by those feelingsand i hope who always will be guided by them but i should consult their feelings enough in the setting before them of the most beautiful works of art all that i should beg of them to yield to me would be that they should look at titian only or at raphael only and not wish to have titian and raphael side by side and i think i should be able to teach them as a matter of beauty that they did enjoy titian and raphael alone better than mingled then i would provide them beautiful galleries full of the mostnoble sculpture whenever we come as a country and a nation to provide beautiful sculpture it seems to me that the greatest pains should be taken to set it off beautifully you should have beautiful sculpture in the middle of the room with dark walls round it to throw out its profile and you should have all the arrangements made there so as to harmonize with it and to set forth every line of it so the painting gallery i think might be made a glorious thing if the pictures were level and the architecture above produced unity of impression from the beauty and glow of color and the purity of form  mr richmond and you would not exclude a crevelli because it was quaint or an early master of any schoolyou would have the infancy the youth and the age of each school would you notcertainly  dean of st pauls of the german as well as the italianyes  mr richmond spanish and all the schoolscertainly  136 mr cockerell you are quite aware of the great liberality of the government as we learn from the papers in a recent instance namely the purchase of a great paul veronesei am rejoiced to hear it if it is confirmed nothing will have given me such pleasure for a long time i think it is the most precious paul veronese in the world as far as the completion of the picture goes and quite a priceless picture  can you conceive a government or a people who would countenance so expensive a purchase condescending to take up with the occupation of the upper story of some public building or with an expedient which should not be entirely worthy of such a noble gallery of picturesi do not think that they ought to do so but i do not know how far they will be consistent i certainly think they ought not to put up with any such expedient i am not prepared to say what limits there are to consistency or inconsistency  mr richmond i understand you to have given in evidence that you think a national collection should be illustrative of the whole art in all its branchescertainly  not a cabinet of paintings not a collection of sculptured works but illustrative of the whole artyes  137 have you any further remark to offer to the commissionersi wish to say one word respecting the question of the restoration of statuary it seems to me a very simple question much harm is being at present done in europe by restoration more harm than was ever done as far as i know by revolutions or by wars the french are now doing great harm to their cathedrals under the idea that they are doing good destroying more than all the good they are doing and all this proceeds from the one great mistake of supposing that sculpture can be restored when it is injured i am very much interested by the question which one of the commissioners asked me in that respect and i would suggest whether it does not seem easy to avoid all questions of that kind if the statue is injured leave it so but provide a perfect copy of the statue in its restored form offer if you like prizes to sculptors for conjectural restorations and choose the most beautiful but do not touch the original work  138 professor faraday you said some time ago that in your own attempts to instruct the public there had not been time yet to see whether the course taken had produced improvement or not you see no signs at all which lead you to suppose that it will not produce the improvement which you desirefar from iti understood the dean of st pauls to ask me whether any general effect had been produced upon the minds of the public i have only been teaching a class of about forty workmen for a couple of years after their workthey not always attendingand that forty being composed of people passing away and coming again and i do not know what they are now doing i only see a gradual succession of men in my own class i rather take them in an elementary class and pass them to a master in a higher class but i have the greatest delight in the progress which these men have made so far as i have seen it and i have not the least doubt that great things will be done with respect to them  chairman will you state precisely what position you holdi am master of the elementary

ruskin as stated above is reprinted from the report of the national gallery site commission london harrison and sons 1857 pp 927 questions 23922504 the commission consisted of lord broughton chairman dean milman professor faraday mr cockerell ra and mr george richmond all of whom were present on the occasion of mr ruskin giving his evidenceed     picture galleriestheir functions and formation  select committee on public institutions2  evidence of john ruskin tuesday march 20 1860   139 chairman i believe you have a general acquaintance with the leading museums picture galleries and institutions in this metropolisyes i know them well  and especially the picturesyes  i believe you have also taken much interest in the working mens collegeyes much interest i have been occupied there as a master for about five years  i believe you conduct a class on two days in the weekon one day of the week only  you have given a great deal of gratuitous instruction to the working classesnot so much to the working classes as to the class which especially attends the lectures on drawing but which of course is connected with the working classes and through which i know something about them  140 you are probably able to speak with reference to the hours at which it would be most convenient that these institutions should be opened to the working classes so that they might enjoy themat all events i can form some opinion about it  what are the hours which you think would be the most suitable to the working classes or those to whom you have imparted instructionthey would of course have in general no hours but in the evening  do you think the hours which are now found suitable for mechanics institutes would be suitable for them that is from eight till ten or from seven till ten at nightthe earlier the better i should think that being dependent closely upon the other much more important question how you can prepare the workmen for taking advantage of these institutions the question before us as a nation is not i think what opportunities we shall give to the workmen of instruction unless we enable them to receive it and all this is connected closely in my mind with the early closing question and with the more difficult question issuing out of that how far you can get the hours of labor regulated and how far you can get the labor during those hours made not competitive and not oppressive to the workmen  141 have you found that the instruction which you have been enabled to give to the working classes has produced very good results upon them already i ought perhaps hardly to speak of my own particular modes of instruction because their tendency is rather to lead the workman out of his class and i am privately obliged to impress upon my men who come to the working mens college not to learn in the hope of being anything but working men but to learn what may be either advantageous for them in their work or make them happy after their work in my class they are especially tempted to think of rising above their own rank and becoming artistsbecoming something better than workmen and that effect i particularly dread i want all efforts for bettering the workmen to be especially directed in this way supposing that they are to remain in this position forever that they have not capacity to rise above it and that they are to work as coal miners or as iron forgers staying as they are how then you may make them happier and wiser  i should suppose you would admit that the desire to rise out of a class is almost inseparable from the amount of selfimprovement that you would wish to give themi should think not i think that the moment a man desires to rise out of his own class he does his work badly in it he ought to desire to rise in his own class and not out of it  the instruction which you would impart one would suppose would be beneficial to the laborer in the class which he is inyes  142 and that agrees does it not with what has been alleged by many working men that they have found in their competition with foreigners that a knowledge of art has been most beneficial to themquite so  i believe many foreigners are now in competition with working men in the metropolis in matters in which art is involvedi believe there are many and that they are likely still more to increase as the relations between the nations become closer  is it your opinion that the individual workman who now executes works of art in this country is less intellectually fit for his occupation than in former daysvery much so indeed  have you not some proofs of that which you can adduce for the benefit of the committeei can only make an assertion i cannot prove it but i assert it with confidence that no workman whose mind i have examined is at present capable of design in the arts only of imitation and of exquisite manual execution such as is unsurpassable by the work of any time or any country manual execution which however being wholly mechanical is always profitless to the man himself and profitless ultimately to those who possess the work  143 with regard to those institutions in which pictures are exhibited are you satisfied that the utmost facilities are afforded to the public compatibly with the expense which is now incurredi cannot tell how far it would be compatible with the expense but i think that a very little increase of expense might certainly bring about a great increase of convenience  various plans have been suggested by different persons as to an improvement in the national gallery with regard to the area and a better distribution of the picturesyes  are you of opinion that at a very small cost it would be possible to increase the area considerably in the case of the national galleryi have not examined the question with respect to the area of the national gallery it depends of course upon questions of rent and respecting the mode in which the building is now constructed which i have not examined but in general this is true of large buildings that expense wisely directed to giving facilities for seeing the pictures and not to the mere show of the building would always be productive of far more good to the nation and especially to the lower orders of the nation than expense in any other way directed with reference to these institutions  144 some persons have been disposed to doubt whether if the institutions were open at night gas would be found injurious to the pictures would that be your impressioni have no doubt that it would be injurious to the pictures if it came in contact with them it would be a matter of great regret to me that valuable pictures should be so exhibited i have hoped that pictures might be placed in a gallery for the working classes which would interest them much more than the chefsdoeuvre of the great masters and which at the same time would not be a great loss to the nation if destroyed  145 have you had any experience of the working of the evening openings of the south kensington museumno direct experience but my impression is that the workmen at present being compelled to think always of getting as much work done in a day as they can are generally led in these institutions to look to the machinery or to anything which bears upon their trade it therefore is no rest to them it may be sometimes when they are allowed to take their families as they do on certain evenings to the kensington museum that is a great step but the great evil is that the pressure of the work on a mans mind is not removed and that he has not rest enough thorough rest given him by proper explanations of the things he sees he is not led by a large printed explanation beneath the very thing to take a happy and unpainful interest in every subject brought before him he wanders about listlessly and exerts himself to find out things which are not sufficiently explained and gradually he tires of it and he goes back to his home or to his alehouse unless he is a very intelligent man  would you recommend that some person should follow him through the building to explain the detailsno but i would especially recommend that our institutions should be calculated for the help of persons whose minds are languid with labor i find that with ordinary constitutions the labor of a day in england oppresses a man and breaks him down and it is not refreshment to him to use his mind after that but it would be refreshment to him to have anything read to him or any amusing thing told him or to have perfect rest he likes to lie back in his chair at his own fireside and smoke his pipe rather than enter into a political debate and what we want is an extension of our art institutions with interesting things teaching a man and amusing him at the same time above all large printed explanations under every print and every picture and the subjects of the pictures such as they can enjoy  146 have you any other suggestion to offer calculated to enlighten the committee on the subject intrusted to them for considerationi can only say what my own feelings have been as to my men i have found particularly that natural history was delightful to them i think that that has an especial tendency to take their minds off their work which is what i always try to do not ambitiously but reposingly i should like to add to what i said about the danger of injury to chefsdoeuvre that such danger exists not only as to gas but also the breath the variation of temperature the extension of the canvases in a different temperature the extension of the paint upon them and various chemical operations of the human breath the chance of an accidental escape of gas the circulation of variously damp air through the ventilators all these ought not to be allowed to affect the great and unreplaceable works of the best masters and those works i believe are wholly valueless to the working classes their merits are wholly imperceptible except to persons who have given many years of study to endeavor to qualify themselves to discover them but what is wanting for the working man is historical painting of events noble and bearing upon his own country the history of his own country well represented to him the natural history of foreign countries well represented to him and domestic pathos brought before him nothing assists him so much as having the moral disposition developed rather than the intellectual after his work anything that touches his feelings is good and puts new life into him therefore i want modern pictures if possible of that class which would ennoble and refine by their subjects i should like prints of all times engravings of all times those would interest him with their variety of means and subject and natural history of three kinds namely shells birds and plants not minerals because a workman cannot study mineralogy at home but whatever town he may be in he may take some interest in the birds and in the plants or in the sea shells of his own country and coast i should like the commonest of all our plants first and most fully illustrated the commonest of all our birds and of our shells and men would be led to take an interest in those things wholly for their beauty and for their separate charm irrespective of any use that might be made of them in the arts there also ought to be for the more intelligent workman who really wants to advance himself in his business specimens of the manufactures of all countries as far as the compass of such institutions would allow  147 you have traveled i believe a good deal abroadyes  and you have seen in many foreign countries that far more interest is taken in the improvement of the people in this matter than is taken in this countryfar more  do you think that you can trace the good effects which result from that mode of treatmentthe circumstances are so different that i do not feel able to give evidence of any definite effect from such efforts only it stands to reason that it must be so there are so many circumstances at present against us in england that we must not be sanguine as to too speedy an effect i believe that one great reason of the superiority of foreign countries in manufactures is that they have more beautiful things about them continually and it is not possible for a man who is educated in the streets of our manufacturing towns ever to attain that refinement of eye or sense he cannot do it and he is accustomed in his home to endure that which not the less blunts his senses  the committee has been informed that with regard to some of our museums particularly the british museum they are very much overcharged with objects and i apprehend that the same remark would be true as to some of our picture galleries are you of opinion that it would be conducive to the general elevation of the people in this country if our works of art and objects of interest were circulated more expeditiously and more conveniently than at present throughout the various manufacturing districtsi think that all precious works of art ought to be treated with a quite different view and that they ought to be kept together where men whose work is chiefly concerned with art and where the artistically higher classes can take full advantage of them they ought therefore to be all together as in the louvre at paris and as in the uffizii at florence everything being illustrative of other things but kept separate from the collections intended for the working classes which may be as valuable as you choose but they should be usable and above all things so situated that the working classes could get at them easily without keepers to watch what they are about and have their wives and children with them and be able to get at them freely so that they might look at a thing as their own not merely as the nations but as a gift from the nation to them as the working class  you would cultivate a taste at the impressionable ageespecially in the education of children that being just the first question i suppose which lies at the root of all you can do for the workman  148 with regard to the circulation of pictures and such loans of pictures as have heretofore been made in manchester and elsewhere are you of opinion that in certain cases during a part of the year some of our best pictures might be lent for particular periods to particular towns to be restored in the same condition so as to give those towns an opportunity of forming an opinion upon them which otherwise they would not havei would rather keep them all in the metropolis and move them as little as possible when valuable  mr slaney that would not apply to loans by independent gentlemen who were willing to lend their picturesi should be very glad if it were possible to lend pictures and send them about i think it is one of the greatest movements in the nation showing the increasing kindness of the upper classes towards the lower that that has been done but i think nothing can justify the risking of noble pictures by railway for instance that of course is an artists view of the matter but i do not see that the advantage to be gained would at all correspond with the danger of loss which is involved  149 mr hanbury you mentioned that you thought it was very desirable that there should be lectures given to the working classesyes  do you think that the duplicate specimens at the british museum could be made available for lectures on natural history if a part of that institution could be arranged for the purposei should think so but it is a question that i have no right to have an opinion upon only the officers of the institution can say what number of their duplicate specimens they could spare  i put the question to you because i have observed in the british museum that the people took a great interest in the natural history department and upon one occasion a friend of mine stopped and explained some of the objects and at once a very numerous crowd was attracted round him and the officials had to interfere and told him to move onso much more depends upon the explanation than on the thing explained that i believe with very simple collections of very small value but well chosen and exhibited by a thoroughly intelligent lecturer you might interest the lower classes and teach them to any extent  would it be difficult to find such lecturers as you speak ofnot in time perhaps at present it would be because we have got so much in the habit of thinking that science consists in language and in fine words and not in ascertaining the nature of the thing the workman cannot be deceived by fine words he always wants to know something about the thing and its properties many of our lecturers would i have no doubt be puzzled if they were asked to explain the habits of a common bird  150 is there an increasing desire for information and improvement among the working classesa thirsty desire for it in every direction increasing day by day and likely to increase it would grow by what it feeds upon  to what do you attribute this improvementpartly to the healthy and proper efforts which have been made to elevate the working classes partly i am sorry to say to an ambitious desire throughout the nation always to get on to a point which it has not yet reached and which makes one man struggle with another in every way i think that the idea that knowledge is power is at the root of the movement among the working classes much more so than in any other  do you consider that the distance of our public institutions is a great hindrance to the working classesvery great indeed  you would therefore probably consider it a boon if another institution such as the british museum could be established in the eastern end of the metropolisi should be most thankful to see it especially there  151 mr slaney i think you stated that you considered that for the working classes it is a great thing to have relaxation of mind after the close occupation of the day that they would embrace an opportunity of attending popular lectures on branches of natural history which they could comprehend if they were given to them in plain and simple languageyes  for instance if you were to give a popular lecture upon british birds giving them an explanation of the habits of the various birds assisted by tolerably good plates or figures describing the different habits of migration of those that come to us in spring remain during the summer and depart in the autumn to distant countries of those which come in the autumn remain during the winter and then leave us of those which charm us with their song and benefit us in various ways do you think that such a lecture would be acceptable to the working classesit would be just what they would enjoy the most and what would do them the most good  do you not think that such lectures might be given without any very great cost by finding persons who would endeavor to make the subjects plain and pleasant not requiring a very expensive apparatus either of figures or of birds but which might be pointed out to them and explained to them from time to timeno i think that no such lectures would be of use unless a permanent means of quiet study were given to the men between times as far as i know lectures are always entirely useless except as a matter of amusement unless some opportunity be afforded of accurate intermediate study and although i should deprecate the idea on the one side of giving the chefsdoeuvre of the highest masters to the workman for his daily experiments so i should deprecate on the other the idea of any economy if i saw a definite plan of helping a man in his own times of quiet study  152 there are some popular works on british birds which the men might be referred to containing accounts of the birds and their habits which might be referred to subsequentlyyes  there are several works relating to british birds which are very beautifully illustrated and to those they might be referred do you not think that something might also be done with regard to popular lectures upon british plants and particularly those which are perhaps the most common and only neglected because of their being common that you might point out to them the different soils in which they grow so that they might be able to make excursions to see them in their wild statemy wish is that in every large manufacturing town there should be a perfect collection at all events of the principal genera of british plants and birds thoroughly well arranged and a library associated with it containing the best illustrative works on the subject and that from time to time lectures should be given by the leading scientific men which i am sure they would be willing to give if such collections were opened to them  i dare say you know that there is one book upon british birds which was compiled by a gentleman who was in trade and lived at the corner of st jamess street for many years which is prized by all who are devoted to that study and which would be easily obtained for the working men do you not think that this would relax their minds and be beneficial to them in many ways especially if they were able to follow up the studyyes in every way  as to plants might not they interest their wives as welli quite believe so  if such things could be done by subscription in the vicinity of large towns such as manchester would they not be very much responded to by the grateful feelings of the humbler people who themselves would subscribe probably some triflei think they would be grateful however it were done but i should like it to be done as an expression of the sense of the nation as doing its duty towards the workmen rather than it should be done as a kind of charity by private subscription  153 sir robert peel you have been five years connected with the working mens collegeyes i think about that time  is the attendance good therethere is a fair attendance i believe  of the working classesyes in the other lecturerooms not much in mine  do they go there as they please without going beforehand for ticketsthey pass through an introductory examination which is not severe in any way but merely shows that they are able to take advantage of the classes there of course they pay a certain sum which is not at all at present i believe supporting to the college for every class just to insure their paying attention to it  you stated that you did not think lectures would be of any use unless there was what you called active intermediate studyi think not  what did you mean by active intermediate study if a man is working every day of the week until saturday afternoon how could that take placei think that you could not at all provide lectures once or twice a week at the institutions throughout the kingdom by intermediate study i mean merely that a man should have about him when he came into the room things that shall tempt him to look at them and get interested in say in one bird or in one plant  while the lecture was going onno that might be given once a fortnight or once a month but that this intermediate attention should be just that which a man is delighted to give to a single plant which he cultivates in his own garden or a single bird which he may happen to have obtained the best of all modes of study  154 you are in favor of the early closing associationi will not say that i am because i have not examined their principles i want to have our labor regulated so that it shall be impossible for men to be so entirely crushed in mind and in body as they are by the system of competition  you stated that you would wish the hours during which they would be able to enjoy the institutions to be as early as possibleyes certainly  but it would be impossible to have them earlier than they are now on account of the organization of labor in the countryi do not know what is possible i do not know what the number of hours necessary for labor will ultimately be found to be  still you are of opinion that if there was a halfholiday on the saturday it would be an advantage to the working classes and enable them to visit and enjoy these institutionscertainly  155 you observed i think that there was a thirsty desire on the part of the working classes for improvementcertainly  and you also stated that there was a desire on their part to rise in that class but not out of iti did not say that they wanted to rise in that class they wish to emerge from it they wish to become something better than workmen and i want to keep them in that class i want to teach every man to rest contented in his station and i want all people in all stations to better and help each other as much as they can  but you never saw a man did you who was contentedyes i have seen several nearly all the very good workmen are contented i find that it is only the secondrate workmen who are discontented  156 surely competition with foreigners is a great advantage to the working classes of this countryno  it has been stated that competition is an immense advantage in the extension of artistic knowledge among the people of this country who are rapidly stepping on the heels of foreignersan acquaintance with what foreign nations have accomplished may be very useful to our workmen but a spirit of competition with foreign nations is useful to no one  will you be good enough to state whyevery nation has the power of producing a certain number of objects of art or of manufacturing productions which are peculiar to it and which it can produce thoroughly well and when that is rightly understood every nation will strive to do its own work as well as it can be done and will desire to be supplied by other nations with that which they can produce for example if we tried here in england to produce silk we might possibly grow unhealthy mulberry trees and bring up unhealthy silkworms but not produce good silk it may be a question how far we should compete with foreigners in matters of taste i think it doubtful even in that view that we should ever compete with them thoroughly i find evidence in past art that the french have always had a gift of color which the english never had  157 you stated that you thought that at very little expense the advantages to be derived from our national institutions might be greatly increased will you state why you think very little expense would be necessary and how it should be doneby extending the space primarily and by adding very cheap but completely illustrative works by making all that such institutions contain thoroughly accessible and giving as i think i have said before explanations especially in a visible form beside the thing to be illustrated not in a separate form  but that only would apply to daytimeto nighttime as well  but would you not have to introduce a system of lightingyes a system of lighting i should only regret as applied to the great works of art i should think that the brightest system of lighting should be applied especially of an evening so that such places should be made delightful to the workman and withdraw him from the alehouse and all other evil temptation but i want them rather to be occupied by simple and more or less cheap collections than by the valuable ones for fear of fire  if at the british museum they had printed information upon natural history that you think would do great goodyes  158 you stated that you thought there was far more interest taken in foreign countries in the intellectual development of the working classes than in englandi answered that question rather rashly i hardly ever see anything of society in foreign countries and i was thinking at the time of the great efforts now being made in france and of the general comfort of the institutions that are open  not politicalno  still you think that there is more interest taken in the intellectual development of the working classes in foreign countries than in englandi think so but i do not trust my own opinion  i have lived abroad and i have remarked that there is a natural facility in the french people for instance in acquiring a knowledge of art and of combination of colors but i never saw more but far less desire or interest taken in the working classes than in englandas far as relates to their intellectual development i say yes but i think there is a greater disposition to make them happy and allow them to enjoy their happiness in ordinary associations at fêtes and everything of that kind that is amusing or recreative to them  but that is only on sundaysno on all fête days and throughout i think you see the working man with his wife happier in the gardens or in the suburbs of a town and on the whole in a happier state there is less desire to get as much out of him for the money as they can less of that desire to oppress him and to use him as a machine than there is in england but observe i do not lean upon that point and i do not quite see how that bears upon the question because whatever interest there may be in foreign countries or in ours it is not as much as it should be in either  but you were throwing a slur upon the character of the upper classes in this country by insinuating that abroad a great deal more interest was taken in the working classes than in england now i assert that quite the contrary is the facti should be very sorry to express all the feelings that i have respecting the relations between the upper classes and the working classes in this country it is a subject which cannot at present be discussed and one upon which i would decline any further examination  159 you stated that the working men were not so happy in this country as they were abroad pursuing the same occupationsi should think certainly not  you have been in switzerlandyes  and at zurichnot lately  that is the seat of a great linen manufacturei have never examined the manufactures there nor have i looked at switzerland as a manufacturing country  but you stated that there was much more interest taken in the intellectual developments of the working classes in foreign countries than in englandyes but i was not thinking of switzerland or of zurich i was thinking of france and i was thinking of the working classes generally not specially the manufacturing working classes i used the words working classes generally  then do you withdraw the expression that you made use of that in foreign countries the upper classes take more interest in the condition of the working classes than they do in englandi do not withdraw it i only said that it was my impression  but you cannot establish itno  therefore it is merely a matter of individual impressionentirely so  you said i think that abroad the people enjoy their public institutions better because inspectors do not follow them abouti did not say so i was asked the question whether i thought teaching should be given by persons accompanying the workman about and i said certainly not i would rather leave him to himself with such information as could be given to him by printed documents  160 mr sclater booth with regard to the national gallery are you aware that there is great pressure and want of space there now both with regard to the room for hanging pictures and also with reference to the crowds of persons who frequent the national galleryi am quite sure that if there is not great pressure there will be soon owing to the number of pictures which are being bought continually  do you not think that an extension of the space in the national gallery is a primary consideration which ought to take precedence of any improvement that might be made in the rooms as they are with a view to opening them of an eveningmost certainly  that is the first thing you think that ought to be donemost certainly  when you give your lectures at the working mens college is it your habit to refer to special pictures in the national gallery or to special works of art in the british museumnever i try to keep whatever instruction i give bearing upon what is easily accessible to the workman or what he can see at the moment i do not count upon his having time to go to these institutions i like to put the thing in his hand and have it about  has it never been a stumblingblock in your path that you have found a workman unable to compare your lectures with any illustrations that you may have referred him toi have never prepared my lectures with a view to illustrate them by the works of the great masters  161 you spoke and very justly of the importance of fixing on works of art printed explanations are you not aware that that has been done to some extent at the kensington museumyes  do you not think that a great part of the popularity of that institution is owing to that circumstancei think so certainly  on the whole i gather from your evidence that you are not very sanguine as to the beneficial results that would arise from the opening of the british museum and the national gallery of an evening as those institutions are at present constituted from a want of space and the crowding of the objects therewhatever the results might be from opening them as at present constituted i think better results might be attained by preparing institutions for the workman himself alone  do you think that museums of birds and plants established in various parts of the metropolis illustrated and furnished with pictures of domestic interest and possibly with specimens of manufactures would be more desirable considering the mode in which the large institutions are now seeni think in these great institutions attention ought specially to be paid to giving perfect security to all the works and objects of art which they possess and to giving convenience to the thorough student whose business lies with those museums and that collections for the amusement and improvement of the working classes ought to be entirely separate  if such institutions as i have described were to be established you would of course desire that they should be opened of an evening and be specially arranged with a view to evening exhibitioncertainly  it has been stated that the taxpayer has a right to have these exhibitions opened at hours when the workpeople can go to them they being taxpayers do not you think that the real interest of the taxpayer is first to have the pictures as carefully preserved as possible and secondly that they should be accessible to those whose special occupation in life is concerned in their studymost certainly  is not the interest of the taxpayer reached in this way rather than by any special opportunity being given of visiting at particular hoursmost certainly  162 mr kinnaird have you ever turned your attention to any peculiar localities where museums of paintings and shells and of birds and plants might be opened for the purpose referred tonever i have never examined the subject  has it ever occurred to you that the vestry halls which have recently been erected and which are lighted might be so appropriatedno i have never considered the subject at all  supposing that suitable premises could be found do you not think that many people would contribute modern paintings and engravings and various other objects of interesti think it is most probable in fact i should say certain  you would view such an attempt with great favoryes with great delight indeed  you rather look upon it as the duty of the government to provide such institutions for the peoplei feel that very strongly indeed  do you not think that the plan which has been adopted at versailles of having modern history illustrated by paintings would prove of great interest to the peoplei should think it would be an admirable plan in every way  and a very legitimate step to be taken by the government for the purpose of encouraging art in that waymost truly  would it have do you think an effect in encouraging art in this countryi should think so certainly  whose duty would you consider it to be to superintend the formation of such collections are there any government officers who are at present capable of organizing a staff for employment in local museums that you are aware ofi do not know i have not examined that subject at all  163 chairman the committee would like to understand you more definitely upon the point that has been referred to as to foreigners and englishmen i presume that what you wished the committee to understand was that upon the whole so far as you have observed more facilities are in point of fact afforded to the working classes in some way or other abroad than in this country for seeing pictures and visiting public institutionsmy answer referred especially to the aspect of the working classes as i have watched them in their times of recreation i see them associated with the upper classes more happily for themselves i see them walking through the louvre and walking through the gardens of all the great cities of europe and apparently less ashamed of themselves and more happily combined with all the upper classes of society than they are here here our workmen somehow are always miserably dressed and they always keep out of the way both at such institutions and at church the temper abroad seems to be while there is a sterner separation and a more aristocratic feeling between the upper and the lower classes yet just on that account the workman confesses himself for a workman and is treated with affection i do not say workmen merely but the lower classes generally are treated with affection and familiarity and sympathy by the master or employer which has to me often been very touching in separate eases and that impression being on my mind i answered not considering that the question was of any importance hastily and i am not at present prepared to say how far i could by thinking justify that impression  164 mr kinnaird in your experience in the last few years have you not seen a very marked improvement in the working classes in this country in every respect to which you have alluded take the last twenty years or since you have turned your attention that wayi have no evidence before me in england of that improvement because i think that the struggle for existence becomes every day more severe and that while greater efforts are made to help the workman the principles on which our commerce is conducted are every day oppressing him and sinking him deeper  have you ever visited the manufacturing districts of lancashire and yorkshire with a view of ascertaining the state of the people therenot with a definite view my own work has nothing to do with those subjects and it is only incidentally because i gratuitously give such instruction as i am able to give at the working mens college that i am able to give you any facts on this subject all the rest that i can give is as sir robert peel accurately expressed it nothing but personal impression  you admit that the working mens college is after all a very limited spherea very limited sphere  165 sir robert peel you have stated that in the louvre a working man looks at the pictures with a greater degree of selfrespect than the same classes do in the national gallery herei think so  you surely never saw a man of the upper class in england scorn at a working man because he appeared in his working dress in the national gallery in londoni have certainly seen working men apprehensive of such scorn  chairman is it not the fact that the upper and lower classes scarcely ever meet on the same occasionsi think if possible they do not  is it not the fact that the laboring classes almost invariably cease labor at such hours as would prevent them from going to see pictures at the time when the upper classes do goi meant before to signify assent to your question that they do not meet if it can be avoided  sir robert peel take the crystal palace as an example do not working men and all classes meet there together and did you ever see a working man gêné in the examination of works of arti am sure that a working man very often would not go where he would like to go  but you think he would abroadi think they would go abroad i only say that i believe such is the fact  mr slaney do not you think that the lighthearted temperament of our southern neighbors and the fineness of the climate which permits them to enjoy themselves more in the open air has something to do with iti hope that the old name of merry england may be recovered one of these days i do not think that it is in the disposition of the inhabitants to be in the least duller than other people  sir robert peel when was that designation losti am afraid ever since our manufactures have prospered  chairman referring to the crystal palace do you think that that was an appropriate instance to put considering the working man pays for his own and is not ashamed to enjoy his own for his own moneyi have never examined the causes of the feeling it did not appear to me to be a matter of great importance what was the state of feeling in foreign countries i felt that it depended upon so many circumstances that i thought it would be a waste of time to trace it  166 sir robert peel you stated that abroad the working classes were much better dressedyes  do you think soyes  surely they cannot be better dressed than they are in england for you hardly know a working man here from an aristocratit is precisely because i do know working men on a sunday and every other day of the week from an aristocrat that i like their dress better in france it is the ordinary dress belonging to their position and it expresses momentarily what they are it is the blue blouse which hangs freely over their frames keeping them sufficiently protected from cold and dust but here it is a shirt open at the collar very dirty very much torn with ragged hair and a ragged coat and altogether a dress of misery  you think that they are better dressed abroad because they wear a blousebecause they wear a costume appropriate to their work  are you aware that they make it an invariable custom to leave off the blouse on sundays and on holidays and that after they have finished their work they take off their blousei am not familiar nor do i profess to be familiar with the customs of the continent i am only stating my impressions but i like especially their habit of wearing a national costume i believe the national costume of work in switzerland to be at the root of what prosperity switzerland yet is retaining i think for instance although it may sound rather singular to say so that the pride which the women take in their clean chemise sleeves is one of the healthiest things in switzerland and that it is operative in every way on the health of the mind and the body their keeping their costume pure fresh and beautiful  you stated that the working classes were better dressed abroad than in englandas far as i know that is certainly the fact  still their better dress consists of a blouse which they take off when they have finished their worki bow to your better knowledge of the matter  chairman are you aware that a considerable number of the working classes are in bed on the sundayperhaps it is the best place for them  167 mr kinnaird you trace the deterioration in the condition of the working classes to the increase of trade and manufactures in this countryto the increase of competitive trades and manufactures  it is your conviction that we may look upon this vast extension of trade and commerce and competition altogether as an evilnot on the vast extension of trade but on the vast extension of the struggle of man with man instead of the principle of help of man by man  chairman i understood you to say that you did not object to trade but that you wished each country to produce that which it was best fitted to produce with a view to an interchange of its commodities with those of other countriesyes  you did not intend to cast a slur upon the idea of competitionyes very distinctly i intended not only to cast a slur but to express my excessive horror of the principle of competition in every way for instance we ought not to try to grow claret here nor to produce silk we ought to produce coal and iron and the french should give us wine and silk  you say that with a view to an interchange of such commoditiesyes  each country producing that which it is best fitted to produceyes as well as it can not striving to imitate or compete with the productions of other countries finally i believe that the way of ascertaining what ought to be done for the workman in any position is for any one of us to suppose that he was our own son and that he was left without any parents and without any help that there was no chance of his ever emerging out of the state in which he was and then that what we should each of us like to be done for our son so left we should strive to do for the workman       the following analysis of the above evidence was

printed 27 march 1860 pp 113123 the following members of the committee were present on the occasion of the above evidence being given sir john trelawny chairman mr sclater booth mr du pre mr kinnaird mr hanbury sir robert peel mr slaney and mr john tollemacheed     picture galleriestheir functions and formation  the royal academy commission3  evidence of john ruskin monday june 8th 1863   168 chairman you have no doubt frequently considered the position of the royal academy in this countryyes  is it in all points satisfactory to youno certainly not  do you approve for example of the plan by which on a vacancy occurring the royal academicians supply that vacancy or would you wish to see that election confided to any other handsi should wish to see the election confided to other hands i think that all elections are liable to mistake or mischance when the electing body elect the candidate into them i rather think that elections are only successful where the candidate is elected into a body other than the body of electors but i have not considered the principles of election fully enough to be able to give any positive statement of opinion upon that matter i only feel that at present the thing is liable to many errors and mischances  does it not seem however that there are some precedents such for example as the institute of france in which the body electing to the vacancies that occur within it keeps up a very high character and enjoys a great reputationthere are many such precedents and as every such body for its own honor must sometimes call upon the most intellectual men of the country to join it i should think that every such body must retain a high character where the country itself has a proper sense of the worth of its best men but the system of election may be wrong though the sense of the country may be right and i think in appealing to a precedent to justify a system we should estimate properly what has been brought about by the feeling of the country we are all i fancy too much in the habit of looking to forms as the cause of what really is caused by the temper of the nation at the particular time working through the forms for good or evil  if however the election of academicians were to be confided to artists who were not already academicians themselves would it be easy to meet this objection that they would have in many cases a personal interest in the question that each might be striving for his own admission to that distinction whereas when the election takes place among those who have already attained that distinction direct personal interest at all events is absenti should think personal interest would act in a certain sense in either case it would branch into too many subtleties of interest to say in what way it would act i should think that it would be more important to the inferior body to decide rightly upon those who were to govern them than to the superior body to decide upon those who were to govern other people and that the superior body would therefore generally choose those who were likely to be pleasant to themselvespleasant either as companions or in carrying out a system which they chose for their own convenience to adopt while the inferior body would choose men likely to carry out the system that would tend most to the general progress of art  169 as i understand you though you have a decided opinion that it would be better for some other constituent body to elect the members of the royal academy you have not a decided opinion as to how that constituent body would best be composedby no means  i presume you would wish that constituent body to consist of artists though you are not prepared to say precisely how they should be selectedi should like the constituent body to consist both of artists and of the public i feel great difficulties in offering any suggestion as to the manner in which the electors should elect but i should like the public as well as artists to have a voice so that we might have the public feeling brought to bear upon painting as we have now upon music and that the election of those who were to attract the public eye or direct the public mind should indicate also the will of the public in some respects not that i think that will always wise but i think you would then have pointed out in what way those who are teaching the public should best regulate the teaching and also it would give the public itself an interest in art and a sense of responsibility which in the present state of things they never can have  will you explain more fully the precedent of music to which you have just advertedthe fame of any great singer or any great musician depends upon the public enthusiasm and feeling respecting him no royal academy can draw a large audience to the opera by stating that such and such a piece of music is good or that such and such a voice is clear if the public do not feel the voice to be delicious and if they do not like the music they will not go to hear it the fame of the musician whether singer instrumentalist or composer is founded mainly upon his having produced a strong effect upon the public intellect and imagination i should like that same effect to be produced by painters and to be expressed by the public enthusiasm and approbation not merely by expressions of approbation in conversation but by the actual voice which in the theater is given by the shout and by the clapping of the hands you cannot clap a picture nor clap a painter at his work but i should like the public in some way to bring their voice to bear upon the painters work  170 have you formed any opinion upon the position of the associates in the royal academyi have thought of it a little but the present system of the academy is to me so entirely nugatory it produces so little effect in any way what little effect it does produce being in my opinion mischievous that it has never interested me and i have felt the difficulty so greatly that i never till your lordships letter reached me paid much attention to it i always thought it would be a waste of time to give much time to thinking how it might be altered so that as to the position of associates i can say little except that i think in any case there ought to be some period of probation and some advanced scale of dignity indicative of the highest attainments in art which should be only given to the oldest and most practiced painters  from the great knowledge which you possess of british art looking to the most eminent painters sculptors and architects at this time should you say that the number of the royal academy is sufficient fully to represent them or would you recommend an increase in the present number of academiciansi have not considered in what proportion the academicianships at present exist that is rather a question bearing upon the degree of dignity which one would be glad to confer i should like the highest dignity to be limited but i should like the inferior dignity corresponding to the associateship to be given as the degrees are given in the universities without any limitation of number to those possessing positive attainments and skill i should think a very limited number of academicianships would always meet all the requirements of the highest intellect of the country  171 have you formed any opinion upon the expediency of intrusting laymen with some share in the management of the affairs of the academyno i have formed no opinion upon that matter i do not know what there is at present to be managed in the academy i should think if the academy is to become an available school laymen cannot be joined in the management of that particular department in matters of revenue and in matters concerning the general interests and dignity of the academy they might be  should you think that nonprofessional persons would be fitly associated with artists in such questions as the selection and hanging of the pictures sent in for exhibitionno i think not  some persons have suggested that the president of the academy should not always nor of necessity be himself an artist should you approve of any system by which a gentleman of high social position not an artist was placed at the head of such a body as the academyof such a body as the academy if i may be permitted to repeat your words must of course have reference to the constitution to be given to it as at present constituted i do not know what advantage might or might not be derived from such a gentleman being appointed president as i should like to see it constituted i think he ought to be an artist only  172 have you had any reason to observe or to make yourself acquainted with the working of the schools of the royal academyyes i have observed it i have not made myself acquainted with the actual methods of teaching at present in use but i know the general effect upon the art of the country  what should you say was that effectnearly nugatory exceedingly painful in this respect that the teaching of the academy separates as the whole idea of the country separates the notion of arteducation from other education and when you have made that one fundamental mistake all others follow you teach a young man to manage his chalk and his brushnot always thatbut having done that you suppose you have made a painter of him whereas to educate a painter is the same thing as to educate a clergyman or a physicianyou must give him a liberal education primarily and that must be connected with the kind of learning peculiarly fit for his profession that error is partly owing to our excessively vulgar and excessively shallow english idea that the artists profession is not and cannot be a liberal one we respect a physician and call him a gentleman because he can give us a purge and clean out our stomachs but we do not call an artist a gentleman whom we expect to invent for us the face of christ when we have made that primary mistake all other mistakes in education are trivial in comparison the very notion of an art academy should be a body of teachers of the youth who are to be the guides of the nation through its senses and that is a very important means of guiding it we have done a good deal through dinners but we may some day do a good deal more through pictures  you would have a more comprehensive system of teachingmuch more comprehensive  173 do i rightly understand you that you would wish it to embrace branches of liberal education in general and not be merely confined to specific artistic studiescertainly i would have the academy education corresponding wholly to the university education the schools of the country ought to teach the boy the first conditions of manipulation he should come up i say not at what age but probably at about fourteen or fifteen to the central university of art wherever that was established and then while he was taught to paint and to carve and to work in metaljust as in old times he would have been taught to manage the sword and lance they being the principal business of his lifeduring the years from fifteen to twenty the chief attention of his governors should be to make a gentleman of him in the highest sense and to give him an exceedingly broad and liberal education which should enable him not only to work nobly but to conceive nobly  174 as to the point however of artistic manipulation is not it the fact that many great painters have differed and do differ from each other and would it therefore be easy for the academy to adopt any authoritative system of teaching excluding one mode and acknowledging anothernot easy but very necessary there have been many methods but there has never been a case of a great school which did not fix upon its method and there has been no case of a thoroughly great school which did not fix upon the right method as far as circumstances enabled it to do so the meaning of a successful school is that it has adopted a method which it teaches to its young painters so that right working becomes a habit with them so that with no thought and no effort and no torment and no talk about it they have the habit of doing what their school teaches them  you do not think a system is equally good which leaves to each eminent professor according to the bent of his genius or the result of his experience to instruct young men the instruction varying with the character of each professorgreat benefit would arise if each professor founded his own school and were interested in his own pupils but as has been sufficiently illustrated in the schools of domenichino and guido there is apt to arise rivalry between the masters with no correlative advantages unless the masters are all of one mind and the only successful idea of an academy has been where the practice was consistent and where there was no contradiction considering the knowledge we now have and the means we now have of comparing all the works of the greatest painters though as you suggest by your question it is not easy to adopt an authoritative system yet it is perfectly possible let us get at the best method and let us teach that there is unquestionably a best way if we can find it and we have now in england the means of finding it out  the teaching in the academy is now under all circumstances gratuitous would you wish that system to continue or should you prefer to see a system of paymenti am not prepared to answer that question it would depend upon the sort of system that was adopted and on the kind of persons you received into your schools  175 i presume you would say that in artistic teaching there are some points on which there would be common ground and others upon which there must be specific teaching for instance in sculpture and painting there is a point up to which the proportions of the human figure have to be studied but afterwards there is a divergence between the two arts of chiseling marble and laying colors on the canvascertainly i should think all that might be arranged in an academy system very simply you would have first your teaching of drawing with the soft point and associated with that chiaroscuro you would then have the teaching of drawing with the hard or black point involving the teaching of the best system of engraving and all that was necessary to form your school of engravers you would then proceed to metal work and on working in metal you would found your school of sculpture and on that your school of architecture and finally and above all you would have your school of painting including oil painting and fresco painting and all painting in permanent material not comprising painting in any material that was not permanent and with that you would associate your school of chemistry which should teach what was permanent and what was not which school of chemistry should declare authoritatively with the academys seal what colors would stand and what process would secure their standing and should have a sort of apothecaries hall where anybody who required them could procure colors in the purest state all these things being organized in one great system and only possibly right by their connection and in their connection  176 do you approve of the encouragement which of late years has been given to fresco painting and do you look forward to much extension of that branch of art in englandi found when i was examining the term fresco painting that it was a wide one that none of us seemed to know quite the limitation or extent of it and after giving a good deal more time to the question i am still less able to answer distinctly on an understanding of the term fresco painting but using the term decorative painting applicable to walls in permanent materials i think it essential that every great school should include as one of its main objects the teaching of wall painting in permanent materials and on a large scale  you think it should form a branch of the system of teaching in the academyi think it should form a branch of the teaching in the academy possibly the principal branch  does it so far as you know form a separate branch of teaching in any of the foreign academiesi do not know  177 looking generally and of course without mentioning any names have you in the course of the last few years been generally satisfied with the selection of artists into the royal academyno certainly not  do you think that some artists of merit have been excluded or that artists whom you think not deserving of that honor have been electedmore that artists not deserving of the honor have been elected i think it does no harm to any promising artist to be left out of the academy but it does harm to the public sometimes that an unpromising artist should be let into it  you think there have been cases within the last few years in which persons in your judgment not entitled to that distinction have nevertheless been electedcertainly  178 with respect to the selection of pictures for the exhibition are you satisfied in general with that selection or have you in particular instances seen ground to think that it has been injudiciously exercisedin some cases it has been injudiciously exercised but it is a matter of small importance it causes heartburning probably but little more if a rejected picture is good the public will see it some day or other and find out that it is a good picture i care little about what pictures are let in or not but i do care about seeing the pictures that are let in the main point which everyone would desire to see determined is how the pictures that are admitted are to be best seen no picture deserving of being seen at all should be so hung as to give you any pain or fatigue in seeing it if you let a picture into the room at all it should not be hung so high as that either the feelings of the artist or the neck of the public should be hurt  179 viscount hardinge i gather from your evidence that you would wish to see the royal academy a sort of central university to which young men from other institutions should be sent assuming that there were difficulties in the way of carrying that out do you think under the present system you could exact from young men who are candidates for admission into the royal academy some educational testcertainly i think much depends upon that if the system of education which i have been endeavoring to point out were adopted you would have in every one of those professions very practiced workmen you could not have any of this education carried out unless you had thoroughly practiced workmen and you should fix your pass as you fix your university pass and you should pass a man in architecture sculpture and painting because he knows his business and knows as much of any other science as is necessary for his profession you require a piece of work from him and you examine him and then you pass himcall him whatever you likebut you say to the public here is a workman in this branch who will do your work well  you do not think there would in such a system be any risk of excluding men who might hereafter be great men who under such a system might not be able to passthere are risks in every system but i think every man worth anything would pass a great many who would be good for nothing would pass but your really great man would assuredly pass  180 has it ever struck you that it would be advantageous to art if there were at the universities professors of art who might give lectures and give instruction to young men who might desire to avail themselves of it as you have lectures on botany and geologyyes assuredly the want of interest on the part of the upper classes in art has been very much at the bottom of the abuses which have crept into all systems of education connected with it if the upper classes could only be interested in it by being led into it when young a great improvement might be looked for therefore i feel the expediency of such an addition to the education of our universities  181 is not that want of refinement which may be observed in many of the pictures from time to time exhibited in the royal academy to be attributed in a great measure to the want of education amongst artistsit is to be attributed to that and to the necessity which artists are under of addressing a low class of spectators an artist to live must catch the public eye our upper classes supply a very small amount of patronage to artists at present their main patronage being from the manufacturing districts and from the public interested in engravingsan exceedingly wide sphere but a low sphereand you catch the eye of that class much more by pictures having reference to their amusements than by any noble subject better treated and the better treated it was the less it would interest that class  is it not often the case that pictures exhibiting such a want of refinement at the same time fetch large prices amongst what i may call the mercantile patrons of artcertainly and the larger the price the more harm done of course to the school for that is a form of education you cannot resist plato said long ago when you have your demagogue against you no human form of education can resist that  182 sir e head what is your opinion of the present mode of teaching in the life school and the painting school namely by visitors constantly changingi should think it mischievous the unfortunate youths i should imagine would just get what they could pick up it would be throwing them crumbs very much as you throw bones to the animals in the zoological gardens  do you conceive that anything which can be properly called a school is likely to be formed where the teaching is conducted in that wayassuredly not  183 you stated that in the event of the introduction of lay members into the academy you would not think it desirable that they should take part in the selection or hanging of pictures for exhibition is not there a great distinction between the selection of the pictures and the hanging of the pictures and might not they take part in the one without taking part in the otheri should think hardly my notion of hanging a picture is to put it low enough to be seen if small it should be placed near the eye anybody can hang a picture but the question should be is there good painting enough in this picture to make it acceptable to the public or to make it just to the artist to show it and none but artists can quite judge of the workmanship which should entitle it to enter the academy  do you think it depends solely upon the workmanshipnot by any means solely but i think that is the first point that should be looked to an illworked picture ought not to be admitted let it be exhibited elsewhere if you will but your academy has no business to let bad work pass if a man cannot carve or paint though his work may be well conceived do not let his work pass unless you require good work in your academy exhibition you can form no school  mr reeve applying the rule you have just laid down would the effect be to exclude a considerable proportion of the works now exhibited in the academyyes more of the academicians than of others  sir e head selection now being made by technical artistsno  professionalyes  lord elcho do you think that none but professional artists are capable of judging of the actual merit or demerit of a paintingnonprofessional persons may offer a very strong opinion upon the subject which may happen to be rightor which may be wrong  your opinion is that the main thing with respect to the exhibition is that the pictures should be seen that they should not be hung too high or too low that question has been already raised before the commission and it has been suggested that two feet from the ground should be the minimum height for the base of the picture and some witnesses have said that six feet and others eight feet should be the maximum height for the base of the picture what limit would you fixi should say that the horizontal line in the perspective of the picture ought always to be opposite the spectators eye no matter what the height may be from the floor if the horizontal line is so placed that it must be above the spectators eye in consequence of the size of the picture it cannot be helped but i would always get the horizontal line opposite the eye if possible  184 chairman should you concur in the suggestion which a witness has made before this commission that it would be an improvement if the space admitted of it that works of sculpture should be intermixed in the same apartment with works of painting instead of being kept as at present in separate apartmentsi should think it would be very delightful to have some works of sculpture mixed with works of painting that it would make the exhibition more pleasing and that the eye would be rested sometimes by turning from the colors to the marble and would see the colors of the paintings better in return sir joshua reynolds mentions the power which some of the flemish pictures seemed to derive in his opinion by looking at them after having consulted his notebook statuary placed among the pictures would have the same effect i would not have the sculpture that was sent in for the exhibition of the year exhibited with the paintings but i would have works of sculpture placed permanently in the painting rooms  lord elcho supposing there were no works of sculpture available for being placed in the rooms permanently and supposing among the works sent in for annual exhibition there were works of a character fit to be placed among the paintings should you see any objection to their being so placedthat would cause an immense amount of useless trouble and perpetual quarrels among the sculptors as to whose works were entitled to be placed in the painting rooms or not  are you aware that in the exhibition in paris in 1855 that was the system adoptedno if the french adopted it it was likely to be useful and doubtless they would carry it out very cleverly but we have not the knack of putting the right things in the right places by any means  did you see our own international exhibition last yearno  are you aware that a similar system was resorted to in the exhibition of pictures therei should think in our exhibitions we must put anything where it would go in the sort of way that we manage them  185 at the present moment there are on the books of the academy five honorary members who hold certain titular offices earl stanhope being antiquary to the academy mr grote being professor of ancient history dean milman being professor of ancient literature the bishop of oxford being chaplain and sir henry holland being secretary for foreign correspondence these professors never deliver any lectures and have no voice whatever in the management but have mere honorary titular distinctions should you think it desirable that gentlemen of their position and character should have a voice in the management of the affairs of the academyit would be much more desirable that they should give lectures upon the subjects with which they are acquainted i should think earl stanhope and all the gentlemen you have mentioned would be much happier in feeling that they were of use in their positions and that if you gave them something to do they would very nobly do it if you give them nothing to do i think they ought not to remain in the institution  186 it has been suggested that the academy now consisting of fortytwo might be increased advantageously to fifty professional members architecture sculpture and painting being fairly represented and that in addition to those fifty there might be elected or nominated somehow or other ten nonprofessional persons that is men taking an interest in art who had a certain position and standing in the country and who might take an active part in the management of the affairs of the institution so tending to bring the royal academy and the public togetheri do not know enough of society to be able to form an opinion upon the subject  irrespective of society as a question of art you know enough of nonprofessional persons interested in art to judge as to whether the infusion of such an element into the academy might be of advantage to the academy and to art generallyi think if you educate our upper classes to take more interest in art which implies of course to know something about it they might be most efficient members of the academy but if you leave them as you leave them now to the education which they get at oxford and cambridge and give them the sort of scorn which all the teaching there tends to give for art and artists the less they have to do with an academy of art the better  assuming that at present you have not a very great number of those persons in the country do you not think that the mere fact of the adoption of such a principle in any reform in the constitution of the academy might have the effect of turning attention more to this matter at the universities and leading to the very thing which you think so desirableno i should think not it would only at present give the impression that the whole system was somewhat artificial and that it was to remain ineffective  notwithstanding the neglect of this matter at the universities do you think at the present moment you could not find ten nonprofessional persons of the character you would think desirable to add to the academyif i may be so impertinent i may say that you as one of the upper classes and i as a layman in the lower classes are tolerably fair examples of the kind of persons who take an interest in art and i think both of us would do a great deal of mischief if we had much to do with the academy  187 assuming those two persons to be appointed lay members will you state in what way you think they would do mischief in the councils of the academywe should be disturbing elements whereas what i should try to secure if i had anything to do with its arrangements would be entire tranquillity a regular system of tuition in which there should be little excitement and little operation of popular aristocratic or any other disturbing influence none of criticism and therefore none of tiresome people like myselfnone of money patronage or even of aristocratic patronage the whole aim of the teachers should be to produce work which could be demonstrably shown to be good and useful and worthy of being bought or used in any way and after that the whole question of patronage and interest should be settled the school should teach its artgrammar thoroughly in everything and in every material and should teach it carefully and that could be done if a perfect system were adopted and above all if a few thoroughly good examples were put before the students that is a point which i think of very great importance i think it very desirable that grants should be made by the government to obtain for the pupils of the academy beautiful examples of every kind the very loveliest and best not too many and that their minds should not be confused by having placed before them examples of all schools and times they are confused enough by what they see in the shops and in the annual exhibitions let engraving be taught by marc antonio and albert dürerpainting by giorgione paul veronese titian and velasquezand sculpture by good greek and selected roman examples and let there be no question of other schools or their merits let those things be shown as good and right and let the student be trained in those principlesif afterwards he strikes out an original path let him but do not let him torment himself and other people with his originalities till he knows what is right so far as is known at present  you are opposed on the whole to the introduction of the lay elementyes but i am not opposed strongly or distinctly to it because i have not knowledge enough of society to know how it would work  your not being in favor of it results from your belief that the lay element that would be useful to the academy does not at present exist in this country but you think if it did exist and if it could be made to grow out of our schools and universities by art teaching it might with advantage to the academy and to artists be introduced into the academyyes  188 supposing the class of royal academicians to be retained and that you had fifty royal academicians should you think it desirable that their works should be exhibited by themselves so that the public might see together the works of those considered to be the first artists of this countrycertainly i should like all pictures to be well seen but i should like one department of the exhibition to be given to the associates or graduates i use that term because i suppose those associates to have a degree given them for a certain amount of excellence and any person who had attained that degree should be allowed to send in so many pictures then the pictures sent in by persons who had attained the higher honor of royal academician should be separately exhibited  that would act as a stimulus to them to keep up their position and show themselves worthy of the honoryes i do not think they ought to be mixed at all as they are now  189 what is your opinion with reference to the present system of traveling studentshipsi think it might be made very useful indeed  on the one hand it has been suggested that there should be as is the system adopted by the french academy a permanent professor at rome to look after the students on the other hand it has been said that it is not desirable if you have those traveling studentships that the students should go to rome that it is better for them to travel and to go to venice or lombardy and to have no fixed school in connection with the academy at rome to which of those two systems do you give the preferencei should prefer the latter if a man goes to travel he ought to travel and not be plagued with schools  it has been suggested that fellowships might be given to rising artists pecuniary assistance being attached to those fellowships the artist being required annually to send in some specimen of his work to show what he was doing but it being left optional with him to go abroad or to work at home should you think that would be desirable or as has been suggested in a letter by mr armitage supposing those fellowships to be established for four years that two of those years should be spent abroad and two at homewithout entering into any detail as to whether two years should be spent abroad and two years at home i feel very strongly that one of the most dangerous and retarding influences you have operating upon art is the enormous power of money and the chances of entirely winning or entirely losing that is of making your fortune in a year by a large taking picture or else starving for ten years by very good small ones the whole life of an artist is a lottery and a very wild lottery and the best artist is liable to be warped away from what he knows is right by the chance of at once making a vast fortune by catching the public eye the public eye being only to be caught by bright colors and certain conditions of art not always desirable if therefore connected with the academy schools there could be the means of giving a fixed amount of income to certain men who would as a consideration for that income furnish a certain number of works that might be agreed upon or undertake any national work that might be agreed upon that i believe would be the healthiest way in which a good painter could be paid to give him his bread and cheese and so much a day and say here are such and such things we want you to do is i believe the healthiest simplest and happiest way in which great work can be produced but whether it is compatible with our present system i cannot say nor whether every man would not run away as soon as he found he could get two or three thousand pounds by painting a catching picture i think your best men would not  you would be in favor of those fellowshipsyes  190 i gather that you are in favor of the encouragement of mural decoration fresco painting and so forth the system that prevails abroad in france for instance is for painters to employ pupils to work under them it was in that way that delaroche painted his hemicycle at the académie des beauxarts employing four pupils who worked for him and who from his small sketch drew the fullsized picture on the walls which was subsequently corrected by him they then colored it up to his sketch after which he shut himself up again and completed it on the other hand if you go to the victoria gallery in the house of lords you find mr maclise at work on a space of wall fortyeight feet long painting the death of nelson on the deck of the victory every figure being life size the deck of the ship and the ropes and everything being the actual size and you see him painting with his own hand each little bit of rope and the minutest detail which of the two systems do you think is the soundest and most calculated to produce great and noble workthe first is the best for the pupils the other is the best for the public but unquestionably not only can a great work be executed as mr maclise is executing his but no really great work was executed otherwise for in all mighty work whether in fresco or oil every touch and hue of color to the last corner has been put on lovingly by the painters own hand not leaving to a pupil to paint so much as a pebble under a horses foot  191 do you believe that most of the works of the great masters in italy were so executedno because the pupils were nearly as mighty as the masters great men took such an interest in their work and they were so modest and simple that they were repeatedly sacrificing themselves to the interests of their religion or of the society they were working for and when a thing was to be done in a certain time it could only be done by bringing in aid but whenever precious work was to be done then the great man said lock me up here by myself give me a little wine and cheese and come in a month and i will show you what i have done  do you think it desirable that the pupils should be so trained as to be capable of assisting great masters in such worksassuredly       notethe following analysis of the above evidence was      given in the index to the report pp 139 140ed       16869 the academy not in all points satisfactory would wish to      see the academicians not selfelectedbut by a constituency      consisting both of artists and the publicpublic influence to be      the same in painting as in music       170 as to the associates is in favor of some period of      probationtheir class to be unlimited with a very limited number      of academicians       171 has formed no opinion on the question of introducing laymen      into the academy in matters of revenue they might be joined with      artists but not in the selection and hanging of pictures opposed      on the whole to their introduction considering the present state      of art educationas he would like to see the academy constituted      thinks the president ought to be an artist       172 general effect of the academys

education       174 not easy but very necessary for the academy to adopt an      authoritative system of teaching       175 his idea of what the academy teaching should be would have a      school of chemistry       176 the teaching of wallpainting in permanent materials should be      a branch possibly the principal branch       177 not satisfied with the selection of artists to be members of      the academy       178 in some cases the selection of pictures has been injudicious      but this a matter of small importance the main point is how the      pictures that are admitted are to be best seen       179 in favor of an educational test for candidates for admission      into the academy       180 and of professors of art at the universities       181 causes of the want of refinement

conveniently it may hang fire till this time next year if you will accept a note on the subject now and then keeping them till there are enough to be worth printing all practical ends may be enough answered and much more quickly  the first function of a museumfor a little while i shall speak of art and natural history as alike cared for in an ideal oneis to give example of perfect order and perfect elegance in the true sense of that test word to the disorderly and rude populace everything in its own place everything looking its best because it is there nothing crowded nothing unnecessary nothing puzzling therefore after a room has been once arranged there must be no change in it for new possessions there must be new rooms and after twenty years absencecoming back to the room in which one learned ones bird or beast alphabet we should be able to show our children the old bird on the old perch in the accustomed corner butfirst of all let the room be beautifully complete ie complete enough for its proper business  193 in the british museum at the top of the stairs we encounter in a terrific alliance a giraffe a hippopotamus and a basking shark the publicyoung and oldpass with a start and a stare and remain as wise as they were before about all the three creatures the day before yesterday i was standing by the big fisha father came up to it with his little boy thats a shark says he it turns on its side when it wants to eat you and so went onliterally as wise as he was before for he had read in a book that sharks turn on their side to bite and he never looked at the ticket which told him this particular shark only ate small fish now he never looked at the ticket because he didnt expect to find anything on it except that this was the sharkogobalus smithjonesianius but if round the walls of the room there had been all the wellknown kinds of shark going down in graduated sizes from that basking one to our waggling dogfish and if every one of these had had a plain english ticket with ten words of common sense on it saying where and how the beast lived and a number unchangeable referring to a properly arranged manual of the shark tribe sold by the museum publisher who ought to have his little shop close by the porters lodge both father and son must have been much below the level of average english man and boy in mother wit if they did not go out of the room by the door in front of them very distinctly andto themselvesamazingly wiser than they had come in by the door behind them  194 if i venture to give instances of fault from the british museum it is because on the whole it is the bestordered and pleasantest institution in all england and the grandest concentration of the means of human knowledge in the world and i am heartily sorry for the breakup of it and augur no good from any changes of arrangement likely to take place in concurrence with kensington where the same day that i had been meditating by the old shark i lost myself in a cretan labyrinth of military ironmongery advertisements of spring blinds model fishfarming and plaster bathing nymphs with a years smut on all the noses of them and had to put myself in charge of a policeman to get out again ever affectionately yours    j ruskin     march 29th 1880    my dear   195 the only chance of my getting these letters themselves into fairly consistent and museumlike order is by writing a word or two always the first thing in the morning till i get them done so i shall at least remember what i was talking of the day before but for the resti must speak of one thing or another as it may come into my head for there are too many to classify without pedantry and loss of time  my requirement of elegance in that last letter contemplates chiefly architecture and fittings these should not only be perfect in stateliness durability and comfort but beautiful to the utmost point consistent with due subordination to the objects displayed to enter a room in the louvre is an education in itself but two steps on the filthy floor and under the iron forks half scaffold half gallows of the big norwood glass bazaar debase mind and eye at once below possibility of looking at anything with profit all the day afterwards i have just heard that a french picture dealer is to have charge of the picture gallery there and that the whole interior is to become virtually a large café whenit is hopedthe glass monster may at last pay concerning which beautiful consummation of mr dickenss fairyland see my pamphlet5 on the opening of the socalled palace be it here at once noted that all idea of any payment in that sense must be utterly and scornfully abjured on the foundation stone of every national or civic museum there must be neither companies to fill their own pockets out of it nor trustees who can cramp the management or interfere with the officering or shorten the supplies of it put one man of reputation and sense at its head give him what staff he asks for and a fixed annual sum for expenditurespecific accounts to be printed annually for all the worlds seeingand let him alone the original expenditure for building and fitting must be magnificent and the current expenditure for cleaning and refitting magnanimous but a certain proportion of this current cost should be covered by small entrance fees exacted not for any miserly helping out of the floorsweepers salaries but for the sake of the visitors themselves that the rooms may not be incumbered by the idle or disgraced by the disreputable you must not make your museum a refuge against either rain or ennui nor let into perfectly wellfurnished and even in the true sense palatial rooms the utterly squalid and illbred portion of the people there should indeed be refuges for the poor from rain and cold and decent rooms accessible to indecent persons if they like to go there but neither of these charities should be part of the function of a civic museum  196 make the entrance fee a silver penny a silver groat typically representing the father mother eldest son and eldest daughter passing always the total number of any one family and every person admitted however young being requested to sign their name or make their mark  that the entrance money should be always of silver is one of the beginnings of education in the placeone of the conditions of its elegance on the very threshold  and the institution of silver for bronze in the lower coinage is a part of the system of national education which i have been teaching these last ten yearsa very much deeper and wider one than any that can be given in museumsand without which all museums will ultimately be vainever affectionately yours    j r  psthere should be a wellserved coffeeroom attached to the building but this part of the establishment without any luxury in furniture or decoration and without any cooking apparatus for carnivora     easter monday 1880    dear   197 the day is auspicious for the beginning of reflection on the right manner of manifestation of all divine things to those who desire to see them for every house of the muses where indeed they live is an interpreters by the wayside or rather a place of oracle and interpretation in one and the right function of every museum to simple persons is the manifestation to them of what is lovely in the life of nature and heroic in the life of men  there are already you see some quaint restrictions in that last sentence whereat sundry of our friends will start and others stop i must stop also myself therefore for a minute or two to insist on them  198 a museum primarily is to be for simple persons children that is to say and peasants for your student your antiquary or your scientific gentleman there must be separate accommodation or they must be sent elsewhere the town museum is to be for the towns people the village museum for the villagers keep that first principle clear to start with if you want to found an academy of painting in littleborough or of literature in squattlesea mere you must get your advice from somebody else not me  199 secondly the museum is to manifest to these simple persons the beauty and life of all things and creatures in their perfectness not their modes of corruption disease or death not even always their genesis in the more or less blundering beginnings of it not even their modes of nourishment if destructive you must not stuff a blackbird pulling up a worm nor exhibit in a glass case a crocodile crunching a baby  neither must you ever show bones or guts or any other charnelhouse stuff teach your children to know the larks note from the nightingales the length of their larynxes is their own business and gods  i cannot enough insist upon this point nor too solemnly if you wish your children to be surgeons send them to surgeons college if jugglers or necromancers to messrs maskelyne and cooke and if butchers to the shambles but if you want them to lead the calm life of country gentlemen and gentlewomen manservants and maidservants let them seek none of deaths secrets till they die ever faithfully and affectionately yours    j r     easter tuesday 1880    dear   200 i must enter today somewhat further on the practical no less than emotional reason for the refusal of anatomical illustrations to the general public  it is difficult enough to get one clear idea into anybody of any single thing but next to impossible to get two clear ideas into them of the same thing we have had lions heads for doorknockers these hundred and fifty years without ever learning so much as what a lions head is like but with good modern stuffing and fetching i can manage now to make a child really understand something about the beasts look and his mane and his sullen eyes and brindled lips but if im bothered at the same time with a big bony box that has neither mane lips nor eyes and have to explain to the poor wretch of a parish schoolboy how somehow this fits on to that i will be bound that at a years end draw one as big as the other and he wont know a lions head from a tigersnor a lions skull from a rabbits nor is it the parish boy only who suffers the scientific people themselves miss half their points from the habit of hacking at things instead of looking at them when i gave my lecture on the swallow6 at oxford i challenged every anatomist there to tell me the use of his tail i believe half of them didnt know he had one not a soul of them could tell me which i knew beforehand but i did not know till i had looked well through their books how they were quarreling about his wings actually at this moment easter tuesday 1880 i dont believe you can find in any scientific book in europe a true account of the way a bird fliesor how a snake serpentines my swallow lecture was the first bit of clear statement on the one point and when i get my snake lecture published you will have the first extant bit of clear statement on the other and that is simply because the anatomists cant for their life look at a thing till they have skinned it  201 and matters get worse and worse every hour yesterday after writing the first leaf of this note i went into the british museum and found a nasty skeleton of a lizard with its under jaw dropped off on the top of a table of butterfliestemporarily of coursebut then everything has been temporary or temporizing at the british museum for the last halfcentury making it always a mere waste and weariness to the general public because forsooth it had always to be kept up to the last meeting of the zoological society and last edition of the times as if there had not been beasts enough before the ark to tell our children the manners of on a sunday afternoon  202 i had gone into the museum that day to see the exact form of a ducks wing the examination of a lively young drakes here at coniston having closed in his giving me such a cut on the wrist with it that i could scarcely write all the morning afterwards now in the whole bird gallery there are only two ducks wings expanded and those in different positions fancy the difference to the mob and me if the shells and monkey skeletons were taken away from the midgallery and instead three gradated series of birds put down the length of it or half the lengthor a quarter would do itwith judgment showing the transition in length of beak from bunting to

their heads  enough of natural history you will say i will come to art in my next letterfinishing the ugly subject of this one with a single sentence from section ix of the tale of a tub commending the context of it to my friends of the royal academy  last week i saw a woman flayed and you will hardly believe how much it altered her person for the worseever my dear  affectionately yours    j r     7th april 1880    my dear   203 i suppose that proper respect for the great first principles of the british constitution that every man should do as he pleases think what he likes and see everything that can be seen for money will make most of your readers recoil from my first principle of museum arrangementthat nothing should be let inside the doors that isnt good of its sortas from an attempt to restore the papacy revive the inquisition and away with everybody to the lowest dungeon of the castle moat they must at their pleasure charge me with these sinister views they will find that there is no dexter view to be had of the business which does not consist primarily in knowing bad from good and right from wrong nor if they will condescend to begin simply enough and at the bottom of the said business and let the cobbler judge of the crepida and the potter of the pot will they find it so supremely difficult to establish authorities that shall be trustworthy and judgments that shall be sure  204 suppose for instance at leicester whence came first to us the inquiry on such points one began by setting apart a hunters room in which a series of portraits of their masters favorites for the last fifty years or so should be arranged with certificate from each squire of his satisfaction to such and such a point with the portrait of lightfoot or lucifer or will o the wisp and due notification for perhaps a recreant and degenerate future of the virtues and perfections at this time sought and secured in the english horse would not such a chamber of chivalry have in its kind a quite indisputable authority and historical value not to be shaken by any future impudence or infidelity  or again in staffordshire would it not be easily answered to an honest question of what is good and not in clay or ware this will work and that will stand and might not a series of the mugs which have been matured with discrimination and of the pots which have been popular in use be so ordered as to display their qualities in a convincing and harmonious manner against all gainsayers  205 nor is there any mystery of taste or marvel of skill concerning which you may not get quite easy initiation and safe pilotage for the common people provided you once make them clearly understand that there is indeed something to be learned and something to be admired in the arts which will need their attention for a time and cannot be explained with a word nor seen with a wink and provided also and with still greater decision you set over them masters in each branch of the arts who know their own minds in that matter and are not afraid to speak them nor to say we know when they know and we dont know when they dont  to which end the said several branches must be held well apart and dealt with one at a time every considerable town ought to have its exemplary collections of woodwork ironwork and jewelry attached to the schools of their several trades leaving to be illustrated in its public museum as in an hexagonal bees cell the six queenly and musetaught arts of needlework writing pottery sculpture architecture and painting  206 for each of these there should be a separate tribune or chamber of absolute tribunal which need not be largethat so called of florence not the size of a railway waitingroom has actually for the last century determined the taste of the european public in two artsin which the absolute best in each art so far as attainable by the communal pocket should be authoritatively exhibited with simple statement that it is good and reason why it is good and notification in what particulars it is unsurpassable together with some not too complex illustrations of the steps by which it has attained to that perfection where these can be traced far back in history  207 these six tribunes or temples of fame being first set with their fixed criteria there should follow a series of historical galleries showing the rise and fall if fallen of the arts in their beautiful associations as practiced in the great cities and by the great nations of the world the history of egypt of persia of greece of italy of france and of england should be given in their artsdynasty by dynasty and age by age and for a seventh a sunday room for the history of christianity in its art including the farthest range and feeblest efforts of it reserving for this room also what power could be reached in delineation of the great monasteries and cathedrals which were once the glory of all christian lands  208 in such a scheme every form of noble art would take harmonious and instructive place and often very little and disregarded things be found to possess unthoughtof interest and hidden relative beauty but its efficiencyand in this chiefly let it be commended to the patience of your practical readerswould depend not on its extent but on its strict and precise limitation the methods of which if you care to have my notions of them i might perhaps enter into next month with some illustrative detailever most truly yours    j r     10th june 18807    my dear   209 i cant give you any talk on detail yet but not to drop a stitch in my story i want to say why ive attached so much importance to needlework and put it in the opening court of the six you see they are progressive so that i dont quite put needlework on a level with painting but a nation that would learn to touch must primarily know how to stitch i am always busy for a good part of the day in my wood and wear out my leathern gloves fast after once i can wear them at all but thats the precise difficulty of the matter i get them from the shop looking as stout and trim as you please and half an hour after ive got to work they split up the fingers and thumbs like ripe horsechestnut shells and i find myself with five dangling rags round my wrist and a rotten white thread draggling after me through the wood or tickling my nose as if ariadne and arachne had lost their wits together i go home invoking the universe against sewingmachines and beg the charity of a sound stitch or two from any of the maids who know their womans art and thenceforward the life of the glove proper begins wow it is not possible for any people that put up with this sort of thing to learn to paint or do anything else with their fingers decentlyonly for the most part they dont think their museums are meant to show them how to do anything decently but rather how to be idle indecently which extremely popular and extremely erroneous persuasion if you please we must get out of our way before going further  210 i owe some apology by the way to mr frith for the way i spoke of his picture8 in my letter to the leicester committee not intended for publication though i never write what i would not allow to be published and was glad that they asked leave to print it it was not i who instanced the picture it had been named in the meeting of the committee as the kind of thing that people best like and i was obliged to say why people best liked itnamely not for the painting which is good and worthy their liking but for the sight of the racecourse and its humors and the reason that such a picture ought not to be in a museum is precisely because in a museum people ought not to fancy themselves on a racecourse if they want to see races let them go to races and if rogues to bridewells they come to museums to see something different from rogues and races  211 but to put the matter at once more broadly and more accurately be it remembered for sum of all that a museum is not a theater both are means of noble educationbut you must not mix up the two dramatic interest is one thing aesthetic charm another a pantomime must not depend on its fine color nor a picture on its fine pantomime  take a special instance it is long since i have been so pleased in the royal academy as i was by mr britton rivières sympathy the dog in uncaricatured doggedness divine as anubis or the dogstar the child entirely childish and lovely the carpet might have been laid by veronese a most precious picture in itself yet not one for a museum everybody would think only of the story in it everybody be wondering what the little girl had done and how she would be forgiven and if she wasnt how soon she would stop crying and give the doggie a kiss and comfort his heart all which they might study at home among their own children and dogs just as well and should not come to the museum to plague the real students there since there is not anything of especial notableness or unrivaled quality in the actual painting  212 on the other hand one of the four pictures i chose for permanent teaching in fors was one of a child and a dog the child is doing nothing neither is the dog but the dog is absolutely and beyond comparison the best painted dog in the worldancient or modernon this side of it or at the antipodes so far as ive seen the contents of said world and the child is painted so that child cannot be better done that is a picture for a museum  not that dramatic still less didactic intention should disqualify a work of art for museum purposes butbroadlydramatic and didactic art should be universally national the luster of our streets the treasure of our palaces the pleasure of our homes much art that is weak transitory and rude may thus become helpful to us but the museum is only for what is eternally right and well done according to divine law and human skill the least things are to be thereand the greatestbut all good with the goodness that makes a child cheerful and an old man calm the simple should go there to learn and the wise to remember  213 and now to return to what i meant to be the subject of this letterthe arrangement of our first ideal room in such a museum as i think of it i would fain expand the single room first asked for into one like prince houssainsno prince houssain had the flying tapestry and i forget which prince had the elastic palace but indeed it must be a lordly chamber which shall be large enough to exhibit the true nature of thread and needleomened in threadneedle street  the structure first of wool and cotton of fur and hair and down of hemp flax and silkmicroscope permissible if any cause can be shown why wool is soft and fur fine and cotton downy and down downier and how a flax fiber differs from a dandelion stalk and how the substance of a mulberry leaf can become velvet for queen victorias crown and clothing of purple for the housewife of solomon  then the phase of its dyeing what azures and emeralds and tyrians scarlets can be got into fibers of thread  214 then the phase of its spinning the mystery of that divine spiral from finest to firmest which renders lace possible at valenciennesanchorage possible after

woven from the top throughout draughts of fishes possible miraculous enough in any pilchard or herring shoal gathered into companionable catchablenesswhich makes in fine so many nations possible and saxon and norman beyond the rest  215 and finally the accomplished phase of needlework the acu tetigisti of all time which does indeed practically exhibit what mediæval theologists vainly tried to conclude inductivelyhow many angels can stand on a needlepoint to show the essential nature of a stitchdrawing the separate into the inseparable from the lowly work of duly restricted sutor and

pearlto valance of venice gold in needlework to the counterpanes and samplers of our own lovely ancestresses imitable perhaps once more with good help from whitelands collegeand girton  216 it was but yesterday my own womankind were in much wholesome and sweet excitement delightful to behold in the practice of some new device of remedy for rents to think how much of evil there is in the two senses of that fourlettered word as in the two methods of intonation of its synonym tear whereby they might be daintily effaced and with a newness which would never make them worse the process began beautifully even to my uninformed eyes in the likeness of herringbone masonry crimson on white but it seemed to me marvelous that anything should yet be discoverable in needle process and that of so utilitarian character  all that is reasonable i say of such work is to be in our first museum room all that athena and penelope would approve nothing that vanity has invented for change or folly loved for costliness but all that can bring honest pride into homely life and give security to healthand honor to beauty    j ruskin   footnotes  footnote 4 these letters are reprinted from the art journal of june and august 1880 where they were prefaced with the following note by the editor in explanation of their originwe are enabled through mr ruskins kindness to publish this month a series of letters to a friend upon the functions and formation of a model museum or picture gallery as stated in our last issue the question arose thusat the distribution of the prizes to the school of art at leicester by mr j d linton and mr james orrock members of the institute of painters in water colors the latter after stating the vital importance of study from nothing but the finest models and expressing his regret that the present price of works of art of the first class rendered their attainment by schools almost prohibitory offered drawings by william hunt and david cox as a nucleus for a collection he urged others to follow this example and with so much success that a few days saw a large sum and many works of art promised in aid of a students gallery the attention of the leicester corporation was thereupon drawn to the movement and they at once endeavored to annex the scheme to their museum failing in this they in friendly rivalry subscribed a large sum of money and the question at once arose how best to dispose of it each naturally thinking his own ideas the best at this juncture mr ruskins aid was invoked by one section of the subscribers and he replied in a letter which owing to its having been circulated without its context has been open to some misconstruction as he was only asked so he only advised what should not be done however the letter bore its fruits for both parties have had the attention of the country drawn to their proposals and so are now more diffident how to set about carrying them into effect than they were before under these circumstances mr ruskin has been induced to set out the mode in which he considers an art museum should be formed  the letter which was open to some misconstruction may be found in arrows of the chace  footnote 5

nicola cavalli is in the southernmost chapel of the five which form the east end of the church of st anastasia at verona  the traveler in italy is so often called upon to admire what he cannot enjoy that it must relieve the mind of any reader intending to visit verona to be assured that this church deserves nothing but extraordinary praise it has however some characters which a quarter of an hours attention will make both interesting and instructive and which i will note briefly before giving an account of the cavalli chapel this church would if the font were finished probably be the most perfect specimen in existence of the style to which it belongs says a critic quoted in murrays guide the conjecture is a bold one for the font is not only unfinished and for the most part a black mass of ragged brickwork but the portion pretending to completion is in three styles approaches excellence only in one of them and in that the success is limited to the sides of the single entrance door the flanks and vaults of this porch indeed deserve our almost unqualified admiration for their beautiful polychrome masonry they are built of large masses of green serpentine alternating with red and white marble and the joints are so delicate and firm that a casual spectator might pass the gate with contempt thinking the stone was painted  218 the capitals on these two sides the carved central shaft and the horizontal lintel of this door are also excellent examples of veronese thirteenth century sculpture and have merits of a high order but of which the general observer cannot be cognizant i do not mean in saying this to extol them greatly the best art is pleasing to all and its virtue or a portion of its virtue instantly manifest but there are some good qualities in every earnest work which can only be ascertained by attention and in saying that a casual observer cannot see the good qualities in early veronese sculpture i mean that it possesses none but these nor of these many  219 yet it is worth a minutes delay to observe how much the sculpture has counted on attention in later work figures of the size of life or multitudinous small ones please if they do not interest the spectator who can spare them a momentary glance but all the figures on this door are diminutive and project so slightly from the stone as scarcely to catch the eye there are none in the sides and none in the vault of the gate and it is only by deliberate examination that we find the faith which is to be preached in the church and the honor of its preacher conclusively engraved on the lintel and doorpost the spiral flutings of the central shaft are uninterrupted so as to form a slight recess for the figure of st dominic with i believe st peter martyr and st thomas aquinas one on each side with the symbols of the sun and moon at the end of the lintel on the left is st anastasia on the right st catherine of siena in the center on the projecting capital the madonna and on the lintel the story of christ in the four passages of the annunciation nativity crucifixion and resurrection  220 this is the only part of the front of the church which is certainly part of the first structure in 1260 the two statues of st anastasia and st catherine are so roughly joined to the lateral capitals as to induce a suspicion that even these latter and the beautiful polychrome vault are of later work not however later than 1300 the two pointed arches which divide the tympanum are assuredly subsequent and the fresco which occupies it is a bad work of the end of the fourteenth century and the marble frieze and foundations of the front are at least not earlier than 1426  of this portion of the building the foundation is noble and its color beautifully disposed but the sculpture of the paneling is poor and of no interest or value  221 on entering the church and turning immediately to the left there will be seen on the inner side of the external wall a tomb under a boldly trefoiled canopy it is a sarcophagus with a recumbent figure on it which is the only work of art in the church deserving serious attention it is the tomb of gerard bolderius sui temporis physicorum principi says his epitaph10 not as far as i can discover untruly on the front of the sarcophagus is the semifigure of christ rising from the tomb used generally at the period for the type of resurrection between the virgin and st john and two shields bearing one the fleurdelys the other an eagle the recumbent figure is entirely simple and right in treatment sculptured without ostentation of skill or exaggeration of sentiment by a true artist who endeavors only to give the dead due honor and his own art subordinate and modest scope  this monument being the best in st anastasia is by the usual spite of fortune placed where it is quite invisible except on bright days on the opposite side of the church the first monument on the right well lighted by the tall western window should be looked at next to the physicians for as that is the best this is essentially the worst piece of sculptured art in the building a series of academy studies in marble well executed but without either taste or invention and necessarily without meaning the monument having been erected to a person whose only claim to one was his having stolen money enough to pay for it before he died it is one of the first pieces extant of entirely mechanical art workmanship done for money and the perfection of its details may justify me in directing special attention to it  222 there are no other monuments still less pictures in the body of the church deserving notice the general effect of the interior is impressive owing partly to the boldness and simplicity of the pillars which sustain the roof partly to the darkness which involves them these dominican churches being in fact little more than vast halls for preaching in and depending little on decoration and not at all on light but the sublimity of shadow soon fails when it has nothing interesting to shade and the chapel or monuments which opposite each interval between the pillars fill the sides of the aisles possess no interest except in their arabesques of cinquecento sculpture of which far better examples may be seen elsewhere while the differences in their ages styles and purposes hinder them from attaining any unity of decorative effect and break the unity of the church almost as fatally though not as ignobly as the incoherent fillings of the aisles at westminster the cavalli chapel itself though well deserving the illustration which the arundel society has bestowed upon it is filled with a medley of tombs and frescoes of different dates partly superseding none illustrating each other and instructive mainly as showing the unfortunate results of freedom and private enterprise in matters of art as compared with the submission to the design of one ruling mind which is the glory of all the chapels in italy where the art is entirely noble  223 instructive thus at least even if seen hastily much better teaching may be had even from the unharmonious work if we give time and thought to it the upper fresco on the north wall representing the baptism of christ has no beauty and little merit as art yet the manner of its demerit is interesting st john kneels to baptize this variation from the received treatment in which he stands above the christ is enough in itself to show that the poor veronese painter had some intelligence of his subject and the quaint and haggard figure grimfeatured with its black hair rising in separate locks like a crown of thorns is a curious intermediate type between the grotesque conception which we find in earlier art or for instance on the coins of florence and the beautiful yet always melancholy and severe figures of st john painted by cima da conegliano at venice with this stern figure in raiment of camels hair compare the magdalen in the frescoes at the side of the altar who is veiled from head to foot with her own and sustained by six angels being the type of repentance from the passions as st john of resistance to them both symbols are to us to say the very least without charm and to very few without offense yet consider how much nobler the temper of the people must have been who could take pleasure in art so gloomy and unadorned than that of the populace of today which must be caught with bright colors and excited by popular sentiment  224 both these frescoes with the others on the north wall of the chapel and madonna between four saints on the south side by the cavalli tomb are evidently of fourteenth century work none of it good but characteristic and the lastnamed work seen in the plate is so graceful as to be quite worth some separate illustration but the one above it is earlier and of considerable historical interest it was discovered with the other paintings surrounding the tomb about the year 1838 when persico published his work verona e la sua provincia in which he says p 13 levatane lantica incrostatura tornarono a vita novella  it would have been more serviceable to us if we could have known the date of the rough cast than of its removal the period of entire contempt for ancient art being a subject of much interest in the ecclesiastical history of italy but the tomb itself was an incrustation having been raised with much rudeness and carelessness amidst the earlier art which recorded the first rise of the cavalli family  225 it will be seen by reference to the plate that the frescoes round the tomb have no symmetrical relation to it they are all of earlier date and by better artists the tomb itself is roughly carved and coarsely painted by men who were not trying to do their best and could not have done anything very well even if they had tried it is an entirely commonplace and dull work though of a good school and has been raised against the highest fresco with a strange disregard of the merit of the work itself and of its historical value to the family this fresco is attributable by persico to giotto but is i believe nothing more than an interesting example of the earnest work of his time and has no quality on which i care to enlarge nor is it ascertainable who the three knights are whom it commemorates unless some evidence be found of the date of the painting and there is yet none but that of its manner but they are all three cavallis and i believe them to represent the three first founders of the family giovanni che fioriva intorno al 1274 his son nicola 1297 and grandson federigo who was podesta of vicenza under the scaligers in 1331 and by whom i suppose the fresco to have been commanded the cavallis came first from germany into the service of the visconti of milan as condottieri thence passing into the service of the scaligers whether i am right in this conjecture or not we have at all events record in this chapel of seven knights of the family of whom two are named on the sarcophagus of which the inscription on the projecting ledge under the recumbent figure is       s sepulchrum nobilis et egregii viri federici et egregii et      strenui viri domini nicolai de cavalis suorunique heredum qui      spiritum redidit astris ano dni mccclxxxx  of which i think the force may be best given thus in modern terms  the tomb of the noble and distinguished herr frederic and of the distinguished and energetic herr the lord nicholas of the house of the horse and of their heirs who gave back his soul to the stars in the year of our lord 1390  226 this frederic and nicolas cavalli were the brothers of the jacopo cavalli who is buried at venice and who by a singular fatality was enrolled among the venetian nobles of the senate in the year in which his brother died at verona for i assume the spiritum redidit to be said of the firstnamed brother jacopo married constance della scala of verona and had five sons of whom one giorgio conte di schio plotted after the fall of the scaligers for their restoration to power in verona and was exiled by decree of the council of ten to candia where he died from another son conrad are descended the cavallis of venice whose palace has been the principal material from which recent searchers for the picturesque in venice compose pictures of the grand canal it forms the square mass of architecture on the left in the continually repeated view of the church of the salute seen from the steps of the academy  the genealogy of the family from the thirteenth century when they first appeared in italy to the founder of this venetian lordship had better be set before the reader in one view11                        giovanni      condottiere in service of the visconti 1274                                                  nicola                 condottiere 1297                                                 federico      podesta of vicenza under the scaligers 1331                                                  conrado                 condottiere 1350                                             federigo         jacopo        nicola                                  nicola   giovanni     conrado    federigo    giorgio                founds venetian family  227 now as above stated i believe that the fresco of the three knights was commanded by the podesta of vicenza on his receiving that authority from the scaligers in 1331 and that it represents giovanni nicola and himself while the tomb of federigo and nicola would be ordered by the venetian cavallis and completed without much care for the record of the rise of the family at verona  whether my identification of the figures seen kneeling in the fresco be correct or not the representation of these three cavalli knights to the madonna each interceded for by his patron saint will be found to receive a peculiar significance if the reader care to review the circumstances influencing the relation of the german chivalry to the power of the church in the very year when giovanni cavalli entered the ranks of the visconti  228 for the three preceding centuries milan the oldest archbishopric of lombardy had been the central point at which the collision between the secular and ecclesiastical power took place in europe the guelph and ghibelline naturally met and warred throughout the plain of lombardy but the intense civic stubbornness and courage of the milanese population formed a kind of rock in their tideway where the quarrel of burgher with noble confused itself with embittered and brought again and again to trial by battle that of pope with emperor in 1035 their warrior archbishop heading their revolt against conrad of franconia organized the first disciplined resistance of footsoldiers to cavalry by his invention and decoration of the carroccio and the contest was only closed after the rebuilding of the walls of ruined milan by the wandering of barbarossa his army scattered through the maize fields which the traveler now listlessly crosses at speed in the train between milan and arona little noting the name of the small station legnano where the fortune of the lombard republic finally prevailed but it was only by the death of frederick ii that the supremacy of the church was secured and when innocent iv who had written on hearing of that death to his sicilian clergy in words of blasphemous exultation entered milan on his journey from lyons to perugia the road for ten miles before he reached the gates was lined by the entire population of the city drawn forth in enthusiastic welcome as they had invented a sacred car for the advance of their standard in battle they invented some similar honor for the head of their church as the harbinger of peace under a canopy of silk borne by the first gentlemen of milan the pope received the hosannas of a people who had driven into shameful flight their caesarking and it is not uninteresting for the english traveler to remember as he walks through the vast arcades of shops in the form of a cross by which the milanese of today express their triumph in liberation from teutonic rule that the baldacchino of all mediæval religious ceremony owed its origin to the taste of the milliners of milan as the safety of the best knights in european battle rested on the faithful craftsmanship of her armorers  229 but at the date when the cavalli entered the service of the great milanese family the state of parties within the walls had singularly changed three years previously 1271 charles of anjou had drawn together the remnants of the army of his dead brother had confiscated to his own use the goods of the crusading knights whose vessels had been wrecked on the coast of sicily and called the pontifical court to viterbo to elect a pope who might confirm his dominion over the kingdoms of sicily and jerusalem  on the deliberations of the cardinals at viterbo depended the fates of italy and the northern empire they chose tebaldo visconti then a monk in pilgrimage at jerusalem but before that election was accomplished one of the candidates for the northern empire had involuntarily withdrawn his claim guy de montfort had murdered at the altar foot the english count of cornwall to avenge his father simon de montfort killed at evesham the death of the english king of the romans left the throne of germany vacant tebaldo had returned from jerusalem with no personal ambition but having at heart only the restoration of greece to europe and the preaching of a new crusade in syria a general council was convoked by him at lyons with this object but before anything could be accomplished in the conclave it was necessary to balance the overwhelming power of charles of anjou and the visconti gregory x ratified in 1273 the election of rudolph of hapsburg  230 but charles of anjou owed his throne in reality to the assistance of the milanese their popular leader napoleone della torre had facilitated his passage through lombardy which otherwise must have been arrested by the ghibelline states and in the year in which the visconti pope had appointed the council at lyons the visconti archbishop of milan was heading the exiled nobles in vain attempts to recover their supremacy over the popular party the new emperor rudolph not only sent a representative to the council but a german contingent to aid the exiled archbishop the popular leader was defeated and confined in an iron cage in the year 1274 and the first entrance of the cavalli into the italian armies is thus contemporary with the conclusive triumph of the northern monarchic over the republican power or more literally of the wandering rider eques or ritter living by pillage over the sedentary burgher living by art and hale peasant living by labor the essential nature of the struggle is curiously indicated in relation to this monument by the two facts that the revolt of the milanese burghers headed by their archbishop began by a gentlemans killing an importunate creditor and that at venice the principal circumstance recorded of jacopo cavalli see my notice of his tomb in the stones of venice vol iii ch ii § 69 is his refusal to assault feltre because the senate would not grant him the pillage of the town the reader may follow out according to his disposition what thoughts the fresco of the three kneeling knights each with his helmetcrest in the shape of a horses head thrown back from his shoulders may suggest to him on review of these passages of history one thought only i must guard him against strictly namely that a condottieres religion must necessarily have been false or hypocritical the folly of nations is in nothing more manifest than in their placid reconciliation of noble creeds with base practices but the reconciliation in the fourteenth as in the nineteenth century was usually foolish only not insincere   footnotes  footnote 9 published by the arundel society 1872 together with a chromolithograph after a drawing by herr gnauthed  footnote

still so like the creatures they were once that there it first occurred to the human brain to imagine that the buried shapes were not mockeries of life but had indeed once lived and under those white banks by the roadside was born like a poor italian gypsy the modern science of geology  the wall was chiefly built the moat entirely excavated by can grande della scala and it represents typically the form of defense which rendered it possible for the life and the arts of citizens to be preserved and practiced in an age of habitual war not only so but it is the wall of the actual city which headed the great lombard league which was the beginner of personal and independent power in the italian nation and the first bannerbearer therefore of all that has been vitally independent in religion and in art throughout the entire christian world to this day at the upper angle of the wall looking down the northern descent is seen a great round tower at the foot of it not forked in battlements but with embrasures for guns the battlemented wall was the cradle of civic life that low circular tower is the cradle of modern war and of all its desolation it is the first european tower for artillery the beginning of fortification against gunpowderthe beginning that is to say of the end of all fortification  232 after noticing the beautiful vegetation of the district mr ruskin described the view from the promontory or spur about ten miles long of which the last rock dies into the plain at the eastern gate of verona this promontory he said is one of the sides of the great gate out of germany into italy through which the goths always entered cloven up to innspruck by the inn and down to verona by the adige and by this gate not only the gothic armies came but after the italian nation is formed the current of northern life enters still into its heart through the mountain artery as constantly and strongly as the cold waves of the adige itself  the rock of this promontory hardens as we trace it back to the alps first into a limestone having knots of splendid brown jasper in it as our chalk has flints and in a few miles more into true marble colored by iron into a glowing orange or pale warm redthe peachblossom marble of which verona is chiefly builtand then as you advance farther into the hills into variegated marbles very rich and grotesque in their veinings  233 after dilating on the magnificent landscape viewed from the top of this promontory embracing the blue plain of lombardy and its cities mr ruskin said  i do not think that there is any other rock in all the world from which the places and monuments of so complex and deep a fragment of the history of its ages can be visible as from this piece of crag with its blue and prickly weeds for you have thus beneath you at once the birthplaces of virgil and of livythe homes of dante and petrarch and the source of the most sweet and pathetic inspiration to your own shakespearethe spot where the civilization of the gothic kingdoms was founded on the throne of theodoric and there whatever was strongest in the italian race redeemed itself into life by its league against barbarossa the beginning of the revival of natural science and medicine in the schools of padua the center of italian chivalry in the power of the scaligers of italian cruelty in that of ezzelin and lastly the birthplace of the highest art for among those hills or by this very adige bank were born mantegna titian correggio and veronese  234 mr ruskin then referred to a series of drawings and photographs taken at verona by himself and his assistants mr burgess and mr bunney which he had divided into three series and of which he had furnished a number of printed catalogues illustrated with notes13  i lombard extending to the end of the twelfth century being the expression of the introduction of christianity into barbaric minds christianization  ii the gothic period dantes time from 1200 to 1400 dante beginning his poem exactly in the midst of it in 1300 the period of vital christianity and of the development of the laws of chivalry and forms of imagination which are founded on christianity  iii the first period of the revival in which the arts of greece and some of its religion return and join themselves to christianity not taking away its sincerity or earnestness but making it poetical instead of practical in the following period even this poetical christianity expired the arts became devoted to the pursuit of pleasure and in that they persist except where they are saved by a healthy naturalism or domesticity  235 i the lombardic period is one of savage but noble life gradually subjected to law it is the forming of men not out of clay but wild beasts and art of this period in all countries including our own norman especially is in the inner heart of it the subjection of savage or terrible or foolish and erring life to a dominant law it is government and conquest of fearful dreams there is in it as yet no germ of true hopeonly the conquest of evil and the waking from darkness and terror the literature of it is as in greece far in advance of art and is already full of the most tender and impassioned beauty while the art is still grotesque and dreadful but however wild it is supreme above all others by its expression of governing law and here at verona is the very center and utmost reach of that expression  i know nothing in architecture at once so exquisite and so wild and so strange in the expression of selfconquest achieved almost in a dream for observe these barbaric races educated in violencechiefly in war and in huntingcannot feel or see clearly as they are gradually civilized whether this element in which they have been brought up is evil or not they must be good soldiers and huntersthat is their life yet they know that killing is evil and they do not expect to find wild beasts in heaven they have been trained by pain by violence by hunger and cold they know there is a good in these things as well as evil they are perpetually hesitating between the one and the other thought of them but one thing they see clearly that killing and hunting and every form of misery pleasure and of passion must somehow at last be subdued by law which shall bring good out of it all and which they feel more and more constraining them every hour now if with this sympathy you look at their dragon and wild beast decoration you will find that it now tells you about these lombards far more than they could know of themselves all the actions and much more the arts of men tell to others not only what the worker does not know but what he can never know of himself which you can only recognize by being in an element more advanced and wider than his in deliberate symbolism the question is always not what a symbol meant first or meant elsewhere but what it means now and means here now this dragon symbol of the lombard is used of course all over the world it means good here and evil there sometimes means nothing sometimes everything you have always to ask what the man who here uses it means by it whatever is in his mind that he is sure partly to express by it nothing else than that can he express by it  236 ii in the second period mr ruskin said was to be found the highest development of italian character and chivalry with an entirely believed christian religion you get therefore joy and courtesy and hope and a lovely peace in death and with these you have two fearful elements of evil you have first such confidence in the virtue of the creed that men hate and persecute all who do not accept it and worse still you find such confidence in the power of the creed that men not only can do anything that is wrong and be themselves for a word of faith pardoned but are even sure that after the wrong is done god is sure to put it all right again for them or even make things better than they were before now i need not point out to you how the spirit of persecution as well as of vain hope founded on creed only is mingled in every line with the lovely moral teaching of the divina conmedia nor need i point out to you how between the persecution of other peoples creeds and the absolution of ones own crimes all christian error is concluded  in relation to this mr ruskin referred to the history of the founder of the power of the scalas mastino a simple citizen chosen first to be podesta and then captain of verona for his justice and sagacity who although wise and peaceful in his policy employed the civil power in the persecution of heresy burning above two hundred persons and he also related how can signorio della scala on his deathbed after giving a pious charge to his children ordered the murder of his brotherexamples of the boundless possibility of selfdeception one of these children killed the other and was himself driven from the throne so ending the dynasty of the scalas referring to his illustrations mr ruskin pointed out the expressions of hope in the conquest of death and the rewards of faith apparent in the art of the time the lombard architecture expresses the triumph of law over passion the christian that of hope over sorrow  mr ruskin concluded his remarks on this period by commenting on the history and the tomb of can grande della scala a good knight and true as busy and bright a life as is found in the annals of chivalry  237 iii the period when classical literature and art were again known in italy and the painters and sculptors who had been gaining steadily in power for two hundred yearspower not of practice merely but of race alsowith every circumstance in their favor around them received their finally perfect instruction both in geometrical science in that of materials and in the anatomy and action of the human body also the people about themthe models of their workhad been perfected in personal beauty by a chivalric war in imagination by a transcendental philosophy in practical intellect by stern struggle for civic law and in commerce not in falsely made or vile or unclean things but in lovely things beautifully and honestly made and now therefore you get out of all the worlds long history since it was peopled by men till nowyou get just fifty years of perfect work perfect it is a strong word it is also a true one the doing of these fifty years is unaccusably right as art what its sentiment may bewhether too great or too little whether superficial or sincereis another question but as artists work it admits no conception of anything better  it is true that in the following age founded on the absolutely stern rectitude of this there came a phase of gigantic power and of exquisite ease and felicity which possess an awe and a charm of their own they are more inimitable than the work of the perfect school but they are not perfect   238 this period mr ruskin named the time of the masters fifty years including luini leonardo john bellini vitto carpaccio andrea mantegna andrea verrocchio cima da conegliano perugino and in date though only in his earlier life belonging to the school raphael the great fifty years was the prime of life of three men john bellini born 1430 died at 90 in 1516 mantegna born 1430 died at 76 in 1506 and vittor carpaccio who died in 1522  the object of these masters is wholly different from that of the former school the central gothic men always want chiefly to impress you with the facts of their subject but the masters of this finished time desire only to make everything dainty and delightful we have not many pictures of the class in england but several have been of late added to the national gallery and the perugino there especially the compartment with raphael and tobit and the little st jerome by john bellini will perfectly show you this main characterpictorial perfectness and deliciousnesssought before everything else you will find if you look into that st jerome that everything in it is exquisite complete and pure there is not a particle of dust in the cupboards nor a cloud in the air the wooden shutters are dainty the candlesticks are dainty the saints scarlet hat is dainty and its violet tassel and its ribbon and his blue cloak and his spare pair of shoes and his little brown partridgeit is all a perfect quintessence of innocent luxuryabsolute delight without one drawback in it nor taint of the devil anywhere   239 after dilating on several other pictures of this class giving evidence of the entire devotion of the artists of the period to their art and work mr ruskin adverted to the second part of his discourse the rivers of verona there is but one river at verona nevertheless dante connects its name with that of the po when he says of the whole of lombardy    in sul paese ch adice e po riga   solea valore e cortesia trovarsi   prima che federigo avesse briga  i want to speak for a minute or two about those great rivers because in the efforts that are now being made to restore some of its commerce to venice precisely the same questions are in course of debate which again and again ever since venice was a city have put her senate at pausenamely how to hold in check the continually advancing morass formed by the silt brought down by the alpine rivers is it not strange that for at least six hundred years the venetians have been contending with those rivers at their mouthsthat is to say where their strength has become wholly irresistibleand never once thought of contending with them at their sources where their infinitely separated streamlets might be and are meant by heaven to be ruled as easily as children and observe how sternly how constantly the place where they are to be governed is marked by the mischief done by their liberty consider what the advance of the delta of the po in the adriatic signifies among the alps the evil of the delta itself however great is as nothing in comparison of that which is in its origin  240 the gradual destruction of the harborage of venice the endless cost of delaying it the malaria of the whole coast down to ravenna nay the raising of the bed of the po to the imperiling of all lombardy are but secondary evils every acre of that increasing delta means the devastation of part of an alpine valley and the loss of so much fruitful soil and ministering rain some of you now present must have passed this year through the valleys of the toccia and ticino you know therefore the devastation that was caused there as well as in the valley of the rhone by the great floods of 1868 and that ten years of labor even if the peasantry had still the heart for labor cannot redeem those districts into fertility what you have there seen on a vast scale takes place to a certain extent during every summer thunderstorm and from the ruin of some portion of fruitful land the dust descends to increase the marshes of the po but observe furtherwhether fed by sudden melting of snow or by stormevery destructive rise of the italian rivers signifies the loss of so much power of irrigation on the south side of the alps you must all well know the look of their chainseen from milan or turin late in summerhow little snow is left except on monte rosa how vast a territory of brown mountainside heated and barren without rocks yet without forest there is in that brownpurple zone and along the flanks of every valley that divides it another lombardy of cultivable land and every drift of rain that swells the mountain torrents if it were caught where it falls is literally rain of gold we seek gold beneath the rocks and we will not so much as make a trench along the hillside to catch it where it falls from heaven and where if not so caught it changes into a frantic monster first ravaging hamlet hill and plain then sinking along the shores of venice into poisoned sleep think what that belt of the alps might beup to four thousand feet above the plainif the system of terraced irrigation which even halfsavage nations discovered and practiced long ago in china and in borneo and by which our own engineers have subdued vast districts of farthest india were but in part also practiced herehere in the oldest and proudest center of european arts where leonardo da vincimaster among mastersfirst discerned the laws of the coiling clouds and wandering streams so that to this day his engineering remains unbettered by modern science and yet in this center of all human achievements of genius no thought has been taken to receive with sacred art these great gifts of quiet snow and flying rain think i repeat what that south slope of the alps might be one paradise of lovely pasture and avenued forest of chestnut and blossomed trees with cascades docile and innocent as infants laughing all summer long from crag to crag and pool to pool and the adige and the po the dora and the ticino no more defiled no more alternating between fierce flood and venomous languor but in calm clear currents bearing ships to every city and health to every field of all that azure plain of lombard italy  241 it has now become a most grave object with me to get some of the great pictures of the italian schools into england and that i think at this timewith good helpmight be contrived further without in the least urging my plans impatiently on anyone else i know thoroughly that this which i have said should be done can be done for the italian rivers and that no method of employment of our idle ablebodied laborers would be in the end more remunerative or in the beginnings of it more healthful and every way beneficial than with the concurrence of the italian and swiss governments setting them to redeem the valleys of the ticino and the rhone and i pray you to think of this for i tell you trulyyou who care for italythat both her passions and her mountain streams are noble but that her happiness depends not on the liberty but the right government of both14   footnotes  footnote 12 report with extracts of a

and garlands above are the beginning of a façade intended      to have been erected in the 15th century       the count of castelbarco the chancellor of can grande della scala      died about the year 1330 and his tomb cannot be much later in      date       the details of this group of buildings are illustrated under the      numbers next in series  12 pillars and lintels of the western door of st anastasia      photograph       the sculpture of the lintel is first notable for its concise and      intense story of the life of christ    1 the annunciation both virgin and angel kneeling    2 the nativity    3 the epiphany chosen as a sign of life giver to the      gentiles    4 christ bearing his cross chosen as a sign of his      personal life in its entirety    5 the crucifixion    6 the resurrection       secondly as sculpture this lintel shows all the principal      features of the characteristic 13th century design of verona       diminutive and stunted figures the heads ugly in

hotel of the two towers r       that inn was itself one of the palaces of the scaligers and the      traveler should endeavor always to imagine the effect of the little      square of sta anastasia when the range of its buildings was      complete the castelbarco tomb on one side this gothic palace on      the other and the great door of the church between the masonry of      the canopy of this tomb was so locked and dovetailed that it stood      balanced almost without cement but of late owing to the      permission given to heavily loaded carts to pass continually under      the archway the stones were so loosened by the vibration that the      old roof became unsafe and was removed and a fine smooth one of      trimly cut white stone substituted while i was painting the rest      of the tomb against time hence the unfinished condition of my      sketch the last that can ever be taken of the tomb as it was built  16 the castelbarco tomb seen laterally b       a most careful drawing leaving little to be desired in realization      of the subject it is taken so near the tomb as to make the      perspective awkward but i liked this quaint view better than more      distant ones       the drawing of the archway and of the dark gray and red masonry of      the tomb is very beautiful  247 17 lion with hind in its claws a       the support of the sarcophagus under the feet

small panels at the angles of the      sarcophagus in the castelbarco tomb i engraved the st mark for      the illustration of noble grotesque in the stones of venice but      this drawing more perfectly renders the stern touch of the old      sculptor  20 two of the spurs of the bases of the nave pillars in the church       of st anastasia a       of the real size not generally seen in the darkness of the church      and very fine in their rough way  248 21 tomb of can grande general view r       put together some time since from photograph and sketches taken in      the year 1852 and

detail of this kind      carefully slight as it is the sketch gives some idea of the easy      flow of the stone drapery and of the care taken by the sculptor to      paint his pattern as if it were bent at the apparent fold  250 30 tomb of can signorio della scala       samuel prouts sketch on the spot afterwards lithographed by him      in his sketches in france and italy quite admirable in

friendship was my disciple  but of late i have been his for he has devoted himself earnestly to the study of forms of christian art which i had little opportunity of examining and has been animated in that study by a brightness of enthusiasm which has been long impossible to me knowing this and that he was able perfectly to fill what must otherwise have been a rudely bridged chasm in my teaching at oxford i begged him to give these lectures and to arrange them for press and this he has done to please me and now that he has done it i am in one sense anything but pleased for i like his writing better than my own and am more jealous of it than i thought it was in me to be of any good workhow much less of my friends i console myself by reflecting or at least repeating to myself and endeavoring to think that he could not have found out all this if i had not shown him the way but most deeply and seriously i am thankful for such help in a work far too great for my present strength help all the more precious because my friend can bring to the investigation of early christian art and its influence the integrity and calmness of the faith in which it was wrought happier than i in having been a personal comforter and helper of men fulfilling his life in daily and unquestionable duty while i have been perhaps wrongly always hesitatingly persuading myself that it was my duty to do the things which pleased me  255 also it has been necessary to much of my analytical work that i should regard the art of every nation as much as possible from their own natural point of view and i have striven so earnestly to realize belief which i supposed to be false and sentiment which was foreign to my temper that at last i scarcely know how far i think with other peoples minds and see with anyones eyes but my own even the effort to recover my temporarily waived conviction occasionally fails and what was once secured to me becomes theoretical like the rest  but my old scholar has been protected by his definitely directed life from the temptations of this speculative equity and i believe his writings to contain the truest expression yet given in england of the feelings with which a christian gentleman of sense and learning should regard the art produced in ancient days by the dawn of the faiths which still guide his conduct and secure his peace  256 on all the general principles of art mr tyrwhitt and i are absolutely at one but he has often the better of me in his acute personal knowledge of men and their ways when we differ in our thoughts of things it is because we know them on contrary sides and often his side is that most naturally seen and which it is most desirable to see there is one important matter for instance on which we are thus apparently at issue and yet are not so in reality these lectures show throughout the most beautiful and just reverence for michael angelo and are of especial value in their account of him while the last lecture on sculpture16 which i gave at oxford is entirely devoted to examining the modes in which his genius failed and perverted that of other men but michael angelo is great enough to make praise and blame alike necessary and alike inadequate in any true record of him my friend sees him as a traveler sees from a distance some noble mountain range obscure in golden clouds and purple shade and i see him as a sullen miner would the same mountains wandering among their precipices through chill of storm and snow and discerning that their strength was perilous and their substance sterile both of us see truly both partially the complete truth is the witness of both  257 the notices of holbein and the english whom he painted see especially the sketch of sir thomas wyatt in the sixth lecture are to my mind of singular value and the tenor of the book throughout as far as i can judgefor as i said much of it treats of subjects with which i am unfamiliarso sound and the feeling in it so warm and true and true in the warmth of it that it refreshes me like the sight of the things themselves it speaks of new and vivid sight of them it will give to many readers and to all who will regard my commendation i commend it asking those who have hitherto credited my teaching to read these lectures as they would my own and trusting that others who have doubted me will see reason to put faith in my friend

british and american travelers who take unaffected interest in the early art of europe is already large and is daily increasing daily also as i thankfully perceive feeling themselves more and more in need of a guidebook containing as much trustworthy indication as they can use of what they may most rationally spend their time in examining the books of reference published by mr murray though of extreme value to travelers who make it their object to see in his and their sense of the word whatever is to be seen are of none whatever or may perhaps be considered justly as even of quite the reverse of value to travelers who wish to see only what they may in simplicity understand and with pleasure remember while the histories of art and biographies of artists to which the more earnest student in his novitiate must have recourse are at once so voluminous so vague and so contradictory that i cannot myself conceive his deriving any other benefit from their study than a deep conviction of the difficulty of the subject and of the incertitude of human opinions  259 it seemed to me on reading the essays collected in this volume as they appeared in the periodical18 for which they were written that the author not only possessed herself a very true discernment of the qualities in mediæval art which were justly deserving of praise but had unusually clear understanding of the degree in which she might expect to cultivate such discernment in the general mind of polite travelers nor have i less admired her aptitude in collation of essentially illustrative facts so as to bring the history of a very widely contemplative range of art into tenable compass and very graceful and serviceable form her reading indeed has been with respect to many very interesting periods of religious workmanship much more extensive than my own and when i consented to edit the volume of collected papers it was not without the assurance of considerable advantage to myself during the labor of revising them  260 the revision however i am sorry to say has been interrupted and imperfect very necessarily the last from the ignorance i have just confessed of more than one segment of the great illuminated field of early religious art to which the writer most wisely has directed equal and symmetrical attention and interrupted partly under extreme pressure of other occupation and partly in very fear of being tempted to oppress the serenity of the general prospect which i think these essays are eminently calculated to open before an ingenious reader with the stormy chiaroscuro of my own preference and reprobation i leave the work therefore absolutely miss owens with occasional note of remonstrance but without retouch though it must be distinctly understood that when i allow my name to stand as the editor of a book it is in no mere compliment if my editorship could indeed be held as such to the genius or merit of the author but it means that i hold myself entirely responsible in main points for the accuracy of the views advanced and that i wish the work to be received by those who have confidence in my former teaching as an extension and application of the parts of it which i have felt to be incomplete       oxford november 27 1875       notethe notes of remonstrance or approbation      scattered through the volume are not numerous they are given      below preceded in

pp 4878 where miss owens      statement that the cause of rafaelles popularity  has been      that predominance of exaggerated dramatic representation which in      his pictures is visible above all

of his cause given with so temperate mastery by mr somervell that i find nothing to add in circumstance and little to reenforce in argument and i have less heart to the writing even of what brief preface so good work might by its authors courtesy be permitted to receive from me occupied as i so long have been in efforts tending in the same direction because on that very account i am far less interested than my friend in this local and limited resistance to the elsewhere fatally victorious current of modern folly cruelty and ruin when the frenzy of avarice is daily drowning our sailors suffocating our miners poisoning our children and blasting the cultivable surface of england into a treeless waste of ashes20 what does it really matter whether a flock of sheep more or less be driven from the slopes of helvellyn or the little pool of thirlmere filled with shale or a few wild blossoms of st johns vale lost to the coronal of english spring little to anyone andlet me say this at least in the outset of all sayingnothing to me no one need charge me with selfishness in any word or action for defense of these mossy hills i do not move with such small activity as i have yet shown in the business because i live at coniston where no sound of the iron wheels by dunmail raise can reach me nor because i can find no other place to remember wordsworth by than the daffodil margin of his little rydal marsh what thoughts and work are yet before me such as he taught must be independent of any narrow associations all my own dear mountain grounds and treasurecities chamouni interlachen lucerne geneva venice are long ago destroyed by the european populace and now for my own part i dont care what more they do they may drain loch katrine drink loch lomond and blow all wales and cumberland into a heap of slate shingle the world is wide enough yet to find me some refuge during the days appointed for me to stay in it but it is no less my duty in the cause of those to whom the sweet landscapes of england are yet precious and to whom they may yet teach what they taught me in early boyhood and would still if i had it now to learnit is my duty to plead with what earnestness i may that these sacred sibylline books may be redeemed from perishing  262 but again i am checked because i dont know how to speak to the persons who need to be spoken to in this matter  suppose i were sitting where still in muchchanged oxford i am happy to find myself in one of the little latticed cells of the bodleian library and my kind and muchloved friend mr coxe were to come to me with news that it was proposed to send nine hundred excursionists through the library every day in three parties of three hundred each that it was intended they should elevate their minds by reading all the books they could lay hold of while they stayedand that practically scientific persons accompanying them were to look out for and burn all the manuscripts that had any gold in their illuminations that the said gold might be made of practical service but that he mr coxe could not for his part sympathize with the movement and hoped i would write something in deprecation of it as i should then feel i feel now at mr somervells request that i would write him a preface in defense of helvellyn what could i say for mr coxe of course that nine hundred people should see the library daily instead of one is only fair to the nine hundred and if there is gold in the books is it not public property if there is copper or slate in helvellyn shall not the public burn or hammer it outand they say they will of coursein spite of us what does it signify to them how we poor old quiet readers in this mountain library feel true we know well enoughwhat the nine hundred excursionist scholars dontthat the library cant be read quite through in a quarter of an hour also that there is a pleasure in real reading quite different from that of turning pages and that gold in a missal or slate in a crag may be more precious than in a bank or a chimneypot but how are these practical people to credit usthese who cannot read nor ever will and who have been taught that nothing is virtuous but care for their bellies and nothing useful but what goes into them  263 whether to be credited or not the real facts of the matter made clear as they are in the following pages can be briefly stated for the consideration of any candid person  the arguments in favor of the new railway are in the main four and may be thus answered  1 there are mineral treasures in the district capable of development  answer it is a wicked fiction got up by whosoever has got it up simply to cheat shareholders every lead and copper vein in cumberland has been known for centuries the copper of coniston does not pay and there is none so rich in helvellyn and the main central volcanic rocks through which the track lies produce neither slate nor hematite while there is enough of them at llanberis and dalton to roof and irongrate all england into one vast bedlam if it honestly perceives itself in need of that accommodation  2 the scenery must be made accessible to the public  answer it is more than accessible already the public are pitched into it headforemost and necessarily miss twothirds of it the lake scenery really begins on the south at lancaster where the cumberland hills are seen over morecambe bay on the north at carlisle where the moors of skiddaw are seen over the rich plains between them and the solway no one who loves mountains would lose a step of the approach from these distances on either side but the stupid herds of modern tourists let themselves be emptied like coals from a sack at windermere and keswick having got there what the new railway has to do is to shovel those who have come to keswick to windermere and to shovel those who have come to windermere to keswick and what then  3 but cheap and swift transit is necessary for the working population who otherwise could not see the scenery at all  answer after all your shrieking about what the operatives spend in drink cant you teach them to save enough out of their years wages to pay for a chaise and pony for a day to drive missis and the baby that pleasant twenty miles stopping when they like to unpack the basket on a mossy bank if they cant enjoy the scenery that way they cant any way and all that your railroad company can do for them is only to open taverns and skittle grounds round grasmere which will soon then be nothing but a pool of drainage with a beach of broken gingerbeer bottles and their minds will be no more improved by contemplating the scenery of such a lake than of blackpool  4 what else is to be said i protest i can find nothing unless that engineers and contractors must live let them live but in a more useful and honorable way than by keeping old bartholomew fair under helvellyn and making a steam merrygoround of the lake country  there are roads to be mended where the parish will not mend them harbors of refuge needed where our deckloaded ships are in helpless danger get your commissions and dividends where you know that work is needed not where the best you can do is to persuade pleasureseekers into giddier idleness  264 the arguments brought forward by the promoters of the railway may thus be summarily answered of those urged in the following pamphlet in defense of the country as it is i care only myself to direct the readers attention to one see pp 27 28 the certainty namely of the deterioration of moral character in the inhabitants of every district penetrated by a railway where there is little moral character to be lost this argument has small weight but the border peasantry of scotland and england painted with absolute fidelity by scott and wordsworth for leading types out of this exhaustless portraiture i may name dandie dinmont and michael are hitherto a scarcely injured race whose strength and virtue yet survive to represent the body and soul of england before her days of mechanical decrepitude and commercial dishonor there are men working in my own fields who might have fought with henry the fifth at agincourt without being discerned from among his knights i can take my tradesmens word for a thousand pounds my garden gate opens on the latch to the public road by day and night without fear of any foot entering but my own and my girlguests may wander by road or moorland or through every bosky dell of this wild wood free as the heather bees or squirrels  what effect on the character of such a population will be produced by the influx of that of the suburbs of our manufacturing towns there is evidence enough if the reader cares to ascertain the facts in every newspaper on his morning table  265 and now one final word concerning the proposed beneficial effect on the minds of those whom you send to corrupt us  i have said i take no selfish interest in this resistance to the railroad but i do take an unselfish one it is precisely because i passionately wish to improve the minds of the populace and because i am spending my own mind strength and fortune wholly on that object that i dont want to let them see helvellyn while they are drunk i suppose few men now living have so earnestly feltnone certainly have so earnestly declaredthat the beauty of nature is the blessedest and most necessary of lessons for men and that all other efforts in education are futile till you have taught your people to love fields birds and flowers come then my benevolent friends join with me in that teaching i have been at it all my life and without pride do solemnly assure you that i know how it is to be managed i cannot indeed tell you in this short preface how completely to fulfill so glorious a task but i can tell you clearly instantly and emphatically in what temper you must set about it here are you a christian a gentleman and a trained scholar there is your subject of educationa godless clown in helpless ignorance you can present no more blessed offering to god than that human creature raised into faith gentleness and the knowledge of the works of his lord but observe thisyou must not hope to make so noble an offering to god of that which doth cost you nothing you must be resolved to labor and to lose yourself before you can rescue this overlabored lost sheep and offer it alive to its master if then my benevolent friend you are prepared to take out your two pence and to give them to the hosts here in cumberland sayingtake care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more i will repay thee when i come to cumberland myself on these termsoh my benevolent friends i am with you hand and glove in every effort you wish to make for the enlightenment of poor mens eyes but if your motive is on the contrary to put two pence into your own purse stolen between the jerusalem and jericho of keswick and ambleside out of the poor drunken travelers pocketif your real object in your charitable offering is not even to lend unto the lord by giving to the poor but to lend unto the lord by making a dividend out of the poorthen my pious friends enthusiastic ananias pitiful judas and sanctified korah i

hamilton advertiser of 10th and 17th june     the study of beauty and art in large towns21   266 i have been asked by mr horsfall to write a few words of introduction to the following papers the trust is a frank one for our friendship has been long and intimate enough to assure their author that my feelings and even practical convictions in many respects differ from his and in some relating especially to the subjects here treated of are even opposed to his so that my private letters which to speak truth he never attends to a word of are little more than a series of exhortations to him to singonce for allthe beautiful cavalier ditty of farewell manchester and pour the dew of his artistic benevolence on less recusant ground nevertheless as assuredly he knows much more of his own town than i do and as his mind is evidently made up to do the best he can for it the only thing left for me to do is to help him all i can in the hard task he has set himself or if i cant help at least to bear witness to the goodness of the seed he has set himself to sow among thorns for indeed the principles on which he is working are altogether true and sound and the definitions and defense of them in this pamphlet are among the most important pieces of art teaching which i have ever met with in recent english literature in past artliterature there cannot of course be anything parallel to them since the difficulties to be met and mischiefs to be dealt with are wholly of today and in all the practical suggestions and recommendations given in the following pages i not only concur but am myself much aided as i read them in the giving form to my own plans for the museum at sheffield nor do i doubt that they will at once commend themselves to every intelligent and candid reader but to my own mind the statements of principle on which these recommendations are based are far the more valuable part of the writings for these are true and serviceable for all time and in all places while in simplicity and lucidity they are far beyond any usually to be found in essays on art and the political significance of the laws thus defined is really i believe here for the first time rightly grasped and illustrated  267 of these however the one whose root is deepest and range widest will be denied by many readers and doubted by others so that it may be well to say a word or two farther in its interpretation and defensethe saying namely that faith cannot dwell in hideous towns and that familiarity with beauty is a most powerful aid to belief this is a curious saying in front of the fact that the primary force of infidelity in the renaissance times was its pursuit of carnal beauty and that nowadays at least so far as my own experience reaches more faith may be found in the back streets of most cities than in the fine ones nevertheless the saying is wholly true first because carnal beauty is not true beauty secondly because rightly judged the fine streets of most modern towns are more hideous than the back ones lastlyand this is the point on which i must enlargebecause universally the first condition to the believing there is order in heaven is the sight of order upon earth order that is to say not the result of physical law but of some spiritual power prevailing over it as to take instances from my own old and favorite subject the ordering of the clouds in a beautiful sunset which corresponds to a painters invention of them or the ordering of the colors on a birds wing or of the radiations of a crystal of hoarfrost or of sapphire concerning any of which matters men so called of science are necessarily and forever silent because the distribution of colors in spectra and the relation of planes in crystals are final and causeless facts orders that is to say not laws and more than this the infidel temper which is incapable of perceiving this spiritual beauty has an instant and constant tendency to delight in the reverse of it so that practically its investigation is always by preference of forms of death or disease and every state of disorder and dissolution the affectionate analysis of vice in modern novels being a part of the same science and to keep to my own special field of studythe order of cloudsthere is a grotesquely notable example of the connection between infidelity and the sense of ugliness in a paper in the last contemporary review in which an able writer who signs vernon lee but whose personal view or purpose remains to the close of the essay inscrutable has rendered with considerable acuteness and animation the course of a dialogue between one of the common modern men about town who are the parasites of their own cigars and two more or less weak and foolish friends of hesitatingly adverse instincts the three of them however practically assuming their own wisdom to be the highest yet attained by the human race and their own diversion on the mountainous heights of it being by the aspect of a socalled preposterous sunset described in the following terms                                       a brilliant light which seemed to sink out of the landscape all its reds and yellows and with them all life bleaching the yellowing cornfields and brown heath but burnishing into demoniac22 energy of color the pastures and oak woods brilliant against the dark sky as if filled with green fire  along the roadside the poppies which an ordinary sunset makes flame were quite extinguished like burntout embers the yellow hearts of the daisies were quite lost merged into their shining white petals and striking against the windows of the old black and white checkered farm a ghastly skeleton in this light it made them not flare nay not redden in the faintest degree but reflect a brilliant speck of white light everything was unsubstantial yet not as in a mist nay rather substantial but flat as if cut out of paper and pasted on the black branches and green leaves the livid glaring houses with roofs of dead scarce perceptible rod as when an iron turning whitehot from redhot in the stithy grows also dull and dim  it looks like the eve of the coming of antichrist as described in mediæval hymns remarked vere the sun before setting nevermore to rise sucking all life out of the earth leaving it but a mound of livid cinders barren and crumbling through which the buried nations will easily break their way when they rise                                       as i have above said i do not discern the purpose of the writer of this paper but it would be impossible to illustrate more clearly this chronic insanity of infidel thought which makes all nature spectral while with exactly correspondent and reflective power whatever is dreadful or disordered in external things reproduces itself in disease of the human mind affected by them                                       268 the correspondent relations of beauty to morality are illustrated in the following pages in a way which leaves little to be desired and scarcely any room for dissent but i have marked for my own future reference the following passages of which i think it will further the usefulness of the book that the reader should initially observe the contents and connection23  1 p 15 line 610 our idea of beauty in all things depends on what we believe they ought to be and do  2 p 17 line 817 pleasure is most to be found in safe and pure ways and the greatest happiness of life is to have a great many little happinesses  3 p 24 line 1030 the wonder and sorrow that in a country possessing an established church no book exists which can be put into the hands of youth to show them the best things that can be done in life and prevent their wasting it  4 p 28 line 2136 there is every reason to believe that susceptibility to beauty can be gained through proper training in childhood by almost everyone  5 p 29 line 3335 but if we are to attain to either a higher morality or a strong love of beauty such attainment must be the result of a strenuous effort and a strong will  6 p 41 line 1622 rightness of form and aspect must first be shown to the people in things which interest them and about the rightness of appearance in which it is possible for them to care a great deal  7 p 42 line 110 and therefore rightness of appearance of the bodies and the houses and the actions of the people of these large towns is of more importance than rightness of appearance in what is usually called art and pictures of noble action and passion and of beautiful scenery are of far greater value than art in things which cannot deeply affect human thought and feeling  the practical suggestions which deduced from these principles occupy the greater part of mr horsfalls second paper exhibit an untried group of resources in education and it will be to myself the best encouragement in whatever it has been my hope to institute of art school at oxford if the central influence of the university may be found capable of extension by such means in methods promoting the general happiness of the people of england  brantwood 28th june 1883   footnotes  footnote 21 introduction by mr ruskin to a pamphlet

hearts and brains have been opened to perceive beauty richter has somewhere said that mans greatest defect is that he has such a lot of small ones with equal truth it may be said that the greatest happiness man can have is to have a great many little happinesses and therefore a strong love of beauty which enables almost every square inch of unspoiled country to give us pleasant sensations is one of the best possessions we can have  3 it must be evident to everyone who watches life carefully that hardly anyone reaches the objects which all should live for who does not strive to reach them and that at present not one person in a hundred so much as knows what are the objects which should be sought in life it is astounding therefore that in a country which possesses an established church richly endowed universities and even several professors of education no book exists which can be put into the hands of every intelligent youth and of every intelligent father and mother showing what our wisest and best men believe are the best things which can be done in life and what is the kind of training which makes the doing of these things most easy it is often said that each of us can profit only by his own experience but no one believes that no one can see how many wellmeaning persons mistake means for ends and drift into error and sin simply because neither they nor their parents have known what course should be steered and what equipment is needed in the voyage of lifeno one can see this and doubt that a guidebook to life containing the results of the comparison of the experiences of even halfadozen able and sincere men would save countless people from wasting their lives as most lives are now wasted  4 that which is true with regard to music is true with regard to beauty of form and color because a great many grownup people in spite of great efforts find it impossible to sing correctly or even to perceive any pleasantness in music it used to be commonly supposed that a great many people are born without the power of gaining love of and skill in music now it is known that it is a question of early training that in every thousand children there are very fewnot i believe on an average more than two or threewho cannot gain the power of singing correctly and of enjoying music if they are taught well in childhood while their nervous system can still easily form habits and has not yet formed the habit of being insensible to differences of sound  there is every reason to believe that susceptibility to beauty of form and color can also be gained through proper training in childhood by almost everyone  5 in such circumstances as ours there is no such thing as a wise passiveness if we are to attain to a high morality or to strong love of beauty attainment must be the result of strenuous effort of strong will  6 the principle i refer to is that as art is the giving of right or beautiful form or of beautiful or right appearance if we desire to make people take keen interest in art if we desire to make them love good art we must show it them when applied to things which themselves are very interesting to them and about the rightness of appearance of which it is therefore possible for them to care a great deal  7 success in bringing the influence of art to bear on the masses of the population in large towns or on any set of people who have to earn their bread and have not time to acquire an unhealthy appetite for nonsense verses or nonsense pictures will certainly only be attained by persons who know that art is important just in proportion to the importance of that which it clothes and who themselves feel that rightness of appearance of the bodies and the houses and the actions in short of the whole life of the population of those large towns which are now or threaten soon to be england is of far greater importance than rightness of appearance in all that which is usually called art and who feel to speak of only the fine arts that rightness of appearance in pictures of noble action and passion and of beautiful scenery love of which is almost a necessary of mental health is of far greater importance than art can be in things which cannot deeply affect human thought and feelinged                                         notes on natural science  the color of the rhine 1834  the strata of mont blanc 1834  the

sufficiently ascertained i do not mean that effect of color which is simply optical as the color of the sea which is regulated by the sky above or the state of the atmosphere but i mean the settled color of transparent water which has when analyzed been found pure now copper will tinge water green and that very strongly but water thus impregnated will not be transparent and will deposit the copper it holds in solution upon any piece of iron which may be thrown into it there is a lake in a defile on the northwest flank of snowdon which is supplied by a stream which previously passes over several veins of copper this lake is of course of a bright verdigris green but it is not transparent now the coloring effect of which i speak is well seen in the water of the rhone and rhine the former of these rivers when it enters the lake of geneva after having received the torrents descending from the mountains of the valais is fouled with mud or white with the calcareous matter which it holds in solution having deposited this in the lake leman25 thereby gradually forming an immense delta it issues from the lake perfectly pure and flows through the streets of geneva so transparent that the bottom can be seen twenty feet below the surface jet so blue that you might imagine it to be a solution of indigo in like manner the rhine after purifying itself in the lake of constance flows forth colored of a clear green and this under all circumstances and in all weathers it is sometimes said that this arises from the torrents which supply these rivers generally flowing from the glaciers the green and blue color of which may have given rise to this opinion but the color of the ice is purely optical as the fragments detached from the mass appear white perhaps some

interesting to the geologist as they are to the painter the granite is dark red often inclosing veins of quartz crystallized and compact and likewise wellformed crystals of schorl the average elevation of its range of peaks which extends from mont blanc to the tète noire is about 12000 english feet above the level of the sea the highest culminating point is 15744 feet the aiguille de servoz and that of dru are excellent examples of the pyramidal and spiratory formation which these granite ranges in general assume they rise out of immense fields of snow but being themselves too steep for snow to rest upon form red bare and inaccessible peaks which even the chamois scarcely dares to climb their bases appear sometimes abutted if i may so speak by mica slate which forms the

geneva to chamonix are somewhat remarkable the rock is a hard dark brown limestone forming part of a range of secondary cliffs which rise from 500 feet to 1000 feet above the defile which they border

it owing that the stones in buildings formed originally of the frailest materials gradually become indurated by exposure to the atmosphere and by age and stand the wear and tear of time and weather every bit as well in some instances much better than the hardest and most compact limestones and granite29  272 in addition to the fact mentioned by mr hunter30 relative to the induration of soft sandstone i would adduce an excellent example of the same effect in the cathedral of basle in switzerland the cathedral is wholly built of a soft coarsegrained sandstone of so deep a red as to resemble longburned brick the numerous and delicate ornaments and fine tracery on the exterior are in a state of excellent preservation and present none of the moldering appearance so common in old cathedrals that are built of stone which when quarried was much harder than this sandstone the pavement in the interior is composed of the same material and as almost every slab is a tomb it is charged with the arms names and often statues in low relief of those who lie below delicately sculptured in the soft material yet though these sculptures have been worn for ages by the feet of multitudes they are very little injured they still stand out in bold and distinct relief not an illegible letter not an untraceable ornament is to be found and it is said and i believe with truth that they have now grown so hard as not to be in the least degree farther worn by the continual tread of thousands and that the longer the stone is exposed to the air the harder it becomes the cathedral was built in 1019  273 the causes of the different effects of air on stone must be numerous and the investigation of them excessively difficult with regard first to rocks en masse if their structure be crystalline or their composition argillaceous the effect of the air will i think ordinarily be found injurious thus in granite which has a kind of parallelogrammatic cleavage water introduces itself into the fissures and the result in a sharp frost will be a disintegration of the rocks en masse and if the felspar be predominant in the composition of the granite it will be subject to a rapid decomposition the morvine of some of the chamouni and allée blanche glaciers is composed of a white granite being chiefly composed of quartz and felspar with a little chlorite the sand and gravel at the edge of these glaciers appears far more the result of decomposition than attrition all finely foliated rocks slates etc are liable to injury from frost or wet weather the road of the simplon on the italian side is in some parts dangerous in or after wet weather on account of the rocks of slate continually falling from the overhanging mountains above this however is mere disintegration not decomposition not so with the breccias of central switzerland the rock of righi is composed of pebbles of different kinds joined by a red argillaceous gluten when this rock has not been exposed to the air it is very hard you may almost as easily break the pebbles as detach them from their matrix but when exposed for a few years to wind and weather the matrix becomes soft and the pebbles may be easily detached i was struck with the difference between this rock and a breccia at epinal in france where the matrix was a red sandstone like that of the cathedral at basle here though the rock had every appearance of having been long exposed to the air it was as hard as iron and it was utterly impossible to detach any of the pebbles from the bed it was difficult even to break the rock at all i cannot positively state that the gluten in these sandstones is calcareous but i suppose it to have been so compact calcareous rock as far as i remember appears to be subject to no injury from the weather many churches in italy and almost the whole cities of venice and genoa are built of very fine marble and the perfection of the delicate carvings however aged is most remarkable i remember a church near pavia coated with the finest and most expensive marbles a range of beautifully sculptured medallions running round its base though old were as distinct and fine in their execution as if they had just come out of the sculptors studio if therefore the gluten of the sandstone be either calcareous or siliceous it will naturally produce the effect above alluded to though it is certainly singular that the stone should be soft when first quarried sandstone is a rock in which you seldom see many cracks or fissures in the strata they are generally continuous and solid now there may be a certain degree of density in the mass which could not be increased without producing as in granite fissures running through it the particles may be supposed to be held in a certain degree of tension and there may be a tendency to what the french call assaissement i do not know the english term which is nevertheless resisted by the stone en masse and a quantity of water may likewise be held not in a state of chemical combination but in one of close mixture with the rock on being broken or quarried the assaissement may take place the particles of stone may draw closer together the attraction become stronger and on the exposure to the air the water however intimately combined will in a process of years be driven off occasioning the consolidation of the calcareous and the near approach of the siliceous particles and a consequent gradual induration of the whole body of the stone i offer this supposition with all diffidence there may be many other causes which cannot be developed until proper experiments have been made it would be interesting to ascertain the relative hardness of different specimens of sandstone taken from different depths in a bed the surface of which was exposed to the air as of specimens exposed to the air for different lengths of time    j r  herne hill july 25 1836   footnotes  footnote 27 londons magazine of natural history

footnote 29 loudons magazine of natural history vol ix no 65 pp 48890ed  footnote 30 the question here discussed was originally asked in the magazine vol ix pp 37980 by mr w perceval hunter with reference to the condition of bodiam castle in sussexed     observations on the causes which occasion the variation of temperature between spring and river waterby j r31   274 the difference in temperature between river and spring water which gives rise to the query of your correspondent indigena p 49132 may be the result of many causes the principal of which is however without doubt the interior heat of the earth it is a well known fact that this heat increases in a considerable ratio as we descend making a difference of several degrees between the temperature of the earth at its surface and at depths of 500 or 600 feet raising of course the temperature of all springs which have their source at even moderate depths and entirely securing them from the effects of frost which it is well known cannot penetrate the earth to a greater depth than 3 or 4 ft  275 many instances might be given of the strong effect of this interior heat the glaciers of the alps for instance frequently cover an extent of three or four square leagues with a mass of ice 400 500 or even 600 feet deep thus entirely preventing the access of exterior heat to the soil yet the radiation of heat from the ground itself is so powerful as to dissolve the ice very rapidly and to occasion streams of no inconsiderable size beneath the ice whose temperature in summer is i believe as far as can be ascertained not many degrees below that of streams exposed to the air and the radiation of heat from the water of these streams forms vaults under the ice which are frequently 40 ft or 50 ft above the water and which are formed as a glance will show not by the force of the stream which would only tear itself a broken cave sufficient for its passage but by the heat which radiates from it and gives the arch its immense height and beautifully regular form  these streams continue to flow in winter as well as in summer although in less quantity and it is this process which chiefly prevents the glacier from increasing in size for the melting at the surface is in comparison very inconsiderable even in summer the wind being cold the sun having little power and slight frosts being frequent during the night it is also this melting beneath the ice subglacial suppose we call it which loosens the ice from the ground and occasions or rather permits the perpetual downward movement with which    the glaciers cold and restless mass   moves onward day by day  276 but more forcible and striking evidence is afforded by experiments made in mines of great depth between 60 ft and 80 ft down the temperature of the earth is i believe the same at all times and in all places and below this depth it gradually increases near bex in the valais there is a perpendicular shaft 677 ft deep or about 732 ft english with water at the bottom the temperature of which was ascertained by saussure he does not tell us whether he used réaumurs or the centesimal thermometer but the result of his experiment was thisin a lateral gallery connected with the main shaft but deserted and therefore unaffected by breath or the heat of lamps at 321 ft 10 in below the surface the temperature of the water and the air was exactly the same 1112° or if the centesimal thermometer was used 5245 fahr if réaumurs 5778 fahr  277 in another gallery 564 feet below the surface the water and air had likewise the same temperature 1212° either 5445 or 6o14 fahr the water at the bottom 677 feet was 14° 5712 or 6314 fahr the ratio in which the heat increases therefore increased as we descend since a difference of 113 feet between the depth of the bottom of the shaft and the lowest gallery makes a greater difference in temperature than the difference of 243 feet between the lowest and upper gallery this heat is the more striking when it is considered that the water is impregnated with salt indeed saussure appears inclined to consider it accidental perhaps occasioned by the combustion of pyrites or other causes in the interior of the mountain voyages dans les alpes tom iv c 50 all experiments of this kind indeed are liable to error from the frequent occurrence of warm springs and other accidental causes of increase in temperature the water at the bottom of deep lakes is always found several degrees colder than the atmosphere even when the water at the surface is warmer but that may be accounted for by the difference in the specific gravity of water at different temperatures and as the heat of the sun and atmosphere in summer is greater than the mean heat of the earth at moderate depths the water at the bottom even if it becomes of the same heat with the earth must be colder than that at the surface which from its exposure to the sun becomes frequently warmer than the air the same causes affect the temperature of the sea and the greater saturation of the water below with salt renders it yet more susceptible of cold undercurrents from the poles and the sinking of the water of low temperature which results from the melting of the icebergs which float into warmer latitudes contribute still farther to lower the temperature of the deep sea if then the temperature of the sea at great depths is found not many degrees lower than that at the surface it would be a striking proof of the effect produced by the heat of the earth but i am not aware of the results of the experiments which have been made on this subject  278 we must then rest satisfied with the wellascertained fact that the temperature of the earth even at depths of a few feet never descends in temperate latitudes to the freezing point and that at the depth of 60 feet it is always the same in winter much higher in summer considerably lower than that of the atmosphere spring water then which has its source at a considerable depth will when it first rises be of this mean temperature while after it has flowed for some distance it becomes of the temperature of the atmosphere or in summer even warmer owing to the action of the sun both directly and reflected or radiated from its bottom besides this equable temperature in the water itself spring or well water is usually covered and even if exposed if the well is very deep the water will not freeze or at least very slightly for frost does not act with its full power except where there is a free circulation of air in open ponds wherever bushes hang over the water the ice is weak indigenas supposition that there are earthy particles in river water which render it more susceptible of cold than spring water cannot be true for then the relative temperatures would be the same in winter and in summer which is not the case and besides there are frequently more earthy particles in mineral springs or even common land springs than in clear river water provided it has not been fouled by extraneous matter for it has a tendency to deposit the earthy particles which it holds in suspension  279 it is evident also that the supposition of mr carr vol v p 395 relative to anchor frosts that the stones at the bottom acquire a greater degree of cold or to speak more correctly lose more heat than the water is erroneous j g has given the reasons at p 770 and the glaciers of switzerland afford us an example when a stone is deposited on a glacier of any considerable size but not larger than 1 foot or 18 inches in diameter it becomes penetrated with the heat of the sun melts the ice below it and sinks into the glacier but this effect does not cease as might be supposed when the stone sinks beneath the water which it has formed on the contrary it continues to absorb heat from the rays of the sun to keep the water above it liquid by its radiation and to sink deeper into the body of the glacier until it gets down beyond the reach of the suns rays when the water of the well which it has formed is no longer kept liquid and the stone is buried in the ice in summer however the water is kept liquid and circular wells formed in this manner are of frequent occurrence on the glaciers sometimes in the morning covered by a thin crust of ice  thus the stones at the bottom of streams must tend to raise rather than lower this temperature is it possible that in the agitation of a stream at its bottom if violent momentary and minute vacua may be formed tending to increase the intensity of the cold  herne hill sept 2 1836   footnotes  footnote 31 londons

winterin the summer time the river water is much warmer than that from a spring during the severe frosts of winter it is colder and when the stream is covered over with ice the spring that is well or pump water is unaffected by frost does this difference proceed from the exposure of the surface of the river water in summer to the suns direct influence and in winter to that of frost while the well

280 the comparison and estimation of the relative advantages of separate departments of science is a task which is always partially executed because it is never entered upon with an unbiased mind for since it is only the accurate knowledge of a science which can enable us to present its beauty or estimate its utility the branches of knowledge with which we are most familiar will always appear the most important the endeavor therefore to judge of the relative beauty or interest of the sciences is utterly hopeless let the astronomer boast of the magnificence of his speculations the mathematician of the immutability of his facts the chemist of the infinity of his combinations and we will admit that they all have equal ground for their enthusiasm but the highest standard of estimation is that of utility the far greater proportion of mankind the uninformed who are unable to perceive the beauty of the sciences whose benefits they experience are the true the just the only judges of their relative importance it is they who feel what impartial men of learning know that the mass of general knowledge is a perfect and beautiful body among whose members there should be no schism and whose prosperity must always be greatest when none are partially pursued and none unduly rejected we do not therefore advance any proud and unjustifiable claims to the superiority of that branch of science for the furtherance of which this society has been formed over all others but we zealously come forward to deprecate the apathy with which it has long been regarded to dissipate the prejudices which that apathy alone could have engendered and to vindicate its claims to an honorable and equal position among the proud thrones of its sister sciences we do not bring meteorology forward as a pursuit adapted for the occupation of tedious leisure or the amusement of a careless hour such qualifications are no inducements to its pursuit by men of science and learning and to these alone do we now address ourselves neither do we advance it on the ground of its interest or beauty though it is a science possessing both in no ordinary degree as to its beauty it may be remarked that it is not calculated to harden the mind it strengthens and bind it down to the measurement of magnitudes and estimation of quantities destroying all higher feelings all finer sensibilities it is not to be learned among the gaseous exhalations of the deathful laboratory it has no dwelling in the cold caves of the dark earth it is not to be followed up among the charnel houses of creation but it is a science of the pure air and of the bright heaven its thoughts are amidst the loveliness of creation it leads the mind as well as the eye to the morning mist and the noonday glory and the twilightcloud to the purple peace of the mountain heaven to the cloudy repose of the green valley now expatiating in the silence of stormless ether now on the rushing of the wings of the wind it is indeed a knowledge which must be felt to be in its very essence full of the soul of the beautiful for its interest it is universal unabated in every place and in all time he whose kingdom is the heaven can never meet with an uninteresting space can never exhaust the phenomena of an hour he is in a realm of perpetual change of eternal motion of infinite mystery light and darkness and cold and heat are to him as friends of familiar countenance but of infinite variety of conversation and while the geologist yearns for the mountain the botanist for the field and the mathematician for the study the meteorologist like a spirit of a higher order than any rejoices in the kingdoms of the air  281 but as we before said it is neither for its interest nor for its beauty that we recommend the study of meteorology it involves questions of the highest practical importance and the solution of which will be productive of most substantial benefit to those classes who can least comprehend the speculations from which these advantages are derived times and seasons and climates calms and tempests clouds and winds whose alternations appear to the inexperienced mind the confused consequences of irregular indefinite and accidental causes arrange themselves before the meteorologist in beautiful succession of undisturbed order in direct derivation from definite causes it is for him to trace the path of the tempest round the globe to point out the place whence it arose to foretell the time of its decline to follow the hours around the earth as she spins beneath her pyramid of night to feel the pulses of ocean to pursue the course of its currents and its changes to measure the power direction and duration of mysterious and invisible influences and to assign constant and regular periods to the seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night which we know shall not cease till the universe be no more it may be thought we are exaggerating the effects of a science which is yet in its infancy but it must be remembered that we are not speaking of its attained but of its attainable power it is the young hercules for the fostering of whose strength the meteorological society has been formed  282 there is one point it must now be observed in which the science of meteorology differs from all others a galileo or a newton by the unassisted workings of his solitary mind may discover the secrets of the heavens and form a new system of astronomy a davy in his lonely meditations on the crags of cornwall or in his solitary laboratory might discover the most sublime mysteries of nature and trace out the most intricate combinations of her elements but the meteorologist is impotent if alone his observations are useless for they are made upon a point while the speculations to be derived from them must be on space it is of no avail that he changes his position ignorant of what is passing behind him and before he desires to estimate the movements of space and can only observe the dancing of atoms he would calculate the currents of the atmosphere of the world while he only knows the direction of a breeze it is perhaps for this reason that the cause of meteorology has hitherto been so slightly supported no progress can be made by the most gigantic efforts of a solitary intellect and the cooperation demanded was difficult to obtain because it was necessary that the individuals should think observe and act simultaneously though separated from each other by distances on the greatness of which depended the utility of the observations  283 the meteorological society therefore has been formed not for a city nor for a kingdom but for the world it wishes to be the central point the moving power of a vast machine and it feels that unless it can be this it must be powerless if it cannot do all it can do nothing it desires to have at its command at stated periods perfect systems of methodical and simultaneous observationsit wishes its influence and its power to be omnipotent over the globe so that it may be able to know at any given instant the state of the atmosphere at every point on its surface let it not be supposed that this is a chimerical imagination the vain dream of a few philosophical enthusiasts it is cooperation which we now come forward to request in full confidence that if our efforts are met with a zeal worthy of the cause our associates will be astonished individually by the result of their labors in a body let none be discouraged because they are alone or far distant from their associates what was formerly weakness will now have become strength let the pastor of the alps observe the variations of his mountain winds let the voyagers send us notes of the changes on the surface of the sea let the solitary dweller in the american prairie observe the passages of the storms and the variations of the climate and each who alone would have been powerless will find himself a part of one mighty mind a ray of light entering into one vast eye a member of a multitudinous power contributing to the knowledge and aiding the efforts which will be capable of solving the most deeply hidden problems of nature penetrating into the most occult causes and reducing to principle and order the vast multitude of beautiful and wonderful phenomena by which the wisdom and benevolence of the supreme deity regulates the course of the times and the seasons robes the globe with verdure and fruitfulness and adapts it to minister to the wants and contribute to the felicity of the innumerable tribes of

state of meteorological science the society was instituted in 1823 but appears to have published no previous transactionsed     on tree twigs34   284 the speakers purpose was to exhibit the development of the common forms of branch in dicotyledonous trees from the fixed type of the annual shoot three principal modes of increase and growth might be distinguished in all accumulative change namely  1 simple aggregation having no periodical or otherwise defined limit and subject only to laws of cohesion and crystallization as in inorganic matter  2 addition of similar parts to each other under some law fixing their limits and securing their unity  3 enlargement or systematic change in arrangement of a typical form as in the growth of the members of an animal  285 the growth of trees came under the second of these heads a tree did not increase in stem or boughs as the wrist and hand of a child increased to the wrist and hand of a man but it was built up by additions of similar parts as a city is increased by the building of new rows of houses  any annual shoot was most conveniently to be considered as a single rod which would always grow vertically if possible  every such rod or pillar was in common timber trees typically either polygonal in section or rectangular  if polygonal the leaves were arranged on it in a spiral order as in the elm or oak  if rectangular the leaves were arranged on it in pairs set alternately at right angles to each other  intermediate forms connected each of these types with those of monocotyledonous trees the structure of the arbor vitæ might be considered as typically representing the link between the rectangular structure and that of monocotyledons and that of the pine between the polygonal structure and that of monocotyledons  every leaf during its vitality secreting carbon from the atmosphere with the elements of water formed a certain quantity of woody tissue which extended down the outside of the tree to the ground and farther to the extremities of the roots the mode in which this descending masonry was added appeared to depend on the peculiar functions of cambium and the speaker believed was as yet unexplained by botanists  286 every leaf besides forming this masonry all down the tree protected a bud at the base of its own stalk from this bud unless rendered abortive a new shoot would spring next year now supposing that out of the leafbuds on each shoot of a pentagonal tree only five at its extremity or on its side were permitted to develop themselves even under this limitation the number of shoots developed from a single one in the seventh year would be 78125 the external form of a healthily grown tree at any period of its development was therefore composed of a mass of sprays whose vitality was approximately distributed over the surface of the tree to an equal depth the branches beneath at once supported and were fed by this orbicular field or animated external garment of vegetation from every several leaf of which as from an innumerable multitude of small green fountains the streams of woody fiber descended met and united as rivers do and gathered their full flood into the strength of the stem  287 the principal errors which had been committed by artists in drawing trees had arisen from their regarding the bough as ramifying irregularly and somewhat losing in energy towards the extremity whereas the real boughs threw their whole energy and multiplied their substance towards the extremities ranking themselves in more or less cupshaped tiers round the trunk and forming a compact united surface at the exterior of the tree  288 in the course of arrival at this form the bough throughout its whole length showed itself to be influenced by a force like that of an animals instinct its minor curves and angles were all subjected to one strong ruling tendency and law of advance dependent partly on the aim of every shoot to raise itself upright partly on the necessity which each was under to yield due place to the neighboring leaves and obtain for itself as much light and air as possible it had indeed been ascertained that vegetable tissue was liable to contractions and expansion under fixed mechanical conditions by light heat moisture etc but vegetable tissue in the living branch did not contract nor expand under external influence alone the principle of life manifested itself either by contention with or felicitous recognition of external force it accepted with a visible active and apparently joyful concurrence the influences which led the bough towards its due place in the economy of the tree and it obeyed reluctantly partially and with distorted curvatures those which forced it to violate the typical organic form the attention of painters of foliage had seldom been drawn with sufficient accuracy to the lines either of branch curvature or leaf contour as expressing these subtle laws of incipient volition but the relative merit of the great schools of figure design might in absence of all other evidence be determined almost without error by observing the precision of their treatment of leaf curvature the leafpainting round the head of ariosto by titian in the national gallery might be instanced  289 the leaf thus differed from the flower in forming and protecting behind it not only the bud in which was the form of a new shoot like itself but a piece of permanent work and produced substance by which every following shoot could be placed under different circumstances from its predecessor every leaf labored to solidify this substance during its own life but the seed left by the flower matured only as the flower perished  this difference in the action and endurance of the flower and leaf had been applied by nearly all great nations as a type of the variously active and productive states of life among individuals or commonwealths chaucers poem of the flower and leaf is the most definite expression of the mediæval feeling in this respect while the fables of the rape of proserpine and of apollo and daphne embody that of the greeks there is no greek goddess corresponding to the flora of the romans their flora is persephone the bringer of death she plays for a little while in the sicilian fields gathering flowers then snatched away by pluto receives her chief power as she vanishes from our sight and is crowned in the grave daphne on the other hand is the daughter of one of the great arcadian river gods and of the earth she is the type of the river mist filling the rocky vales of arcadia the sun pursuing this mist from dell to dell is apollo pursuing daphne where the mist is protected from his rays by the rock shadows the laurel and other richest vegetation spring by the riversides so that the laurelleaf becomes the type in the greek mind of the beneficent ministry and vitality of the rivers and the earth under the beams of sunshine and therefore it is chosen to form the signetcrown of highest honor for gods or men honor for work born of the strength and dew of the earth and informed by the central light of heaven work living perennial and beneficent    j r   footnotes  footnote 34 read by mr ruskin at the weekly evening meeting of the royal institution see proceedings vol iii pp 35860 april 19 1861ed     on the forms of the stratified alps of savoy35   290 the purpose of the discourse was to trace some of the influences which have produced the present external forms of the stratified mountains of savoy and the probable extent and results of the future operation of such influences  the subject was arranged under three heads    i the materials of the savoy alps   ii the mode of their formation   iii the mode of their subsequent sculpture  291 i their materialsthe investigation was limited to those alps which consist in whole or in part either of jura limestone of neocomian beds or of the hippurite limestone and include no important masses of other formations all these rocks are marine deposits and the first question to be considered with respect to the development of mountains out of them is the kind of change they must undergo in being dried whether prolonged through vast periods of time or hastened by heat and pressure the drying and solidification of such rocks involved their contraction and usually in consequence their being traversed throughout by minute fissures under certain conditions of pressure these fissures take the aspect of slaty cleavage under others they become irregular cracks dividing all the substance of the stone if these are not filled the rock would become a mere heap of débris and be incapable of establishing itself in any bold form this is provided against by a metamorphic action which either arranges the particles of the rock throughout in new and more crystalline conditions or else causes some of them to separate from the rest to traverse the body of the rock and arrange themselves in its fissures thus forming a cement usually of finer and purer substance than the rest of the stone in either case the action tends continually to the purification and segregation of the elements of the stone the energy of such action depends on accidental circumstances first on the attractions of the component elements among themselves secondly on every change of external temperature and relation so that mountains are at different periods in different stages of health so to call it or disease we have mountains of a languid temperament mountains with checked circulations mountains in nervous fevers mountains in atrophy and decline  292 this change in the structure of existing rocks is traceable through continuous gradations so that a black mud or calcareous slime is imperceptibly modified into a magnificently hard and crystalline substance inclosing nests of beryl topaz and sapphire and veined with gold but it cannot be determined how far or in what localities these changes are yet arrested in the plurality of instances they are evidently yet in progress it appears rational to suppose that as each rock approaches to its perfect type the change becomes slower its perfection being continually neared but never reached its change being liable also to interruption or reversal by new geological phenomena in the process of this change rocks expand or contract and in portions their multitudinous fissures give them a ductility or viscosity like that of glacierice on a larger scale so that many formations are best to be conceived as glaciers or frozen fields of crag whose depth is to be measured in miles instead of fathoms whose crevasses are filled with solvent flame with vapor with gelatinous flint or with crystallizing elements of mingled natures the whole mass changing its dimensions and flowing into new channels though by gradations which cannot be measured and in periods of time of which human life forms no appreciable unit  293 ii formationmountains are to be arranged with respect to their structure under two great classesthose which are cut out of the beds of which they are composed and those which are formed by the convolution or contortion of the beds themselves the savoy mountains are chiefly of this latter class when stratified formations are contorted it is usually either by pressure from below which raises one part of the formation above the rest or by lateral pressure which reduces the whole formation into a series of waves the ascending pressure may be limited in its sphere of operation the lateral one necessarily affects extensive tracts of country and the eminences it produces vanish only by degrees like the waves left in the wake of a ship the savoy mountains have undergone both these kinds of violence in very complex modes and at different periods so that it becomes almost impossible to trace separately and completely the operation of any given force at a given point  294 the speakers intention was to have analyzed as far as possible the action of the forming forces in one wave of simple elevation the mont salève and in another of lateral compression the mont brezon but the investigation of the mont salève had presented unexpected difficulty its façade had been always considered to be formed by vertical beds raised into that position during the tertiary periods the speakers investigations had on the contrary led him to conclude that the appearance of vertical beds was owing to a peculiarly sharp and distinct cleavage at right angles with the beds but nearly parallel to their strike elsewhere similarly manifested in the jurassic series of savoy and showing itself on the fronts of most of the precipices formed of that rock the attention of geologists was invited to the determination of this question  the compressed wave of the brezon more complex in arrangement was more clearly defined a section of it was given showing the reversed position of the hippurite limestone in the summit and lower precipices this limestone wave was shown to be one of a great series running parallel with the alps and constituting an undulatory district chiefly composed of chalk beds separated from the higher limestone district of the jura and lias by a long trench or moat filled with members of the tertiary serieschiefly nummulite limestones and flysch this trench might be followed from faverges at the head of the lake of annecy across savoy it separated mont vergi from the mont dorons and the dent doche from the dent du midi then entered switzerland separating the moleson from the diablerets passed on through the districts of thun and brientz and dividing itself into two caused the zigzagged form of the lake of lucerne the principal branch then passed between the high sentis and the glarnisch and broke into confusion in the tyrol on the north side of this trench the chalk beds were often vertical or cast into repeated folds of which the escarpments were mostly turned away from the alps but on the south side of the trench the jurassic triassic and carboniferous beds though much distorted showed a prevailing tendency to lean towards the alps and turn their escarpments to the central chain  295 both these systems of mountains are intersected by transverse valleys owing their origin in the first instance to a series of transverse curvilinear fractures which affect the forms even of every minor ridge and produce its principal ravines and boldest rocks even where no distinctly excavated valleys exist thus the mont vergi and the aiguilles of salouvre are only fragmentary remains of a range of horizontal beds once continuous but broken by this transverse system of curvilinear cleavage and worn or weathered into separate summits  the means of this ultimate sculpture or weathering were lastly to be considered                                       296 iii sculpturethe final reductions of mountainform are owing either to disintegration or to the action of water in the condition of rain rivers or ice aided by frost and other circumstances of temperature and atmosphere  all important existing forms are owing to disintegration or the action of water that of ice had been curiously overrated as an instrument of sculpture ice is much less powerful than water the apparently energetic effects of it being merely the exponents of disintegration a glacier did not produce its moraine but sustained and exposed the fragments which fell on its surface pulverizing these by keeping them in motion but producing very unimportant effects on the rock below the roundings and striation produced by ice were superficial while a torrent penetrated into every angle and cranny undermining and wearing continually and carrying stones at the lowest estimate six hundred thousand times as fast as the glacier had the quantity of rain which has fallen on mont blanc in the form of snow and descended in the ravines as ice fallen as rain and descended in torrents the ravines would have been much deeper than they are now and the glacier may so far be considered as exercising a protective influence but its power of carriage is unlimited and when masses of earth or rock are once loosened the glacier carries them away and exposes fresh surfaces generally the work of water and ice is in mountain surgery like that of lancet and spongeone for incision the other for ablution no excavation by ice was possible on a large scale any more than by a stream of honey and its various actions with their limitations were only to be understood by keeping always clearly in view the great law of its motion as a viscous substance determined by professor james forbes  297 the existing forms of the alps are therefore traceable chiefly to denudation as they rose from the sea followed by more or less violent aqueous action partly arrested during the glacial periods while the produced diluvium was carried away into the valley of the rhine or into the north sea one very important result of denudation had not yet been sufficiently regarded namely that when portions of a thick bed as the rudistenkalk had been entirely removed the weight of the remaining masses pressing unequally on the inferior beds would when these were soft as the neocomian marls press them up into arched conditions like those of the floors of coalmines in what the miners called creeps many anomalous positions of the beds of spatangenkalk in the district of the lake of annecy were in all probability owing to this cause they might be studied advantageously in the sloping base of the great rochers de lanfon which disintegrating in curved nearly vertical flakes each a thousand feet in height were nevertheless a mere outlying remnant of the great horizontal formation of the parmelan and formed like it of very thin horizontal beds of rudistenkalk imposed on shaly masses of neocomian modified by their pressure more complex forms of harder rock were wrought by the streams and rains into fantastic outlines and the transverse gorges were cut deep where they had been first traced by fault or distortion the analysis of this aqueous action would alone require a series of discourses but the sum of the facts was that the best and most interesting portions of the mountains were just those which were finally left the centers and joints as it were of the alpine anatomy immeasurable periods of time would be required to wear these away and to all appearances during the process of their destruction others were rising to take their place and forms of perhaps far more nobly organized mountain would witness the collateral progress of humanity    j r   footnotes  footnote 35 read by mr ruskin at the weekly evening meeting of the royal institution see proceedings vol iv pp 14246 june 5 1863ed     the range of intellectual conception proportioned to the rank in animated life36  a theorem   298 i suppose this theorem to be a truism but i venture to state it because it is surely desirable that it should be recognized as an axiom by metaphysicians and practically does not seem to me yet to have been so i say animated life because the word life by itself might have been taken to include that of vegetables and i say animated instead of spiritual life because the latin anima and pretty italian corruption of it alma involving the new idea of nourishment of the body as by the aliment or alms of god seems to me to convey a better idea of the existence of conscious creatures than any derivative of spiritus pneuma or psyche  i attach however a somewhat lower sense to the word conception than is i believe usual with metaphysicians for as a painter i belong to a lower rank of animated being than theirs and can only mean by conception what i know of it a painter never conceives anything absolutely and is indeed incapable of conceiving anything at all except as a phenomenon or sensation or as the mode or locus of a phenomenon or sensation that which is not an appearance or a feeling or a mode of one or the other is to him nothing  299 for instance he would deny the definition of the phenomenon which he is himself first concerned in producinga lineas length without breadth he would say that which has no breadth is nothing and nothing cannot be long he would define a line as a narrow and long phenomenon and a mathematicians idea of it as an idea of the direction of such a phenomenon  the act of conception or imagination with him therefore is merely the memory simple or combined of things that he has seen or felt he has no ray no incipience of faculty beyond this no quantity of the sternest training in the school of hegel would ever enable him to think the absolute he would persist in an obstinate refusal to use the word think at all in a transitive sense he would never for instance say i think the table but i think the table is turning or is not as the case might be and if he were to be taught in any school whatever to conceive a table his first demand would be that he should be shown one or referred to other things that had the qualities of one in illustrative degree  300 and even respecting the constant methods or laws of phenomena he cannot raise the statement of them into an act of conception the statement that two right lines can never inclose a space merely appears to him another form of verbal definition or at the grandest a definition in prophetic extent saying in other words that a line which incloses or ever may inclose a space is not and never will be a right one he would admit that what he now conceives as two things doubled would always be what he now conceives as four things but assuming the existence of a world in which whenever two things were actually set in juxtaposition with other two things they became actually three times or actually five he supposes that the practice of arithmetic and laws of it would change in relation to this new condition in matter and he accepts therefore the statement that twice two are four only as an accident of the existing phenomena of matter  301 a painter therefore may i think be looked upon as only representing a high order of sensational creatures incapable of any but physical ideas and impressions and i continue my paper therefore only in the name of the docile and therefore improvable part of the brute creation  and in their name i would suggest that we should be much more docile than we are if we were never occupied in efforts to conceive things above our natures to take an instance in a creature somewhat lower than myself i came by surprise the other day on a cuttlefish in a pool at low tide on being touched with the point of my umbrella he first filled the pool with ink and then finding himself still touched in the darkness lost his temper and attacked the umbrella with much psyche or anima hugging it tightly with all his eight arms and making efforts like an impetuous baby with a coral to get it into his mouth on my offering him a finger instead he sucked that with two or three of his arms with an apparently malignant satisfaction and on being shaken off retired with an air of frantic misanthropy into the cloud of his ink  302 now it seems to me not a little instructive to reflect how entirely useless such a manifestation of a superior being was to his cuttlefish mind and how fortunate it was for his fellowoctopods that he had no command of pens as well as ink nor any disposition to write on the nature of umbrellas or of men  it may be observed further that whatever ideas he was able to form respecting either were positively falseso contrary to truth as to be worse than none and simply dangerous to himself so far as he might be induced to act upon themthat namely an umbrella was an eatable thing or a man a conquerable one that the individual man who looked at him was hostile to him or that his purposes could be interfered with by ejection of ink every effort made by the fish under these convictions was harmful to himself his only wisdom would have been to lie quietly and unreflectively in his pool  and with us painters also the only result of any efforts we make to acquaint ourselves with the subjects of metaphysical inquiry has been an increased sense of the prudence of lying placidly and unreflectively in our pools or at least limiting ourselves to such gentle efforts of imagination as may be consistent with the as yet imperfectly developed powers i do not say even of cephalopodic but of ascidian nervous centers  303 but it may be easily imagined how pleasantly to persons thus subdued in selfestimation the hope presents itself which is involved in the darwinian theory that their pools themselves may be capable of indefinite extension and their natures of indefinite developmentthe hope that our descendants may one day be ashamed of us and debate the question of their parentage with astonishment and disgust  and it seems to me that the aim of elementary metaphysical study might henceforth become more practical than that of any other science for in hitherto taking little cognizance of the limitation of thought by the structure of the body we have surely also lost sight of the power of certain modes of thought over the processes of that structure taking for instance the emotion of anger of which the cephalopoda are indeed as capable as we are but inferior to us in being unable to decide whether they do well to be angry or not i do not think the chemical effect of that emotion on the particles of the blood in decomposing and otherwise paralyzing or debilitating them has been sufficiently examined nor the actual quantity of nervous energy which a fit of anger of given violence withdraws from the body and restores to space neither the correlative power of volition in restraining the passion or in directing the choice of salutary thought as of salutary herbs on streams and even we painters who dare not call ourselves capable of thought are capable of choice in more or less salutary vision in the degree in which we lose such power of choice in vision so that the spectral phenomena which are the materials of our industry present themselves under forms beyond our control we become insane and although for all our best work a certain degree of this insanity is necessary and the first occurring conceptions are uncommanded as in dreams we have when in health always instantaneous power of accepting some refusing others perfecting the outlines and colors of those we wish to keep and arranging them in such relations as we choose  304 and unquestionably the forms of the body which painters instinctively recognize as best and call beautiful are so far under the command of the plastic force of voluntary thought that the original and future authority of such a plastic force over the whole of creation cannot but seem to painters a direct though not a certain influence and they would at once give their adherence to the statement made many years since in his opening lectures in oxford by the present regius professor of medicine as far as i can recollect approximately in these termsthat it is quite as logical and far more easy to conceive of original anima as adapting itself to forms of substance than of original substance as adapting to itself modes of mind  305 it is surely therefore not too much to expect of future schools of metaphysicians that they will direct mankind into methods of thought which will be at once happy unerring and medicinal and therefore entirely wise that they will mark the limits beyond which uniformity must be dangerous and speculation vain and that they will at no distant period terminate the acrimony of theologians and the insolences as well as the sorrows of groundless faith by showing that it is appointed for us in common with the rest of the animal creation to live in the midst of an universe the nature of which is as much better than we can believe as it is greater than we can understand   footnotes  footnote 36 contemporary review june 1871ed                                         literature   fictionfair and foul  nineteenth century june august sept

march in this year i walked through what was once a country lane between the hostelry of the halfmoon at the bottom of herne hill and the secluded college of dulwich  in my young days croxsted lane was a green byroad traversable for some distance by carts but rarely so traversed and for the most part little else than a narrow strip of untilled field separated by blackberry hedges from the bettercaredfor meadows on each side of it growing more weeds therefore than they and perhaps in spring a primrose or twowhite archangeldaisies plenty and purple thistles in autumn a slender rivulet boasting little of its brightness for there are no springs at dulwich yet fed purely enough by the rain and morning dew here trickledthere loiteredthrough the long grass beneath the hedges and expanded itself where it might into moderately clear and deep pools in which under their veils of duckweed a freshwater shell or two sundry curious little skipping shrimps any quantity of tadpoles in their time and even sometimes a tittlebat offered themselves to my boyhoods pleased and not inaccurate observation there my mother and i used to gather the first buds of the hawthorn and there in after years i used to walk in the summer shadows as in a place wilder and sweeter than our garden to think over any passage i wanted to make better than usual in modern painters  so as aforesaid on the first kindly day of this year being thoughtful more than usual of those old times i went to look again at the place  2 often both in those days and since i have put myself hard to it vainly to find words wherewith to tell of beautiful things but beauty has been in the world since the world was made and human language can make a shift somehow to give account of it whereas the peculiar forces of devastation induced by modern city life have only entered the world lately and no existing terms of language known to me are enough to describe the forms of filth and modes of ruin that varied themselves along the course of croxsted lane the fields on each side of it are now mostly dug up for building or cut through into gaunt corners and nooks of blind ground by the wild crossings and concurrencies of three railroads half a dozen handfuls of new cottages with doric doors are dropped about here and there among the gashed ground the lane itself now entirely grassless is a deeprutted heavyhillocked cartroad diverging gatelessly into various brickfields or pieces of waste and bordered on each side by heaps ofhades only knows whatmixed dust of every unclean thing that can crumble in drought and mildew of every unclean thing that can rot or rust in damp ashes and rags beerbottles and old shoes battered pans smashed crockery shreds of nameless clothes doorsweepings floorsweepings kitchen garbage backgarden sewage old iron rotten timber jagged with outtorn nails cigarends pipebowls cinders bones and ordure indescribable and variously kneaded into sticking to or fluttering foully here and there over all theseremnants broadcast of every manner of newspaper advertisement or biglettered bill festering and flaunting out their last publicity in the pits of stinking dust and mortal slime  3 the lane ends now where its prettiest windings once began being cut off by a crossroad leading out of dulwich to a minor railway station and on the other side of this road what was of old the daintiest intricacy of its solitude is changed into a straight and evenly macadamized carriage drive between new houses of extreme respectability with good attached gardens and officesmost of these tenements being largerall more pretentious and many i imagine held at greatly higher rent than my fathers tenanted for twenty years at herne hill and it became matter of curious meditation to me what must here become of children resembling my poor little dreamy quondam self in temper and thus brought up at the same distance from london and in the same or better circumstances of worldly fortune but with only croxsted lane in its present condition for their country walk the trimly kept road before their doors such as one used to see in the fashionable suburbs of cheltenham or leamington presents nothing to their study but gravel and gaslamp posts the modern addition of a vermilion letterpillar contributing indeed to the splendor but scarcely to the interest of the scene and a child of any sense or fancy would hastily contrive escape from such a barren desert of politeness and betake itself to investigation such as might be feasible of the natural history of croxsted lane  4 but for its sense or fancy what food or stimulus can it find in that foul causeway of its youthful pilgrimage what would have happened to myself so directed i cannot clearly imagine possibly i might have got interested in the old iron and woodshavings and become an engineer or a carpenter but for the children of today accustomed from the instant they are out of their cradles to the sight of this infinite nastiness prevailing as a fixed condition of the universe over the face of nature and accompanying all the operations of industrious man what is to be the scholastic issue unless indeed the thrill of scientific vanity in the primary analysis of some unheardof process of corruptionor the reward of microscopic research in the sight of worms with more legs and acari of more curious generation than ever vivified the more simply smelling plasma of antiquity  one result of such elementary education is however already certain namely that the pleasure which we may conceive taken by the children of the coming time in the analysis of physical corruption guides into fields more dangerous and desolate the expatiation of an imaginative literature and that the reactions of moral disease upon itself and the conditions of languidly monstrous character developed in an atmosphere of low vitality have become the most valued material of modern fiction and the most eagerly discussed texts of modern philosophy  5 the many concurrent reasons for this mischief may i believe be massed under a few general heads38  i there is first the hot fermentation and unwholesome secrecy of the population crowded into large cities each mote in the misery lighter as an individual soul than a dead leaf but becoming oppressive and infectious each to his neighbor in the smoking mass of decay the resulting modes of mental ruin and distress are continually new and in a certain sense worth study in their monstrosity they have accordingly developed a corresponding science of fiction concerned mainly with the description of such forms of disease like the botany of leaflichens  in de balzacs story of father goriot a grocer makes a large fortune of which he spends on himself as much as may keep him alive and on his two daughters all that can promote their pleasures or their pride he marries them to men of rank supplies their secret expenses and provides for his favorite a separate and clandestine establishment with her lover on his deathbed he sends for this favorite daughter who wishes to come and hesitates for a quarter of an hour between doing so and going to a ball at which it has been for the last month her chief ambition to be seen she finally goes to the ball  the story is of course one of which the violent contrasts and spectral catastrophe could only take place or be conceived in a large city a village grocer cannot make a large fortune cannot marry his daughters to titled squires and cannot die without having his children brought to him if in the neighborhood by fear of village gossip if for no better cause  6 ii but a much more profound feeling than this mere curiosity of science in morbid phenomena is concerned in the production of the carefulest forms of modern fiction the disgrace and grief resulting from the mere trampling pressure and electric friction of town life become to the sufferers peculiarly mysterious in their undeservedness and frightful in their inevitableness the power of all surroundings over them for evil the incapacity of their own minds to refuse the pollution and of their own wills to oppose the weight of the staggering mass that chokes and crushes them into perdition brings every law of healthy existence into question with them and every alleged method of help and hope into doubt indignation without any calming faith in justice and selfcontempt without any curative selfreproach dull the intelligence and degrade the conscience into sullen incredulity of all sunshine outside the dunghill or breeze beyond the wafting of its impurity and at last a philosophy develops itself partly satiric partly consolatory concerned only with the regenerative vigor of manure and the necessary obscurities of fimetic providence showing how everybodys fault is somebody elses how infection has no law digestion no will and profitable dirt no dishonor  and thus an elaborate and ingenious scholasticism in what may be called the divinity of decomposition has established itself in connection with the more recent forms of romance giving them at once a complacent tone of clerical dignity and an agreeable dash of heretical impudence while the inculcated doctrine has the double advantage of needing no laborious scholarship for its foundation and no painful selfdenial for its practice  7 iii the monotony of life in the central streets of any great modern city but especially in those of london where every emotion intended to be derived by men from the sight of nature or the sense of art is forbidden forever leaves the craving of the heart for a sincere yet changeful interest to be fed from one source only under natural conditions the degree of mental excitement necessary to bodily health is provided by the course of the seasons and the various skill and fortune of agriculture in the country every morning of the year brings with it a new aspect of springing or fading nature a new duty to be fulfilled upon earth and a new promise or warning in heaven no day is without its innocent hope its special prudence its kindly gift and its sublime danger and in every process of wise husbandry and every effort of contending or remedial courage the wholesome passions pride and bodily power of the laborer are excited and exerted in happiest unison the companionship of domestic the care of serviceable animals soften and enlarge his life with lowly charities and discipline him in familiar wisdoms and unboastful fortitudes while the divine laws of seedtime which cannot be recalled harvest which cannot be hastened and winter in which no man can work compel the impatiences and coveting of his heart into labor too submissive to be anxious and rest too sweet to be wanton what thought can enough comprehend the contrast between such life and that in streets where summer and winter are only alternations of heat and cold where snow never fell white nor sunshine clear where the ground is only a pavement and the sky no more than the glass roof of an arcade where the utmost power of a storm is to choke the gutters and the finest magic of spring to change mud into dust wherechief and most fatal difference in statethere is no interest of occupation for any of the inhabitants but the routine of counter or desk within doors and the effort to pass each other without collision outside so that from morning to evening the only possible variation of the monotony of the hours and lightening of the penalty of existence must be some kind of mischief limited unless by more than ordinary godsend of fatality to the fall of a horse or the slitting of a pocket  8 i said that under these laws of inanition the craving of the human heart for some kind of excitement could be supplied from one source only it might have been thought by any other than a sternly tentative philosopher that the denial of their natural food to human feelings would have provoked a reactionary desire for it and that the dreariness of the street would have been gilded by dreams of pastoral felicity experience has shown the fact to be otherwise the thoroughly trained londoner can enjoy no other excitement than that to which he has been accustomed but asks for that in continually more ardent or more virulent concentration and the ultimate power of fiction to entertain him is by varying to his fancy the modes and defining for his dullness the horrors of death in the single novel of bleak house there are nine deaths or left for deaths in the drop scene carefully wrought out or led up to either by way of pleasing surprise as the babys at the brickmakers or finished in their threatenings and sufferings with as much enjoyment as can be contrived in the anticipation and as much pathology as can be concentrated in the description under the following varieties of method    one by assassination               mr tulkinghorn   one by starvation with phthisis   joe   one by chagrin                     richard   one by spontaneous combustion      mr krook   one by sorrow                      lady dedlocks lover   one by remorse                     lady dedlock   one by insanity                    miss flite   one by paralysis                   sir leicester  besides the baby by fever and a lively young frenchwoman left to be hanged  and all this observe not in a tragic adventurous or military story but merely as the further enlivenment of a narrative intended to be amusing and as a properly representative average of the statistics of civilian mortality in the center of london  9 observe further and chiefly it is not the mere number of deaths which if we count the odd troopers in the last scene is exceeded in old mortality and reached within one or two both in waverley and guy mannering that marks the peculiar tone of the modern novel it is the fact that all these deaths but one are of inoffensive or at least in the worlds estimate respectable persons and that they are all grotesquely either violent or miserable purporting thus to illustrate the modern theology that the appointed destiny of a large average of our population is to die like rats in a drain either by trap or poison not indeed that a lawyer in full practice can be usually supposed as faultless in the eye of heaven as a dove or a woodcock but it is not in former divinities thought the will of providence that he should be dropped by a shot from a client behind his firescreen and retrieved in the morning by his housemaid under the chandelier neither is lady dedlock less reprehensible in her conduct than many women of fashion have been and will be but it would not therefore have been thought poetically just in oldfashioned morality that she should be found by her daughter lying dead with her face in the mud of a st giless churchyard  10 in the work of the great masters death is always either heroic deserved or quiet and natural unless their purpose be totally and deeply tragic when collateral meaner death is permitted like that

function earning his fate is avenged to the uttermost on all the men conscious of the crime mr bertrams death like that of his wife brief in pain and each told in the space of half a dozen lines and that of the heroine of the tale selfdevoted heroic in the highest and happy  nor is it ever to be forgotten in the comparison of scotts with inferior work that his own splendid powers were even in early life tainted and in his latter years destroyed by modern conditions of commercial excitement then first but rapidly developing themselves there are parts even in his best novels colored to meet tastes which he despised and many pages written in his later ones to lengthen his article for the indiscriminate market  11 but there was one weakness of which his healthy mind remained incapable to the last in modern stories prepared for more refined or fastidious audiences than those of dickens the funereal excitement is obtained for the most part not by the infliction of violent or disgusting death but in the suspense the pathos and the more or less by all felt and recognized mortal phenomena of the sickroom the temptation to weak writers of this order of subject is especially great because the study of it from the livingor dyingmodel is so easy and to many has been the most impressive part of their own personal experience while if the description be given even with mediocre accuracy a very large section of readers will admire its truth and cherish its melancholy few authors of second or third rate genius can either record or invent a probable conversation in ordinary life but few on the other hand are so destitute of observant faculty as to be unable to chronicle the broken syllables and languid movements of an invalid the easily rendered and too surely recognized image of familiar suffering is felt at once to be real where all else had been false and the historian of the gestures of fever and words of delirium can count on the applause of a gratified audience as surely as the dramatist who introduces on the stage of his flagging action a carriage that can be driven or a fountain that will flow but the masters of strong imagination disdain such work and those of deep sensibility shrink from it39 only under conditions of personal weakness presently to be noted would scott comply with the cravings of his lower audience in scenes of terror like the death of frontdeboeuf but he never once withdrew the sacred curtain of the sickchamber nor permitted the disgrace of wanton tears round the humiliation of strength or the wreck of beauty  12 iv no exception to this law of reverence will be found in the scenes in coeur de lions illness introductory to the principal incident in the talisman an inferior writer would have made the king charge in imagination at the head of his chivalry or wander in dreams by the brooks of aquitaine but scott allows us to learn no more startling symptoms of the kings malady than that he was restless and impatient and could not wear his armor nor is any bodily weakness or crisis of danger permitted to disturb for an instant the royalty of intelligence and heart in which he examines trusts and obeys the physician whom his attendants fear  yet the choice of the main subject in this story and its companionthe trial to a point of utter torture of knightly faith and several passages in the conduct of both more especially the exaggerated scenes in the house of baldringham and hermitage of engedi are signs of the gradual decline in force of intellect and soul which those who love scott best have done him the worst injustice in their endeavors to disguise or deny the mean anxieties moral humiliations and mercilessly demanded braintoil which killed him show their sepulchral grasp for many and many a year before their final victory and the states of more or less dulled distorted and polluted imagination which culminate in castle dangerous cast a stygian hue over st ronans well the fair maid of perth and anne of geierstein which lowers them the first altogether the other two at frequent intervals into fellowship with the normal disease which festers throughout the whole body of our lower fictitious literature  13 fictitious i use the ambiguous word deliberately for it is impossible to distinguish in these tales of the prisonhouse how far their vice and gloom are thrown into their manufacture only to meet a vile demand and how far they are an integral condition of thought in the minds of men trained from their youth up in the knowledge of londinian and parisian misery the speciality of the plague is a delight in the exposition of the relations between guilt and decrepitude and i call the results of it literature of the prisonhouse because the thwarted habits of body and mind which are the punishment of reckless crowding in cities become in the issue of that punishment frightful subjects of exclusive interest to themselves and the art of fiction in which they finally delight is only the more studied arrangement and illustration by colored firelights of the daily bulletins of their own wretchedness in the prison calendar the police news and the hospital report  14 the reader will perhaps be surprised at my separating the greatest work of dickens oliver twist with honor from the loathsome mass to which it typically belongs that book is an earnest and uncaricatured record of states of criminal life written with didactic purpose full of the gravest instruction nor destitute of pathetic studies of noble passion even the mysteries of paris and gaboriaus crime dorcival are raised by their definiteness of historical intention and forewarning anxiety far above the level of their order and may be accepted as photographic evidence of an otherwise incredible civilization corrupted in the infernal fact of it down to the genesis of such figures as the vicomte dorcival the stabber40 the skeleton and the shewolf but the effectual head of the whole cretinous school is the renowned novel in which the hunchbacked lover watches the execution of his mistress from the tower of notredame and its strength passes gradually away into the anatomical preparations for the general market of novels like poor miss finch in which the heroine is blind the hero epileptic and the obnoxious brother is found dead with his hands dropped off in the arctic regions41  15 this literature of the prisonhouse understanding by the word not only the cell of newgate but also and even more definitely the cell of the hôteldieu the hôpital des fous and the grated corridor with the dripping slabs of the morgue having its central root thus in the ile de parisor historically and preeminently the cité de parisis when understood deeply the precise countercorruption of the religion of the sainte chapelle just as the worst forms of bodily and mental ruin are the corruption of love i have therefore called it fiction mécroyante with literal accuracy and precision according to the explanation of the word which the reader may find in any good french dictionary42 and round its arctic pole in the morgue he may gather into one caina of gelid putrescence the entire product of modern infidel imagination amusing itself with destruction of the body and busying itself with aberration of the mind  16 aberration palsy or plague observe as distinguished from normal evil just as the venom of rabies or cholera differs from that of a wasp or a viper the life of the insect and serpent deserves or at least permits our thoughts not so the stages of agony in the furydriven hound there is some excuse indeed for the pathologic labor of the modern novelist in the fact that he cannot easily in a city population find a healthy mind to vivisect but the greater part of such amateur surgery is the struggle in an epoch of wild literary competition to obtain novelty of material the varieties of aspect and color in healthy fruit be it sweet or sour may be within certain limits described exhaustively not so the blotches of its conceivable blight and while the symmetries of integral human character can only be traced by harmonious and tender skill like the branches of a living tree the faults and gaps of one gnawed away by corroding accident can be shuffled into senseless change like the wards of a chubb lock  17 v it is needless to insist on the vast field for this dicecast or carddealt calamity which opens itself in the ignorance moneyinterest and mean passion of city marriage peasants know each other as childrenmeet as they grow up in testing labor and if a stout farmers son marries a handless girl it is his own fault also in the patrician families of the field the young people know what they are doing and marry a neighboring estate or a covetable title with some conception of the responsibilities they undertake but even among these their season in the confused metropolis creates licentious and fortuitous temptation before unknown and in the lower middle orders an entirely new kingdom of discomfort and disgrace has been preached to them in the doctrines of unbridled pleasure which are merely an apology for their peculiar forms of illbreeding it is quite curious how often the catastrophe or the leading interest of a modern novel turns upon the want both in maid and bachelor of the common selfcommand which was taught to their grandmothers and grandfathers as the first element of ordinarily decent behavior rashly inquiring the other day the plot of a modern story43 from a female friend i elicited after some hesitation that it hinged mainly on the young peoples forgetting themselves in a boat and i perceive it to be accepted as nearly an axiom in the code of modern civic chivalry that the strength of amiable sentiment is proved by our incapacity on proper occasions to express and on improper ones to control it the pride of a gentleman of the old school used to be in his power of saying what he meant and being silent when he ought not to speak of the higher nobleness which bestowed love where it was honorable and reverence where it was due but the automatic amours and involuntary proposals of recent romance acknowledge little further law of morality than the instinct of an insect or the effervescence of a chemical mixture  18 there is a pretty little story of alfred de mussetsla mouche which if the reader cares to glance at it will save me further trouble in explaining the disciplinarian authority of mere oldfashioned politeness as in some sort protective of higher things it describes with much grace and precision a state of society by no means preeminently virtuous or enthusiastically heroic in which many people do extremely wrong and none sublimely right but as there are heights of which the achievement is unattempted there are abysses to which fall is barred neither accident nor temptation will make any of the principal personages swerve from an adopted resolution or violate an accepted principle of honor people are expected as a matter of course to speak with propriety on occasion and to wait with patience when they are bid those who do wrong admit it those who do right dont boast of it everybody knows his own mind and everybody has good manners  19 nor must it be forgotten that in the worst days of the selfindulgence which destroyed the aristocracies of europe their vices however licentious were never in the fatal modern sense unprincipled the vainest believed in virtue the vilest respected it chaque chose avait son nom44 and the severest of english moralists recognizes the accurate wit the lofty intellect and the unfretted benevolence which redeemed from vitiated surroundings the circle of dalembert and marmontel45  i have said with too slight praise that the vainest in those days believed in virtue beautiful and heroic examples of it were always before them nor was it without the secret significance attaching to what may seem the least accidents in the work of a master that scott gave to both his heroines of the age of revolution in england the name of the queen of the highest order of english chivalry46  20 it is to say little for the types of youth and maid which alone scott felt it a joy to imagine or thought it honorable to portray that they act and feel in a sphere where they are never for an instant liable to any of the weaknesses which disturb the calm or shake the resolution of chastity and courage in a modern novel scott lived in a country and time when from highest to lowest but chiefly in that dignified and nobly severe47 middle class to which he himself belonged a habit of serene and stainless thought was as natural to the people as their mountain air women like rose bradwardine and ailie dinmont were the grace and guard of almost every household god be praised that the race of them is not yet extinct for all that mall or boulevard can do and it has perhaps escaped the notice of even attentive readers that the comparatively uninteresting character of sir walters heroes had always been studied among a class of youths who were simply incapable of doing anything seriously wrong and could only be embarrassed by the consequences of their levity or imprudence  21 but there is another difference in the woof of a waverley novel from the cobweb of a modern one which depends on scotts larger view of human life marriage is by no means in his conception of man and woman the most important business of their existence48 nor love the only reward to be proposed to their virtue or exertion it is not in his reading of the laws of providence a necessity that virtue should either by love or any other external blessing be rewarded at all49 and marriage is in all cases thought of as a constituent of the happiness of life but not as its only interest still less its only aim and upon analyzing with some care the motives of his principal stories we shall often find that the love in them is merely a light by which the sterner features of character are to be irradiated and that the marriage of the hero is as subordinate to the main bent of the story as henry the fifths courtship of katherine is to the battle of agincourt nay the fortunes of the person who is nominally the subject of the tale are often little more than a background on which grander figures are to be drawn and deeper fates forthshadowed the judgments between the faith and chivalry of scotland at drumclog and bothwell bridge owe little of their interest in the mind of a sensible reader to the fact that the captain of the popinjay is carried a prisoner to one battle and returns a prisoner from the other and scott himself while he watches the white sail that bears queen mary for the last time from her native land very nearly forgets to finish his novel or to tell usand with small sense of any consolation to be had out of that minor circumstancethat roland and catherine were united spite of their differing faiths  22 neither let it be thought for an instant that the slight and sometimes scornful glance with which scott passes over scenes which a novelist of our own day would have analyzed with the airs of a philosopher and painted with the curiosity of a gossip indicates any absence in his heart of sympathy with the great and sacred elements of personal happiness an era like ours which has with diligence and ostentation swept its heart clear of all the passions once known as loyalty patriotism and piety necessarily magnifies the apparent force of the one remaining sentiment which sighs through the barren chambers or clings inextricably round the chasms of ruin nor can it but regard with awe the unconquerable spirit which still tempts or betrays the sagacities of selfishness into error or frenzy which is believed to be love  that scott was never himself in the sense of the phrase as employed by lovers of the parisian school ivre damour may be admitted without prejudice to his sensibility50 and that he never knew lamor che move l sol e laltre stelle was the chief though unrecognized calamity of his deeply checkered life but the reader of honor and feeling will not therefore suppose that the love which miss vernon sacrifices stooping for an instant from her horse is of less noble stamp or less enduring faith than that which troubles and degrades the whole existence of consuelo or that the affection of jeanie deans for the companion of her childhood drawn like a field of soft blue heaven beyond the cloudy wrack of her sorrow is less fully in possession of her soul than the hesitating and selfreproachful impulses under which a modern heroine forgets herself in a boat or compromises herself in the cool of the evening  23 i do not wish to return over the waste ground we have traversed comparing point by point scotts manner with those of bermondsey and the faubourgs but it may be perhaps interesting at this moment to examine with illustration from those waverley novels which have so lately retracted the attention of a fair and gentle public51 the universal conditions of style rightly so called which are in all ages and above all local currents or wavering tides of temporary manners pillars of what is forever strong and models of what is forever fair  but i must first define and that within strict horizon the works of scott in which his perfect mind may be known and his chosen ways understood  his great works of prose fiction excepting only the first halfvolume of waverley were all written in twelve years 181426 of his own age fortythree to fiftyfive the actual time employed in their composition being not more than a couple of months out of each year and during that time only the morning hours and spare minutes during the professional day though the first volume of waverley was begun long ago and actually lost for a time yet the other two were begun and finished between the 4th of june and the 1st of july during all which i attended my duty in court and proceeded without loss of time or hindrance of business52  few of the maxims for the enforcement of which in modern painters long ago i got the general character of a lover of paradox are more singular or more sure than the statement apparently so encouraging to the idle that if a great thing can be done at all it can be done easily but it is that kind of ease with which a tree blossoms after long years of gathered strength and all scotts great writings were the recreations of a mind confirmed in dutiful labor and rich with organic gathering of boundless resource  omitting from our count the two minor and illfinished sketches of the black dwarf and legend of montrose and for a reason presently to be noticed the unhappy st ronans the memorable romances of scott are eighteen falling into three distinct groups containing six each  24 the first group is distinguished from the other two by characters of strength and felicity which never more appeared after scott was struck down by his terrific illness in 1819 it includes waverley guy mannering the antiquary rob roy old mortality and the heart of midlothian  the composition of these occupied the mornings of his happiest days between the ages of fortythree and fortyeight on the 8th of april 1819 he was fortyeight on the preceding 15th of august he began for the first time to dictatebeing unable for the exertion of writingthe bride of lammermuir the affectionate laidlaw beseeching him to stop dictating when his audible suffering filled every pause nay willie he answered only see that the doors are fast i would fain keep all the cry as well as all the wool to ourselves but as for giving over work that can only be when i am in woolen53 from this time forward the brightness of joy and sincerity of inevitable humor which perfected the imagery of the earlier novels are wholly absent except in the two short intervals of health unaccountably restored in which he wrote redgauntlet and nigel  it is strange but only a part of the general simplicity of scotts genius that these revivals of earlier power were unconscious and that the time of extreme weakness in which he wrote st ronans well was that in which he first asserted his own restoration  25 it is also a deeply interesting characteristic of his noble nature that he never gains anything by sickness the whole man breathes or faints as one creature the ache that stiffens a limb chills his heart and every pang of his stomach paralyzes the brain it is not so with inferior minds in the workings of which it is often impossible to distinguish native from narcotic fancy and the throbs of conscience from those of indigestion whether in exaltation or languor the colors of mind are always morbid which gleam on the sea for the ancient mariner and through the casements on st agnes eve but scott is at once blinded and stultified by sickness never has a fit of the cramp without spoiling a chapter and is perhaps the only author of vivid imagination who never wrote a foolish word but when he was ill  it remains only to be noticed on this point that any strong natural excitement affecting the deeper springs of his heart would at once restore his intellectual powers to their fullness and that far towards their sunset but that the strong will on which he prided himself though it could trample upon pain silence grief and compel industry never could warm his imagination or clear the judgment in his darker hours  i believe that this power of the heart over the intellect is common to all great men but what the special character of emotion was that alone could lift scott above the power of death i am about to ask the reader in a little while to observe with joyful care  26 the first series of romances then abovenamed are all that exhibit the emphasis of his unharmed faculties the second group composed in the three years subsequent to illness all but mortal bear every one of them more or less the seal of it  they consist of the bride of lammermuir ivanhoe the monastery the abbot kenilworth and the pirate54 the marks of broken health on all these are essentially twofoldprevailing melancholy and fantastic improbability three of the tales are agonizingly tragic the abbot scarcely less so in its main event and ivanhoe deeply wounded through all its bright panoply while even in that most powerful of the series the impossible archeries and axstrokes the incredibly opportune appearances of locksley the death of ulrica and the resuscitation of athelstane are partly boyish partly feverish caleb in the bride triptolemus and halcro in the pirate are all laborious and the first incongruous half a volume of the abbot is spent in extremely dull detail of rolands relations with his fellowservants and his mistress which have nothing whatever to do with the future story and the lady of avenel herself disappears after the first volume like a snawwreath when its thaw jeanie the public has for itself pronounced on the monastery though as much too harshly as it has foolishly praised the horrors of ravenswood and the nonsense of ivanhoe because the modern public finds in the torture and adventure of these the kind of excitement which it seeks at an opera while it has no sympathy whatever with the pastoral happiness of glendearg or with the lingering simplicities of superstition which give historical likelihood to the legend of the white lady  but both this despised tale and its sequel have scotts heart in them the first was begun to refresh himself in the intervals of artificial labor on ivanhoe it was a relief he said to interlay the scenery most familiar to me55 with the strange world for which i had to draw so much on imagination through all the closing scenes of the second he is raised to his own true level by his love for the queen and within the code of scotts work to which i am about to appeal for illustration of his essential powers i accept the monastery and abbot and reject from it the remaining four of this group  27 the last series contains two quite noble ones redgauntlet and nigel two of very high value durward and woodstock the slovenly and diffuse peveril written for the trade56 the sickly tales of the crusaders and the entirely broken and diseased st ronans well this last i throw out of count altogether and of the rest accept only the four first named as sound work so that the list of the novels in which i propose to examine his methods and ideal standards reduces itself to these following twelve named in order of production waverley guy mannering the antiquary rob roy old mortality the heart of midlothian the monastery the abbot redgauntlet the fortunes of nigel quentin durward and woodstock57  28 it is however too late to enter on my subject in this article which i may fitly close by pointing out some of the merely verbal characteristics of his style illustrative in little ways of the questions we have been examining and chiefly of the one which may be most embarrassing to many readers the difference namely between character and disease  one quite distinctive charm in the waverleys is their modified use of the scottish dialect but it has not generally been observed either by their imitators or the authors of different taste who have written for a later public that there is a difference between the dialect of a language and its corruption  a dialect is formed in any district where there are persons of intelligence enough to use the language itself in all its fineness and force but under the particular conditions of life climate and temper which introduce words peculiar to the scenery forms of word and idioms of sentence peculiar to the race and pronunciations indicative of their character and disposition  thus burn of a streamlet is a word possible only in a country where there are brightly running waters lassie a word possible only where girls are as free as the rivulets and auld a form of the southern old adopted by a race of finer musical ear than the english  on the contrary mere deteriorations or coarse stridulent and in the ordinary sense of the phrase broad forms of utterance are not dialects at all having nothing dialectic in them and all phrases developed in states of rude employment and restricted intercourse are injurious to the tone and narrowing to the power of the language they affect mere breadth of accent does not spoil a dialect as long as the speakers are men of varied idea and good intelligence but the moment the life is contracted by mining millwork or any oppressive and monotonous labor the accents and phrases become debased it is part of the popular folly of the day to find pleasure in trying to write and spell these abortive crippled and more or less brutal forms of human speech  29 abortive crippled or brutal are however not necessarily corrupted dialects corrupt language is that gathered by ignorance invented by vice misused by insensibility or minced and mouthed by affectation especially in the attempt to deal with words of which only half the meaning is understood or half the sound heard mrs gamps aperiently soand the underminded with primal sense of undermine ofi forget which gossip in the mill on the floss are masterand mistresspieces in this latter kind mrs malaprops allegories on the banks of the nile are in somewhat higher order of mistake mrs tabitha brambles ignorance is vulgarized by her selfishness and winifred jenkins by her conceit the wot of noah claypole and the other degradations of cockneyism sam weller and his father are in nothing more admirable than in the power of heart and sense that can purify even these the trewth of mr chadband and natur of mr squeers are examples of the corruption of words by insensibility the use of the word bloody in modern low english is a deeper corruption not altering the form of the word but defiling the thought in it  thus much being understood i shall proceed to examine thoroughly a fragment of scotts lowland scottish dialect not choosing it of the most beautiful kind on the contrary it shall be a piece reaching as low down as he ever allows scotch to goit is perhaps the only unfair patriotism in him that if ever he wants a word or two of really villainous slang he gives it in english or dutchnot scotch  i had intended in the close of this paper to analyze and compare the characters of andrew fairservice and richie moniplies for examples the former of innate evil unaffected by external influences and undiseased but distinct from natural goodness as a nettle is distinct from balm or lavender and the latter of innate goodness contracted and pinched by circumstance but still undiseased as an oakleaf crisped by frost not by the worm this with much else in my mind i must put off but the careful study of one sentence of andrews will give us a good deal to think of  30 i take his account of the rescue of glasgow cathedral at the time of the reformation       ah its a brave kirknane o yere whigmaleeries an curliewurlies      and opensteek hems about ita solid weeljointed masonwark      that will stand as lang as the warld keep hands and gunpowther aff      it it had amaist a douncome lang syne at the reformation when      they pud doun the kirks of st andrews and perth and thereawa      to cleanse them o papery and idolatry and imageworship and      surplices and siclike rags o the muckle hure that sitteth on      seven hills as if ane wasna braid eneugh for her auld hinder end      sae the commons o renfrew and o the barony and the gorbals and      a about they behoved to come into glasgow ae fair morning to try      their hand on purging the high kirk o popish nicknackets but the      townsmen o glasgow they were feared their auld edifice might slip      the girths in gaun through siccan rough physic sae they rang the      common bell and assembled the trainbands wi took o drum by      good luck the worthy james rabat was dean o guild that yearand      a gude mason he was himsell made him the keener to keep up the      auld bigging and the trades assembled and offered downright      battle to the commons rather than their kirk should coup the      crans as others had done elsewhere it wasna for luve o      paperiena nanane could ever say that o the trades o      glasgowsae they sune came to an agreement to take a the      idolatrous statues of sants sorrow be on them out o their      neuksand sae the bits o stane idols were broken in pieces by      scripture warrant and flung into the molendinar burn and the auld      kirk stood as crouse as a cat when the flaes are kaimed aff her      and abody was alike pleased and i hae heard wise folk say that      if the same had been done in ilka kirk in scotland the reform wad      just hae been as pure as it is een now and we wad hae mair      christianlike kirks for i hae been sae lang in england that      naething will drived out o my head that the dogkennel at      osbaldistonehall is better than mony a house o god in scotland  31 now this sentence is in the first place a piece of scottish history of quite inestimable and concentrated value andrews temperament is the type of a vast class of scottishshall we call it sowthistlianmind which necessarily takes the view of either pope or saint that the thistle in lebanon took of the cedar or lilies in lebanon and the entire force of the passions which in the scottish revolution foretold and forearmed the french one is told in this one paragraph the coarseness of it observe being admitted not for the sake of the laugh any more than an onion in broth merely for its flavor but for the meat of it the inherent constancy of that coarseness being a fact in this order of mind and an essential part of the history to be told  secondly observe that this speech in the religious passion of it such as there may be is entirely sincere andrew is a thief a liar a coward and in the fair service from which he takes his name a hypocrite but in the form of prejudice which is all that his mind is capable of in the place of religion he is entirely sincere he does not in the least pretend detestation of image worship to please his master or anyone else he honestly scorns the carnal morality58 as dowd and fusionless as rueleaves at yule of the sermon in the upper cathedral and when wrapt in critical attention to the real savor o doctrine in the crypt so completely forgets the hypocrisy of his fair service as to return his masters attempt to disturb him with hard punches of the elbow  thirdly he is a man of no mean sagacity quite up to the average standard of scottish common sense not a low one and though incapable of understanding any manner of lofty thought or passion is a shrewd measurer of weaknesses and not without a spark or two of kindly feeling see first his sketch of his masters character to mr hammorgaw beginning hes no athegither sae void o sense neither and then the close of the dialogue but the lads no a bad lad after a and he needs some careful body to look after him  fourthly he is a good workman knows his own business well and can judge of other craft if sound or otherwise  all these four qualities of him must be known before we can understand this single speech keeping them in mind i take it up word by word  32 you observe in the outset scott makes no attempt whatever to indicate accents or modes of pronunciation by changed spelling unless the word becomes a quite definitely new and securely writable one the scottish way of pronouncing james for instance is entirely peculiar and extremely pleasant to the ear but it is so just because it does not change the word into jeems nor into jims nor into jawms a modern writer of dialects would think it amusing to use one or other of these ugly spellings but scott writes the name in pure english knowing that a scots reader will speak it rightly and an english one be wise in letting it alone on the other hand he writes weel for well because that word is complete in its change and may be very closely expressed by the double e the ambiguous us in gude and sune are admitted because far liker the sound than the double o would be and that in hure for grace sake to soften the word so also flaes for fleas mony for many is again positively right in sound and neuk differs from our nook in sense and is not the same word at all as we shall presently see  secondly observe not a word is corrupted in any indecent haste slowness slovenliness or incapacity of pronunciation there is no lisping drawling slobbering or snuffling the speech is as clear as a bell and as keen as an arrow and its elisions and contractions are either melodious na for notpud for pulled or as normal as in a latin verse the long words are delivered without the slightest bungling and bigging finished to its last g  33 i take the important words now in their places  brave the old english sense of the word in to go brave retained expressing andrews sincere and respectful admiration had he meant to insinuate a hint of the churchs being too fine he would have said braw  kirk this is of course just as pure and unprovincial a word as kirche or église  whigmaleerie i cannot get at the root of this word but it is one showing that the speaker is not bound by classic rules but will use any syllables that will enrich his meaning nippertytipperty of his masters poetrynonsense is another word of the same class curliewurlie is of course just as pure as shakespeares hurlyburly but see first suggestion of the idea to scott at blairadam l vi 264  opensteek hems more description or better of the later gothic cannot be put into four syllables steek melodious for stitch has a combined sense of closing or fastening and note that the later gothic being precisely what scott knew best in melrose and liked best it is here as elsewhere quite as much himself59 as frank that he is laughing at when he laughs with andrew whose opensteek hems are only a ruder metaphor for his own willowwreaths changed to stone  gunpowther ther is a lingering vestige of the french dre  syne one of the melodious and mysterious scottish words which have partly the sound of wind and stream in them and partly the range of softened idea which is like a distance of blue hills over border land far in the distant cheviots blue perhaps even the least sympathetic englisher might recognize this if he heard old long since vocally substituted for the scottish words to the air i do not know the root but the words proper meaning is not since but before or after an interval of some duration as weel sune as syne but first on sawnie gies a ca syne bauldly in she enters  behoved to come a rich word with peculiar idiom always used more or less ironically of anything done under a partly mistaken and partly pretended notion of duty  siccan far prettier and fuller in meaning than such it contains an

foul62  ii   35 he hated greetings in the marketplace and there were generally loiterers in the streets to persecute him either about the events of the day or about some petty pieces of business  these lines which the reader will find near the beginning of the sixteenth chapter of the first volume of the antiquary contain two indications of the old mans character which receiving the ideal of him as a portrait of scott himself are of extreme interest to me they mean essentially that neither monkbarns nor scott had any mind to be called of men rabbi in mere hearing of the mob and especially that they hated to be drawn back out of their faraway thoughts or forward out of their longago thoughts by any manner of daily news whether printed or gabbled of which two vital characteristics deeper in both men for i must always speak of scotts creations as if they were as real as himself than any of their superficial vanities or passing enthusiasms i have to speak more at another time i quote the passage just now because there was one piece of the daily news of the year 1815 which did extremely interest scott and materially direct the labor of the latter part of his life nor is there any piece of history in this whole nineteenth century quite so pregnant with various instruction as the study of the reasons which influenced scott and byron in their opposite views of the glories of the battle of waterloo  36 but i quote it for another reason also the principal greeting which mr oldbuck on this occasion receives in the marketplace being compared with the speech of andrew fairservice examined in my first paper will furnish me with the text of what i have mainly to say in the present one       mr oldbuck said the townclerk a more important person who      came in front and ventured to stop the old gentleman the      provost understanding you were in town begs on no account that      youll quit it without seeing him he wants to speak to ye about      bringing the water frae the fairwell spring through a part o your      lands       what the deucehave they nobodys land but mine to cut and      carve oni wont consent tell them       and the provost said the clerk going on without noticing the      rebuff and the council wad be agreeable that you should hae the      auld stanes at donagilds chapel that ye was wussing to hae       ehwhatoho thats another storywell well ill call upon      the provost and well talk about it       but ye maun speak your mind ont forthwith monkbarns if ye want      the stanes for deacon harlewalls thinks the carved throughstanes      might be put with advantage on the front of the new council      housethat is the twa crosslegged figures that the callants used      to ca robbin and bobbin ane on ilka doorcheek and the other

about the watercourseits lucky i happened to come this way      today       they parted mutually satisfied but the wily clerk had most reason      to exult in the dexterity he had displayed since the whole      proposal of an exchange between the monuments which the council      had determined to remove as a nuisance because they encroached      three feet upon the public road and the privilege of conveying the      water to the burgh through the estate of monkbarns was an idea      which had originated with himself upon the pressure of the moment  37 in this single page of scott will the reader please note the kind of prophetic instinct with which the great men of every age mark and forecast its destinies the water from the fairwell is the future thirlmere carried to manchester the auld stanes63 at donagilds chapel removed as a nuisance foretell the necessary view taken by modern cockneyism liberalism and progress of all things that remind them of the noble dead of their fathers fame or of their own duty and the public road becomes their idol instead of the saints shrine finally the roguery of the entire transactionthe mean man seeing the weakness of the honorable and besting himin modern slang in the manner and at the pace of modern tradeon the pressure of the moment  but neither are these things what i have at present quoted the passage for  i quote it that we may consider how much wonderful and various history is gathered in the fact recorded for us in this piece of entirely fair fiction that in the scottish borough of fairport montrose really in the year 17of christ the knowledge given by the pastors and teachers provided for its children by enlightened scottish protestantism of their fathers history and the origin of their religion had resulted in this substance and sumthat the statues of two crusading knights had become to their children bobbin and bobbin and the statue of the madonna ailie dailie  a marvelous piece of history truly and far too comprehensive for general comment here only one small piece of it i must carry forward the readers thoughts upon  38 the pastors and teachers aforesaid represented typically in another part of this errorless book by mr blattergowl are not whatever else they may have to answer for answerable for these names the names are of the childrens own choosing and bestowing but not of the childrens own inventing robin is a classically endearing cognomen recording the errant heroism of old daysthe name of the bruce and of rob roy bobbin is a poetical and symmetrical fulfillment and adornment of the original phrase ailie is the last echo of ave changed into the softest scottish christian name familiar to the children itself the beautiful feminine form of royal louis the dailie again symmetrically added for kinder and more musical endearment the last vestiges you see of honor for the heroism and religion of their ancestors lingering on the lips of babes and sucklings  but what is the meaning of this necessity the children find themselves under of completing the nomenclature rhythmically and rhymingly note first the difference carefully and the attainment of both qualities by the couplets in question rhythm is the syllabic and quantitative measure of the words in which robin both in weight and time balances bobbin and dailie holds level scale with ailie but rhyme is the added correspondence of sound unknown and undesired so far as we can learn by the greek orpheus but absolutely essential to and as special virtue becoming titular of the scottish thomas  39 the ryme64 you may at first fancy is the especially childish part of the work not so it is the especially chivalric and christian part of it it characterizes the christian chant or canticle as a higher thing than a greek ode melos or hymnos or than a latin carmen  think of it for this again is wonderful that these children of montrose should have an element of music in their souls which homer had notwhich a melos of david the prophet and king had notwhich orpheus and amphion had notwhich apollos unrymed oracles became mute at the sound of  a strange new equity thismelodious justice and judgment as it werein all words spoken solemnly and ritualistically by christian human creaturesrobin and bobbinby the crusaders tomb up to dies iræ dies illa at judgment of the crusading soul  you have to understand this most deeply of all christian minstrels from first to last that they are more musical because more joyful than any others on earth ethereal minstrels pilgrims of the sky true to the kindred points of heaven and home their joy essentially the skylarks in light in purity but with their human eyes looking for the glorious appearing of something in the sky which the bird cannot  this it is that changes etruscan murmur into terza rimahoratian latin into provençal troubadours melody not because less artful less wise  40 here is a little bit for instance of french ryming just before chaucers timenear enough to our own french to be intelligible to us yet    o quant trèsglorieuse vie   quant cil qui tout peut et maistrie   veult esprouver pour nécessaire   ne pour quant il ne blasma mie   la vie de marthe sa mie   mais il lui donna exemplaire   dautrement vivre et de bien plaire   a dieu et plut de bien à faire   pour se conclutil que marie   qui estoit à ses piedz sans braire   et pensoit dentendre et de taire   estleut la plus saine partie    la meilleur partie esleutelle   et la plus saine et la plus belle   qui jà ne luy sera ostée   car par vérité se fut celle   qui fut tousjours fresche et nouvelle   daymer dieu et den estre aymée   car jusquau cueur fut entamée   et si ardamment enflamée   que tousjours ardoit iestincelle   par quoi elle fut visitée   et de dieu premier confortée   car charité est trop ysnelle  41 the only law of meter observed in this song is that each line shall be octosyllabic    qui fut  tousjours  fresche et  nouvelle   dautre  ment vi  vret de  bien ben plaire   et pen  soit den  tendret  de taire  but the reader must note that words which were twosyllabled in latin mostly remain yet so in the french    la vi  e de  marthe  sa mie  although mie which is pet language loving abbreviation of amica through amie remains monosyllabic but vie elides its e before a vowel    car mar  the me  nait vie  active   et ma  rie  contemp  lative  and custom endures many exceptions thus marie may be threesyllabled as above or answer to mie as a dissyllable but vierge is always i think dissyllabic vierge with even stronger accent on the ge for the latin go  then secondly of quantity there is scarcely any fixed law the meters may be timed as the minstrel choosesfast or slowand the iambic current checked in reverted eddy as the words chance to come  but thirdly there is to be rich ryming and chiming no matter how simply got so only that the words jingle and tingle together with due art of interlacing and answering in different parts of the stanza correspondent to the involutions of tracery and illumination the whole twelveline stanza is thus constructed with two rymes only six of each thus arranged    a a b  a a b  b b a  b b a   dividing the verse thus into four measures reversed in ascent and descent or descant more properly and doubtless with correspondent phases in the voicegiven and duly accompanying or following music thomas the rymers own precept that tong is chefe in mynstrelsye being always kept faithfully in mind65  42 here then you have a sufficient example of the pure chant of the christian ages which is always at heart joyful and divides itself into the four great forms song of praise song of prayer song of love and song of battle praise however being the keynote of passion through all the four forms according to the first law which i have already given in the laws of fésole all great art is praise of which the contrary is also true all foul or miscreant art is accusation greek diabolê she gave me of the tree and i did eat being an entirely museless expression on adams part the briefly essential contrary of lovesong  with these four perfect forms of christian chant of which we may take for pure examples the te deum the te lucis ante the amor che nella mente66 and the chant de roland are mingled songs of mourning of pagan origin whether greek or danish holding grasp still of the races that have once learned them in times of suffering and sorrow and songs of christian humiliation or grief regarding chiefly the sufferings of christ or the conditions of our own sin while through the entire system of these musical complaints are interwoven moralities instructions and related histories in illustration of both passing into epic and romantic verse which gradually as the forms and learnings of society increase becomes less joyful and more didactic or satiric until the last echoes of christian joy and melody vanish in the vanity of human wishes  43 and here i must pause for a minute or two to separate the different branches of our inquiry clearly from one another for one thing the reader must please put for the present out of his head all thought of the progress of civilizationthat is to say broadly of the substitution of wigs for hair gas for candles and steam for legs this is an entirely distinct matter from the phases of policy and religion it has nothing to do with the british constitution or the french revolution or the unification of italy there are indeed certain subtle relations between the state of mind for instance in venice which makes her prefer a steamer to a gondola and that which makes her prefer a gazetteer to a duke but these relations are not at all to be dealt with until we solemnly understand that whether men shall be christians and poets or infidels and dunces does not depend on the way they cut their hair tie their breeches or light their fires dr johnson might have worn his wig in fullness conforming to his dignity without therefore coming to the conclusion that human wishes were vain nor is queen antoinettes civilized hairpowder as opposed to queen berthas savagely loose hair the cause of antoinettes laying her head at last in scaffold dust but bertha in a pilgrimhaunted tomb  44 again i have just now used the words poet and dunce meaning the degree of each quality possible to average human nature men are eternally divided into the two classes of poet believer maker and praiser and dunce or unbeliever unmaker and dispraiser and in process of ages they have the power of making faithful and formative creatures of themselves or unfaithful and deformative and this distinction between the creatures who blessing are blessed and evermore benedicti and the creatures who cursing are cursed and evermore maledicti is one going through all humanity antediluvian in cain and abel diluvian in ham and shem and the question for the public of any given period is not whether they are a constitutional or unconstitutional vulgus but whether they are a benignant or malignant vulgus so also whether it is indeed the gods who have given any gentleman the grace to despise the rabble depends wholly on whether it is indeed the rabble or he who are the malignant persons  45 but yet again this difference between the persons to whom heaven according to orpheus has granted the hour of delight67 and those whom it has condemned to the hour of detestableness being as i have just said of all times and nationsit is an interior and more delicate difference which we are examining in the gift of christian as distinguished from unchristian song orpheus pindar and horace are indeed distinct from the prosaic rabble as the bird from the snake but between orpheus and palestrina horace and sidney there is another division and a new power of music and song given to the humanity which has hope of the resurrection  this is the root of all life and all rightness in christian harmony whether of word or instrument and so literally that in precise manner as this hope disappears the power of song is taken away and taken away utterly when the christian falls back out of the bright hope of the resurrection even the orpheus song is forbidden him not to have known the hope is blameless one may sing unknowing as the swan or philomela but to have known and fall away from it and to declare that the human wishes which are summed in that onethy kingdom comeare vain the fates ordain there shall be no singing after that denial  46 for observe this and earnestly the old orphic song with its dim hope of yet once more eurydicethe philomela songgranted after the cruel silencethe halcyon songwith its fifteen days of peace were all sad or joyful only in some vague vision of conquest over death but the johnsonian vanity of wishes is on the whole satisfactory to johnsonaccepted with gentlemanly resignation by popetriumphantly and with bray of penny trumpets and blowing of steamwhistles proclaimed for the glorious discovery of the civilized ages by mrs barbauld miss edgeworth adam smith and co there is no god but have we not invented gunpowderwho wants a god with that in his pocket68 there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but have we not paper and pens and cannot every blockhead print his opinions and the day of judgment become republican with everybody for a judge and the flat of the universe for the throne there is no law but only gravitation and congelation and we are stuck together in an everlasting hail and melted together in everlasting mud and great was the day in which our worships were born and there is no gospel but only whatever weve got to get more and wherever we are to go somewhere else and are not these discoveries to be sung of and drummed of and fiddled of and generally made melodiously indubitable in the eighteenth century song of praise  47 the fates will not have it so no word of song is possible in that century to mortal lips only polished versification sententious pentameter and hexameter until having turned out its toes long enough without dancing and pattered with its lips long enough without piping suddenly astræa returns to the earth and a day of judgment of a sort and there bursts out a song at last again a most curtly melodious triplet of amphisbænic ryme Ça ira  amphisbænic fanged in each ryme with fire and obeying

antistrophe returning to that council chamber in sedan  49 while these two great songs were thus being composed and sung and danced to in cometary cycle by the french nation here in our less giddy island there rose amidst hours of business in scotland and of idleness in england three troubadours of quite different temper different also themselves but not opponent forming a perfect chord and adverse all the three of them alike to the french musicians in this main pointthat while the ca ira and marseillaise were essentially songs of blame and wrath the british bards wrote virtually always songs of praise though by no means psalmody in the ancient keys on the contrary all the three are alike moved by a singular antipathy to the priests and are pointed at with fear and indignation by the pietists of their daynot without latent cause for they are all of them with the most loving service servants of that world which the puritan and monk alike despised and in the triple chord of their song could not but appear to the religious persons around them as respectively and specifically the praisersscott of the world burns of the flesh and byron of the devil  to contend with this carnal orchestra the religious world having long ago rejected its catholic psalms as antiquated and unscientific and finding its puritan melodies sunk into faint jar and twangle from their native trumpettone had nothing to oppose but the innocent rather than religious verses of the school recognized as that of the english lakes very creditable to them domestic at once and refined observing the errors of the world outside of the lakes with a pitying and tender indignation and arriving in lacustrine seclusion at many valuable principles of philosophy as pure as the tarns of their mountains and of corresponding depth72  50 i have lately seen and with extreme pleasure mr matthew arnolds arrangement of wordsworths poems and read with sincere interest his high estimate of them but a great poets work never needs arrangement by other hands and though it is very proper that silver how should clearly understand and brightly praise its fraternal rydal mount we must not forget that over yonder are the andes all the while  wordsworths rank and scale among poets were determined by himself in a single exclamation    what was the great parnassus self to thee   mount skiddaw  answer his question faithfully and you have the relation between the great masters of the muses teaching and the pleasant fingerer of his pastoral flute among the reeds of rydal  wordsworth is simply a westmoreland peasant with considerably less shrewdness than most border englishmen or scotsmen inherit and no sense of humor but gifted in this singularly with vivid sense of natural beauty and a pretty turn for reflections not always acute but as far as they reach medicinal to the fever of the restless and corrupted life around him water to parched lips may be better than samian wine but do not let us therefore confuse the qualities of wine and water i much doubt there being many inglorious miltons in our country churchyards but i am very sure there are many wordsworths resting there who were inferior to the renowned one only in caring less to hear themselves talk  with an honest and kindly heart a stimulating egoism a wholesome contentment in modest circumstances and such sufficient ease in that accepted state as permitted the passing of a good deal of time in wishing that daisies could see the beauty of their own shadows and other such profitable mental exercises wordsworth has left us a series of studies of the graceful and happy shepherd life of our lake country which to me personally for one are entirely sweet and precious but they are only so as the mirror of an existent reality in many ways more beautiful than its picture  51 but the other day i went for an afternoons rest into the cottage of one of our country people of old statesman class cottage lying nearly midway between two village churches but more conveniently for downhill walk towards one than the other i found as the good housewife made tea for me that nevertheless she went up the hill to church why do not you go to the nearer church i asked dont you like the clergyman oh no sir she answered it isnt that but you know i couldnt leave my mother your mother she is buried at h then yes sir and you know i couldnt go to church anywhere else  that feelings such as these existed among the peasants not of cumberland only but of all the tender earth that gives forth her fruit for the living and receives her dead to peace might perhaps have been to our great and endless comfort discovered before now if wordsworth had been content to tell us what he knew of his own villages and people not as the leader of a new and only correct school of poetry but simply as a country gentleman of sense and feeling fond of primroses kind to the parish children and reverent of the spade with which wilkinson had tilled his lands and i am by no means sure that his influence on the stronger minds of his time was anywise hastened or extended by the spirit of tunefulness under whose guidance he discovered that heaven rymed to seven and foy to boy  52 tuneful nevertheless at heart and of the heavenly choir i gladly and frankly acknowledge him and our english literature enriched with a new and a singular virtue in the aërial purity and healthful rightness of his quiet songbut aërial onlynot ethereal and lowly in its privacy of light  a measured mind and calm innocent unrepentant helpful to sinless creatures and scathless such of the flock as do not stray hopeful at least if not faithful content with intimations of immortality such as may be in skipping of lambs and laughter of childrenincurious to see in the hands the print of the nails  a gracious and constant mind as the herbage of its native hills fragrant and pureyet to the sweep and the shadow the stress and distress

compassion  54 for this is indeed all that is noble in the life of man and the source of all that is noble in the speech of man had it narrowed itself then in those days out of all the world into this peninsula between cockermouth and shap  not altogether so but indeed the vocal piety seemed conclusively to have retired or excursed into that mossy hermitage above little langdale the unvocal piety with the uncomplaining sorrow of man may have a somewhat wider range for aught we know but history disregards those items and of firmly proclaimed and sweetly canorous religion there really seemed at that juncture none to be reckoned upon east of ingleborough or north of criffel only under furness fells or by bolton priory it seems we can still write ecclesiastical sonnets stanzas on the force of prayer odes to duty and complimentary addresses to the deity upon his endurance for adoration far otherwise over yonder by spezzia bay and ravenna pineta and in ravines of hartz there the softest voices speak the wildest words and keats discourses of endymion shelley of demogorgon goethe of lucifer and burger of the resurrection of death unto deathwhile even puritan scotland and episcopal anglia produce for us only these three minstrels of doubtful tone who show but small respect for the unco guid put but limited faith in gifted gilfillan and translate with unflinching frankness the morgante maggiore74  55 dismal the aspect of the spiritual world or at least the sound of it might well seem to the eyes and ears of saints such as we had of the perioddismal in angels eyes also assuredly yet is it possible that the dismalness in angelic sight may be otherwise quartered as it were from the way of mortal heraldry and that seen and heard of angelsagain i sayhesitatinglyis it possible that the goodness of the unco guid and the gift of gilfillan and the word of mr blattergowl may severally not have been the goodness of god the gift of god nor the word of god but that in the much blotted and broken efforts at goodness and in the careless gift which they themselves despised75 and in the sweet ryme and murmur of their unpurposed words the spirit of the lord had indeed wandering as in chaos days on lightless waters gone forth in the hearts and from the lips of those other three strange prophets even though they ate forbidden bread by the altar of the pouredout ashes and even though the wild beast of the desert found them and slew  this at least i know that it had been well for england though all her other prophets of the press the parliament the doctors chair and the bishops throne had fallen silent so only that she had been able to understand with her heart here and there the simplest line of these her despised  56 i take one at mere chance    who thinks of self when gazing on the sky76  well i dont know mr wordsworth certainly did and observed with truth that its clouds took a sober coloring in consequence of his experiences it is much if indeed this sadness be unselfish and our eyes have kept loving watch oer mans mortality i have found it difficult to make anyone nowadays believe that such sobriety can be and that turner saw deeper crimson than others in the clouds of goldau but that any should yet think the clouds brightened by mans immortality instead of dulled by his deathand gazing on the sky look for the day when every eye must gaze alsofor behold he cometh with cloudsthis it is no more possible for christian england to apprehend however exhorted by her gifted and guid  57 but byron was not thinking of such thingshe the reprobate how should such as he think of christ  perhaps not wholly as you or i think of him take at chance another line or two to try    carnage so wordsworth tells you is gods daughter77   if he speak truth she is christs sister and   just now behaved as in the holy land  blasphemy cry you good reader are you sure you understand it the first line i gave you was easy byronalmost shallow byronthese are of the man in his depth and you will not fathom them like a tarnnor in a hurry  just now behaved as in the holy land how did carnage behave in the holy land then you have all been greatly questioning of late whether the sun which you find to be now going out ever stood still did you in any lagging minute on those scientific occasions chance to reflect what he was bid stand still for or if notwill you please lookand what also going forth again as a strong man to run his course he saw rejoicing  then joshua passed from makkedah unto libnahand fought against libnah and the lord delivered it and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein and from lachish to eglon and from eglon to kirjatharba and sarahs grave in the amorites land and joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the southand of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathedas the lord god of israel commanded  58 thus it is written though you perhaps do not so often hear these texts preached from as certain others about taking away the sins of the world i wonder how the world would like to part with them hitherto it has always preferred parting first with its lifeand god has taken it at its word but death is not his begotten son for all that nor is the death of the innocent in battle carnage his instrument for working out a pure intent as mr wordsworth puts it but mans instrument for working out an impure one as byron would have you to know theology perhaps less orthodox but certainly more reverentneither is the woolwich infant a child of god neither does the ironclad thunderer utter thunders of godwhich facts if you had had the grace or sense to learn from byron instead of accusing him of blasphemy it had been better at this day for you and for many a savage soul also by euxine shore and in zulu and afghan lands  59 it was neither however for the theology nor the use of these lines that i quoted them but to note this main point of byrons own character he was the first great englishman who felt the cruelty of war and in its cruelty the shame its guilt had been known to george foxits folly shown practically by penn but the compassion of the pious world had still for the most part been shown only in keeping its stock of barabbases unhanged if possible and till byron came neither kunersdorf eylau nor waterloo had taught the pity and the pride of men that    the drying up a single tear has more   of honest fame than shedding seas of gore78  such pacific verse would not indeed have been acceptable to the edinburgh volunteers on portobello sands but byron can write a battle song too when it is his cue to fight if you look at the introduction to the isles of greece namely the 85th and 86th stanzas of the 3rd canto of don juanyou will findwhat will you not find if only you understand them he in the first line remember means the typical modern poet    thus usually when he was asked to sing     he gave the different nations something national   twas all the same to himgod save the king     or ca ira according to the fashion all   his muse made increment of anything     from the high lyric down to the low rational   if pindar sang horseraces what should hinder     himself from being as pliable as pindar    in france for instance he would write a chanson     in england a sixcanto quarto tale   in spain hed make a ballad or romance on     the last warmuch the same in portugal   in germany the pegasus hed prance on     would be old goethessee what says de staël   in italy hed ape the trecentisti   in greece hed sing some sort of hymn like this tye  60 note first here as we did in scott the concentrating and foretelling power the god save the queen in england fallen hollow now as the ca ira in francenot a man in france knowing where either france or that whatever that may be is going to nor the queen of england daring for her life to ask the tiniest englishman to do a single thing he doesnt likenor any salvation either of queen or realm being any more possible to god unless under the direction of the royal society then note the estimate of height and depth in poetry swept in an instant high lyric to low rational pindar to pope knowing popes height too all the while no man better then the poetic power of franceresumed in a wordbéranger then the cut at marmion entirely deserved as we shall see yet kindly given for everything he names in these two stanzas is the best of its kind then romance in spain onthe last war present war not being to spanish poetical taste then goethe the real heart of all germany and last the aping of the trecentisti which has since consummated itself in preraphaelitism that also being the best thing italy has done through england whether in rossettis blessed damozels or burne joness days of creation lastly comes the mock at himselfthe modern english greekfollowed up by the degenerate into hands like mine in the song itself and thento amazement forth he thunders in his achillesvoice we have had one line of him in his clearnessfive of him in his depthsixteen of him in his play hear now but these out of his whole heart    whatsilent yet and silent all     ah no the voices of the dead   sound like a distant torrents fall     and answer let one living head   but one arisewe comewe come   tis but the living who are dumb  resurrection this you see like bürgers but not of death unto death  61 sound like a distant torrents fall i said the whole heart of byron was in this passage first its compassion then its indignation and the third element not yet examined that love of the beauty of this world in which the threeunholychildren of its fiery furnace were like to each other but byron the widesthearted scott and burns love scotland more than nature itself for burns the moon must rise over cumnock hillsfor scott the rymers glen divide the eildons but for byron lochnagar with ida looks oer troy and the soft murmurs of the dee and the bruar change into voices of the dead on distant marathon  yet take the parallel from scott by a field of homelier rest    and silence aidsthough the steep hills   send to the lake a thousand rills   in summer tide so soft they weep   the sound but lulls the ear asleep   your horses hooftread sounds too rude   so stilly is the solitude    nought living meets the eye or ear   but well i ween the dead are near   for though in feudal strife a foe   hath laid our ladys chapel low   yet still beneath the hallowed soil   the peasant rests him from his toil   and dying bids his bones be laid   where erst his simple fathers prayed  and last take the same note of sorrowwith burnss finger on the fall of it

lin  62 as you read one after another these fragments of chant by the great masters does not a sense come upon you of some element in their passion no less than in their sound different specifically from that of parching summer hath no warrant is it more profane think youor more tendernay perhaps in the core of it more true  for instance when we are told that        wharfe as he moved along   to matins joined a mournful voice  is this disposition of the rivers mind to pensive psalmody quite logically accounted for by the previous statement itself by no means rythmically dulcet that    the boy is in the arms of wharfe   and strangled by a merciless force  or when we are led into the improving reflection    how sweet were leisure could it yield no more   than mid this wavewashed churchyard to recline   from pastoral graves extracting thoughts divine  is the divinity of the extract assured to us by its being made at leisure and in a reclining attitudeas compared with the meditations of otherwise active men in an erect one or are we perchance many of us still erring somewhat in our notions alike of divinity and humanitypoetical extraction and moral position  63 on the chance of its being so might i ask hearing for just a few words more of the school of belial  their occasion it must be confessed is a quite unjustifiable one some very wicked peoplemutineers in facthave retired misanthropically into an unfrequented part of the country and there find themselves safe indeed but extremely thirsty whereupon byron thus gives them to drink    a little stream came tumbling from the height   and straggling into ocean as it might   its bounding crystal frolicked in the ray   and gushed from cliff to crag with saltless spray   close on the wild wide oceanyet as pure   and fresh as

now i beg with such authority as an old workman may take concerning his trade having also looked at a waterfall or two in my time and not unfrequently at a wave to assure the reader that here is entirely firstrate literary work though lucifer himself had written it the thing is itself good and not only so but unsurpassedly good the closing line being probably the best concerning the sea yet written by the race of the seakings  64 but lucifer himself could not have written it neither any servant of lucifer i do not doubt but that most readers were surprised at my saying in the close of my first paper that byrons style depended in any wise on his views respecting the ten commandments that so allimportant a thing as style should depend in the least upon so ridiculous a thing as moral sense or that allegras father watching her drive by in count gs coach and six had any remnant of so ridiculous a thing to guideor checkhis poetical passion may alike seem more than questionable to the liberal and chaste philosophy of the existing british public but first of all putting the question of who writes or speaks aside do you good reader know good style when you get it can you say of half a dozen given lines taken anywhere out of a novel or poem or play that is good essentially in style or bad essentially and can you say why such halfdozen lines are good or bad  65 i imagine that in most cases the reply would be given with hesitation yet if you will give me a little patience and take some accurate pains i can show you the main tests of style in the space of a couple of pages  i take two examples of absolutely perfect and in manner highest i e kingly and heroic style the first example in expression of anger the second of love    1    we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us   his present and your pains we thank you for   when we have matchd our rackets to these balls   we will in france by gods grace play a set   shall strike his fathers crown into the hazard    2    my gracious silence hail   wouldst thou have laughed had i come coffind home   that weepst to see me triumph ah my dear   such eyes the widows in corioli wear   and mothers that lack sons  66 let us note point by point the conditions of greatness common to both these passages so opposite in temper  a absolute command over all passion however intense this the firstoffirst conditions see the kings own sentence just before we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fettered in our prisons and with this selfcommand the supremely surveying grasp of every thought that is to be uttered before its utterance so that each may come in its exact place time and connection the slightest hurry the misplacing of a word or the unnecessary accent on a syllable would destroy the style in an instant  b choice of the fewest and simplest words that can be found in the compass of the language to express the thing meant these few words being also arranged in the most straightforward and intelligible way allowing inversion only when the subject can be made primary without obscurity thus his present and your pains we thank you for is better than we thank you for his present and your pains because the dauphins gift is by courtesy put before the ambassadors pains but when to these balls our rackets we have matched would have spoiled the style in a moment becausei was going to have said ball and racket are of equal rank and therefore only the natural order proper but also here the natural order is the desired one the english racket to have precedence of the french ball in the fourth line the in france comes first as announcing the most important resolution of action the by gods grace next as the only condition rendering resolution possible the detail of issue follows with the strictest limit in the final word the king does not say danger far less dishonor but hazard only of that he is humanly speaking sure  67 c perfectly emphatic and clear utterance of the chosen words slowly in the degree of their importance with omission however of every word not absolutely required and natural use of the familiar contractions of final dissyllable thus play a set shall strike is better than play a set that shall strike and matchd is kingly shortno necessity of meter could have excused matched instead on the contrary the three first words we are glad would have been spoken by the king more slowly and fully than any other syllables in the whole passage first pronouncing the kingly we at its proudest and then the are as a continuous state and then the glad as the exact contrary of what the ambassadors expected him to be80  d absolute spontaneity in doing all this easily and necessarily as the heart beats the king cannot speak otherwise than he doesnor the hero the words not merely come to them but are compelled to them even lisping numbers come but mighty numbers are ordained and inspired  e melody in the words changeable with their passion fitted to it exactly and the utmost of which the language is capablethe melody in prose being eolian and variablein verse nobler by submitting itself to stricter law i will enlarge upon this point presently  f utmost spiritual contents in the words so that each carries not only its instant meaning but a cloudy companionship of higher or darker meaning according to the passionnearly always indicated by metaphor play a setsometimes by abstractionthus in the second passage silence for silent one sometimes by description instead of direct epithet coffined for dead but always indicative of there being more in the speakers mind than he has said or than he can say full though his saying be on the quantity of this attendant fullness depends the majesty of style that is to say virtually on the quantity of contained thought in briefest words such thought being primarily loving and true and this the sum of allthat nothing can be well said but with truth nor beautifully but by love  68 these are the essential conditions of noble speech in prose and verse alike but the adoption of the form of verse and especially rymed verse means the addition to all these qualities of one more of music that is to say not eolian merely but apolline a construction or architecture of words fitted and befitting under external laws of time and harmony  when byron says rhyme is of the rude81 he means that burns needs itwhile henry the fifth does not nor plato nor isaiahyet in this need of it by the simple it becomes all the more religious and thus the loveliest pieces of christian language are all in rymethe best of dante chaucer douglas shakespeare spenser and sidney  69 i am not now able to keep abreast with the tide of modern scholarship nor to say the truth do i make the effort the first edge of its waves being mostly muddy and apt to make a shallow sweep of the shore refuse so that i have no better book of reference by me than the confused essay on the antiquity of ryme at the end of turners anglosaxons i cannot however conceive a more interesting piece of work if not yet done than the collection of sifted earliest fragments known of rymed song in european languages of eastern i know nothing but this side hellespont the substance of the matter is all given in king canutes impromptu    gaily or is it sweetlyi forget which and its no matter       sang the monks of ely   as knut the king came sailing by  much to be noted by any who make their religion lugubrious and their sunday the eclipse of the week and observe further that if milton does not ryme it is because his faculty of song was concerning loss chiefly and he has little more than faculty of croak concerning gain while dante though modern readers never go further with him than into the pit is stayed only by casella in the ascent to the rose of heaven so gibbon can write in his manner the fall of rome but virgil in his manner the rise of it and finally douglas in his manner bursts into such rymed passion of praise both of rome and virgil as befits a christian bishop and a good subject of the holy see    master of masterssweet source and springing well   wide where over all rings thy heavenly bell                                           why should i then with dull forehead and vain   with rude ingene and barane emptive brain   with bad harsh speech and lewit barbare tongue   presume to write where thy sweet bell is rung   or counterfeit thy precious wordis dear   na nanot so but kneel when i them hear   but farther moreand lower to descend   forgive me virgil if i thee offend   pardon thy scolar suffer him to ryme   since thou wast but ane mortal man sometime  before honor is humility does not clearer light come for you on that law after reading these nobly pious words and note you whose humility how is it that the sound of the bell comes so instinctively into his chiming verse this gentle singer is the son ofarchibald bellthecat  70 and now perhaps you can read with right sympathy the scene in marmion between his father and king james    his hand the monarch sudden took   now by the bruces soul   angus my hasty

more true   and while the king his hand did strain   the old mans tears fell down like rain  i believe the most infidel of scholastic readers can scarcely but perceive the relation between the sweetness simplicity and melody of expression in these passages and the gentleness of the passions they express while men who are not scholastic and yet are true scholars will recognize further in them that the simplicity of the educated is lovelier than the simplicity of the rude hear next a piece of spensers teaching how rudeness itself may become more beautiful even by its mistakes if the

and beauty buried be84  72 if now with the echo of these perfect verses in your mind you turn to byron and glance over or recall to memory enough of him to give means of exact comparison you will or should recognize these following kinds of mischief in him first if anyone offends himas for instance mr southey or lord elginhis manners have not that repose that marks the caste etc this defect in his lordships style being myself scrupulously and even painfully reserved in the use of vituperative language i need not say how deeply i deplore85  secondly in the best and most violetbedded bits of his work there is yet as compared with elizabethan and earlier verse a strange taint an indefinableevening flavor of covent garden as it werenot to say escape of gas in the strand that is simply what it proclaims itselflondon air if he had lived all his life in greenhead ghyll things would of course have been different but it was his fate to come to townmodern townlike michaels son and modern london and venice are answerable for the state of their drains not byron  thirdly his melancholy is without any relief whatsoever his jest sadder than his earnest while in elizabethan work all lament is full of hope and all pain of balsam  of this evil he has himself told you the cause in a single line prophetic of all things since and now where he gazed a gloom pervaded space86  so that for instance while mr wordsworth on a visit to town being an exemplary early riser could walk felicitous on westminster bridge remarking how the city now did like a garment wear the beauty of the morning byron rising somewhat later contemplated only the garment which the beauty of the morning had by that time received for wear from the city and again while mr wordsworth in irrepressible religious rapture calls god to witness that the houses seem asleep byron lame demon as he was flying smokedrifted unroofs the houses at a glance and sees what the mighty cockney heart of them contains in the still lying of it and will stir up to purpose in the waking business of it    the sordor of civilization mixed   with all the passions which mans fall hath fixed87  73 fourthly with this steadiness of bitter melancholy there is joined a sense of the material beauty both of inanimate nature the lower animals and human beings which in the iridescence colordepth and morbid i use the word deliberately mystery and softness of itwith other qualities indescribable by any single words and only to be analyzed by extreme careis found to the full only in five men that i know of in modern times namely rousseau shelley byron turner and myselfdiffering totally and throughout the entire group of us from the delight in clearstruck beauty of angelico and the trecentisti and separated much more singularly from the cheerful joys of chaucer shakespeare and scott by its unaccountable affection for rokkes blak and other forms of terror and power such as those of the iceoceans which to shakespeare were only alpine rheum and the via malas and diabolic bridges which dante would have condemned none but lost souls to climb or crossall this love of impending mountains coiled thunderclouds and dangerous sea being joined in us with a sulky almost ferine love of retreat in valleys of charmettes gulfs of spezzia ravines of olympus low lodgings in chelsea and close brushwood at coniston  74 and lastly also in the whole group of us glows volcanic instinct of astræan justice returning not to but up out of the earth which will not at all suffer us to rest any more in popes serene whatever is is right but holds on the contrary profound conviction that about ninetynine hundredths of whatever at present is is wrong conviction making four of us according to our several manners leaders of revolution for the poor and declarers of political doctrine monstrous to the ears of mercenary mankind and driving the fifth less sanguine into mere paintedmelody of lament over the fallacy of hope and the implacableness of fate  in byron the indignation the sorrow and the effort are joined to the death and they are the parts of his nature as of mine also in its feebler terms which the selfishly comfortable public have literally no conception of whatever and from which the piously sentimental public offering up daily the pure oblation of divine tranquillity shrink with anathema not unembittered by alarm  75 concerning which matters i hope to speak further and with more precise illustration in my next paper but seeing that this present one has been hitherto somewhat somber and perhaps to gentle readers not a little discomposing i will conclude it with a piece of light biographic study necessary to my plan and as conveniently admissible in this place as afterwardsnamely the account of the manner in which scottwhom we shall always find as aforesaid to be in salient and palpable elements of character of the world worldly as burns is of the flesh fleshly and byron of the deuce damnablespent his sunday  76 as usual from lockharts farrago we cannot find out the first thing we want to knowwhether scott worked after his weekday custom on the sunday morning but i gather not at all events his household and his cattle rested l iii 108 i imagine he walked out into his woods or read quietly in his study immediately after breakfast whoever was in the house ladies and gentlemen i shall read prayers at eleven when i expect you all to attend vii 306 question of college and other externally unanimous prayer settled for us very briefly if you have no faith have at least manners he read the church of england service lessons and all the latter if interesting eloquently ibid after the service one of jeremy taylors sermons vi 188 after sermon if the weather was fine walk with his family dogs included and guests to cold picnic iii 109 followed by short extempore biblical novelettes for he had his bible the old testament especially by heart it having been his mothers last gift to him vi 174 these lessons to his children in bible history were always given whether there was picnic or not for the rest of the afternoon he took his pleasure in the woods with tom purdie who also always appeared at his masters elbow on sunday after dinner was over and drank long life to the laird and his lady and all the good company in a quaigh of whisky or a tumbler of wine according to his fancy vi 195 whatever might happen on the other evenings of the week scott always dined at home on sunday and with old friends never unless inevitably receiving any person with whom he stood on ceremony v 335 he came into the room rubbing his hands like a boy arriving at home for the holidays his peppers and mustards gamboling about him and even the stately maida grinning and wagging his tail with sympathy for the usquebaugh of the less honored weekdays at the sunday board he circulated the champagne briskly during dinner and considered a pint of claret each mans fair share afterwards v 339 in the evening music being to the scottish worldly mind indecorous he read aloud some favorite author for the amusement or edification of his little circle shakespeare it might be or drydenjohnson or joanna bailliecrabbe or wordsworth but in those days byron was pouring out his spirit fresh and full and if a new piece from his hand had appeared it was sure to be read by scott the sunday evening afterwards and that with such delighted emphasis as showed how completely the elder bard had kept up his enthusiasm for poetry at pitch of youth and all his admiration of genius free pure and unstained by the least drop of literary jealousy v 341  77 with such necessary and easily imaginable varieties as chanced in having dandie dinmont or captain brown for guests at abbotsford or colonel mannering counselor pleydell and dr robertson in castle street such was scotts habitual sabbath a day we perceive of eating the fat dinner presumably not cold being a work of necessity and mercythou also even thou saint thomas of turnbull hast thine and drinking the sweet abundant in the manner of mr southeys cataract of lodorehere it comes sparkling a day bestrewn with coronatiöns and sops in wine deep in libations to good hope and fond memory a day of rest to beast and mirth to man as also to sympathetic beasts that can be merry and concluding itself in an orphic hour of delight signifying peace on tweedside and goodwill to men there or far awayalways excepting the french and boney  yes and see what it all came to in the end  not so darkvirulent minosmucklewrath the end came of quite other things of these came such length of days and peace as scott had in his fatherland and such immortality as he has in all lands  78 nathless firm though deeply courteous rebuke for his sometimes overmuch lightmindedness was administered to him by the more grave and thoughtful byron for the lord abbot of newstead knew his bible by heart as well as scott though it had never been given him by his mother as her dearest possession knew it and what was more had thought of it and sought in it what scott had never cared to think nor been fain to seek  and loving scott well and always doing him every possible pleasure in the way he sees to be most agreeable to himas for instance remembering with precision and writing down the very next morning every blessed word that the prince regent had been pleased to say of him before courtly audiencehe yet conceived that such cheap ryming as his own bride of abydos for instance which he had written from beginning to end in four days or even the traveling reflections of harold and juan on men and women were scarcely steady enough sunday afternoons reading for a patriarchmerlin like scott so he dedicates to him a work of a truly religious tendency on which for his own part he has done his bestthe drama of cain of which dedication the virtual significance to sir walter might be translated thus dearest and last of border soothsayers thou hast indeed told us of black dwarfs and of white maidens also of gray friars and green fairies also of sacred hollies by the well and haunted crooks in

things i have nevertheless asked his indulgence this time for a note or two concerning yet older fashions in order to bring into sharper clearness the leading outlines of literary fact which i ventured only in my last paper to secure in silhouette obscurely asserting itself against the limelight of recent moral creed and fiction manufacture  the bishop of manchester on the occasion of the great wordsworthian movement in that city for the enlargement adornment and sale of thirlmere observed in his advocacy of these operations that very few people he supposed had ever seen tairlmere his lordship might have supposed with greater felicity that very few people had ever read wordsworth my own experience in that matter is that the amiable persons who call themselves wordsworthian have readusually a long time agolucy gray the april mornings a picked sonnet or two and the ode on the intimations which last they seem generally to be under the impression that nobody else has ever met with and my further experience of these sentimental students is that they are seldom inclined to put in practice a single syllable of the advice tendered them by their model poet  now as i happen myself to have used wordsworth as a daily textbook from youth to age and have lived moreover in all essential points according to the tenor of his teaching it was matter of some mortification to me when at oxford i tried to get the memory of mr wilkinsons spade honored by some practical spadework at ferry hincksey to find that no other tutor in oxford could see the slightest good or meaning in what i was about and that although my friend professor rolleston occasionally sought the shades of our rydalian laurels with expressions of admiration his professorial manner of from pastoral graves extracting thoughts divine was to fill the oxford museum with the scabbed skulls of plaguestruck cretins  80 i therefore respectfully venture to intimate to my bucolic friends that i know more vitally by far than they what is in wordsworth and what is not any man who chooses to live by his precepts will thankfully find in them a beauty and rightness exquisite rightness i called it in sesame and lilies which will preserve him alike from mean pleasure vain hope and guilty deed so that he will neither mourn at the gate of the fields which with covetous spirit he sold nor drink of the waters which with yet more covetous spirit he stole nor devour the bread of the poor in secret nor set on his guesttable the poor mans lambin all these homely virtues and assured justices let him be wordsworths true disciple and he will then be able with equanimity to hear it said when there is need to say so that his excellent master often wrote verses that were not musical and sometimes expressed opinions that were not profound  and the need to say so becomes imperative when the unfinished verse and uncorrected fancy are advanced by the affection of his disciples into places of authority where they give countenance to the popular national prejudices from the infection of which in most cases they themselves sprang  81 take for example the following three and a half lines of the 38th ecclesiastical sonnet    amazement strikes the crowd while many turn   their eyes away in sorrow others burn   with scorn invoking a vindictive ban   from outraged nature  the first quite evident character of these lines is that they are extremely bad iambicsas illconstructed as they are unmelodious the turning and burning being at the wrong ends of them and the ends themselves put just when the sentence is in its middle  but a graver fault of these three and a half lines is that the amazement the turning the burning and the banning are all alike fictitious and foulfictitious calumniously conceived no less than falsely not one of the spectators of the scene referred to was in reality amazednot one contemptuous not one maledictory it is only our gentle minstrel of the meres who sits in the seat of the scornfulonly the hermit of rydal mount who invokes the malison of nature  what the scene verily was and how witnessed it will not take long to tell nor will the tale be useless but i must first refer the reader to a period preceding by nearly a century the great symbolic action under the porch of st marks  82 the protestant ecclesiastic and infidel historian who delight to prop their pride or edge their malice in unveiling the corruption through which christianity has passed should study in every fragment of authentic record which the fury of their age has left the lives of the three queens of the priesthood theodora marozia and matilda and the foundation of the merciless power of the popes by the monk hildebrand and if there be any of us who would satisfy with nobler food than the catastrophes of the stage the awe at what is marvelous in human sorrow which makes sacred the fountain of tears in authentic tragedy let them follow pace by pace and pang by pang the humiliation of the fourth henry at canossa and his death in the church he had built to the virgin at spire  his antagonist hildebrand died twenty years before him captive to the normans in salerno having seen the rome in which he had proclaimed his princedom over all the earth laid in her last ruin and forever rome herself since her desolation by guiscard has been only a grave and a wilderness89what we call rome is a mere colony of the stranger in her field of mars this destruction of rome by the normans is accurately and utterly the end of her capitoline and wolfsuckled power and from that day her leonine or christian power takes its throne in the leonine city sanctified in tradition by its prayer of safety for the saxon borgo in which the childhood of our own alfred had been trained  and from this date forward recollected broadly as 1090 the year of the birth of st bernard no longer oppressed by the remnants of roman deathchristian faith chivalry and art possess the world and recreate it through the space of four hundred yearsthe twelfth thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth centuries  and necessarily in the first of these centuries comes the main debate between the powers of monk and knight which was reconciled in this scene under the porch of st marks  83 that debate was brought to its crisis and issue by the birth of the new third elemental force of the statethe citizen sismondis republican enthusiasm does not permit him to recognize the essential character of this power he speaks always of the republics and the liberties of italy as if a craftsman differed from a knight only in political privileges and as if his special virtue consisted in rendering obedience to no master but the strength of the great cities of italy was no more republican than that of her monasteries or fortresses the craftsman of milan sailor of pisa and merchant of venice are all of them essentially different persons from the soldier and the anchoritebut the city under the banner of its caroccio and the command of its podesta was disciplined far more strictly than any wandering military squadron by its leader or any lower order of monks under their abbot in the founding of civic constitutions the lord of the city is usually its bishopand it is curious to hear the republican historianwho however in judgment blind is never in heart uncandid prepare to close his record of the ten years war of como with milan with this summary of distress to the heroic mountaineersthat they had lost their bishop guido who was their soul  84 i perceive for quite one of the most hopeless of the many difficulties which modernism finds and will find insuperable either by steam or dynamite that of either wedging or welding into its own castiron head any conception of a king monk or townsman of the twelfth and two succeeding centuries and yet no syllable of the utterance no fragment of the arts of the middle ages far less any motive of their deeds can be read even in the letterhow much less judged in spiritunless first of all we can somewhat imagine all these three living souls  first a king who was the best knight in his kingdom and on whose own swordstrokes hung the fate of christendom a king such as henry the fowler the first and third edwards of england the bruce of scotland and this frederic the first of germany  secondly a monk who had been trained from youth in greater hardship than any soldier and had learned at last to desire no other life than one of hardshipa man believing in his own and his fellows immortality in the aiding powers of angels and the eternal presence of god versed in all the science graceful in all the literature cognizant of all the policy of his age and fearless of any created thing on the earth or under it  and lastly a craftsman absolutely master of his craft and taking such pride in the exercise of it as all healthy souls take in putting forth their personal powers proud also of his city and his people enriching year by year their streets with loftier buildings their treasuries with rarer possession and bequeathing his hereditary art to a line of successive masters by whose tact of race and honor of effort the essential skills of metalwork in gold and steel of pottery glasspainting woodwork and weaving were carried to a perfectness never to be surpassed and of which our utmost modern hope is to produce a not instantly detected imitation  these three kinds of persons i repeat we have to conceive before we can understand any single event of the middle ages for all that is enduring in them was done by men such as these history indeed records twenty undoings for one deed twenty desolations for one redemption and thinks the fool and villain potent as the wise and true but nature and her laws recognize only the noble generations of the cruel pass like the darkness of locust plagues while one loving and brave heart establishes a nation  85 i give the character of barbarossa in the words of sismondi a man sparing in the praise of emperors  the death of frederic was mourned even by the cities which so long had been the objects of his hostility and the victims of his vengeance all the lombardseven the milaneseacknowledged his rare courage his constancy in misfortunehis generosity in conquest  an intimate conviction of the justice of his cause had often rendered him cruel even to ferocity against those who still resisted but after victory he took vengeance only on senseless walls and irritated as he had been by the people of milan crema and tortona and whatever blood he had shed during battle he never sullied his triumph by odious punishments in spite of the treason which he on one occasion used against alessandria his promises were in general respected and when after the peace of constance the towns which had been most inveterately hostile to him received him within their walls they had no need to guard against any attempt on his part to suppress the privileges he had once recognized  my own estimate of frederics character would be scarcely so favorable it is the only point of history on which i have doubted the authority even of my own master carlyle but i am concerned here only with the actualities of his wars in italy with the people of her cities and the head of her religion  86 frederic of suabia direct heir of the ghibelline rights while nearly related by blood to the guelph houses of bavaria and saxony was elected emperor almost in the exact middle of the twelfth century 1152 he was called into italy by the voices of italians the then pope eugenius iii invoked his aid against the roman people under arnold of brescia the people of lodi prayed his protection against the tyrannies of milan  frederic entered the plain of verona in 1154 by the valley of the adigeravaged the territory of milanpillaged and burned tortona asti and chierikept his christmas at novara marched on romedelivered up arnold to the pope90 who instantly killing him ended for that time protestant reforms in italydestroyed spoleto and returned by verona having scorched his path through italy like a level thunderbolt along the ground  three years afterwards adrian died and chiefly by the love and will of the roman people roland of siena was raised to the papal throne under the name of alexander iii the conclave of cardinals chose another pope victor iii frederic on his second invasion of italy 1158 summoned both elected heads of the church to receive judgment of their claims before him  the cardinals pope victor obeyed the peoples alexander refused answering that the successor of st peter submitted himself to the judgment neither of emperors nor councils  the spirit of modern prelacy may perhaps have rendered it impossible for an english churchman to conceive this answer as other than that of insolence and hypocrisy but a faithful pope and worthy of his throne could answer no otherwise frederic of course at once confirmed the claims of his rival the german bishops and italian cardinals in council at pavia joined their powers to the emperors and alexander driven from rome wanderedunsubdued in soulfrom city to city taking refuge at last in france  87 meantime in 1159 frederic took and destroyed crema having first bound its hostages to his machines of war in 1161 milan submitted to his mercy and he decreed that her name should perish only a few pillars of a roman temple and the church of st ambrose remain to us of the ancient city warned by her destruction verona vicenza padua treviso and venice joined in the vowcalled of the lombard leagueto reduce the emperors power within its just limits and in 1164 alexander under the protection of louis vii of france and henry ii of england returned to rome and was received at ostia by its senate clergy and people  three years afterwards frederic again swept down on the campagna attacked the leonine city where the basilica of the vatican changed into a fortress and held by the popes guard resisted his assault until by the emperors order fire was set to the church of st mary of pity  the leonine city was taken the pope retired to the coliseum whence uttering once again his fixed defiance of the emperor but fearing treachery he fled in disguise down the tiber to the sea and sought asylum at benevento  the german army encamped round rome in august of 1166 with the sign before their eyes of the ruins of the church of our lady of pity the marshfever struck themkilled the emperors cousin frederic of rothenburg the duke of bavaria the archbishop of cologne the bishops of liége spire ratisbonne and verden and two thousand knights the common dead were uncounted the emperor gathered the wreck of his army together retreated on lombardy quartered his soldiery at pavia and escaped in secret over the mont cenis with thirty knights  88 no places of strength remained to him south of the alps but pavia and montferrat and to hold these in check and command the plains of piedmont the lombard league built the fortress city which from the pope who had maintained through all adversity the authority of his throne and the cause of the italian people they named alessandria  against this bulwark the emperor still indomitable dashed with his utmost regathered strength after eight years of pause and in the temper in which men set their souls on a single stake all had been lost in his last war except his honorin this he lost his honor also whatever may be the just estimate of the other elements of his character he is unquestionably among the knights of his time notable in impiety in the battle of cassano he broke through the milanese vanguard to their caroccio and struck down with his own hand its golden crucifixtwo years afterwards its cross and standard were bowed before himand in vain91 he fearlessly claims for himself right of decision between contending popes and camps against the rightful one on the ashes of the church of the virgin  foiled in his first assault on alessandria detained before it through the inundations of the winter and threatened by the army of the league in the spring he announced a truce to the besieged that they might keep good friday then violating alike the days sanctity and his own oath he attacked the trusting city through a secretly completed mine and for a second time the verdict of god went forth against him every man who had obtained entrance within the city was slain or cast from its rampartsthe alessandrines threw all their gates openfell with the broken fugitives on the investing troops scattered them in disorder and burned their towers of attack the emperor gathered their remains into pavia on easter sundayspared in his defeat by the army of the league  89 and yet once more he brought his cause to combattrial temporizing at lodi with the popes legates he assembled under the archbishops of magdebourg and cologne and the chief prelates and princes of germany a seventh army brought it down to como across the splügen put himself there at its head and in the early spring of 1176 the fifteenth year since he had decreed the effacing of the name of milan was met at legnano by the specter of milan  risen from her grave she led the lombard league in this final battle three hundred of her nobles guarded her caroccio nine hundred of her knights bound themselvesunder the name of the cohort of deathto win for her or to die  the field of battle is in the midst of the plain now covered with maize and mulberry trees from which the traveler entering italy by the lago maggiore sees first the unbroken snows of the rosa behind him and the white pinnacles of milan cathedral in the south the emperor as was his wont himself led his charging chivalry the milanese knelt as it cameprayed aloud to god st peter and st ambrosethen advanced round their caroccio on foot the emperors charge broke through their ranks nearly up to their standardthen the cohort of death rode against him  90 and all his battle changed before them into flight for the first time in stricken field the imperial standard fell and was taken the milanese followed the broken host until their swords were weary and the emperor struck fighting from his horse was left lost among the dead the empress whose mercy to milan he had forbidden already wore mourning for him in pavia when her husband came solitary and suppliant to its gate  the lesson at last sufficed and barbarossa sent his heretic bishops to ask forgiveness of the pope and peace from the lombards  pardon and peace were grantedwithout conditions cæsars successor had been the blight of italy for a quarter of a century he had ravaged her harvests burnt her cities decimated her children with famine her young men with the sword and seven times over in renewed invasion sought to establish dominion over her from the alps to the rock of scylla  she asked of him no restitutioncoveted no provincedemanded no fortress of his land neither coward nor robber she disdained alike guard and gain upon her frontiers she counted no compensation for her sorrow and set no price upon the souls of her dead she stood in the porch of her brightest templebetween the blue plains of her earth and sea and in the person of her spiritual father gave her enemy pardon  black demons hovering oer his mitered head think you gentle sonneteer of the daffodilmarsh and have barbarossas race been taught of better angels how to bear themselves to a conquered emperoror england by braver and more generous impulses how to protect his exiled son  the fall of venice since that day was measured by byron in a single line    an emperor tramples where an emperor knelt  but what words shall measure the darker humiliation of the german pillaging his helpless enemy and england leaving her ally under the savages spear  91 with the clews now given and an hour or twos additional reading of any standard historian he pleases the reader may judge on secure grounds whether the truce of venice and peace of constance were of the devils making whereof whatever he may ultimately feel or affirm this at least he will please note for positive that mr wordsworth having no shadow of doubt of the complete wisdom of every idea that comes into his own head writes down in dogmatic sonnet his first impression of black instrumentality in the business so that his innocent readers taking him for their sole master far from caring to inquire into the thing more deeply may remain even unconscious that it is disputable and forever incapable of conceiving either a catholics feeling or a careful historians hesitation touching the centrally momentous crisis of power in all the middle ages whereas byron knowing the history thoroughly and judging of catholicism with an honest and open heart ventures to assert nothing that admits of debate either concerning human motives or angelic presences but binds into one line of massive melody the unerringly counted sum of venetian majesty and shame  92 in a future paper i propose examining his method of dealing with the debate itself on a higher issue and will therefore close the present one by trampling a few of the briers and thorns of popular offense out of our way  the common counts against byron are in the main three  i that he confessedin some sort even proclaimed defiantly which is a proud mans natural manner of confession92the naughtiness of his life  the hypocrisy93 even of pall mall and petit trianon does not i assume and dares not go so far as to condemn the naughtiness itself and that he did confess it is precisely the reason for reading him by his own motto trust byron you always may and the common smoothcountenanced man of the world is guiltier in the precise measure of your higher esteem for him  ii that he wrote about pretty things which ought never to be heard of  in the presence of the exact proprieties of modern fiction art and drama i am shy of touching on the question of what should be mentioned and seenand should not all that i care to say here is that byron tells you of realities and that their being pretty ones is to my mindat the first literally blush of the matter rather in his favor if however you have imagined that he means you to think dudu as pretty as myrrha94 or even haidee whether in full dress or none as pretty as marina it is your fault not his  93 iii that he blasphemed god and the king  before replying to this count i must ask the readers patience in a piece of very serious work the ascertainment of the real and full meaning of the word blasphemy it signifies simply harmful speakingmaledictionor shortly blame and may be committed as much against a child or a dog if you desire to hurt them as against the deity and it is in its original use accurately opposed to another greek word euphemy which means a reverent and loving manner of benedictionfallen entirely into disuse in modern sentiment and language  now the compass and character of essential malediction socalled in latin or blasphemy socalled in greek may i think be best explained to the general reader by an instance in a very little thing first translating the short pieces of plato which best show the meaning of the word in codes of greek morality       these are the things then the true order of the sun moon and      planets oh my friends of which i desire that all our citizens      and youths should learn at least so much concerning the gods of      heaven as not to blaspheme concerning them but to eupheme      reverently both in sacrificing and in every prayer they      praylaws vii steph 821       and through the whole of life beyond all other need for it there      is need of euphemy from a man to his parents for there is no      heavier punishment than that of light and winged words to      them for nemesis the angel of divine recompense has been      throned bishop over all men who sin in such manneriv steph      717  the word which i have translated recompense is more strictly that heavenly justicethe proper light of the world from which nothing can be hidden and by which all who will may walk securely whence the mystic answer of ulysses to his son as athena herself invisible walks with them filling the chamber of the house with light this is the justice of the gods who possess olympus see the context in reference to which plato quotes the linelaws x steph 904 the little story that i have to tell is significant chiefly in connection with the second passage of plato above quoted  94 i have elsewhere mentioned that i was a homebred boy and that as my mother diligently and scrupulously taught me my bible and latin grammar so my father fondly and devotedly taught me my scott my pope and my byron95 the latin grammar out of which my mother taught me was the 11th edition of alexander adamsedinb bell and bradfute 1823namely that alexander adam rector of edinburgh high school into whose upper class scott passed in october 1782 and whoprevious masters having found nothing noticeable in the heavylooking laddid find sterling qualities in him and would constantly refer to him for dates and particulars of battles and other remarkable events alluded to in horace or whatever other authors the boys were reading and called him the historian of his class l i 126 that alex adam also who himself a loving historian remembered the fate of every boy at his school during the fifty years he had headed it and whose last wordsit grows dark the boys may dismiss gave to scotts heart the vision and the audit of the death of elspeth of the craigburnfoot  strangely in opening the old volume at this moment i would not give it for an illuminated missal i find in its article on prosody some things extremely useful to me which i have been hunting for in vain through zumpt and matthiæ in all rational respects i believe it to be the best latin grammar that has yet been written  when my mother had carried me through it as far as the syntax it was thought desirable that i should be put under a master and the master chosen was a deeply and deservedly honored clergyman the rev thomas dale mentioned in mr holbeachs article the new fiction contemporary review for february of this year together with mr melville who was our pastor after mr dale went to st pancras  95 on the first day when i went to take my seat in mr dales schoolroom i carried my old grammar to him in a modest pride expecting some encouragement and honor for the accuracy with which i could repeat on demand some hundred and sixty closeprinted pages of it  but mr dale threw it back to me with a fierce bang upon his desk saying with accent and look of seventimesheated scorn thats a scotch thing  now my father being scotch and an edinburgh high school boy and my mother having labored in that book with me since i could read and all my happiest holiday time having been spent on the north inch of perth these four words with the action accompanying them contained as much insult pain and loosening of my respect for my parents love of my fathers country and honor for its worthies as it was possible to compress into four syllables and an illmannered gesture which were therefore pure doubleedged and pointenvenomed blasphemy for to make a boy despise his mothers care is the straightest way to make him also despise his redeemers voice and to make him scorn his father and his fathers house the straightest way to make him deny his god and his gods heaven  96 i speak observe in this instance only of the actual words and their effect not of the feeling in the speakers mind which was almost playful though his words tainted with extremity of pride were such light ones as men shall give account of at the day of judgment the real sin of blasphemy is not in the saying nor even in the thinking but in the wishing which is father to thought and word and the nature of it is simply in wishing evil to anything for as the quality of mercy is not strained so neither that of blasphemy the one distilling from the clouds of heaven the other from the steam of the pit he that is unjust in little is unjust in much he that is malignant to the least is to the greatest he who hates the earth which is gods footstool hates yet more heaven which is gods throne and him that sitteth thereon finally therefore blasphemy is wishing ill to any thing and its outcome is in vanni fuccis extreme ill mannerswishing ill to god  on the contrary euphemy is wishing well to everything and its outcome is in burns extreme good manners wishing well to    ah wad ye tak a thought and men  that is the supreme of euphemy  97 fix then first in your minds that the sin of malediction whether shimeis individual or john bulls national is in the vulgar malignity not in the vulgar diction and then note further that the phemy or fame of the two words blasphemy and euphemy signifies broadly the bearing of false witness against ones neighbor in the one case and of true witness for him in the other so that while the peculiar province of the blasphemer is to throw firelight on the evil in good persons the province of the euphuist i must use the word inaccurately for want of a better is to throw sunlight on the good in bad ones such for instance as bertram meg merrilies rob roy robin hood and the general run of corsairs giaours turks jews infidels and heretics nay even sisters of rahab and daughters of moab and ammon and at last the whole spiritual race of him to whom it was said if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted  98 and being thus brought back to our actual subject i purpose after a few more summary notes on the luster of the electrotype language of modern passion to examine what facts or probabilities lie at the root both of goethes and byrons imagination of that contest between the powers of good and evil of which the scriptural account appears to mr huxley so inconsistent with the recognized laws of political economy and has been by the cowardice of our old translators so maimed of its vitality that the frank greek assertion of st michaels not daring to blaspheme the devil96 is tenfold more mischievously deadened and caricatured by their periphrasis of durst not bring against him a railing accusation than by byrons apparentlyand only apparentlyless reverent description of

reading your interesting article in the june number of the nineteenth century and your quotation from walter scott i was struck with the great similarity between some of the scotch words and my native

same as in scotch and derived from at male to paint siccan is in danish sikken used more about something comical than great and scarcely belonging to the written language in which slig such and slig

everybody knew what fiction meant as mr mill assumed in his political economy that everybody knew what wealth meant the assumption was convenient to mr mill and persisted in but for my own part i am not in the habit of talking even so long as i have done in this instance without making sure that the reader knows what i am talking about and it is high time that we should be agreed upon the primary notion of what fiction is  a feigned fictitious artificial supernatural puttogetheroutofoneshead thing all this it must be to begin with the best type of it being the most practically fictilea greek vase a thing which has two sides to be seen two handles to be carried by and a bottom to stand on and a top to be poured out of this every right fiction is whatever else it may be planned rigorously rounded smoothly balanced symmetrically handled handily lipped softly for pouring out oil and wine painted daintily at last with images of eternal things    forever shalt thou love and she be fair  101 quite a different thing from a castthis work of clay in the hands of the potter as it seemed good to the potter to make it very interesting a cast from life may perhaps be more interesting to some people perhaps a cast from deathmost modern novels are like specimens from lyme regis impressions of skeletons in mud  planned rigorouslyi press the conditions again one by oneit must be as ever memphian labyrinth or norman fortress intricacy full of delicate surprise covered way in secrecy of accurate purposes not a stone useless nor a word nor an incident thrown away  rounded smoothlythe wheel of fortune revolving with it in unfelt swiftness like the world its story rising like the dawn closing like the sunset with its own sweet light for every hour  balanced symmetricallyhaving its two sides clearly separate its war of good and evil rightly divided its figures moving in majestic law of light and shade  handled handilyso that being careful and gentle you can take easy grasp of it and all that it contains a thing given into your hand henceforth to have and to hold comprehensible not a mass that both your arms cannot get round tenable not a confused pebble heap of which you can only lift one pebble at a time  lipped softlyfull of kindness and comfort the keats line indeed the perpetual message of itfor ever shalt thou love and she be fair all beautiful fiction is of the madonna whether the virgin of athens or of judahpanathenaic always  and all foul fiction is leze majesté to the madonna and to womanhood for indeed the great fiction of every human life is the shaping of its love with due prudence due imagination due persistence and perfection from the beginning of its story to the end for every human soul its palladium and it follows that all right imaginative work is beautiful which is a practical and brief law concerning it all frightful things are either foolish or sick visits of frenzy or pollutions of plague  102 taking thus the greek vase at its best time for the symbol of fair fiction of foul you may find in the great entranceroom of the louvre filled with the luxurious orfèvrerie of the sixteenth century types perfect and innumerable satyrs carved in serpentine gorgons platted in gold furies with eyes of ruby scyllas with scales of pearl infinitely worthless toil infinitely witless wickedness pleasure satiated into idiocy passion provoked into madness no object of thought or sight or fancy but horror mutilation distortion corruption agony of war insolence of disgrace and misery of death  it is true that the ease with which a serpent or something that will be understood for one can be chased or wrought in metal and the small workmanly skill required to image a satyrs hoof and horns as compared to that needed for a human foot or forehead have greatly influenced the choice of subject by incompetent smiths and in like manner the prevalence of such vicious or ugly story in the mass of modern literature is not so much a sign of the lasciviousness of the age as of its stupidity though each react on the other and the vapor of the sulphurous pool becomes at last so diffused in the atmosphere of our cities that whom it cannot corrupt it will at least stultify  103 yesterday the last of august came to me from the fine art society a series of twenty black and white scrabbles99 of which i am informed in an eloquent preface that the author was a michael angelo of the glebe and that his shepherds and his herdswomen are akin in dignity and grandeur to the prophets and sibyls of the sistine  glancing through the series of these stupendous productions i find one peculiarly characteristic and expressive of modern picturemaking and novelwritingcalled hauling or more definitely paysan rentrant du fumier which represents a mans back or at least the back of his waistcoat and trousers and hat in full light and a small blot where his face should be with a small scratch where its nose should be elongated into one representing a chink of timber in the background  examining the volume farther in the hope of discovering some trace of reasonable motive for the publication of these works by the society i perceive that this michael angelo of the glebe had indeed natural faculty of no mean order in him and that the woeful history of his life contains very curious lessons respecting the modern conditions of imagination and art  104 i find in the first place that he was a breton peasant his grandmothers godson baptized in good hope and christened jean after his father and françois after the saint of assisi his godmothers patron it was under her care and guidance and those of his uncle the abbé charles that he was reared and the dignified and laborious earnestness of these governors of his was a chief influence in his life and a distinguishing feature in his character the millet family led an existence almost patriarchal in its unalterable simplicity and diligence and the boy grew up in an environment of toil sincerity and devoutness he was fostered upon the bible and the great book of nature when he woke it was to the lowing of cattle and the song of birds he was at play all day among the sights and sounds of the open landscape and he slept with the murmur of the spinningwheel in his ears and the memory of the evening prayer in his heart he learned latin from the parish priest and from his uncle charles and he soon came to be a student of virgil and while yet young in his teens began to follow his father out into the fields and thenceforward as became the eldest boy in a large family worked hard at grafting and plowing sowing and reaping scything and shearing and planting and all the many duties of husbandmen meanwhile he had taken to drawing  copied everything he saw and produced not only studies but compositions also until at last his father was moved to take him away from farming and have him taught painting  105 now all this is related concerning the lads early life by the prefatory and commenting author as if expecting the general reader to admit that there had been some advantage for him in this manner of educationthat simplicity and devoutness are wholesome states of mind that parish curés and uncle abbés are not betrayers or devourers of youthful innocencethat there is profitable reading in the bible and something agreeably soothingif not otherwise usefulin the sound of evening prayer i may observe also in passing that his education thus far is precisely what for the last ten years i have been describing as the most desirable for all persons intending to lead an honest and christian life my recommendation that peasants should learn latin having been some four or five years ago the subject of much merriment in the pages of judy and other such nurses of divine wisdom in the public mind it however having been determined by the boys father that he should be a painter and that art being unknown to the abbé charles and the village curé in which manner of ignorance if the infallible pope did but know it he and his now artless shepherds stand at a fatal disadvantage in the world as compared with monks who could illuminate with color as well as wordthe simple young soul is sent for the exalting and finishing of its artistic faculties to paris  106 wherein observers my prefatory author the romantic movement was in the full tide of prosperity  hugo had written notre dame and musset had published rolla and the nuits balzac the lys dans la vallée gautier the comédie de la mort georges sand léone léonie and a score of wild and eloquent novels more and under the instruction of these romantic authors his landlady to whom he had intrusted the few francs he possessed to dole out to him as he needed fell in love with him and finding he could not or would not respond to her advances confiscated the whole deposit and left him penniless the preface goes on to tell us how not feeling himself in harmony with these forms of romanticism he takes to the study of the infinite and michael angelo how he learned to paint the heroic nude how he mixed up for imitation the manners of rubens ribera mantegna and correggio how he struggled all his life with neglect and endured with his family every agony of poverty owed his butcher and his grocer was exposed to endless worry and annoyance from writs and executions and when first his grandmother died and then his mother neither deathbed was able to raise the money that would have carried him from barbizon to gruchy  the work now laid before the public by the fine art society is to be considered thereforewhatever its merits or defects may beas an expression of the influence of the infinite and michael angelo on a mind innocently prepared for their reception and in another place i may take occasion to point out the peculiar adaptability of modern etching to the expression of the infinite by the multitude of scratches it can put on a surface without representing anything in particular and to illustration of the majesty of michael angelo by preference of the backs and legs of people to their faces  107 but i refer to the book in this paper partly indeed because my mind is full of its sorrow and i may not be able to find another opportunity of saying so but chiefly because the author of the preface has summed the principal authors of depraved fiction in a single sentence and i want the reader to ask himself why among all the forms of the picturesque which were suggested by this body of literary leaders none were acceptable by none helpful to the mind of a youth trained in purity and faith  he will find if he reflect that it is not in romantic or any other healthy aim that the school detaches itself from those called sometimes by recent writers classical but first by infidelity and an absence of the religious element so total that at last it passes into the hatred of priesthood which has become characteristic of republicanism and secondly by the taint and leprosy of animal passion idealized as a governing power of humanity or at least used as the chief element of interest in the conduct of its histories it is with the sin of master anthony that georges sand who is the best of them overshadows the entire course of a novel meant to recommend simplicity of lifeand by the weakness of consuelo that the same authoress thinks it natural to set off the splendor of the most exalted musical genius  i am not able to judge of the degree of moral purpose or conviction with which any of the novelists wrote but i am able to say with certainty that whatever their purpose their method is mistaken and that no good is ever done to society by the pictorial representation of its diseases  108 all healthy and helpful literature sets simple bars between right and wrong assumes the possibility in men and women of having healthy minds in healthy bodies and loses no time in the diagnosis of fever or dyspepsia in either least of all in the particular kind of fever which signifies the ungoverned excess of any appetite or passion the dullness which many modern readers inevitably feel and some modern blockheads think it creditable to allege in scott consists not a little in his absolute purity from every loathsome element or excitement of the lower passions so that people who live habitually in satyric or hircine conditions of thought find him as insipid as they would a picture of angelicos the accurate and trenchant separation between him and the common railroadstation novelist is that in his total method of conception only lofty character is worth describing at all and it becomes interesting not by its faults but by the difficulties and accidents of the fortune through which it passes while in the railway novel interest is obtained with the vulgar reader for the vilest character because the author describes carefully to his recognition the blotches burrs and pimples in which the paltry nature resembles his own the mill on the floss is perhaps the most striking instance extant of this study of cutaneous disease there is not a single person in the book of the smallest importance to anybody in the world but themselves or whose qualities deserved so much as a line of printers type in their description there is no girl alive fairly clever half educated and unluckily related whose life has not at least as much in it as maggies to be described and to be pitied tom is a clumsy and cruel lout with the making of better things in him and the same may be said of nearly every englishman at present smoking and elbowing his way through the ugly world his blunders have contributed to the making of while the rest of the characters are simply the sweepings out of a pentonville omnibus100  109 and it is very necessary that we should distinguish this essentially cockney literature developed only in the london suburbs and feeding the demand of the rows of similar brick houses which branch in devouring cancer round every manufacturing townfrom the really romantic literature of france georges sand is often immoral but she is always beautiful and in the characteristic novel i have named le péché de mons antoine the five principal characters the old cavalier marquisthe carpenterm de chateaubrungilberteand the really passionate and generous lover are all as heroic and radiantly ideal as scotts colonel mannering catherine seyton and roland graeme while the landscape is rich and true with the emotion of years of life passed in glens of norman granite and beside bays of italian sea but in the english cockney school which consummates itself in george eliot the personages are picked up from behind the counter and out of the gutter and the landscape by excursion train to gravesend with return ticket for the cityroad  110 but the second reason for the dullness of scott to the uneducated or miseducated reader lies far deeper and its analysis is related to the most subtle questions in the arts of design  the mixed gayety and gloom in the plan of any modern novel fairly clever in the make of it may be likened almost with precision to the patchwork of a harlequins dress well spangled a pretty thing enough if the human form beneath it be graceful and active few personages on the stage are more delightful to me than a good harlequin also if i chance to have nothing better to do i can still read my georges sand or alfred de musset with much contentment if only the story end well  but we must not dress cordelia or rosalind in robes of triangular patches covered with spangles by way of making the coup doeil of them less dull and so the storytelling of scott is like the robe of the sistine zipporahembroidered only on the edges with gold and blue and the embroidery involving a legend written in mystic letters  and the interest and joy which he intends his reader to find in his tale are in taking up the golden thread here and there in its intended recurrenceand following as it rises again and again his melody through the disciplined and unaccented march of the fugue  111 thus the entire charm and meaning of the story of the monastery depend on the degree of sympathy with which we compare the first and last incidents of the appearance of a character whom perhaps not one in twenty readers would remember as belonging to the dramatis personæstawarth bolton  childless he assures safety in the first scene of the opening tale to the widow of glendinning and her two childrenthe elder boy challenging him at the moment i will war on thee to the death when i can draw my fathers sword in virtually the last scene the grown youth now in command of a small company of spearmen in the regent murrays service is on foot in the first pause after the battle at kennaquhair beside the dead bodies of julian avenel and christie and the dying catherine101  glendinning forgot for a moment his own situation and duties and was first recalled to them by a trampling of horse and the cry of st george for england which the english soldiers still continued to use his handful of men for most of the stragglers had waited for murrays coming up remained on horseback holding their lances upright having no command either to submit or resist  there stands our captain said one of them as a strong party of english came up the vanguard of fosters troop  your captain with his sword sheathed and on foot in the presence of his enemy a raw soldier i warrant him said the english leader so ho young man is your dream out and will you now answer me if you will fight or fly  neither answered halbert glendinning with great tranquillity  then throw down thy sword and yield thee answered the englishman  not till i can help myself no otherwise said halbert with the same moderation of tone and manner  art thou for thine own hand friend or to whom dost thou owe service demanded the english captain  to the noble earl of murray  then thou servest said the southron the most disloyal nobleman who breathesfalse both to england and scotland  thou liest said glendinning regardless of all consequences  ha art thou so hot now and wert so cold but a minute since i lie do i wilt thou do battle with me on that quarrel  with one to one one to two or two to five as you list said halbert glendinning grant me but a fair field  that thou shalt have stand back my mates said the brave englishman if i fall give him fair play and let him go off free with his people  long life to the noble captain cried the soldiers as impatient to see the duel as if it had been a bull  he will have a short life of it though said the sergeant if he an old man of sixty is to fight for any reason or for no reason with every man he meets and especially the young fellows he might be father to and here comes the warden besides to see the swordplay  in fact sir john foster came up with a considerable body of his horsemen just as his captain whose age rendered him unequal to the combat with so strong and active a youth as glendinning lost his sword102  take it up for shame old stawarth bolton said the english warden and thou young man get you gone to your own friends and loiter not here  notwithstanding this peremptory order halbert glendinning could not help stopping to cast a look upon the unfortunate catherine who lay insensible of the danger and of the trampling of so many horses around herinsensible as the second glance assured him of all and forever glendinning almost rejoiced when he saw that the last misery of life was over and that the hoofs of the warhorses amongst which he was compelled to leave her could only injure and deface a senseless corpse he caught the infant from her arms half ashamed of the shout of laughter which rose on all sides at seeing an armed man in such a situation assume such an unwonted and inconvenient burden  shoulder your infant cried a harquebusier  port your infant said a pikeman  peace ye brutes said stawarth bolton and respect humanity in others if you have none yourselves i pardon the lad having done some discredit to my gray hairs when i see him take care of that helpless creature which ye would have trampled upon as if ye had been littered of bitchwolves not born of women  the infant thus saved is the heir of avenel and the intricacy and fateful bearing of every incident and word in the scene knitting into one central moment all the clews to the plot of two romances as the rich boss of a gothic vault gathers the shaft moldings of it can only be felt by an entirely attentive reader just as to follow out the likeness on scotts own ground the willowwreaths changed to stone of melrose tracery can only be caught in their plighting by the keenest eyes the meshes are again gathered by the masters own hand when the child now in halberts arms twenty years hence stoops over him to unlace his helmet as the fallen knight lies senseless on the field of carberry hill103  112 but there is another and a still more hidden method in scotts designing of story in which taking extreme pains he counts on much sympathy from the reader and can assuredly find none in a modern student the moral purpose of the whole which he asserted in the preface to the first edition of waverley was involved always with the minutest study of the effects of true and false religion on the conductwhich subject being always touched with his utmost lightness of hand and stealthiness of art and founded on a knowledge of the scotch character and the human heart such as no other living man possessed his purpose often escapes first observation as completely as the inner feelings of living people do and i am myself amazed as i take any single piece of his work up for examination to find how many of its points i had before missed or disregarded  113 the groups of personages whose conduct in the scott romance is definitely affected by religious conviction may be arranged broadly as those of the actual world under these following heads  1 the lowest group consists of persons who believing in the general truths of evangelical religion accommodate them to their passions and are capable by gradual increase in depravity of any crime or violence i am not going to include these in our present study trumbull red gauntlet trusty tomkyns woodstock burley old mortality are three of the principal types  2 the next rank above these consists of men who believe firmly and truly enough to be restrained from any conduct which they clearly recognize as criminal but whose natural selfishness renders them incapable of understanding the morality of the bible above a certain point and whose imperfect powers of thought leave them liable in many directions to the warping of selfinterest or of small temptations  fairservice blattergowl kettledrummle gifted gilfillan  3 the third order consists of men naturally just and honest but with little sympathy and much pride in whom their religion while in the depth of

all  114 in the present paper i ask the readers patience only with my fulfillment of a promise long since made to mark the opposition of the effects of an entirely similar religious faith in two men of inferior position representing in perfectness the commonest types in scotland of the second and third order of religionists here distinguished andrew fairservice rob roy and richie moniplies nigel  the names of both the men imply deceitfulness of one kind or anotherfairservice as serving fairly only in pretense moniplies as having many windings turns and ways of escape scotts names are themselves so moniplied that they need as much following out as shakespeares and as their roots are pure scotch and few people have a good scottish glossary beside them or would use it if they had the novels are usually read without any turning of the first keys to them i did not myself know till very lately the root of dandie dinmonts namedinmont a twoyearold sheep still less that of moniplies which i had been always content to take master george heriots rendering of this fellow is not illnamedhe has more plies than one in his cloak nigel i 72 in its first sense it is the scotch word for tripe moniplies being a butchers son  115 cunning then they both are in a high degreebut fairservice only for himself moniplies for himself and his friend or in grave business even for his friend first but it is one of scotts first principles of moral law that cunning never shall succeed unless definitely employed against an enemy by a person whose essential character is wholly frank and true as by roland against lady lochleven or mysie happer against dan of the howlethirst but consistent cunning in the character always fails scott allows no ulyssean hero  therefore the cunning of fairservice fails always and totally but that of moniplies precisely according to the degree of its selfishness wholly in the affair of the petitioni am sure i had a the right and a the risk i 73partially in that of the carcanet this he himself at last recognizes with complacency  i think you might have left me says nigel in their parting scene i 286 to act according to my own judgment  mickle better not answered richie mickle better not we are a frail creatures and can judge better for ilk ither than in our own cases and for meeven myselfi have always observed myself to be much more prudential in what i have done in your lordships behalf than even in what i have been able to transact for my own interestwhilk last i have indeed always postponed as in duty i ought  i do believe thou hast answered lord nigel having ever found thee true and faithful  and his final success is entirely owing to his courage and fidelity not to his cunning  to this subtlety both the men join considerable power of penetration into the weaknesses of character but fairservice only sees the surfacefailings and has no respect for any kind of nobleness while richie watches the gradual lowering of his masters character and reputation with earnest sorrow       my lord said richie to be round with you the grace of god is      better than gold pieces and if they were my last words he said      raising his voice i would say you are misled and are forsaking      the paths your honorable father trode in and what is more you are      goingstill under correctionto the devil with a dishclout for      ye are laughed at by them that lead you into these disordered      bypaths i 282  116 in the third place note that the penetration of monipliesthough as aforesaid more into faults than virtuesbeing yet founded on the truth of his own nature is undeceivable no rogue can escape him for an instant and he sees through all the machinations of lord glenvarlochs enemies from the first while fairservice shrewd enough in detecting the follies of good people is quite helpless before knaves and is deceived three times over by his own chosen friendsfirst by the lawyers clerk touthope ii 21 then by the hypocrite macvittie and finally by his true blue presbyterian friend laurie  in these first elements of character the men are thus broadly distinguished but in the next requiring analysis the differences are much more subtle both of them have in nearly equal degree the peculiar love of doing or saying what is provoking by an exact contrariety to the wishes of the person they are dealing with which is a fault inherent in the rough side of uneducated scottish character but in andrew the habit is checked by his selfinterest so that it is only behind his masters back that we hear his opinion of him and only when he has lost his temper that the inherent provocativeness comes outsee the dark ride into scotland  on the contrary moniplies never speaks but in praise of his absent master but exults in mortifying him in direct colloquy yet never indulges this amiable disposition except with a really kind purpose and entirely knowing what he is about fairservice on the other hand gradually falls into an unconscious fatality of varied blunder and provocation and at last causes the entire catastrophe of the story by bringing in the candles when he has been ordered to stay downstairs  117 we have next to remember that with scott truth and courage are one he somewhat overvalued animal courageholding it the basis of all other virtuein his own words without courage there can be no truth and without truth no virtue he would however sometimes allow his villains to possess the basis without the superstructure and thus rashleigh dalgarno balfour varney and other men of that stamp are to be carefully distinguished from his erring heroes marmion bertram christie of the clinthill or nanty ewart in whom loyalty is always the real strength of the character and the faults of life are owing to temporary passion or evil fate scott differs in this standard of heroism materially from byron104 in whose eyes mere courage with strong affections are enough for admiration while bertram and even marmion though loyal to his country are meant only to be pitiednot honored but neither scott nor byron will ever allow any grain of mercy to a coward and the final difference therefore between fairservice and moniplies which decides their fate in scotts hands is that between their courage and cowardice fairservice is driven out at the kitchen door never to be heard of more while richie rises into sir richie of castlecollopthe reader may perhaps at the moment think by too careless grace on the kings part which indeed scott in some measure meantbut the grotesqueness and often evasiveness of richies common manner make us forget how surely his bitter word is backed by his ready blow when need is his first introduction to us i 33 is because his quick temper overcomes his caution       i thought to mysel ye are owre mony for me to mell with but      let me catch ye in barfords park or at the fit of the vennel i      could gar some of ye sing another sang sae ae auld hirpling      deevil of a potter behoved just to step in my way and offer me a      pig as he said just to pit my scotch ointment in and i gave him      a push as but natural and the tottering deevil couped owre amang      his ain pigs and damaged a score of them and then the      reird105 raise  while in the close of the events ii 365 he wins his wife by a piece of handtohand fighting of the value of which his cool and stern estimate in answer to the gay templar is one of the great sentences marking scotts undercurrent of two feelings about war in spite of his love of its heroism  bravo richie cried lowestoffe why man there lies sin struck down like an ox and iniquitys throat cut like a calf  i know not why you should upbraid me with my upbringing master lowestoffe answered richie with great composure but i can tell you the shambles is not a bad place for training one to this work   118 these then being the radical conditions of native character in the two men wholly irrespective of their religious persuasion we have to note what form their presbyterian faith takes in each and what effect it has on their consciences  in richie it has little to do his conscience being in the deep of it frank and clear his religion commands him nothing which he is not at once ready to do or has not habitually done and it forbids him nothing which he is unwilling to forego he pleads no pardon from it for known faults he seeks no evasions in the letter of it for violations of its spirit we are scarcely therefore aware of its vital power in him unless at moments of very grave feeling and its necessary expression       wherefore as the letter will not avail you with him to whom it is      directed you may believe that heaven hath sent it to me who      have a special regard for the writerhave besides as much mercy      and honesty within me as man can weel mak his bread with and am      willing to aid any distressed creature that is my friends      friend  so again in the deep feeling which rebukes his masters careless ruin of the poor apprentice       i say then as i am a true man when i saw that puir creature      come through the ha at that ordinary whilk is accurst heaven      forgive me for swearing of god and man with his teeth set and      his hands clenched and his bonnet drawn over his brows he      stopped a moment and looked fixedly in his masters face  and again in saving the poor lad himself when he takes the street to his last destruction with burning heart and bloodshot eye       why do you stop my way he said fiercely       because it is a bad one master jenkin said richie       nay never start about it man you see you are known      alackaday that an honest mans son should live to start at      hearing himself called by his own name       i pray you in good fashion to let me go said jenkin i am in      the humor to be dangerous to myself or to anyone       i will abide the risk said the scot if you will but come with      me you are the very lad in the world whom i most wish to      meet106       and you answered vincent or any of your beggarly countrymen      are the last sight i should ever wish to see you scots are ever      fair and false       as to our poverty friend replied richie that is as heaven      pleases but touching our falsity ill prove to you that a      scotsman bears as leal and true a heart to his friend as ever beat      in an english doublet  119 in these and other such passages it will be felt that i have done richie some injustice in classing him among the religionists who have little sympathy for all real distress his compassion is instant but his doctrinal religion becomes immediately to him a cause of failure in charity       yon divine has another air from powerful master rollock and mess      david black of north leith and sic like alackaday wha can ken      if it please your lordship whether sic prayers as the southrons      read out of their auld blethering black messbook there may not be      as powerful to invite fiends as a right redhet prayer warm from      the heart may be powerful to drive them away even as the evil      spirit was driven by the smell of the fishs liver from the bridal      chamber of sara the daughter of raguel  the scene in which this speech occurs is one of scotts most finished pieces showing with supreme art how far the weakness of richies superstitious formality is increased by his being at the time partially drunk  it is on the other hand to be noted to his credit for an earnest and searching biblereader that he quotes the apocrypha not so gifted gilfillan       but if your honor wad consider the case of tobit       tobit exclaimed gilfillan with great heat tobit and his dog      baith are altogether heathenish and apocryphal and none but a      prelatist or a papist would draw them into question i doubt i hae      been mistaen in you friend  gilfillan and fairservice are exactly alike and both are distinguished from moniplies in their scornfully exclusive dogmatism which is indeed the distinctive plaguespot of the lower evangelical sect everywhere and the worst blight of the narrow natures capable of its zealous profession in blattergowl on the contrary as his name implies the doctrinal teaching has become mere blather blatter or pattera string of commonplaces spoken habitually in performance of his clerical function but with no personal or sectarian interest in them on his part  he said fine things on the duty o resignation to the will of godthat did he but his own mind is fixed under ordinary circumstances only on the income and privilege of his position scott however indicates this without severity as one of the weaknesses of an established church to the general principle of which as to all other established and monarchic law he is wholly submissive and usually affectionate see the description of colonel mannerings edinburgh sunday so that blattergowl out of the pulpit does not fail in his serious pastoral duty but gives real comfort by his presence and exhortation in the cottage of the mucklebackits  on the other hand to all kinds of independents and nonconformists unless of roderick dhu type scott is adverse with all his powers and accordingly andrew and gilfillan are much more sternly and scornfully drawn than blattergowl  120 in all the three however the reader must not for an instant suspect what is commonly called hypocrisy their religion is no assumed mask or advanced pretense it is in all a confirmed and intimate faith mischievous by its error in proportion to its sincerity compare ariadne florentina paragraph 87 and although by his cowardice petty larceny107 and low cunning fairservice is absolutely separated into a different class of men from monipliesin his fixed religious principle and primary conception of moral conduct he is exactly like him thus when in an agony of terror he speaks for once to his master with entire sincerity one might for a moment think it was a lecture by moniplies to nigel       o maister frank a your uncles follies and your cousins      fliskies were nothing to this drink clean capout like sir      hildebrand begin the blessed morning with brandytaps like squire      percy rin wud among the lasses like squire john gamble like      richard win souls to the pope and the deevil like rashleigh      rive rant break the sabbath and do the popes bidding like      them a put thegitherbut merciful providence tak care o your      young bluid and gang na near rob roy  i said one might for a moment think it was a moniplies lecture to nigel but not for two moments if we indeed can think at all we could not find a passage more concentrated in expression of andrews total character nor more characteristic of scott in the calculated precision and deliberate appliance of every word  121 observe first richies rebuke quoted above fastens nigels mind instantly on the nobleness of his father but andrews to frank fastens as instantly on the follies of his uncle and cousins  secondly the sum of andrews lesson isdo anything that is rascally if only you save your skin but richies is summed in the grace of god is better than gold pieces  thirdly richie takes little note of creeds except when he is drunk but looks to conduct always while andrew clinches his catalogue of wrong with doing the popes bidding and sabbathbreaking these definitions of the unpardonable being the worst absurdity of all scotch wickedness to this houreverything being forgiven to people who go to church on sunday and curse the pope scott never loses sight of this marvelous plaguespot of presbyterian religion and the last words of andrew fairservice are       the villain laurie to betray an auld friend that sang aff the      same psalmbook wi him every sabbath for twenty years  and the tragedy of these last words of his and of his expulsion from his former happy homea jargonelle peartree at one end of the cottage a rivulet and flower plot of a rood in extent in front a kitchen garden behind and a paddock for a cow viii 6 of the 1830 edition can only be understood by the reading of the chapter he quotes on that last sabbath evening he passes in itthe 5th of nehemiah  122 forand i must again and again point out this to the modern reader who living in a world of affectation suspects hypocrisy in every creature he seesthe very plague of this lower evangelical piety is that it is not hypocrisy that andrew and laurie do both expect to get the grace of god by singing psalms on sunday whatever rascality they practice during the week in the modern popular drama of school108 the only religious figure is a dirty and malicious usher who appears first reading herveys meditations and throws away the book as soon as he is out of sight of the company but when andrew is found by frank perched up like a statue by a range of beehives in an attitude of devout contemplation with one eye watching the motions of the little irritable citizens and the other fixed on a book of devotion you will please observe suspicious reader that the devout gardener has no expectation whatever of franks approach nor has he any design upon him nor is he reading or attitudinizing for effect of any kind on any person he is following his own ordinary customs and his book of devotion has been already so well used that much attrition had deprived it of its corners and worn it into an oval shape its attractiveness to andrew being twofoldthe first that it contains doctrine to his mind the second that such sound doctrine is set forth under figures properly belonging to his craft i was een taking a spell o worthy mess john quacklebens flower of a sweet savour sown on the middenstead of this world note in passing scotts easy instant exquisite invention of the name of author and title of book and it is a question of very curious interest how far these sweet spells in quackleben and the like religious exercises of a nature compatible with worldly business compare luckie macleary with eyes employed on bostons crook in the lot while her ideas were engaged in summing up the reckoningwaverley i 112do indeed modify in scotland the national character for the better or the worse or not materially altering do at least solemnize and confirm it in what good it may be capable of my own scottish nurse described in fors clavigera for april 1873 would i doubt not have been as faithful and affectionate without her little library of puritan theology nor were her minor faults so far as i could see abated by its exhortations but i cannot but believe that her uncomplaining endurance of most painful disease and steadiness of temper under not unfrequent misapprehension by those whom she best loved and served were in great degree aided by so much of christian faith and hope as she had succeeded in obtaining with little talk about it  123 i knew however in my earlier days a right old covenanter in my scottish aunts house of whom with mause hedrigg and david deans i may be able perhaps to speak further in my next paper109 but i can only now write carefully of what bears on my immediate work and must ask the readers indulgence for the hasty throwing together of materials intended before my illness last spring to have been far more thoroughly handled the friends who are fearful for my reputation as an écrivain will perhaps kindly recollect that a sentence of modern painters was often written four or five times over in my own hand and tried in every word for perhaps an hourperhaps a

encouragement of virtue in governesses is rewarded by marrying a lord  footnote 109 the present paper was however the lasted     fairy stories110   124 long since longer ago than the opening of some fairy tales i was asked by the publisher who has been rash enough at my request to reprint these my favorite old stories in their earliest english form to set down for him my reasons for preferring them to the more polished legends moral and satiric which are now with rich adornment of every page by very admirable art presented to the acceptance of the nursery  but it seemed to me to matter so little to the majestic independence of the childpublic who beside themselves liked or who disliked what they pronounced entertaining that it is only on strict claims of a promise unwarily given that i venture on the impertinence of eulogy and my reluctance is the greater because there is in fact nothing very notable in these tales unless it be their freedom from faults which for some time have been held to be quite the reverse of faults by the majority of readers  125 in the best stories recently written for the young there is a taint which it is not easy to define but which inevitably follows on the authors addressing himself to children bred in schoolrooms and drawingrooms instead of fields and woodschildren whose favorite amusements are premature imitations of the vanities of elder people and whose conceptions of beauty are dependent partly on costliness of dress the fairies who interfere in the fortunes of these little ones are apt to be resplendent chiefly in millinery and satin slippers and appalling more by their airs than their enchantments  the fine satire which gleaming through every playful word renders some of these recent stories as attractive to the old as to the young seems to me no less to unfit them for their proper function children should laugh but not mock and when they laugh it should not be at the weaknesses and the faults of others they should be taught as far as they are permitted to concern themselves with the characters of those around them to seek faithfully for good not to lie in wait maliciously to make themselves merry with evil they should be too painfully sensitive to wrong to smile at it and too modest to constitute themselves its judges  126 with these minor errors a far graver one is involved as the simplicity of the sense of beauty has been lost in recent tales for children so also the simplicity of their conception of love that word which in the heart of a child should represent the most constant and vital part of its being which ought to be the sign of the most solemn thoughts that inform its awakening soul and in one wide mystery of pure sunrise should flood the zenith of its heaven and gleam on the dew at its feet this word which should be consecrated on its lips together with the name which it may not take in vain and whose meaning should soften and animate every emotion through which the inferior things and the feeble creatures set beneath it in its narrow world are revealed to its curiosity or companionship this word in modern childstory is too often restrained and darkened into the hieroglyph of an evil mystery troubling the sweet peace of youth with premature gleams of uncomprehended passion and flitting shadows of unrecognized sin  these great faults in the spirit of recent childfiction are connected with a parallel folly of purpose parents who are too indolent and selfindulgent to form their childrens characters by wholesome discipline or in their own habits and principles of life are conscious of setting before them no faultless example vainly endeavor to substitute the persuasive influence of moral precept intruded in the guise of amusement for the strength of moral habit compelled by righteous authorityvainly think to inform the heart of infancy with deliberative wisdom while they abdicate the guardianship of its unquestioning innocence and warp into the agonies of an immature philosophy of conscience the once fearless strength of its unsullied and unhesitating virtue  127 a child should not need to choose between right and wrong it should not be capable of wrong it should not conceive of wrong obedient as bark to helm not by sudden strain or effort but in the freedom of its bright course of constant life true with an undistinguished praiseless unboastful truth in a crystalline household world of truth gentle through daily entreatings of gentleness and honorable trusts and pretty prides of childfellowship in offices of good strong not in bitter and doubtful contest with temptation but in peace of heart and armor of habitual right from which temptation falls like thawing hail selfcommanding not in sick restraint of mean appetites and covetous thoughts but in vital joy of unluxurious life and contentment in narrow possession wisely esteemed  children so trained have no need of moral fairy tales but they will find in the apparently vain and fitful courses of any tradition of old time honestly delivered to them a teaching for which no other can be substituted and of which the power cannot be measured animating for them the material world with inextinguishable life fortifying them against the glacial cold of selfish science and preparing them submissively and with no bitterness of astonishment to behold in later years the mysterydivinely appointed to remain such to all human thoughtof the fates that happen alike to the evil and the good  128 and the effect of the endeavor to make stories moral upon the literary merit of the work itself is as harmful as the motive of the effort is false for every fairy tale worth recording at all is the remnant of a tradition possessing true historical valuehistorical at least in so far as it has naturally arisen out of the mind of a people under special circumstances and risen not without meaning nor removed altogether from their sphere of religious faith it sustains afterwards natural changes from the sincere action of the fear or fancy of successive generations it takes new color from their manner of life and new form from their changing moral tempers as long as these changes are natural and effortless accidental and inevitable the story remains essentially true altering its form indeed like a flying cloud but remaining a sign of the sky a shadowy image as truly a part of the great firmament of the human mind as the light of reason which it seems to interrupt but the fair deceit and innocent error of it cannot be interpreted nor restrained by a willful purpose and all additions to it by act do but defile as the shepherd disturbs the flakes of morning mist with smoke from his fire of dead leaves  129 there is also a deeper collateral mischief in this indulgence of licentious change and retouching of stories to suit particular tastes or inculcate favorite doctrines it directly destroys the childs power of rendering any such belief as it would otherwise have been in his nature to give to an imaginative vision how far it is expedient to occupy his mind with ideal forms at all may be questionable to many though not to me but it is quite beyond question that if we do allow of the fictitious representation that representation should be calm and complete possessed to the full and read down its utmost depth the little readers attention should never be confused or disturbed whether he is possessing himself of fairy tale or history let him know his fairy tale accurately and have perfect joy or awe in the conception of it as if it were real thus he will always be exercising his power of grasping realities but a confused careless or discrediting tenure of the fiction will lead to as confused and careless reading of fact let the circumstances of both be strictly perceived and long dwelt upon and let the childs own mind develop fruit of thought from both it is of the greatest importance early to secure this habit of contemplation and therefore it is a grave error either to multiply unnecessarily or to illustrate with extravagant richness the incidents presented to the imagination it should multiply and illustrate them for itself and if the intellect is of any real value there will be a mystery and wonderfulness in its own dreams which would only be thwarted by external illustration yet i do not bring forward the text or the etchings in this volume as examples of what either ought to be in works of the kind they are in many respects common imperfect vulgar but their vulgarity is of a wholesome and harmless kind it is not for instance graceful english to say that a thought popped into catherines head but it nevertheless is far better as an initiation into literary style that a child should be told this than that a subject attracted catherines attention and in genuine forms of minor tradition a rude and more or less illiterate tone will always be discernible for all the best fairy tales have owed their birth and the greater part of their power to narrowness of social circumstances they belonged properly to districts in which walled cities are surrounded by bright and unblemished country and in which a healthy and bustling town life not highly refined is relieved by and contrasted with the calm enchantment of pastoral and woodland scenery either under humble cultivation by peasant masters or left in its natural solitude under conditions of this kind the imagination is enough excited to invent instinctively and rejoice in the invention of spiritual forms of wildness and beauty while yet it is restrained and made cheerful by the familiar accidents and relations of town life mingling always in its fancy humorous and vulgar circumstances with pathetic ones and never so much impressed with its supernatural fantasies as to be in danger of retaining them as any part of its religious faith the good spirit descends gradually from an angel into a fairy and the demon shrinks into a playful grotesque of diminutive malevolence while yet both keep an accredited and vital influence upon the character and mind but the language in which such ideas will be usually clothed must necessarily partake of their narrowness and art is systematically incognizant of them having only strength under the conditions which awake them to express itself in an irregular and gross grotesque fit only for external architectural decoration  130 the illustrations of this volume are almost the only exceptions i know to the general rule they are of quite sterling and admirable art in a class precisely parallel in elevation to the character of the tales which they illustrate and the original etchings as i have before said in the appendix to my elements of drawing were quite unrivaled in masterfulness of touch since rembrandt in some qualities of delineation unrivaled even by him these copies have been so carefully executed that at first i was deceived by them and supposed them to be late impressions from the plates and what is more i believe the master himself was deceived by them and supposed them to be his own and although on careful comparison with the first proofs they will be found no exception to the terrible law that literal repetition of entirely fine work shall be even to the hand that produced itmuch more to any otherforever impossible they still represent with sufficient fidelity to be in the highest degree instructive the harmonious light and shade the manly simplicity of execution and the easy unincumbered fancy of designs which belonged to the best period of cruikshanks genius to make somewhat enlarged copies of them looking at them through a magnifying glass and never putting two lines where cruikshank has put only one would be an exercise in decision and severe drawing which would leave afterwards little to be learnt in schools i would gladly also say much in their praise as imaginative designs but the power of genuine imaginative work and its difference from that which is compounded and patched together from borrowed sources is of all qualities of art the most difficult to explain and i must be content with the simple assertions of it  and so i trust the good old book and the honest work that adorns it to such favor as they may find with children of open hearts and lowly lives    denmark hill easter 1868   footnotes  footnote

authors will perceive upon reflection to have involved errors only the more grave in that they have become of late in the minds of nearly all public men facile and familiar i have therefore requested the editors permission to offer some reply to both of these essays their subjects being intimately connected  the first of which i speak was mr herbert spencers which appeared under the title of the bias of patriotism but the real subject of the paper discussed in its special extent with singular care and equity was only the bias of national vanity and the debate was opened by this very curious sentencepatriotism is nationally that which egoism is individually  mr spencer would not i think himself accept this statement if put into the clear form what is egoism in one man is patriotism in two or more and the vice of an individual the virtue of a multitude113 but it is strangehowever strictly mr spencer may of late have confined his attention to metaphysical or scientific subjects disregarding the language of historical or imaginative literatureit is strange i repeat that so careful a student should be unaware that the term patriotism cannot in classical usage be extended to the action of a multitude no writer of authority ever speaks of a nation as having felt or acted patriotically patriotism is by definition a virtue of individuals and so far from being in those individuals a mode of egoism it is precisely in the sacrifice of their egoism that it consists it is the temper of mind which determines them to defer their own interests to those of their country  132 supposing it possible for any parallel sentiment to animate a nation as one body it could have reference only to the position it held among other families of the world the name of the emotion would then be properly cosmism and would signify the resolution of such a people to sacrifice its own special interests to those of mankind cosmism hitherto has indeed generally asserted itself only in the desire of the cosmic nation that all others should adopt its theological opinions and permit it to adopt their personal property but patriotism has truly existed and even as a dominant feeling in the minds of many persons who have been greatly influential on the fates of their races and that one of our leading philosophers should be unconscious of the nature of this sentiment and ignorant of its political power is to be noted as painfully characteristic of the present state of england itself  it does not indeed follow that a feeling of which we are unaware is necessarily extinguished in us and the faculties of perception and analysis are always so paralyzed by the lingual ingenuities of logic that it is impossible to say of any professed logician whether he may not yet be acting under the real force of ideas of which he has lost both the consciousness and conception no man who has once entangled himself in what mr spencer defines farther on as the science of the relations implied by the conclusions exclusions and overlappings of classes can be expected during the rest of his life to perceive more of any one thing than that it is included excluded or overlapped by something else which is in itself a sufficiently confused state of mind and especially harmful in that it permits us to avoid considering whether our intellectual linen is itself clean while we concern ourselves only to ascertain whether it is included excluded or overlapped by our coat collar but it is a grave phenomenon of the time that patriotismof all othersshould be the sentiment which an english logician is not only unable to define but attempts to define as its precise contrary in every epoch of decline men even of high intellectual energy have been swept down in the diluvium of public life and the crystalline edges of their minds worn away by friction with blunted ones but i had not believed that the whole weight of the depraved mob of modern england though they have become incapable alike of fidelity to their own country and alliance with any other could so far have perplexed one of our exactest students as to make him confuse heroism with conceit and the loves of country and of home with the iniquities of selfishness can it be only a quarter of a century since the last minstrel diedand have we already answered his lives there a man with the calm assertion that there live no other than such and that the wretch concentered all in self is the patriot of our generation  133 be it so let it even be admitted that egoism is the only power conceivable by a modern metaphysician to be the spring of mental energy just as chemical excitement may be the only power traceable by the modern physician as the source of muscular energy and still mr spencers subsequent analysis is inaccurate and unscholarly for egoism does not necessarily imply either misapprehension or mismeasurement there are modes of the love of our country which are definitely selfish as a cats of the hearthrug yet entirely balanced and calm in judicial faculty passions which determine conduct but have no influence on opinion for instance i have bought for my own exclusive gratification the cottage in which i am writing near the lakebeach on which i used to play when i was seven years old were i a publicspirited scientific person or a benevolently pious one i should doubtless instead be surveying the geographical relations of the mountains of the moon or translating the athanasian creed into tartarchinese but i hate the very name of the public and labor under no oppressive anxiety either for the advancement of science or the salvation of mankind i therefore prefer amusing myself with the lakepebbles of which i know nothing but that they are pretty and conversing with people whom i can understand without pains and who so far from needing to be converted seem to me on the whole better than myself this is moral egoism but it is not intellectual error i never form much less express any opinion as to the relative beauties of yewdale crag and the mountains of the moon nor do i please myself by contemplating in any exaggerated light the spiritual advantages which i possess in my familiarity with the thirtynine articles i know the height of my neighboring mountains to a foot and the extent of my real possessions theological and material to an article patriotic egoism attaches me to the one personal egoism satisfies me in the other and the calm selfishness with which nature has blessed all her unphilosophical creatures blinds me to the attractionsas to the faultsof things with which i have no concern and saves me at once from the folly of contempt and the discomfort of envy i might have written as accurately the discomfort of contempt for indeed the forms of petulant rivalry and selfassertion which mr spencer assumes to be developments of egoism are merely its diseases taking the word disease in its most literal meaning a man of sense is more an egoist in modesty than a blockhead is in boasting and it is neither pride nor selfrespect but only ignorance and illbreeding that either disguise the facts of life or violate its courtesies  134 it will not i trust be thought violation of courtesy to a writer of mr spencers extending influence if i urge on his attention the danger under which metaphysicians are always placed of supposing that the investigation of the processes of thought will enable them to distinguish its forms as well might the chemist who had exhaustively examined the conditions of vitreous fusion imagine himself therefore qualified to number or class the vases bent by the breath of venice mr spencer has determined i believe to the satisfaction of his readers in what manner thoughts and feelings are constructed it is time for him now to observe the results of the construction whether native to his own mind or discoverable in other intellectual territories patriotism is however perhaps the last emotion he can now conveniently study in england for the temper which crowns the joy of life with the sweetness and decorum of death can scarcely be manifested clearly in a country which is fast rendering herself one whose peace is pollution and whose battle crime within whose confines it is loathsome to live and in whose cause it is disgraceful to die  135 the chief causes of her degradation were defended with delicate apology in the second paper to which i have above referred the modification by mr w r greg of a letter which he had addressed on the subject of luxurious expenditure and its economical results to the pall mall gazette and which mr greg states to have given rise in that journal to a controversy in which four or five combatants took part the looseness of whose notions induced him to express his own more coherent ones in the contemporary review114  i am sorry to find that mr greg looked upon my own poor part in that correspondence as controversial i merely asked him a question which he declared to be insidious and irrelevant not considering that if it were the one it could not be the other and i stated a few facts respecting which no controversy was possible and which mr greg in his own terms sedulously abstained from noticing  but mr greg felt my question to be insidious because it made him partly conscious that he had only examined one half of the subject he was discussing and even that half without precision  mr goldwin smith had spoken of a rich man as consuming the means of living of the poor mr greg in reply pointed out how beneficially the rich man spent what he had got upon which i ventured to inquire how he got it which is indeed precisely the first of all questions to be asked when the economical relations of any man with his neighbor are to be examined  dick turpin is blamedsupposeby some plainminded person for consuming the means of other peoples living nay says dick to the plainminded person observe how beneficently and pleasantly i spend whatever i get  yes dick persists the plainminded person but how do you get it  the question says dick is insidious and irrelevant  do not let it be supposed that i mean to assert any irregularity or impropriety in dicks professioni merely assert the necessity for mr gregs examination if he would be master of his subject of the manner of gain in every case as well as the manner of expenditure such accounts must always be accurately rendered in a wellregulated society       136 le lieutenant adressa la parole au capitaine et lui dit      quil venait denlever ces mannequins remplis de sucre de      cannelle damandes et de raisins sees à un épicier de bénavente      après quil eut rendu compte de son expédition au bureau les      dépouilles de lépicier furent portées dans loffice alors il ne      fut plus question que de se réjouir je débutai par le buffet que      je parai de plusieurs bouteilles de ce bon vin que le seigneur      rolando mavoit vanté  mr greg strictly confines himself to an examination of the benefits conferred on the public by this so agreeable festivity but he must not be surprised or indignant that some inquiry should be made as to the resulting condition of the épicier de bénavente  and it is all the more necessary that such inquiry be instituted when the captain of the expedition is a minion not of the moon but of the sun and dazzling therefore to all beholders it is heaven which dictates what i ought to do upon this occasion115 says henry of navarre my retreat out of this city116 before i have made myself master of it will be the retreat of my soul out of my body accordingly all the quarter which still held out we forced says m de rosny after which the inhabitants finding themselves no longer able to resist laid down their arms and the city was given up to plunder my good fortune threw a small iron chest in my way in which i found about four thousand gold crowns  i cannot doubt that the barons expenditure of this sum would be in the highest degree advantageous to france and to the protestant religion but complete economical science must study the effect of its abstraction on the immediate prosperity of the town of cahors and even beyond thisthe mode of its former acquisition by the town itself which perhaps in the economies of the nether world may have delegated some of its citizens to the seventh circle117  137 and the most curious points in the partiality of modern economical science are that while it always waives this question of ways and means with respect to rich persons it studiously pushes it in the case of poor ones and while it asserts the consumption of such an article of luxury as wine to take that which mr greg himself instances to be economically expedient when the wine is drunk by persons who are not thirsty it asserts the same consumption to be altogether inexpedient when the privilege is extended to those who are thus mr greg dismisses in one place with compassionate disdain the extremely vulgar notion that a man who drinks a bottle of champagne worth five shillings while his neighbor is in want of actual food is in some way wronging his neighbor and yet mr greg himself elsewhere118 evidently remains under the equally vulgar impression that the twentyfour millions of such thirstier persons who spend fifteen per cent of their incomes in drink and tobacco are wronging their neighbors by that expenditure  138 it cannot surely be the difference in degree of refinement between malt liquor and champagne which causes mr gregs undefined sensation of moral delinquency and economical error in the one case and of none in the other if that be all i can relieve him from his embarrassment by putting the cases in more parallel form a clergyman writes to me in distress of mind because the ablebodied laborers who come begging to him in winter drink port wine out of buckets in summer of course mr gregs logical mind will at once admit as a consequence of his own very just argumentum ad hominem in a previous page119 that the consumption of port wine out of buckets must be as much a benefit to society in general as the consumption of champagne out of bottles and yet curiously enough i am certain he will feel my question where does the drinker get the means for his drinking more relevant in the case of the imbibers of port than in that of the imbibers of champagne and although mr greg proceeds with that lofty contempt for the dictates of nature and christianity which radical economists cannot but feel to observe that while the natural man and the christian would have the champagne drinker forego his bottle and give the value of it to the famishing wretch beside him the radical economist would condemn such behavior as distinctly criminal and pernicious he would scarcely i think carry out with the same triumphant confidence the conclusions of the unnatural man and the antichristian with respect to the laborer as well as the idler and declare that while the extremely simple persons who still believe in the laws of nature and the mercy of god would have the portdrinker forego his bucket and give the value of it to the famishing wife and child beside him the radical economist would condemn such behavior as distinctly criminal and pernicious  mr greg has it indeed in his power to reply that it is proper to economize for the sake of ones own wife and children but not for the sake of anybody elses but since according to another exponent of the principles of radical economy in the cornhill magazine120 a wellconducted agricultural laborer must not marry till he is fortyfive his economies if any in early life must be as offensive to mr greg on the score of their abstract humanity as those of the richest bachelor about town  139 there is another short sentence in this same page of which it is difficult to overrate the accidental significance  the superficial observer says mr greg recollects a text which he heard in his youth but of which he never considered the precise applicabilityhe that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none  the assumptions that no educated englishman can ever have heard that text except in his youth and that those who are old enough to remember having heard it never considered its precise applicability are surely rash in the treatment of a scientific subject i can assure mr greg that a few grayheaded votaries of the creed of christendom still readthough perhaps under their breaththe words which early associations have made precious to them and that in the bygone days when that sermon on the mount was still listened to with respect by many not illiterate persons its meaning was not only considered but very deliberately acted upon even the readers of the contemporary review may perhaps have some pleasure in retreating from the sunshine of contemporary science for a few quiet moments into the shadows of that of the past and hearing in the following extracts from two letters of scotts the first describing the manner of life of his mother whose death it announces to a friend the second anticipating the verdict of the future on the management of his estate by a scottish nobleman what relations between rich and poor were possible when philosophers had not yet even lisped in the sweet numbers of radical sociology                                       140 she was a strict economist which she said enabled her to be liberal out of her little income of about £300 a year she bestowed at least a third in wellchosen charities and with the rest lived like a gentlewoman and even with hospitality more general than seemed to suit her age yet i could never prevail on her to accept of any assistance you cannot conceive how affecting it was to me to see the little preparations of presents which she had assorted for the new year for she was a great observer of the old fashions of her periodand to think that the kind heart was cold which delighted in all these arts of kindly affection  141 the duke is one of those retired and highspirited men who will never be known until the world asks what became of the huge oak that grew on the brow of the hill and sheltered such an extent of ground during the late distress though his own immense rents remained in arrears and though i know he was pinched for money as all men were but more especially the possessors of entailed estates he absented himself from london in order to pay with ease to himself the laborers employed on his various estates these amounted for i have often seen the roll and helped to check it to nine hundred and fifty men working at day wages each of whom on a moderate average might maintain three persons since the single men have mothers sisters and aged or very young relations to protect and assist indeed it is wonderful how much even a small sum comparatively will do in supporting the scottish laborer who in his natural state is perhaps one of the best most intelligent and kindhearted of human beings and in truth i have limited my other habits of expense very much since i fell into the habit of employing mine honest people i wish you could have seen about a hundred children being almost entirely supported by their fathers or brothers labor come down yesterday to dance to the pipes and get a piece of cake and bannock and pence apiece no very deadly largess in honor of hogmanay i declare to you my dear friend that when i thought the poor fellows who kept these children so neat and well taught and well behaved were slaving the whole day for eighteen pence or twenty pence at most i was ashamed of their gratitude and of their becks and bows but after all one does what one can and it is better twenty families should be comfortable according to their wishes and habits than that half that number should be raised above their situation                                       142 i must pray mr greg farther to observe if he has condescended to glance at these remains of almost prehistoric thought that although the modern philosopher will never have reason to blush for any mans gratitude and has totally abandoned the romantic idea of making even so much as one family comfortable according to their wishes and habits the alternative suggested by scott that half the number should be raised above their situation may become a very inconvenient one if the doctrines of modern equality and competition should render the other half desirous of parallel promotion  143 it is now just sixteen years since mr gregs present philosophy of expenditure was expressed with great precision by the common councilmen of new york in their report on the commercial crisis of 1857 in the following terms121       another erroneous idea is that luxurious living extravagant      dressing splendid turnouts and fine houses are the cause of      distress to a nation no more erroneous impression could exist      every extravagance that the man of 100000 or 1000000 dollars      indulges in adds to the means the support the wealth of ten or a      hundred who had little or nothing else but their labor their      intellect or their taste if a man of 1000000 dollars spends      principal and interest in ten years and finds himself beggared at      the end of that time he has actually made a hundred who have      catered to his extravagance employers or employed so much richer      by the division of his wealth he may be ruined but the nation is      better off and richer for one hundred minds and hands with 10000      dollars apiece are far more productive than one with the whole  now that is precisely the view also taken of the matter by a large number of radical economists in england as well as america only they feel that the time however short which the rich gentleman takes to divide his property among them in his own way is practically wasted and even worse because the methods which the gentleman himself is likely to adopt for the depression of his fortune will not in all probability be conducive to the elevation of his character it appears therefore on moral as well as economical grounds desirable that the division and distribution should at once be summarily effected and the only point still open to discussion in the views of the common councilmen is to what degree of minuteness they would think it advisable to carry the subsequent subdivision  144 i do not suppose however that this is the conclusion which mr greg is desirous that the general antichristian public should adopt and in that case as i see by his paper in the last number of the contemporary122 that he considers the christian life itself virtually impossible may i recommend his examination of the manners of the prechristian for i can certify him that this important subject of which he has only himself imperfectly investigated one side had been thoroughly investigated on all sides at least seven hundred years before christ and from that day to this all men of wit sense and feeling have held precisely the same views on the subjects of economy and charity in all nations under the sun it is of no consequence whether mr greg chooses the experience of boeotia lombardy or yorkshire nor whether he studies the relation of work today or under hesiod virgil or sydney smith but it is desirable that at least he should acquaint himself with the opinions of some such persons as well as with those of the common councilmen of new york for though a man of superior sagacity may be pardoned for thinking with the friends of job that wisdom will die with him it can only be through neglect of the existing opportunities of general culture that he remains distinctly under the impression that she was born with him  145 it may perhaps be well that in conclusion i should state briefly the causes and terms of the economical crisis of our own day which has been the subject of the debate between mr goldwin smith and mr greg  no man ever became or can become largely rich merely by labor and economy123 all large fortunes putting treasuretrove and gambling out of consideration are founded either on occupation of land usury or taxation of labor whether openly or occultly the landlord moneylender and capitalist employer gather into their possession a certain quantity of the means of existence which other people produce by the labor of their hands the effect of this impost upon the condition of life of the tenant borrower and workman is the first point to be studiedthe results that is to say of the mode in which captain roland fills his purse  secondly we have to study the effects of the mode in which captain roland empties his purse the landlord usurer or labormaster does not and cannot himself consume all the means of life he collects he gives them to other persons whom he employs for his own behoofgrowers of champagne jockeys footmen jewelers builders painters musicians and the like the division of the labor of these persons from the production of food to the production of articles of luxury is very frequently and at the present day very grievously the cause of famine but when the luxuries are produced it becomes a quite separate question who is to have them and whether the landlord and capitalist are entirely to monopolize the music the painting the architecture the handservice the horseservice and the sparkling champagne of the world  146 and it is gradually in these days becoming manifest to the tenants borrowers and laborers that instead of paying these large sums into the hands of the landlords lenders and employers for them to purchase music painting etc with the tenants borrowers and workers had better buy a little music and painting for themselves that for instance instead of the capitalistemployer paying three hundred pounds for a fulllength portrait of himself in the attitude of investing his capital the united workmen had better themselves pay the three hundred pounds into the hands of the ingenious artist for a painting in the antiquated manner of leonardo or raphael of some subject more religiously or historically interesting to them and placed where they can always see it and again instead of paying three hundred pounds to the obliging landlord for him to buy a box at the opera with whence to study the refinements of music and dancing the tenants are beginning to think that they may as well keep their rents to themselves and therewith pay some wandering willie to fiddle at their own doors or bid some grayhaired minstrel    tune to please a peasants ear   the harp a king had loved to hear  and similarly the dwellers in the hut of the field and garret of the city are beginning to think that instead of paying half a crown for the loan of half a fireplace they had better keep their halfcrown in their pockets till they can buy for themselves a whole one  147 these are the views which are gaining ground among the poor and it is entirely vain to endeavor to repress them by equivocations they are founded on eternal laws and although their recognition will long be refused and their promulgation resisted as it will be partly by force partly by falsehood can only be through incalculable confusion and misery recognized they must be eventually and with these three ultimate resultsthat the usurers trade will be abolished utterlythat the employer will be paid justly for his superintendence of labor but not for his capital and the landlord paid for his superintendence of the cultivation of land when he is able to direct it wisely that both he and the employer of mechanical labor will be recognized as beloved masters if they deserve love and as noble guides when they are capable of giving discreet guidance but neither will be permitted to establish themselves any more as senseless conduits through which the strength and riches of their native land are to be poured into the cup of the fornication of its capital   footnotes  footnote 111 contemporary review may 1873  footnote 112

circumstances by which the letter has been called forth and such imperfect reply as it is in my power without delay to render    j ruskin    manchester december 8 1879  dear sirin a letter from yourself to the rev f a malleson125 published in the contemporary review of the current month i observe the following passagei have never yet heard so much as one preacher heartily proclaiming against all those deceivers with vain words that no covetous person which is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god and on myself personally and publicly challenging the bishops of england generally and by name the bishop of manchester to say whether usury was or was not according to the will of god i have received no answer from any one of them i confess for myself that until i saw this passage in print a few days ago i was unaware of the existence of such challenge and therefore i could not answer it it appears to have been delivered a in no 82 of a series of letters which under the title of fors clavigera you have for some time been addressing to the working classes of england but which from the peculiar mode of their publication are not easily accessible to the general reader and which i have only caught a glimpse of on the librarytable of the athenæum club on the rare occasions when i am able to use my privileges as a member of that society i have no idea why i had the honor of being specially mentioned by name b but i beg to assure you that my silence did not arise from any discourtesy towards my challenger nor from that discretion which some people may think is usually the better part of episcopal valor and which consists in ignoring inconvenient questions from a sense of inability to answer them but simply from the fact that i was not conscious that your lance had touched my shield  149 the question you have asked is just one of those to which aristotles wise caution applies we must distinguish and define such words if we would know how far and in what sense the opposite views are true eth nic ix c viii § 3 what do you mean by usury c do you comprehend under it any payment of money as interest for the use of borrowed capital or only exorbitant inequitable grinding interest such as the moneylender fufidius extorted    quinas hic capiti mercedes exsecat atque   quanto perditior quisque est tanto acrius urget   nomina

its primary meaning neither praise nor blame and a usurer is defined in our dictionaries as a person accustomed to lend money and take interest for itwhich is the ordinary function of a banker without whose help great commercial undertakings could not be carried out though it is obvious how easily the word may pass into a term of reproach so that to have been called a usurer was one of the bitter memories that rankled most in shylocks catalogue of his wrongs  150 i do not believe that anything has done more harm to the practical efficacy of religions sanctions than the extravagant attempts that are frequently made to impose them in cases which they never originally contemplated or to read into ordinances evidently imposed for a timegreek dikaiômata mechri kairou heb ix 10a law of eternal and immutable obligation just as we are told d not to expect to find in the bible a scheme of physical science so i do not expect to find there a scheme of political economy what i do expect to find in relation to my duty to my neighbor are those unalterable principles of equity fairness truthfulness honesty e which are the indispensable bases of civil society i am sure i have no need to remind you that while a jew was forbidden by his law to take usuryie interest for the loan of moneyfrom his brother if he were waxen poor and fallen into decay with him and this generous provision was extended even to strangers and sojourners in the land lev xxv 3538 and the interesting story in nehemiah v 113 tells us how this principle was recognized in the latest days of the commonwealthstill in that old law there is no denunciation of usury in general and it was expressly permitted in the case of ordinary strangers126 deut xxiii 20  it seems to me plain also that our blessed lords precept about lending hoping for nothing again luke vi 35 has the same or a similar class of circumstances in view and was intended simply to govern a christian mans conduct to the poor and needy and such as have no helper and cannot without a violent twist f be construed into a general law determining forever and in all cases the legitimate use of capital indeed on another occasion and in a very memorable parable the great founder of christianity recognizes and impliedly sanctions the practice of lending money at interest thou oughtest says the master addressing his unprofitable servant thou oughtestgreek edei seto have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury  151 st paul no doubt denounces the covetous g but who is the greek pleonektês not the man who may happen to have money out on loan at a fair rate of interest but as liddell and scott give the meaning of the word one who has or claims more than his share hence greedy grasping selfish of such men whose affections are wholly set on things of the earth and who are not very scrupulous how they gratify them it may perhaps not improperly be said h that they have no inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god but here again it would be a manifest wresting of the words to make them apply to a case which we have no proof that the apostle had in contemplation when he uttered them rapacity greed of gain harsh and oppressive dealing taking unfair advantage of our own superior knowledge and anothers ignorance shutting up the bowels of compassion towards a brother who we see has needall these and the like things are forbidden by the very spirit of christianity and are manifestly not according to the will of god for they are all of them forms of injustice or wrong but money may be lent at interest without one of these bad passions being brought in to play and in these cases i confess my inability to see where either in terms or in spirit such use of money is condemned either by the christian code of charity or by that natural law of conscience which we are told i is written on the hearts of men  152 let me take two or three simple instances by way of illustration the following has happened to myself all my life throughfrom the time when my income was not a tenth part of what it is nowi have felt it a duty while endeavoring to discharge all proper claims to live within that income so to adjust my expenditure to it that there should be a margin on the right side this margin of course accumulated and reached in time say £1000 just then say the london and northwestern railway company proposed to issue debenture stock bearing four per cent interest for the purpose of extending the communications and so increasing the wealth of the country whom in the world am i injuringwhat conceivable wrong am i doingwhere or how am i thwarting the will of godif i let the company have my £1000 and have been receiving from them £40 a year for the use of it ever since unless the money had been forthcoming from some quarter or other a work which was absolutely necessary for the prosperity of the nation and which finds remunerative employment k for an immense number of englishmen enabling them to bring up their families in respectability and comfort would never have been accomplished will you tell me that this method of carrying out great commercial enterprises sanctioned by experience l as the most if not the only practicable one is not according to the will of god  153 take another instance in lancashire a large number of cotton mills have been erected on the jointstock principle with limited liability the thing has been pushed too far probably and at one time there was a good deal of unwholesome speculation in floating companies but that is not the question before us and the enterprises gave working men an opportunity of investing their savings which was a great stimulus to thrift and so far an advantage to the country in a mill which it would perhaps cost £50000 to build and fit with machinery the subscribed capital which would be entitled to a division of profits after all other demands had been satisfied would not amount probably to more than £20000 the rest would be borrowed at rates of interest varying according to the conditions of the market you surely would not maintain that those who lent their money for such a purpose and were content with 5 or 6 per cent for the use of it thus enabling in good times the shareholders to realize 20 or 25 per cent on their subscribed capital were doing wrong either to the shareholders or anyone else or could in any sense be charged with acting not according to the will of god  154 take yet one case more a farmer asks his landlord to drain his land gladly says his squire if you will pay me five per cent on the outlay in other words if you will let me share the increased profits to this extent the bargain is agreeable to both sides the productiveness of the land is largely increased who is wronged surely such a transaction could not fairly be described as not according to the will of god surely unless the commerce and productive industries of the country are to be destroyed and with the destruction its population is to be reduced to what it was in the days of elizabeth these and similar transactionswhich can be kept entirely clear of the sin of covetousness and rest upon the wellunderstood basis of mutual advantage each and all being gainers by themare not only legitimate but inevitable m and now that i have taken up your challenge and so far as my ability goes answered it may i without staying to inquire how far your charge against the clergy can be substantiated that they generally patronize and encourage all the iniquity of the world by steadily preaching away the penalties of it n be at least allowed to demur to your wholesale denunciation of the great cities of the earth which you say have become loathsome centers of fornication and covetousness the smoke of their sin going up into the face of heaven like the furnace of sodom and the pollution of it rotting and raging through the bones and souls of the peasant people round them as if they were each a volcano whose ashes brake out in blains upon man and beast127 surely sir your righteous indignation at evil has caused you to overcharge your language no one can have lived in a great city as i have for the last ten years without being aware of its sins and its pollutions but unless you can prevent the aggregation of human beings into great cities these are evils which must necessarily exist at any rate which always have existed the great cities of today are not worse than great cities always have been o in one capital respect i believe they are better there is an increasing number of their citizens who are aware of these evils and who are trying their best with the help of god to remedy them in sodom there was but one righteous man who vexed his soul at the unlawful deeds that he witnessed day by day on every side and he apparently did no more than vex his soul in manchester the men and women of all ranks and persuasions who are actively engaging in some christian or philanthropic work to battle against these gigantic evils are to be reckoned by hundreds nowhere have i seen more conspicuous instances of christian effort and of singlehearted devotion to the highest interests of mankind and though no doubt if these efforts were better organized more might be achieved and elements which one could wish absent sometimes mingle with and mar the work still a great city even with the smoke of its sin going up into the face of heaven is the noblest field of the noblest virtues because it gives the amplest scope for the most varied exercise of them  if you will teach us clergy how better to discharge our office as ministers of a kingdom of truth and righteousness we shall all owe you a deep debt of gratitude which no one will be more forward to acknowledge than my dear sir yours faithfully and with much respect    j manchester    john ruskin esq  155 the foregoing letter to which i would fain have given my undivided and unwearied attention reached my hands as will be seen by its date only in the close of the year when my general correspondence always far overpasses my powers of dealing with it and my strengthsuch as now is left mehad been spent nearly to lowest ebb in totally unexpected business arising out of the threatened mischief at venice but i am content that such fragmentary reply as under this pressure has been possible to me should close the debate as far as i am myself concerned the question at issue is not one of private interpretation and the interests concerned are too vast to allow its decision to be long delayed  the bishop will i trust not attribute to disrespect the mode of reply in the form of notes attached to special passages indicated by inserted letters which was adopted in fors clavigera in all cases of important correspondence as more clearly defining the several points under debate  156 a the challenge appears to have been delivered may i respectfully express my regret that your lordship should not have read the letter you have honored me by answering the number of fors referred to does not deliverit only reiteratesthe challenge given in the fors for january 1st 1875 with reference to the prayer have mercy upon all jews turks infidels and heretics and so fetch them home blessed lord to thy flock that they may be saved among the remnant of the true israelites in these following terms who are the true israelites my lord of manchester on your exchange do they stretch their cloth like other peoplehave they any underhand dealings with the liabletobedamned false israelitesrothschilds and the like or are they duly solicitous about those wanderers souls and how often on the average do your manchester clergy preach from the delicious parable savoriest of all scripture to rogues at least since the eleventh century when i find it to have been specially headed with golden title in my best greek ms of the pharisee and publicanand how often on the average from those objectionable first and fifteenth psalms  b i have no idea why i had the honor of being specially mentioned by name by diocese my lord not name please observe and for this very simple reason that i have already fairly accurate knowledge of the divinity of the old schools of canterbury york and oxford but i looked to your lordship as the authoritative exponent of the more advanced divinity of the school of manchester with which i am not yet familiar  157 c what do you mean by usury what i mean by that word my lord is surely of no consequence to anyone but my few readers and fewer disciples what david and his son meant by it i have prayed your lordship to tell your flock in the name of the church which dictates daily to them the songs of the one and professes to interpret to them the commands of the other  and although i can easily conceive that a bishop at the court of the third richard might have paused in reply to a too curious laymans question of what was meant by murder and can also conceive a bishop at the court of the second charles hesitating as to the significance of the word adultery and farther in the present climacteric of the british constitution an elder of the church of glasgow debating within himself whether the commandment which was severely prohibitory of theft might not be mildly permissive of misappropriationat no time nor under any conditions can i conceive any question existing as to the meaning of the words greek tokos foenus usura or usury and i trust that your lordship will at once acquit me of wishing to attach any other significance to the word than that which it was to the full intended to convey on every occasion of its use by moses by david by christ and by the doctors of the christian church down to the seventeenth century  nor even since that date although the commercial phrase interest has been adopted in order to distinguish an open and unoppressive rate of usury from a surreptitious and tyrannical one has the debate of lawfulness or unlawfulness ever turned seriously on that distinction it is neither justified by its defenders only in its mildness nor condemned by its accusers only in its severity usury in any degree is asserted by the doctors of the early church to be sinful just as theft and adultery are asserted to be sinful though neither may have been accompanied with violence and although the theft may have been on the most splendid scale and the fornication of the most courtly refinement  so also in modern days though the voice of the bank of england in parliament declares a loan without interest to be a monster128 and a loan made below the current rate of interest a monster in its degree the increase of dividends above that current rate is not as far as i am aware shunned by shareholders with an equally religious horror  158 butthis strange question being askedi give its simple and broad answer in the words of christ the taking up that thou layedst not downor in explained and literal terms usury is any money paid or other advantage given for the loan of anything which is restored to its possessor uninjured and undiminished for simplest instance taking a cabman the other day on a long drive i lent him a shilling to get his dinner if i had kept thirteen pence out of his fare the odd penny would have been usury  or again i lent one of my servants a few years ago eleven hundred pounds to build a house with and stock its ground after some years he paid me the eleven hundred pounds back if i had taken eleven hundred pounds and a penny the extra penny would have been usury  i do not know whether by the phrase presently after used by your lordship religious sanctions i am to understand the law of god which david loved and christ fulfilled or whether the splendor the commercial prosperity and the familiar acquaintance with all the secrets of science and treasures of art which we admire in the city of manchester must in your lordships view be considered as cases which the intelligence of the divine lawgiver could not have originally contemplated without attempting to disguise the narrowness of the horizon grasped by the glance of the lord from sinai nor the inconvenience of the commandments which christ has directed those who love him to keep am i too troublesome or too exigent in asking from one of those whom the holy ghost has made our overseers at least a distinct chart of the old world as contemplated by the almighty and a clear definition of even the inappropriate tenor of the orders of christ if only that the modern scientific churchman may triumph more securely in the circumference of his heavenly vision and accept more gratefully the glorious liberty of the freethinking children of god  159 to take a definite and not impertinent instance i observe in the continuing portion of your letter that your lordship recognizes in christ himself as doubtless all other human perfections so also the perfection of an usurer and that confidently expecting one day to hear from his lips the convicting sentence thou knewest that i was an austere man your lordship prepares for yourself by the disposition of your capital no less than of your talents a better answer than the barren behold there thou hast that is thine i would only observe in reply that although the conception of the good shepherd which in your lordships language is implied in this parable may indeed be less that of one who lays down his life for his sheep than of one who takes up his money for them the passages of our masters instruction of which the meaning is not implicit but explicit are perhaps those which his simpler disciples will be safer in following of which i find early in his teaching this almost as it were in words of one syllable give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away  there is nothing more implied in this sentence than the probable disposition to turn away which might be the first impulse in the mind of a christian asked to lend for nothing as distinguished from the disciple of the manchester school whose principal care is rather to find than to avoid the enthusiastic and enterprising him that would borrow of thee we of the older tradition my lord think that prudence no less than charity forbids the provocation or temptation of others into the state of debt which some time or other we might be called upon not only to allow the payment of without usury but even altogether to forgive  160 d just as we are told where my lord and by whom it is possible that some of the schemers in physical science of whom only a few days since i heard one of the leading doctors explain to a pleased audience that serpents once had legs and had dropped them off in the process of development may have advised the modern disciple of progress of a new meaning in the simple phrase upon thy belly shalt thou go and that the wisdom of the serpent may henceforth consist for true believers of the scientific gospel in the providing of meats for that spiritual organ of motion it is doubtless also true that we shall look vainly among the sayings of solomon for any expression of the opinions of mr john stuart mill but at least this much of natural science enough for our highest need we may find in the scripturesthat by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouthand this much of political that the blessing of the lord it maketh richand he addeth no sorrow with it  e what i do expect to find has your lordship no expectations loftier than these from severer scrutiny of the gospel as for instance of some ordinance of love built on the foundation of honesty  161 f cannot without a violent twist i have never myself found any person sincerely desirous of obeying the word of the lord who had the least wish or occasion to twist it nay even those who study it only that they may discover methods of pardonable disobedience recognize the unturnable edge of its swordand in the worst extremity of their need strive not to avert but to evade the utmost deceivableness of unrighteousness cannot deceive itself into satisfactory misinterpretation it is reduced always to a tremulous omission of the texts it is resolved to disobey but a little while since i heard an entirely wellmeaning clergyman taken by surprise in the course of family worship in the house of a wealthy friend and finding himself under the painful necessity of reading the fifteenth psalm omit the first sentence of the closing verse i chanced afterwards to have an opportunity of asking him why he had done so and received for answer that the lowliness of christian attainment was not yet up to that verse the harmonies of iniquity are thus curiously perfectthe economies of spiritual nourishment approve the same methods of adulteration which are found profitable in the carnal until the prudent pastor follows the example of the wellinstructed dairyman and provides for his newborn babes the insincere milk of the word that they may not grow thereby  162 g st paul no doubt denounces the covetous am i to understand your lordship as considering this undeniable denunciation an original and peculiar view taken by the least of the apostlesperhaps in this particular opinion not worthy to be called an apostle the traditions of my earlier days were wont to refer me to an earlier source of the idea which does not however appear to have occurred to your lordships mindelse the reference to the authority of liddell and scott for the significance of the noun greek pleonektês ought to have been made also for that of the verb greek epithumeô and your lordships frankness in referring me to the instances of your own practice in the disposal of your income must plead my excuse for what might have otherwise seemed impertinentin noting that the blamelessness of episcopal character even by that least of the apostles required in his first epistle to timothy consists not merely in contentment with an episcopal share of church property but in being in no respect either greek aischrokordêsa taker of gain in a base or vulgar manner or greek philargurosa lover of silver this latter word being the common and proper word for covetous in the gospels and epistles as of the pharisees in luke xvi 14 and associated with the other characters of men in perilous times 2 timothy iii 2 and its relative noun greek philarguria given in sum for the root of all evil in 2 timothy vi 10 while even the authority of liddell and scott in the interpretation of greek pleonexia itself as only the desire of getting more than our share may perhaps be bettered by the authority of the teacher who declining the appeal made to him as an equitable greek meristês luke xii 1446 tells his disciples to beware of coveteousness simply as the desire of getting more than we have got for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth  163 believe me my lord it is not without some difficulty that i check my natural impulse to follow you as a scholar into the interesting analysis of the distinctions which may be drawn between rapacity and acquisitiveness between the avarice or the prudent care of possession between the greed and the modest expectation of gain between the love of money which is the root of all evil and the commercial spirit which is in england held to be the fountain of all good these delicate adjustments of the balance by which we strive to weigh to a grain the relative quantities of devotion which we may render in the service of mammon and of god are wholly of recent invention and application nor have they the slightest bearing either on the spiritual purport of the final commandment of the decalogue or on the distinctness of the subsequent prohibition of practical usury  it must be remembered also how difficult it has become to define the term filthy with precision in the present state moral and physical of the english atmosphere and still more so to judge how far in that healthy element a moderate and delicately sanctified appetite for gold may be developed into livelier qualms of hunger for righteousness it may be matter of private opinion how far the lucre derived by your lordship from commission on the fares and refreshments of the passengers by the northwestern may be odoriferous or precious in the same sense as the ointment on the head of aaron or how far that received by the primate of england in royalties on the circulation of improving literature129 may enrichas with perfumes out of broken alabasterthe empyreal air of addington but the higher class of laborers in the lords vineyard might surely with true grace receive from the last unto the first the reflected instruction so often given by the first unto the last be content with your wages  h it may perhaps not improperly be said the bible society will doubtless in future gratefully prefix this guarantee to their publications  i which we are told can we then no more find for ourselves this writing on our heartsor has it ceased to be legible  164 k remunerative employment i cannot easily express the astonishment with which i find a man of your lordships intelligence taking up the common phrase of giving employment as if indeed labor were the best gift which the rich could bestow on the poor of course every idle vagabond be he rich or poor gives employment to some otherwise enough burdened wretch to provide his dinner and clothes for him and every vicious vagabond in the destructive power of his vice gives sorrowful occupation to the energies of resisting and renovating virtue the idle child who litters its nursery and tears its frock gives employment to the housemaid and seamstress the idle woman who litters her drawingroom with trinkets and is ashamed to be seen twice in the same dress is in your lordships view the enlightened supporter of the arts and manufactures of her country at the close of your letter my lord you though in measured terms indignantly dissent from my statement of the power of great cities for evil and indeed i have perhaps been led by my prolonged study of the causes of the fall of venice into clearer recognition of some of these urban influences than may have been possible to your lordship in the center of the virtues and proprieties which have been blessed by providence in the rise of manchester but the scriptural symbol of the power of temptation in the hand of the spiritual babylonall kings have been drunk with the wine of her fornicationis perfectly literal in its exposition of the special influence of cities over a vicious that is to say a declining people they are the foci of its fornication and the practical meaning is that the lords of the soil take the food and labor of the peasants who are their slaves and spend them especially in forms of luxury perfected by the definitely socalled women of the town who whether eastcheap doll or westmuch the reverse of cheapnell are both in the color which they give to the arts and in the tone which they give to the manners of the state a literal plague pestilence and burden to it quite otherwise malignant and maleficent than the poor country lassie who loses her snood among the heather and when at last real political economy shall exhibit the exact sources and consequences of the expenditure of the great capitals of civilization on their own indulgences your lordship will be furnished in the statistics of their most splendid and most impious pleasure with record of precisely the largest existing source of remunerative employmentif that were all the poor had to ask for next after the preparation and practice of war i believe it is indeed probable that facility of intercourse gives the next largest quantity of occupation and as your lordship rightly observes to most respectable persons and if the entire population of manchester lost the use of its legs your lordship would similarly have the satisfaction of observing and might share in the profits of providing the needful machinery of porterage and stretchers but observe my lordand observe as a final and inevitable truththat whether you lend your money to provide an invalided population with crutches stretchers hearses or the railroad accommodation which is so often synonymous with the three the tax on the use of these which constitutes the shareholders dividend is a permanent burden upon them exacted by avarice and by no means an aid granted by benevolence  165 l sanctioned by experience the experience of twentythree years my lord and with the following result  we have now had an opportunity of practically testing the theory not more than seventeen now twentythreei quote from a letter dated 1875 years have passed since by the final abolition of the usury laws all restraint was removed from the growth of what lord coke calls this pestilent weed and we see bacons words verifiedthe rich becoming richer and the poor poorer throughout the civilized world letter from mr r sillar quoted in fors clavigera no 43  m inevitable neither impossible nor inevitable were words of old christian faith but see the closing paragraph of my letter  n before you call on me to substantiate this charge my lord i should like to insert after the words steadily preaching the phrase and politely explainingwith the pauline qualification whether by word or our epistle  166 o the great cities of today are not worse than great cities always have been i do not remember having said that they were my lord i have never anticipated for manchester a worse fate than that of sardis or sodom nor have i yet observed any so mighty works shown forth in her by her ministers as to make her impenitence less pardonable than that of sidon or tyre but i used the particular expression which your lordship supposes me to have overcharged in righteous indignation a boil breaking forth with blains on man and beast because that particular plague was the one which moses was ordered in the eternal wisdom to connect with the ashes of the furnaceliterally no less than spiritually when he brought the israelites forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron how literally no less than in faith and hope the smoke of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt has poisoned the earth the waters and the living creatures flocks and herds and the babes that know not their right hand from their leftneither memphis gomorrah nor cahors are themselves likely to recognize but as i pause in front of the infinitude of the evil that i cannot find so much as thought to followhow much less words to speaka letter is brought to me which gives what perhaps may be more impressive in its single and historical example than all the general evidence gathered already in the pages of fors clavigera                                       167 i could never understand formerly what you meant about usury and about its being wrong to take interest i said truly then that i trusted you meaning i knew that in such matters you did not opineand that innumerable things were within your horizon which had no place within mine  but as i did not understand i could only watch and ponder gradually i came to see a littleas when i read current facts about indiaabout almost every country and about our own trade etc then one of several circumstances that could be seen more closely among my mothers kindred in the north i watched the ruin of two lives they began married life together with good prospects and sufficient means in a lovely little nest among the hills beyond the rochdale smoke soon this became too narrow a splendid trade more mills frequent changes into even finer dwellings luxurious living ostentation extravagance increasing year by year all as now appears made possible by usuryborrowed capital the wife was laid in her grave lately and her friends are thankful the husband with ruin threatening his affairs is in a worse and living grave of evil habits       these are some of the loopholes through which light has fallen      upon your words giving them a new meaning and making me wonder      how i could have missed seeing it from the first once alive to it      i recognize the evil on all sides and how we are entangled by it      and though i am still puzzled at one or two points i am very clear      about the principlethat usury is a deadly thing  yes and deadly always with the vilest forms of destruction both to soul and body  168 it happens strangely my lord that although throughout the seven volumes of fors clavigera i never have set down a sentence without chastising it first into terms which could be literally as well as in their widest bearing justified against all controversy you could perhaps not have found in the whole book had your lordship read it for the purpose any saying quite so literally and terrifically demonstrable as this which you have chanced to select for attack for in the first place of all the calamities which in their apparently merciless infliction paralyzed the wavering faith of mediæval christendom the boil breaking forth into blains in the black plagues of florence and london was the fatalest messenger of the fiends and in the second place the broad result of the missionary labors of the cities of madrid paris and london for the salvation of the wild tribes of the new world since the vaunted discovery of it may be summed in the stem sentencedeath by drunkenness and smallpox  the beneficent influence of recent commercial enterprise in the communication of such divine grace and divine blessing not to speak of other more dreadful and shameful conditions of disease may be studied to best advantage in the history of the two great french and english companies who have enjoyed the monopoly of clothing the nakedness of the old world with coats of skins from the new  the charter of the english one obtained from the crown in 1670 was in the language of modern liberalism wonderfully liberal130 comprising not only the grant of the exclusive trade but also of full territorial possession to all perpetuity of the vast lands within the watershed of hudsons bay the company at once established some forts along the shores of the great inland sea from which it derived its name and opened a very lucrative trade with the indians so that it never ceased paying rich dividends to the fortunate shareholders until towards the close of the last century  up to this time with the exception of the voyage of discovery which herne 177071 made under its auspices to the mouth of the coppermine river it had done but little for the promotion of geographical discovery in its vast territory  169 meanwhile the canadian french fur traders had become so hateful to the indians that these savages formed a conspiracy for their total extirpation fortunately for the white men the smallpox broke out about this time among the redskins and swept them away as the fire consumes the parched grass of the prairies their unburied corpses were torn by the wolves and wild dogs and the survivors were too weak and dispirited to be able to undertake anything against the foreign intruders the canadian fur traders now also saw the necessity of combining their efforts for their mutual benefit instead of ruining each other by an insane competition and consequently formed in 1783 a society which under the name of the northwest company of canada ruled over the whole continent from the canadian lakes to the rocky mountains and in 1806 it even crossed the barrier and established its forts on the northern tributaries of the columbia river to the north it likewise extended its operations encroaching more and more upon the privileges of the hudsons bay company which roused to energy now also pushed on its posts further and further into the interior and established in 1812 a colony on the red river to the south of winnipeg lake thus driving as it were a sharp thorn into the side of its rival but a power like the northwest company which had no less than 50 agents 70 interpreters and 1120 voyageurs in its pay and whose chief managers used to appear at their annual meetings at fort william on the banks of lake superior with all the pomp and pride of feudal barons was not inclined to tolerate this encroachment and thus after many quarrels a regular war broke out between the two parties which after two years duration led to the expulsion of the red river colonists and the murder of their governor semple this event took place in the year 1816 and is but one episode of the bloody feuds which continued to reign between the two rival companies until 1821  170 the dissensions of the fur traders had most deplorable consequences for the redskins for both companies to swell the number of their adherents lavishly distributed spirituous liquorsa temptation which no indian can resist the whole of the meetinggrounds of the saskatchewan and athabasca were but one scene of revelry and bloodshed already decimated by the smallpox the indians now became the victims of drunkenness and discord and it was to be feared that if the war and its consequent demoralization continued the most important tribes would soon be utterly swept away  at length wisdom prevailed over passion and the enemies came to a resolution which if taken from the very beginning would have saved them both a great deal of treasure and many crimes instead of continuing to swing the tomahawk they now smoked the calumet and amalgamated in 1821 under the name of hudsons bay company and under the wing of the charter  the british government as a dowry to the impoverished couple presented them with a license of exclusive trade throughout the whole of that territory which under the name of the hudsons bay and northwest territories extends from labrador to the pacific and from the red river to the polar ocean  171 such my lord have been the triumphs of the modern evangel of usury competition and private enterprise in a perfectly clear instance of their action chosen i hope with sufficient candor since history says professor hind does not furnish another example of an association of private individuals exerting a powerful influence over so large an extent of the earths surface and administering their affairs with such consummate skill and unwavering devotion to the original objects of their incorporation  that original object being of course that poor naked america having yet in a manner two coats might be induced by these christian merchants to give to him that had none  in like manner may any christian householder who has two houses or perchance two parks ever be induced to give to him that hath none my temper and my courtesy scarcely serve me my lord to reply to your assertion of the inevitableness that while half of great britain is laid out in huntinggrounds for sport more savage than the indians the poor of our cities must be swept into incestuous heaps or into dens and caves which are only tombs disquieted so changing the whiteness of jewish sepulchers into the blackness of christian ones in which the hearts of the rich and the homes of the poor are alike as graves that appear notonly their murmur that sayeth it is not enough sounds deeper beneath us every hour nay the whole earth and not only the cities of it sends forth that ghastly cry and her fruitful plains have become slimepits and her fair estuaries gulfs of death for us the mountain of the lord has become only golgotha and the sound of the new song before the throne is drowned in the rolling deathrattle of the nations oh christ where is thy victory  these are thy glorious works mammon parent of goodand this the true debate my lord of manchester between the two angels of your churchwhether the dreamland of its souls be now or hereafternow the firelight in the cave or hereafter the sunlight of heaven  172 how my lord am i to receive or reply to the narrow concessions of your closing sentence the spirit of truth was breathed even from the athenian acropolis and the law of justice thundered even from the cretan sinai but for us he who said i am the truth said also i am the way and the life and for us he who reasoned of righteousness reasoned also of temperance and judgment to come is this the sincere milk of the word which takes the hope from the person of christ and the fear from the charge of his apostle and forbids to english heroism the perilous vision of immortality god be with you my lord and exalt your teaching to that quality of mercy which distilling as the rain from heavennot strained as through channels from a sullen reservoirmay soften the hearts of your people to receive the new commandment that they love one another so round the cathedral of your city shall the merchants law be just and his weights true the table of the moneychanger not overthrown and the bench of the moneylender unbroken  and to as many as walk according to this rule peace shall be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god                                       173 with the preceding letter must assuredly endfor the present if not forevermy own notes on a subject of which my strength no longer serves me to endure the stress and sorrow but i may possibly be able to collect eventually into more close form the already manifold and sufficient references scattered through fors clavigera and perhaps to reprint for the st georges guild the admirable compendium of british ecclesiastical and lay authority on the subject collected by john blaxton preacher of gods word at osmington in dorsetshire printed by john norton under the title of the english usurer and sold by francis bowman in oxford 1631 a still more precious record of the fierce struggle of usury into life among christians and of the resistance to it by venice and her anthony131 will be found in the dialogue della usura of messer speron sperone aldus in vinegia mdxiii followed by the dialogue del cathaio between portia sola e fanciulla fame e cibo vita e morte di ciascuno che la conosce and her lover moresini which is the source of all that is loveliest in the merchant of venice readers who seek more modern and more scientific instruction may consult the able abstract of the triumph of usury drawn up by dr andrew dickson white president of cornell university the warfare of science h s king  co 1877 in which the victory of the great modern scientific principle that two and two make five is traced exultingly to the final overthrow of st chrysostom st jerome st bernard st thomas aquinas luther and bossuet by the establishment of the torlonia family in rome a better collection of the most crushing evidence cannot be found than this furnished by an adversary a less petulant and pompous but more earnest voice from america usury the giant sin of the age by edward palmer perth amboys 1865 should be read together with it in the meantime the substance of the teaching of the former church of england in the great sermon against usury of bishop jewell may perhaps not uselessly occupy one additional page of the contemporary review  174 usury is a kind of lending of money or corne or oyle or wine or of any other thing wherein upon covenant and bargaine we receive againe the whole principall which we delivered and somewhat more for the use and occupying of the same as if i lend 100 pound and for it covenant to receive 105 pound or any other summe greater then was the summe which i did lend this is that which we call usury such a kind of bargaining as no good man or godly man ever used such a kind of bargaining as all men that ever feared gods judgments have alwaies abhorred and condemned it is filthy gaines and a worke of darkenesse it is a monster in nature the overthrow of mighty kingdoms the destruction of flourishing states the decay of wealthy cities the plagues of the world and the misery of the people it is theft it is the murthering of our brethren its the curse of god and the curse of the people this is usury by these signes and tokens you may know it for wheresoever it raigneth all those mischiefes ensue  whence springeth usury soone shewed even thence whence theft murder adultery the plagues and destruction of the people doe spring all these are the workes of the divell and the workes of the flesh christ telleth the pharisees you are of your father the divell and the lusts of your father you will doe even so may it truely be sayd to the usurer thou art of thy father the divell and the lusts of thy father thou wilt doe and therefore thou hast pleasure in his workes the divell entered into the heart of judas and put in him this greedinesse and covetousnesse of game for which he was content to sell his master judass heart was the shop the divell was the foreman to worke in it they that will be rich fall into tentation and snares and into many foolish and noysome lusts which drowne men in perdition and destruction for the desire of money is the roote of all evil and st john saith whosoever committeth sinne is of the divell 1 joh 38 thus we see that the divell is the planter and the father of usury  what are the fruits of usury a 1 it dissolveth the knot and fellowship of mankind 2 it hardeneth mans heart 3 it maketh men unnaturall and bereaveth them of charity and love to their dearest friends 4 it breedeth misery and provoketh the wrath of god from heaven 5 it consumeth rich men it eateth up the poore it maketh bankrupts and undoeth many householders 6 the poore occupiers are driven to flee their wives are left alone their children are hopelesse and driven to beg their bread through the unmercifull dealing of the covetous usurer  175 he that is an usurer wisheth that all others may lacke and come to him and borrow of him that all others may lose so that he may have gaine therefore our old forefathers so much abhorred this trade that they thought an usurer unworthy to live in the company of christian men they suffered not an usurer to be witnesse in matters of law they suffer him not to make a testament and to bestow his goods by will when an usurer dyed they would not suffer him to be buried in places appointed for the buriall of christians so highly did they mislike this unmercifull spoyling and deceiving our brethren  but what speak i of the ancient fathers of the church there was never any religion nor sect nor state nor degree nor profession of men but they have disliked it philosophers greekes latins lawyers divines catholikes heretics all tongues and nations have ever thought an usurer as dangerous as a theefe the very sense of nature proves it to be so if the stones could speak they would say as much but some will say all kindes of usury are not forbidden there may be cases where usury may stand with reason and equity and herein they say so much as by wit may be devised to paint out a foule and ugly idoll and to shadow themselves in manifest and open wickednesse whatsoever god sayeth yet this or this kind of usury say they which is done in this or this sort is not forbidden it proffiteth the commonwealth it relieveth great numbers the poore should otherwise perish none would lend them by like good reason there are some that defend theft and murder they say there may be some case where it is lawful to kill or to steale for god willed the hebrews to rob the Ægyptians and abraham to kill his owne sonne isaac in these cases the robbery and the killing of his sonne were lawfull so say they even so by the like reason doe some of our countrymen maintayne concubines curtizans and brothelhouses and stand in defence of open stewes they are say they for the benefit of the country they keepe men from more dangerous inconveniences take them away it will be worse although god say there shall be no whore of the daughters of israel neither shall there be a whorekeeper of the sonnes of israel yet these men say all manner of whoredom is not forbidden in these and these cases it is not amisse to alow it       as samuel sayd to saul so may we say to the usurer thou hast      devised cases and colours to hide thy shame but what regard hath      god to thy cases what careth he for thy reasons the lord would      have more pleasure if when thou heareth his voyce thou wouldest      obey him for what is thy device against the counsell and      ordinance of god what bold presumption is it for a mortall man to      controule the commandments of immortall god and to weigh his      heavenly wisdome in the ballance of humane foolishnesse when god      sayth thou shalt not take usury what creature of god art thou      which canst take usury when god maketh it unlawfull what art      thou oh man that sayst it is lawfull this is a token of a      desperate mind it is found true in thee that paul sayd the love      of money is the root of all ill thou art so given over unto the      wicked mammon that thou carest not to doe the will of god

any that draws breath in italy  this is the shakespearian description of that anthony whom the modern british public with its new critical lights calls a sentimentalist and speculatorholding shylock to be the real hero and innocent victim of the drama     usury132  a preface   176 in the wise practical and affectionate sermon given from st marys pulpit last autumn to the youth of oxford by the good bishop of carlisle his lordship took occasion to warn his eagerly attentive audience with deep earnestness against the crime of debt dwelling with powerful invective on the cruelty and selfishness with which too often the son wasted in his follies the fruits of his fathers labor or the means of his familys subsistence and involved himself in embarrassments which said the bishop i have again and again known to cause the misery of all subsequent life  the sin was charged the appeal pressed only on the preachers undergraduate hearers beneath the gallery the heads of houses sate remorseless nor from the pulpit was a single hint permitted that any measures could be rationally taken for the protection no less than the warning of the youth under their care no such suggestion would have been received if even understood by any english congregation of this timea strange and perilous time in which the greatest commercial people of the world have been brought to think usury the most honorable and fruitful branch or rather perennial stem of commercial industry  177 but whose the fault that english congregations are in this temper and this ignorance the saying of mine133 which the author of this book quotes in the close of his introduction was written by me with a meaning altogether opposite and far more forcible than that which it might seem to bear to a careless interpreter134 in the present state of popular revolt against all conception and manner of authority but more especially spiritual authority the sentence reads as if it were written by an adversary of the churcha hater of its prelacyan advocate of universal liberty of thought and license of crime whereas the sentence is really written in the conviction i might say knowledge if i spoke without deference to the readers incredulity that the pastoral office must forever be the highest for good or evil in every christian land and that when it fails in vigilance faith or courage the sheep must be scattered and neither king nor law avail any more to protect them against the fury of their own passions nor any human sagacity against the deception of their own hearts  178 since however these things are instantly so and the bishops of england have now with one accord consented to become merely the highly salaried vergers of her cathedrals taking care that the choristers do not play at leapfrog in the churchyard that the precincts are elegantly ironrailed from the profane parts of the town and that the doors of the building be duly locked so that nobody may pray in it at improper timesthese things being so may we not turn to the everymanhisownbishop party with its bible society missionary zeal and right of infallible private interpretation to ask at least for some small exposition to the inhabitants of their own country of those scriptures which they are so fain to put in the possession of others and this the rather because the popular familiar version of the new testament among us unwritten seems to be now the exact contrary of that which we were once taught to be of divine authority  179 i place side by side the ancient and modern versions of the seven verses of the new testament which were the beginning and are indeed the heads of all the teaching of christ    ancient    blessed are the poor in   spirit for theirs is the   kingdom of heaven    blessed are they that mourn   for they shall be comforted    blessed are the meek for   they shall inherit the   earth    blessed are they which do   hunger for righteousness   for they shall be filled    blessed are the merciful for   they shall obtain mercy    blessed are the pure in heart   for they shall see god    blessed are the peacemakers   for they shall be called the   children of

innermost of all causes of modern war they would be found not in the avarice or ambition but the idleness of the upper classes they have nothing to do but to teach the peasantry to kill each

industriously collected on the guilt of usury and supporting it by the always impressive language of symbolical art136 for indeed i had myself no idea till i read the connected statement which these pictures illustrate how steadily the system of moneylending had gained on the nation and how fatally every hand and foot was now entangled by it yet in commending the study of this book to every

persons will probably find fault with me for publishing opinions which are not new but i shall bear this blame contentedly believing that opinions on this subject could hardly be just if they were not 1800 years old others will blame me for making proposals which are altogether new to whom i would answer that things in these days seem not so far right but that they may be mended and others will simply call the opinions false and the proposals foolishto whose goodwill if they take it in hand to contradict me i must leave what i have writtenhaving no purpose of being drawn at present into religious controversy if however any should admit the truth but regret the tone of what i have said lean only pray them to consider how much less harm is done in the world by ungraceful boldness than by untimely fear    denmark hill    february 1851   preface to the second 1851 edition  since the publication of these notes i have received many letters upon the affairs of the church from persons of nearly every denomination of christians for all these letters i am grateful and in many of them i have found valuable information or suggestion but i have not leisure at present to follow out the subject farther and no reason has been shown me for modifying or altering any part of the text as it stands it is republished therefore without change or addition  i must however especially thank one of my correspondents for sending me a pamphlet called sectarianism the bane of religion and the church138 which i would recommend in the strongest terms to the reading of all who regard the cause of christ and for help in reading the scriptures i would name also the short and admirable arrangement of parallel passages relating to the offices of the clergy called the testimony of scripture concerning the christian ministry139   preface to third called second edition  i have only to add to this first preface that the boldness of the pamphletungraceful enough it must be admittedhas done no one any harm that i know of but on the contrary some definite good as far as i can judge and that i republish the whole now letter for letter as originally printed believing it likely to be still serviceable and on the ground it takes for argument scriptural authority incontrovertible as far as it reaches though it amazes me to find on rereading it that so late as 1851 i had only got the length of perceiving the schism between sects of protestants to be criminal and ridiculous while i still supposed the schism between protestants and catholics to be virtuous and sublime  the most valuable part of the whole is the analysis of governments §§ 21315 the passages on church discipline §§ 2045 being also anticipatory of much that i have to say in fors where i hope to reassert the substance of this pamphlet on wider grounds and with more modesty    brantwood    3rd august 1875   footnotes  footnote 137 this pamphlet was originally published in 1851 under the title of notes on the construction of sheepfolds by john ruskin ma author of the seven lamps of architecture etc smith elder  co a second edition with an additional preface followed in the same year after which the

street  footnote 139 london 1847 t k campbell 1 warwick square     notes  etc etc   182 the following remarks were intended to form part of the appendix to an essay on architecture but it seemed to me when i had put them into order that they might be useful to persons who would not care to possess the work to which i proposed to attach them i publish them therefore in a separate form but i have not time to give them more consistency than they would have had in the subordinate position originally intended for them i do not profess to teach divinity and i pray the reader to understand this and to pardon the slightness and insufficiency of notes set down with no more intention of connected treatment of their subject than might regulate an accidental conversation some of them are simply copied from my private diary others are detached statements of facts which seem to me significative or valuable without comment all are written in haste and in the intervals of occupation with an entirely different subject it may be asked of me whether i hold it right to speak thus hastily and insufficiently respecting the matter in question yes i hold it right to speak hastily not to think hastily i have not thought hastily of these things and besides the haste of speech is confessed that the reader may think of me only as talking to him and saying as shortly and simply as i can things which if he esteem them foolish or idle he is welcome to cast aside but which in very truth i cannot help saying at this time  183 the passages in the essay which required notes described the repression of the political power of the venetian clergy by the venetian senate and it became necessary for mein supporting an assertion made in the course of the inquiry that the idea of separation of church and state was both vain and impiousto limit the sense in which it seemed to me that the word church should be understood and to note one or two consequences which would result from the acceptance of such limitation this i may as well do in a separate paper readable by any person interested in the subject for it is high time that some definition of the word should be agreed upon i do not mean a definition involving the doctrine of this or that division of christians but limiting in a manner understood by all of them the sense in which the word should thenceforward be used there is grievous inconvenience in the present state of things for instance in a sermon lately published at oxford by an antitractarian divine i find this sentenceit is clearly within the province of the state to establish a national church or external institution of certain forms of worship now suppose one were to take this interpretation of the word church given by an oxford divine and substitute it for the simple word in some bible texts as for instance unto the angel of the external institution of certain forms of worship of ephesus write etc or salute the brethren which are in laodicea and nymphas and the external institution of certain forms of worship which is in his housewhat awkward results we should have here and there now i do not say it is possible for men to agree with each other in their religious opinions but it is certainly possible for them to agree with each other upon their religious expressions and when a word occurs in the bible a hundred and fourteen times it is surely not asking too much of contending divines to let it stand in the sense in which it there occurs and when they want an expression of something for which it does not stand in the bible to use some other word there is no compromise of religious opinion in this it is simply proper respect for the queens english  184 the word occurs in the new testament as i said a hundred and fourteen times140 in every one of those occurrences it bears one and the same grand sense that of a congregation or assembly of men but it bears this sense under four different modifications giving four separate meanings to the word these are  i the entire multitude of the elect otherwise called the body of christ and sometimes the bride the lambs wife including the faithful in all agesadam and the children of adam yet unborn  in this sense it is used in ephesians v 25 27 32 colossians i 18 and several other passages  ii the entire multitude of professing believers in christ existing on earth at a given moment including false brethren wolves in sheeps clothing goats and tares as well as sheep and wheat and other forms of bad fish with good in the net  in this sense it is used in 1 cor x 32 xv 9 galatians i 13 1 tim iii 5 etc  iii the multitude of professed believers living in a certain city place or house this is the most frequent sense in which the word occurs as in acts vii 38 xiii 1 1 cor i 2 xvi 19 etc  iv any assembly of men as in acts xix 32 41  185 that in a hundred and twelve out of the hundred and fourteen texts the word bears some one of these four meanings is indisputable141 but there are two texts in which if the word had alone occurred its meaning might have been doubtful these are matt xvi 18 and xviii 17  the absurdity of founding any doctrine upon the inexpressibly minute possibility that in these two texts the word might have been used with a different meaning from that which it bore in all the others coupled with the assumption that the meaning was this or that is selfevident it is not so much a religious error as a philological solecism unparalleled so far as i know in any other science but that of divinity  nor is it ever i think committed with open front by protestants no english divine asked in a straightforward manner for a scriptural definition of the church would i suppose be bold enough to answer the clergy nor is there any harm in the common use of the word so only that it be distinctly understood to be not the scriptural one and therefore to be unfit for substitution in a scriptural text there is no harm in a mans talking of his sons going into the church meaning that he is going to take orders but there is much harm in his supposing this a scriptural use of the word and therefore that when christ said tell it to the church he might possibly have meant tell it to the clergy  186 it is time to put an end to the chance of such misunderstanding let it but be declared plainly by all men when they begin to state their opinions on matters ecclesiastical that they will use the word church in one sense or the otherthat they will accept the sense in which it is used by the apostles or that they deny this sense and propose a new definition of their own we shall then know what we are about with themwe may perhaps grant them their new use of the term and argue with them on that understanding so only that they will not pretend to make use of scriptural authority while they refuse to employ scriptural language this however it is not my purpose to do at present i desire only to address those who are willing to accept the apostolic sense of the word church and with them i would endeavor shortly to ascertain what consequences must follow from an acceptance of that apostolic sense and what must be our first and most necessary conclusions from the common language of scripture142 respecting these following points    1 the distinctive characters of the church   2 the authority of the church   3 the authority of the clergy over the church   4 the connection of the church with the state  187 these are four separate subjects of question but we shall not have to put these questions in succession with each of the four scriptural meanings of the word church for evidently its second and third meaning may be considered together as merely expressing the general or particular conditions of the visible church and the fourth signification is entirely independent of all questions of a religious kind so that we shall only put the above inquiries successively respecting the invisible and visible church and as the two lastof authority of clergy and connection with statecan evidently only have reference to the visible church we shall have in all these six questions to consider    1 the distinctive characters of the invisible church   2 the distinctive characters of the visible church   3 the authority of the invisible church   4 the authority of the visible church   5 the authority of clergy over the visible church   6 the connection of the visible church with the state  188 1 what are the distinctive characters of the invisible church that is to say what is it which makes a person a member of this church and how is he to be known for such wide questionif we had to take cognizance of all that has been written respecting it remarkable as it has been always for quantity rather than carefulness and full of confusion between visible and invisible even the article of the church of england being ambiguous in its first clause the visible church is a congregation of faithful men as if ever it had been possible except for god to see faith or to know a faithful man by sight and there is little else written on this question without some such quick confusion of the visible and invisible churchneedless and unaccountable confusion for evidently the church which is composed of faithful men is the one true indivisible and indiscernible church built on the foundation of apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone it includes all who have ever fallen asleep in christ and all yet unborn who are to be saved in him its body is as yet imperfect it will not be perfected till the last saved human spirit is gathered to its god  a man becomes a member of this church only by believing in christ with all his heart nor is he positively recognizable for a member of it when he has become so by any one but god not even by himself nevertheless there are certain signs by which christs sheep may be guessed at not by their being in any definite foldfor many are lost sheep at times but by their sheeplike behavior and a great many are indeed sheep which on the far mountain side in their peacefulness we take for stones to themselves the best proof of their being christs sheep is to find themselves on christs shoulders and between them there are certain sympathies expressed in the apostles creed by the term communion of saints by which they may in a sort recognize each other and so become verily visible to each other for mutual comfort  189 2 the limits of the visible church or of the church in the second scriptural sense are not so easy to define they are awkward questions these of stakenets it has been ingeniously and plausibly endeavored to make baptism a sign of admission into the visible church but absurdly enough for we know that half the baptized people in the world are very visible rogues believing neither in god nor devil and it is flat blasphemy to call these visible christians we also know that the holy ghost was sometimes given before baptism143 and it would be absurdity to call a man on whom the holy ghost had fallen an invisible christian the only rational distinction is that which practically though not professedly we always assume if we hear a man profess himself a believer in god and in christ and detect him in no glaring and willful violation of gods law we speak of him as a christian and on the other hand if we hear him or see him denying christ either in his words or conduct we tacitly assume him not to be a christian a mawkish charity prevents us from outspeaking in this matter and from earnestly endeavoring to discern who are christians and who are not and this i hold144 to be one of the chief sins of the church in the present day for thus wicked men are put to no shame and better men are encouraged in their failings or caused to hesitate in their virtues by the example of those whom in false charity they choose to call christians now it being granted that it is impossible to know determinedly who are christians indeed that is no reason for utter negligence in separating the nominal apparent or possible christian from the professed pagan or enemy of god we spend much time in arguing about efficacy of sacraments and such other mysteries but we do not act upon the very certain tests which are clear and visible we know that christs people are not thievesnot liarsnot busybodiesnot dishonestnot avariciousnot wastefulnot cruel let us then get ourselves well clear of thievesliarswasteful peopleavaricious peoplecheating peoplepeople who do not pay their debts let us assure them that they at least do not belong to the visible church and having thus got that church into decent shape and cohesion it will be time to think of drawing the stakenets closer  i hold it for a law palpable to common sense and which nothing but the cowardice and faithlessness of the church prevents it from putting in practice that the conviction of any dishonorable conduct or willful crime of any fraud falsehood cruelty or violence should be ground for the excommunication of any manfor his publicly declared separation from the acknowledged body of the visible church and that he should not be received again therein without public confession of his crime and declaration of his repentance if this were vigorously enforced we should soon have greater purity of life in the world and fewer discussions about high and low churches but before we can obtain any idea of the manner in which such law could be enforced we have to consider the second respecting the authority of the church now authority is twofold to declare doctrine and to enforce discipline and we have to inquire therefore in each kind  190 3 what is the authority of the invisible church evidently in matters of doctrine all members of the invisible church must have been and must ever be at the time of their deaths right in the points essential to salvation but a we cannot tell who are members of the invisible church  b we cannot collect evidence from deathbeds in a clearly stated form  c we can collect evidence in any form only from some one or two out of every sealed thousand of the invisible church elijah thought he was alone in israel and yet there were seven thousand invisible ones around him grant that we had elijahs intelligence and we could only calculate on collecting one seventhousandth part of the evidence or opinions of the part of the invisible church living on earth at a given moment that is to say the sevenmillionth or trillionth of its collective evidence it is very clear therefore we cannot hope to get rid of the contradictory opinions and keep the consistent ones by a general equation but it has been said these are no contradictory opinions the church is infallible there was some talk about the infallibility of the church if i recollect right in that letter of mr bennetts to the bishop of london if any church is infallible it is assuredly the invisible church or body of christ and infallible in the main sense it must of course be by its definition an elect person must be saved and therefore cannot eventually be deceived on essential points so that christ says of the deception of such if it were possible implying it to be impossible therefore as we said if one could get rid of the variable opinions of the members of the invisible church the constant opinions would assuredly be authoritative but for the three reasons above stated we cannot get at their constant opinions and as for the feelings and thoughts which they daily experience or express the question of infallibility which is practical only in this bearingis soon settled observe st paul and the rest of the apostles write nearly all their epistles to the invisible churchthose epistles are headedromans to the beloved of god called to be saints 1 corinthians to them that are sanctified in christ jesus 2 corinthians to the saints in all achaia ephesians to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus philippians to all the saints which are at philippi colossians to the saints and faithful brethren which are at colosse 1 and 2 thessalonians to the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and the lord jesus 1 and 2 timothy to his own son in the faith titus to the same 1 peter to the strangers elect according to the foreknowledge of god 2 peter to them that have obtained like precious faith with us  2 john to the elect lady  jude  to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called  191 there are thus fifteen epistles expressly directed to the members of the invisible church philemon and hebrews and 1 and 3 john are evidently also so written though not so expressly inscribed that of james and that to the galatians are as evidently to the visible church the one being general and the other to persons removed from him that called them missing out therefore these two epistles but including christs words to his disciples we find in the scriptural addresses to members of the invisible church fourteen if not more direct injunctions not to be deceived145 so much for the infallibility of the church  now one could put up with puseyism more patiently if its fallacies arose merely from peculiar temperaments yielding to peculiar temptations but its bold refusals to read plain english its elaborate adjustments of tight bandages over its own eyes as wholesome preparation for a walk among traps and pitfalls its daring trustfulness in its own clairvoyance all the time and declarations that every pit it falls into is a seventh heaven and that it is pleasant and profitable to break its legswith all this it is difficult to have patience one thinks of the highwayman with his eyes shut in the arabian nights and wonders whether any kind of scourging would prevail upon the anglican highwayman to open first one and then the other  192 4 so much then i repeat for the infallibility of the invisible church and for its consequent authority now if we want to ascertain what infallibility and authority there is in the visible church we have to alloy the small wisdom and the light weight of invisible christians with the large percentage of the false wisdom and contrary weight of undetected antichristians which alloy makes up the current coin of opinions in the visible church having such value as we may chooseits nature being properly assayedto attach to it  there is therefore in matters of doctrine no such thing as the authority of the church we might as well talk of the authority of a morning cloud there may be light in it but the light is not of it and it diminishes the light that it gets and lets less of it through than it receives christ being its sun or we might as well talk of the authority of a flock of sheepfor the church is a body to be taught and fed not to teach and feed and of all sheep that are fed on the earth christs sheep are the most simple the children of this generation are wiser always losing themselves doing little else in this world but lose themselvesnever finding themselves always found by some one else getting perpetually into sloughs and snows and bramble thickets like to die there but for their shepherd who is forever finding them and bearing them back with torn fleeces and eyes full of fear  193 this then being the noauthority of the church in matter of doctrine what authority has it in matters of discipline  much every way the sheep have natural and wholesome power however far scattered they may be from their proper fold of getting together in orderly knots following each other on trodden sheepwalks and holding their heads all one way when they see strange dogs coming as well as of casting out of their company any whom they see reason to suspect of not being right sheep and being among them for no good all which things must be done as the time and place require and by common consent a path may be good at one time of day which is bad at another or after a change of wind and a position may be very good for sudden defense which would be very stiff and awkward for feeding in and common consent must often be of such and such a company on this or that hillside in this or that particular dangernot of all the sheep in the world and the consent may either be literally common and expressed in assembly or it may be to appoint officers over the rest with such and such trusts of the common authority to be used for the common advantage conviction of crimes and excommunication for instance could neither be effected except before or by means of officers of some appointed authority  194 5 this then brings us to our fifth question what is the authority of the clergy over the church  the first clause of the question must evidently bewho are the clergy and it is not easy to answer this without begging the rest of the question  for instance i think i can hear certain people answering that the clergy are folk of three kindsbishops who overlook the church priests who sacrifice for the church deacons who minister to the church thus assuming in their answer that the church is to be sacrificed for and that the people cannot overlook and minister to her at the same timewhich is going much too fast i think however if we define the clergy to be the spiritual officers of the churchmeaning by officers merely people in officewe shall have a title safe enough and general enough to begin with and corresponding too pretty well with st pauls general expression greek proistamenoi in rom xii 8 and 1 thess v 13  now respecting these spiritual officers or officebearers we have to inquire first what their office or authority is or should be secondly who gave or should give them that authority that is to say first what is or should be the nature of their office and secondly what the extent or force of their authority in it for this last depends mainly on its derivation  195 first then what should be the offices and of what kind should be the authority of the clergy  i have hitherto referred to the bible for an answer to every question i do so again and behold the bible gives me no answer i defy you to answer me from the bible you can only guess and dimly conjecture what the offices of the clergy were in the first century you cannot show me a single command as to what they shall be strange this the bible gives no answer to so apparently important a question god surely would not have left his word without an answer to anything his children ought to ask surely it must be a ridiculous questiona question we ought never to have put or thought of putting let us think of it again a little to be sureit is a ridiculous question and we should be ashamed of ourselves for having put itwhat should be the offices of the clergy that is to say what are the possible spiritual necessities which at any time may arise in the church and by what means and men are they to be suppliedevidently an infinite question different kinds of necessities must be met by different authorities constituted as the necessities arise robinson crusoe in his island wants no bishop and makes a thunderstorm do for an evangelist the university of oxford would be ill off without its bishop but wants an evangelist besides and that forthwith the authority which the vaudois shepherds need is of barnabas the son of consolation the authority which the city of london needs is of james the son of thunder let us then alter the form of our question and put it to the bible thus what are the necessities most likely to arise in the church and may they be best met by different men or in great part by the same men acting in different capacities and are the names attached to their offices of any consequence ah the bible answers now and that loudly the church is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the cornerstone well we cannot have two foundations so we can have no more apostles nor prophetsthen as for the other needs of the church in its edifying upon this foundation there are all manner of things to be done dailyrebukes to be given comfort to be brought scripture to be explained warning to be enforced threatenings to be executed charities to be administered and the men who do these things are called and call themselves with absolute indifference deacons bishops elders evangelists according to what they are doing at the time of speaking st paul almost always calls himself a deacon st peter calls himself an elder 1 peter v 1 and timothy generally understood to be addressed as a bishop is called a deacon in 1 tim iv 6forbidden to rebuke an elder in v 1 and exhorted to do the work of an evangelist in 2 tim iv 5 but there is one thing which as officers or as separate from the rest of the flock they never call themselveswhich it would have been impossible as so separate they ever should have called themselves that ispriests  196 it would have been just as possible for the clergy of the early church to call themselves levites as to call themselves exofficio priests the whole function of priesthood was on christmas morning at once and forever gathered into his person who was born at bethlehem and thenceforward all who are united with him and who with him make sacrifice of themselves that is to say all members of the invisible church become at the instant of their conversion priests and are so called in 1 peter ii 5 and rev i 6 and xx 6 where observe there is no possibility of limiting the expression to the clergy the conditions of priesthood being simply having been loved by christ and washed in his blood the blasphemous claim on the part of the clergy of being more priests than the godly laitythat is to say of having a higher holiness than the holiness of being one with christis altogether a romanist heresy dragging after it or having its origin in the other heresies respecting the sacrificial power of the church officer and his repeating the oblation of christ and so having power to absolve from sinwith all the other endless and miserable falsehoods of the papal hierarchy falsehoods for which that there might be no shadow of excuse it has been ordained by the holy spirit that no christian minister shall once call himself a priest from one end of the new testament to the other except together with his flock and so far from the idea of any peculiar sanctification belonging to the clergy ever entering the apostles minds we actually find st paul defending himself against the possible imputation of inferiority if any man trust to himself that he is christs let him of himself think this again that as he is christs even so are we christs 2 cor x 7 as for the unhappy retention of the term priest in our english prayerbook so long as it was understood to mean nothing but an upper order of church officer licensed to tell the congregation from the readingdesk what for the rest they might one would think have known without being toldthat god pardoneth all them that truly repentthere was little harm in it but now that this order of clergy begins to presume upon a title which if it mean anything at all is simply short for presbyter and has no more to do with the word hiereus than with the word levite it is time that some order should be taken both with the book and the clergy for instance in that dangerous compound of halting poetry with hollow divinity called the lyra apostolica we find much versification on the sin of korah and his company with suggested parallel between the christian and levitical churches and threatening that there are judgment fires for highvoiced korahs in their day there are indeed such fires but when moses said a prophet shall the lord raise up unto you like unto me did he mean the writer who signs greek g in the lyra apostolica the office of the lawgiver and priest is now forever gathered into one mediator between god and man and they are guilty of the sin of korah who blasphemously would associate themselves in his mediatorship  197 as for the passages in the ordering of priests and visitation of the sick respecting absolution they are evidently pure romanism and might as well not be there for any practical effect which they have on the consciences of the laity and had much better not be there as regards their effect on the minds of the clergy it is indeed true that christ promised absolving powers to his apostles he also promised to those who believed that they should take up serpents and if they drank any deadly thing it should not hurt them his words were fulfilled literally but those who would extend their force to beyond the apostolic times must extend both promises or neither  although however the protestant laity do not often admit the absolving power of their clergy they are but too apt to yield in some sort to the impression of their greater sanctification and from this instantly results the unhappy consequence that the sacred character of the layman himself is forgotten and his own ministerial duty is neglected men not in office in the church suppose themselves on that ground in a sort unholy and that therefore they may sin with more excuse and be idle or impious with less danger than the clergy especially they consider themselves relieved from all ministerial function and as permitted to devote their whole time and energy to the business of this world no mistake can possibly be greater every member of the church is equally bound to the service of the head of the church and that service is preeminently the saving of souls there is not a moment of a mans active life in which he may not be indirectly preaching and throughout a great part of his life he ought to be directly preaching and teaching both strangers and friends his children his servants and all who in any way are put under him being given to him as special objects of his ministration so that the only difference between a church officer and a lay member is either a wider degree of authority given to the former as apparently a wiser and better man or a special appointment to some office more easily discharged by one person than by many as for instance the serving of tables by the deacons the authority or appointment being in either case commonly signified by a marked separation from the rest of the church and the privilege or power146 of being maintained by the rest of the church without being forced to labor with his hands or incumber himself with any temporal concerns  198 now putting out of the question the serving of tables and other such duties respecting which there is no debate we shall find the offices of the clergy whatever names we may choose to give to those who discharge them falling mainly into two great headsteaching including doctrine warning and comfort discipline including reproof and direct administration of punishment either of which functions would naturally become vested in single persons to the exclusion of others as a mere matter of convenience whether those persons were wiser and better than others or not and respecting each of which and the authority required for its fitting discharge a short inquiry must be separately made  199 i teachingit appears natural and wise that certain men should be set apart from the rest of the church that they may make theology the study of their lives and that they should be thereto instructed specially in the hebrew and greek tongues and have entire leisure granted them for the study of the scriptures and for obtaining general knowledge of the grounds of faith and best modes of its defense against all heretics and it seems evidently right also that with this scholastic duty should be joined the pastoral duty of constant visitation and exhortation to the people for clearly the bible and the truths of divinity in general can only be understood rightly in their practical application and clearly also a man spending his time constantly in spiritual ministrations must be better able on any given occasion to deal powerfully with the human heart than one unpracticed in such matters the unity of knowledge and love both devoted altogether to the service of christ and his church marks the true christian minister who i believe whenever he has existed has never failed to receive due and fitting reverence from all menof whatever character or opinion and i believe that if all those who profess to be such were such indeed there would never be question of their authority more  200 but whatever influence they may have over the church their authority never supersedes that of either the intellect or the conscience of the simplest of its lay members they can assist those members in the search for truth or comfort their overworn and doubtful minds they can even assure them that they are in the way of truth or that pardon is within their reach but they can neither manifest the truth nor grant the pardon truth is to be discovered and pardon to be won for every man by himself this is evident from innumerable texts of scripture but chiefly from those which exhort every man to seek after truth and which connect knowing with doing we are to seek after knowledge as silver and search for her as for hid treasures therefore from every man she must be naturally hid and the discovery of her is to be the reward only of personal search the kingdom of god is as treasure hid in a field and of those who profess to help us to seek for it we are not to put confidence in those who sayhere is the treasure we have found it and have it and will give you some of it but in those who saywe think that is a good place to dig and you will dig most easily in such and such a way  201 farther it has been promised that if such earnest search be made truth shall be discovered as much truth that is as is necessary for the person seeking these therefore i hold for two fundamental principles of religionthat without seeking truth cannot be known at all and that by seeking it may be discovered by the simplest i say without seeking it cannot be known at all it can neither be declared from pulpits nor set down in articles nor in anywise prepared and sold in packages ready for use truth must be ground for every man by himself out of its husk with such help as he can get indeed but not without stern labor of his own in what science is knowledge to be had cheap or truth to be told over a velvet cushion in half an hours talk every seventh day can you learn chemistry sozoologyanatomy and do you expect to penetrate the secret of all secrets and to know that whose price is above rubies and of which the depth saithit is not in mein so easy fashion there are doubts in this matter which evil spirits darken with their wings and that is true of all such doubts which we were told long agothey can be ended by action alone147  202 as surely as we live this truth of truths can only so be discerned to those who act on what they know more shall be revealed and thus if any man will do his will he shall know the doctrine whether it be of god any mannot the man who has most means of knowing who has the subtlest brains or sits under the most orthodox preacher or has his library fullest of most orthodox booksbut the man who strives to know who takes god at his word and sets himself to dig up the heavenly mystery roots and all before sunset and the night come when no man can work beside such a man god stands in more and more visible presence as he toils and teaches him that which no preacher can teachno earthly authority gainsay by such a man the preacher must himself be judged  203 doubt you this there is nothing more certain nor clear throughout the bible the apostles themselves appeal constantly to their flocks and actually claim judgment from them as deserving it and having a right to it rather than discouraging it but first notice the way in which the discovery of truth is spoken of in the old testament evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lord understand all things proverbs xxviii 5 god overthroweth not merely the transgressor or the wicked but even the words of the transgressor proverbs xxii 12 and the counsel of the wicked job v 13 xxi 16 observe again in proverbs xxiv 14 my son eat thou honey because it is goodso shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou hast found it there shall be a reward and again what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose so job xxxii 8 and multitudes of places more and then with all these places which express the definite and personal operation of the spirit of god on every one of his people compare the place in isaiah which speaks of the contrary of this human teaching a passage which seems as if it had been written for this very day and hour because their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men therefore behold the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid xxix 1314 then take the new testament and observe how st paul himself speaks of the romans even as hardly needing his epistle but able to admonish one another nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind xv 15 anyone we should have thought might have done as much as this and yet st paul increases the modesty of it as he goes on for he claims the right of doing as much as this only because of the grace given to me of god that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles then compare 2 cor v 11 where he appeals to the consciences of the people for the manifestation of his having done his duty and observe in verse 21 of that and i of the next chapter the pray and beseech not command and again in chapter vi verse 4 approving ourselves as the ministers of god but the most remarkable passage of all is 2 cor iii 1 whence it appears that the churches were actually in the habit of giving letters of recommendation to their ministers and st paul dispenses with such letters not by virtue of his apostolic authority but because the power of his preaching was enough manifested in the corinthians themselves and these passages are all the more forcible because if in any of them st paul had claimed absolute authority over the church as a teacher it was no more than we should have expected him to claim nor could his doing so have in anywise justified a successor in the same claim but now that he has not claimed itwho following him shall dare to claim it and the consideration of the necessity of joining expressions of the most exemplary humility which were to be the example of succeeding ministers with such assertion of divine authority as should secure acceptance for the epistle itself in the sacred canon sufficiently accounts for the apparent inconsistencies which occur in 2 thess iii 14 and other such texts  204 so much then for the authority of the clergy in matters of doctrine next what is their authority in matters of discipline it must evidently be very great even if it were derived from the people alone and merely vested in the clerical officers as the executors of their ecclesiastical judgments and general overseers of all the church but granting as we must presently the minister to hold office directly from god his authority of discipline becomes very great indeed how great it seems to me most difficult to determine because i do not understand what st paul means by delivering a man to satan for the destruction of the flesh leaving this question however as much too hard for casual examination it seems indisputable that the authority of the ministers or court of ministers should extend to the pronouncing a man excommunicate for certain crimes against the church as well as for all crimes punishable by ordinary law there ought i think to be an ecclesiastical code of laws and a man ought to have jury trial according to this code before an ecclesiastical judge in which if he were found guilty as of lying or dishonesty or cruelty much more of any actually committed violent crime he should be pronounced excommunicate refused the sacrament and have his name written in some public place as an excommunicate person until he had publicly confessed his sin and besought pardon of god for it the jury should always be of the laity and no penalty should be enforced in an ecclesiastical court except this of excommunication  205 this proposal may seem strange to many persons but assuredly this if not much more than this is commanded in scripture first in the muchabused text tell it unto the church and most clearly in 1 cor v 1113 2 thess iii 6 and 14 1 tim v 8 and 20 and titus iii 10 from which passages we also know the two proper degrees of the penalty for christ says let him who refuses to hear the church be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican but christ ministered to the heathen and sat at meat with the publican only always with declared or implied expression of their inferiority here therefore is one degree of excommunication for persons who offend their brethren committing some minor fault against them and who having been pronounced in error by the body of the church refuse to confess their fault or repair it who are then to be no longer considered members of the church and their recovery to the body of it is to be sought exactly as it would be in the case of an heathen but covetous persons railers extortioners idolaters and those guilty of other gross crimes are to be entirely cut off from the company of the believers and we are not so much as to eat with them this last penalty however would require to be strictly guarded that it might not be abused in the infliction of it as it has been by the romanists we are not indeed to eat with them but we may exercise all christian charity towards them and give them to eat if we see them in hunger as we ought to all our enemies only we are to consider them distinctly as our enemies that is to say enemies of our master christ and servants of satan  206 as for the rank or name of the officers in whom the authorities either of teaching or discipline are to be vested they are left undetermined by scripture i have heard it said by men who know their bible far better than i that careful examination may detect evidence of the existence of three orders of clergy in the church this may be but one thing is very clear without any laborious examination that bishop and elder sometimes mean the same thing as indisputably in titus i 5 and 7 and i peter v i and 2 and that the office of the bishop or overseer was one of considerably less importance than it is with us this is palpably evident from i timothy iii for what divine among us writing of episcopal proprieties would think of saying that bishops must not be given to wine must be no strikers and must not be novices we are not in the habit of making bishops of novices in these days and it would be much better that like the early church we sometimes ran the risk of doing so for the fact is we have not bishops enoughby some hundreds the idea of overseership has been practically lost sight of its fulfillment having gradually become physically impossible for want of more bishops the duty of a bishop is without doubt to be accessible to the humblest clergymen of his diocese and to desire very earnestly that all of them should be in the habit of referring to him in all cases of difficulty if they do not do this of their own accord it is evidently his duty to visit them live with them sometimes and join in their ministrations to their flocks so as to know exactly the capacities and habits of life of each and if any of them complained of this or that difficulty with their congregations the bishop should be ready to go down to help them preach for them write general epistles to their people and so on besides this he should of course be watchful of their errorsready to hear complaints from their congregations of inefficiency or aught else besides having general superintendence of all the charitable institutions and schools in his diocese and good knowledge of whatever was going on in theological matters both all over the kingdom and on the continent this is the work of a right overseer and i leave the reader to calculate how many additional bishopsand those hardworking men toowe should need to have it done even decently then our present bishops might all become archbishops with advantage and have general authority over the rest148  207 as to the mode in which the officers of the church should be elected or appointed i do not feel it my business to say anything at present nor much respecting the extent of their authority either over each other or over the congregation this being a most difficult question the right solution of which evidently lies between two most dangerous extremesinsubordination and radicalism on one hand and ecclesiastical tyranny and heresy on the other of the two insubordination is far the least to be dreadedfor this reason that nearly all real christians are more on the watch against their pride than their indolence and would sooner obey their clergyman if possible than contend with him while the very pride they suppose conquered often returns masked and causes them to make a merit of their humility and their abstract obedience however unreasonable but they cannot so easily persuade themselves there is a merit in abstract disobedience  208 ecclesiastical tyranny has for the most part founded itself on the idea of vicarianism one of the most pestilent of the romanist theories and most plainly denounced in scripture of this i have a word or two to say to the modern vicarian all powers that be are unquestionably ordained of god so that they that resist the power resist the ordinance of god therefore say some in these offices we being ordained of god and having our credentials and being in the english bible called ambassadors for god do in a sort represent god we are vicars of christ and stand on earth in place of christ i have heard this said by protestant clergymen  209 now the word ambassador has a peculiar ambiguity about it owing to its use in modern political affairs and these clergymen assume that the word as used by st paul means an ambassador plenipotentiary representative of his king and capable of acting for his king what right have they to assume that st paul meant this st paul never uses the word ambassador at all he says simply we are in embassage from christ and christ beseeches you through us most true and let it further be granted that every word that the clergyman speaks is literally dictated to him by christ that he can make no mistake in delivering his message and that therefore it is indeed christ himself who speaks to us the word of life through the messengers lips does therefore the messenger represent christ does the channel which conveys the waters of the fountain represent the fountain itself suppose when we went to draw water at a cistern that all at once the leaden spout should become animated and open its mouth and say to us see i am vicarious for the fountain whatever respect you show to the fountain show some part of it to me should we not answer the spout and say spout you were set there for our service and may be taken away and thrown aside149 if anything goes wrong with you but the fountain will flow forever  210 observe i do not deny a most solemn authority vested in every christian messenger from god to men i am prepared to grant this to the uttermost and all that george herbert says in the end of the churchporch i would enforce at another time than this to the uttermost but the authority is simply that of a kings messenger not of a kings representative there is a wide difference all the difference between humble service and blasphemous usurpation  well the congregation might ask grant him a kings messenger in cases of doctrinein cases of discipline an officer bearing the kings commission how far are we to obey him how far is it lawful to dispute his commands  for in granting above that the messenger always gave his message faithfully i granted too much to my adversaries in order that their argument might have all the weight it possibly could the messengers rarely deliver their message faithfully and sometimes have declared as from the king messages of their own invention how far are we knowing them for kings messengers to believe or obey them  211 suppose for instance in our english army on the eve of some great battle one of the colonels were to give his order to his regiment my men tie your belts over your eyes throw down your muskets and follow me as steadily as you can through this marsh into the middle of the enemys line this being precisely the order issued by our puseyite church officers it might be questioned in the real battle whether it would be better that a regiment should show an example of insubordination or be cut to pieces but happily in the church there is no such difficulty for the king is always with his army not only with his army but at the right hand of every soldier of it therefore if any of their colonels give them a strange command all they have to do is to ask the king and never yet any christian asked guidance of his king in any difficulty whatsoever without mental reservation or secret resolution but he had it forthwith we conclude then finally that the authority of the clergy is in matters of discipline large being executive first of the written laws of god and secondly of those determined and agreed upon by the body of the church in matters of doctrine dependent on their recommending themselves to every mans conscience both as messengers of god and as themselves men of god perfect and instructed to good works150  212 6 the last subject which we had to investigate was it will be remembered what is usually called the connection of church and state but by our definition of the term church throughout the whole of christendom the church or society of professing christians is the state and our subject is therefore properly speaking the connection of lay and clerical officers of the church that is to say the degrees in which the civil and ecclesiastical governments ought to interfere with or influence each other  it would of course be vain to attempt a formal inquiry into this intricate subjecti have only a few detached points to notice respecting it  213 there are three degrees or kinds of civil government the first and lowest executive merely the government in this sense being simply the national hand and composed of individuals who administer the laws of the nation and execute its established purposes  the second kind of government is deliberative but in its deliberation representative only of the thoughts and will of the people or nation and liable to be deposed the instant it ceases to express those thoughts and that will this whatever its form whether centered in a king or in any number of men is properly to be called democratic the third and highest kind of government is deliberative not as representative of the people but as chosen to take separate counsel for them and having power committed to it to enforce upon them whatever resolution it may adopt whether consistent with their will or not this government is properly to be called monarchical whatever its form  214 i see that politicians and writers of history continually run into hopeless error because they confuse the form of a government with its nature a government may be nominally vested in an individual and yet if that individual be in such fear of those beneath him that he does nothing but what he supposes will be agreeable to them the government is democratic on the other hand the government may be vested in a deliberative assembly of a thousand men all having equal authority and all chosen from the lowest ranks of the people and yet if that assembly act independently of the will of the people and have no fear of them and enforce its determinations upon them the government is monarchical that is to say the assembly acting as one has power over the many while in the case of the weak king the many have power over the one  a monarchical government acting for its own interest instead of the peoples is a tyranny i said the executive government was the hand of the nationthe republican government is in like manner its tongue the monarchical government is its head  all true and right government is monarchical and of the head what is its best form is a totally different question but unless it act for the people and not as representative of the people it is no government at all and one of the grossest blockheadisms of the english in the present day is their idea of sending men to parliament to represent their opinions whereas their only true business is to find out the wisest men among them and send them to parliament to represent their own opinions and act upon them of all puppetshows in the satanic carnival of the earth the most contemptible puppetshow is a parliament with a mob pulling the strings  215 now of these three states of government it is clear that the merely executive can have no proper influence over ecclesiastical affairs but of the other two the first being the voice of the people or voice of the church must have such influence over the clergy as is properly vested in the body of the church the second which stands in the same relation to the people as a father does to his family will have such farther influence over ecclesiastical matters as a father has over the consciences of his adult children no absolute authority therefore to enforce their attendance at any particular place of worship or subscription to any particular creed but indisputable authority to procure for them such religious instruction as he deems fittest151 and to recommend it to them by every means in his power he not only has authority but is under obligation to do this as well as to establish such disciplines and forms of worship in his house as he deems most convenient for his family with which they are indeed at liberty to refuse compliance if such disciplines appear to them clearly opposed to the law of god but not without most solemn conviction of their being so nor without deep sorrow to be compelled to such a course  216 but it may be said the government of a people never does stand to them in the relation of a father to his family if it do not it is no government however grossly it may fail in its duty and however little it may be fitted for its place if it be a government at all it has paternal office and relation to the people i find it written on the one handhonor thy father on the otherhonor the king on the one handwhoso smiteth his father shall be put to death152 on the otherthey that resist shall receive to themselves damnation well but it may be farther argued the clergy are in a still more solemn sense the fathers of the people and the people are their beloved sons why should not therefore the clergy have the power to govern the civil officers  217 for two very clear reasons  in all human institutions certain evils are granted as of necessity and in organizing such institutions we must allow for the consequences of such evils and make arrangements such as may best keep them in check now in both the civil and ecclesiastical governments there will of necessity be a certain number of bad men the wicked civilian has comparatively little interest in overthrowing ecclesiastical authority it is often a useful help to him and presents in itself little which seems covetable but the wicked ecclesiastical officer has much interest in overthrowing the civilian and getting the political power into his own hands as far as wicked men are concerned therefore it is better that the state should have power over the clergy than the clergy over the state  secondly supposing both the civil and ecclesiastical officers to be christians there is no fear that the civil officer should underrate the dignity or shorten the serviceableness of the minister but there is considerable danger that the religious enthusiasm of the minister might diminish the serviceableness of the civilian the history of religious enthusiasm should be written by someone who had a life to give to its investigation it is one of the most melancholy pages in human records and one of the most necessary to be studied therefore as far as good men are concerned it is better the state should have power over the clergy than the clergy over the state  218 this we might it seems to me conclude by unassisted reason but surely the whole question is without any need of human reason decided by the history of israel if ever a body of clergy should have received independent authority the levitical priesthood should for they were indeed a priesthood and more holy than the rest of the nation but aaron is always subject to moses all solemn revelation is made to moses the civil magistrate and he actually commands aaron as to the fulfillment of his priestly office and that in a necessity of life and death go and make an atonement for the people nor is anything more remarkable throughout the whole of the jewish history than the perfect subjection of the priestly to the kingly authority thus solomon thrusts out abiathar from being priest i kings ii 27 and jehoahaz administers the funds of the lords house 2 kings xii 4 though that money was actually the atonement money the hansom for souls exod xxx 12  219 we have however also the beautiful instance of samuel uniting in himself the offices of priest prophet and judge nor do i insist on any special manner of subjection of clergy to civil officers or vice versâ but only on the necessity of their perfect unity and influence upon each other in every christian kingdom those who endeavor to effect the utter separation of ecclesiastical and civil officers are striving on the one hand to expose the clergy to the most grievous and most subtle of temptations from their own spiritual enthusiasm and spiritual pride on the other to deprive the civil officer of all sense of religious responsibility and to introduce the fearful godless conscienceless and soulless policy of the radical and the socalled socialist whereas the ideal of all government is the perfect unity of the two bodies of officers each supporting and correcting the other the clergy having due weight in all the national councils the civil officers having a solemn reverence for god in all their acts the clergy hallowing all worldly policy by their influence and the magistracy repressing all religious enthusiasm by their practical wisdom to separate the two is to endeavor to separate the daily life of the nation from god and to map out the dominion of the soul into two provincesone of atheism the other of enthusiasm these then were the reasons which caused me to speak of the idea of separation of church and state as fatuity for what fatuity can be so great as the not having god in our thoughts and in any act or office of life saying in our hearts there is no god  220 much more i would fain say of these things but not now this only i must emphatically assert in conclusionthat the schism between the socalled evangelical and high church parties in britain is enough to shake many mens faith in the truth or existence of religion at all it seems to me one of the most disgraceful scenes in ecclesiastical history that protestantism should be paralyzed at its very heart by jealousies based on little else than mere difference between high and low breeding for the essential differences in the religious opinions of the two parties are sufficiently marked in two men whom we may take as the highest representatives of eachgeorge herbert and john milton and i do not think there would have been much difficulty in atoning those two if one could have got them together but the real difficulty nowadays lies in the sin and folly of both parties in the superciliousness of the one and the rudeness of the other evidently however the sin lies most at the high church door for the evangelicals are much more ready to act with churchmen than they with the evangelicals and i believe that this state of things cannot continue much longer and that if the church of england does not forthwith unite with herself the entire evangelical body both of england and scotland and take her stand with them against the papacy her hour has struck she cannot any longer serve two masters nor make courtesies alternately to christ and antichrist that she has done this is visible enough by the state of europe at this instant three centuries since lutherthree hundred years of protestant knowledgeand the papacy not yet overthrown christs truth still restrained in narrow dawn to the white cliffs of england and white crests of the alpsthe morning star paused in its course in heaventhe sun and moon stayed with satan for their joshua  221 but how to unite the two great sects of paralyzed protestants by keeping simply to scripture the members of the scottish church have not a shadow of excuse for refusing episcopacy it has indeed been abused among them grievously abused but it is in the bible and that is all they have a right to ask  they have also no shadow of excuse for refusing to employ a written form of prayer it may not be to their tasteit may not be the way in which they like to pray but it is no question at present of likes or dislikes but of duties and the acceptance of such a form on their part would go halfway to reconcile them with their brethren let them allege such objections as they can reasonably advance against the english form and let these be carefully and humbly weighed by the pastors of both churches some of them ought to be at once forestalled for the english church on the other hand must cut the term priest entirely out of her prayerbook and substitute for it that of minister or elder the passages respecting absolution must be thrown out also except the doubtful one in the morning service in which there is no harm and then there would be only the baptismal question left which is one of words rather than of things and might easily be settled in synod turning the refractory clergy out of their offices to go to rome if they chose then when the articles of faith and form of worship had been agreed upon between the english and scottish churches the written forms and articles should be carefully translated into the european languages and offered to the acceptance of the protestant churches on the continent with earnest entreaty that they would receive them and due entertainment of all such objections as they could reasonably allege and thus the whole body of protestants united in one great fold would indeed go in and out and find pasture and the work appointed for them would be done quickly and antichrist overthrown  222 impossible a thousand times impossiblei hear it exclaimed against me nonot impossible christ does not order impossibilities and he has ordered us to be at peace one with another nay it is answeredhe came not to send peace but a sword yes verily to send a sword upon earth but not within his church for to his church he said my peace i leave with you

shown to be used of the congregation by 1 cor iii 16 17  i have not noticed the word greek kyriakê oikia from which the german kirche the english church and the scotch kirk are derived as it is not used with that signification in the new testament  footnote 142 any reference except to scripture in notes of this kind would of course be useless the argument from or with the fathers is not to be

let not the reader be displeased with me for these short and apparently insolent statements of opinion i am not writing insolently but as shortly and clearly as i can and when i seriously believe a thing i say so in a few words leaving the reader to determine what my belief is worth but i do not choose to temper down every expression of personal opinion into courteous generalities and so lose space and time and intelligibility at once we are utterly oppressed in these days by our courtesies and considerations and compliances and proprieties forgive me them this once or rather let us all forgive them to each other and learn to speak plainly first and if it may be gracefully afterwards and not only to speak but to stand by what we have spoken one of my oxford friends heard the other day that i was employed on these notes and forthwith wrote to me in a panic not to put my name to them for fear i should compromise myself i think we are most of us compromised to some extent already when england has sent a roman catholic minister to the second city in italy and remains herself for a week without any government because her chief men cannot agree upon the position which a popish

footnote 146 greek exousia in 1 cor ix 12 2 thess iii 9  footnote 147 carlyle past and present chapter xi can anything be more striking than the repeated warnings of st paul against strife of words

especially in connection with the previous three and 2 timothy ii 14 19 22 23 tracing the connection here also add titus i 10 14 16 noting in works they deny him and titus iii 8 9 affirm constantly that they be careful to maintain good works but avoid foolish questions and finally 1 timothy i 47 a passage which seems to have been especially written for these times  footnote 148 i leave in the main text the abstract question of the fitness of episcopacy unapproached not feeling any call to speak of it at length at present all that i feel necessary to be said is that bishops being granted it is clear that we have too few to do their work but the argument from the practice of the primitive church appears to me to be of enormous weightnor have i ever heard any rational plea alleged against episcopacy except that like other things it is capable of abuse and has sometimes been abused and as altogether clearly and indisputably there is described in the bible an episcopal office distinct from the merely ministerial one and apparently also an episcopal officer attached to each church and distinguished in the revelation as an angel i hold the resistance of the scotch presbyterian church to episcopacy to be unscriptural futile and schismatic  footnote 149 by just judgment be deposed art 26  footnote 150 the difference between the authority of doctrine and discipline is beautifully marked in 2 timothy ii 25 and titus ii 1215 in the first passage the servant of god teaching divine doctrine must not strive but must in meekness instruct those that oppose themselves in the second passage teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts he is to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world the minister is to speak exhort and rebuke with all authorityboth functions being expressed as united in 2 timothy iv 3  footnote 151 observe this and the following conclusions depend entirely on the supposition that the government is part of the body of the church and that some pains have been taken to compose it of religious and wise men if we choose knowingly and deliberately to compose our parliament in great part of infidels and papists gamblers and debtors we may well regret its power over the clerical officer but that we should at any time so compose our parliament is a sign that the clergy themselves have failed in their duty and the church in its watchfulnessthus the evil accumulates in reaction whatever i say of the responsibility or authority of government is therefore to be understood only as sequent on what i have said previously of the necessity of closely circumscribing the church and then composing the civil government out of the circumscribed body thus all papists would at once be rendered incapable of share in it being subjected to the second or most severe degree of excommunicationfirst as idolaters by 1 cor v 10 then as covetous and extortioners selling absolution by the same text and finally as heretics and maintainers of falsehoods by titus iii 10 and 1 tim iv 1  i do not write this hastily nor without earnest consideration both of the difficulty and the consequences of such church discipline but either the bible is a superannuated book and is only to be read as a record of past days or these things follow from it clearly and inevitably that we live in days when the bible has become impracticable is if it be so the very thing i desire to be considered i am not setting down these plans or schemes as at present possible i do not know how far they are possible but it seems to me that god has plainly commanded them and that therefore their impracticability is a thing to be meditated on  footnote 152 exod xxi 15     the lords prayer and the church153  letters   i154    brantwood coniston lancashire   20th june 1879  223 dear mr mallesoni could not at once answer your important letter for though i felt at once the impossibility of my venturing to address such an audience as you proposed i am unwilling to fail in answering to any call relating to matters respecting which my feelings have been long in earnest if in any wise it may be possible for me to be of service therein my healthor want of itnow utterly forbids my engagement in any duty involving excitement or acute intellectual effort but i think before the first tuesday in august i might be able to write one or two letters to yourself referring to and more or less completing some passages already printed in fors and elsewhere which might on your reading any portions you thought available become matter of discussion during the meeting at some leisure time after its own main purposes had been answered  at all events i will think over what i should like and be able to represent to such a meeting and only beg you not to think me insensible of the honor done me by your wish and of the gravity of the trust reposed in me    ever most faithfully yours   j ruskin    the rev f a malleson   ii    brantwood coniston 23rd june 1879

sensible people kindly feeling and knowledge of each others personal characters i have every trust in your kindness and truth nor do i fear being myself misunderstood by you what i may be able to put into written form so as to admit of being laid before your friends in council must be set down without any question of personal feelingas simply as a mathematical question or demonstration  225 the first exact question which it seems to me such an assembly may be earnestly called upon by laymen to solve is surely axiomatic the definition of themselves as a body and of their business as such  namely as clergymen of the church of england do they consider themselves to be so called merely as the attached servants of a particular state do they in their quality of guides hold a position similar to that of the guides of chamouni or grindelwald who being a numbered body of examined and trustworthy persons belonging to those several villages have nevertheless no chamounist or grindelwaldist opinions on the subject of alpine geography or glacier walking but are prepared to put into practice a common and universal science of locality and athletics founded on sure survey and successful practice are the clergymen of the ecclesia of england thus simply the attached and salaried guides of england and the english in the way known of all good men that leadeth unto lifeor are they on the contrary a body of men holding or in any legal manner required or compelled to hold opinions on the subjectsay of the height of the celestial mountains the crevasses which go down quickest to the pit and other cognate points of sciencediffering from or even contrary to the tenets of the guides of the church of france the church of italy and other christian countries  is not this the first of all questions which a clerical council has to answer in open terms    ever affectionately yours   j ruskin   iii    brantwood 6th july  226 my first letter contained a laymans plea for a clear answer to the question what is a clergyman of the church of england supposing the answer to this first to be that the clergy of the church of england are teachers not of the gospel to england but of the gospel to all nations and not of the gospel of luther nor of the gospel of augustine but of the gospel of christthen the laymans second question would be  can this gospel of christ be put into such plain words and short terms as that a plain man may understand itand if so would it not be in a quite primal sense desirable that it should be so rather than left to be gathered out of thirtynine articles written by no means in clear english and referring for further explanation of exactly the most important point in the whole tenor of their teaching156 to a homily of justification157 which is not generally in the possession or even probably within the comprehension of simple persons    ever faithfully yours   j ruskin   iv    brantwood 8th july  227 i am so very glad that you approve of the letter plan as it enables me to build up what i would fain try to say of little stones without lifting too much for my strength at once and the sense of addressing a friend who understands me and sympathizes with me prevents my being brought to a stand by continual need for apology or fear of giving offense  but yet i do not quite see why you should feel my asking for a simple and comprehensible statement of the christian gospel at starting are you not bid to go into all the world and preach it to every creature i should myself think the clergyman most likely to do good who accepted the greek pasê thê ktisei so literally as at least to sympathize with st francis sermon to the birds and to feel that feeding either sheep or fowls or unmuzzling the ox or keeping the wrens alive in the snow would be received by their heavenly feeder as the perfect fulfillment of his feed my sheep in the higher sense158  228 thats all a parenthesis for although i should think that your good company would all agree that kindness to animals was a kind of preaching to them and that hunting and vivisection were a kind of blasphemy to them i want only to put the sterner question before your council how this gospel is to be preached either greek pantachou or to greek panta ta ethnê if first its preachers have not determined quite clearly what it is and might not such definition acceptable to the entire body of the church of christ be arrived at by merely explaining in their completeness and life the terms of the lords prayerthe first words taught to children all over the christian world  i will try to explain what i mean of its several articles in following letters and in answer to the question with which you close your last i can only say that you are at perfect liberty to use any or all or any parts of them as you think good usually when i am asked if letters of mine may be printed i say assuredly provided only that you print them entire but in your hands i withdraw even this condition and trust gladly to your judgment remaining always    faithfully and affectionately yours   j ruskin    the rev f a malleson   v    greek pater hêmon ho en tois ouranois    pater noster qui es in cælis    brantwood 10th july  229 my meaning in saying that the lords prayer might be made a foundation of gospelteaching was not that it contained all that christian ministers have to teach but that it contains what all christians are agreed upon as first to be taught and that no good parishworking pastor in any district of the world but would be glad to take his part in making it clear and living to his congregation  and the first clause of it of course rightly explained gives us the ground of what is surely a mighty part of the gospelits first and great commandment namely that we have a father whom we can love and are required to love and to desire to be with him in heaven wherever that may be  and to declare that we have such a loving father whose mercy is over all his works and whose will and law is so lovely and lovable that it is sweeter than honey and more precious than gold to those who can taste and see that the lord is goodthis surely is a most pleasant and glorious good message and spell to bring to menas distinguished from the evil message and accursed spell that satan has brought to the nations of the world instead of it that they have no father but only a consuming fire ready to devour them unless they are delivered from its raging flame by some scheme of pardon for all for which they are to be thankful not to the father but to the son  supposing this first article of the true gospel agreed to how would the blessing that closes the epistles of that gospel become intelligible and living instead of dark and dead the grace of christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the holy ghostthe most tender word being that used of the father   vi    greek hagiasthêtô to onoma sou    sanctificetur nomen tuum    brantwood 12th july 1879  230 i wonder how many even of those who honestly and attentively join in our church services attach any distinct idea to the second clause of the lords prayer the first petition of it the first thing that they are ordered by christ to seek of their father  am i unjust in thinking that most of them have little more notion on the matter than that god has forbidden bad language and wishes them to pray that everybody may be respectful to him  is it any otherwise with the third commandment do not most look on it merely in the light of the statute of swearing and read the words will not hold him guiltless merely as a passionless intimation that however carelessly a man may let out a round oath there really is something wrong in it  on the other hand can anything be more tremendous than the words themselvesdoublenegatived    greek ou gar mê katharisê  kurios  for other sins there is washingfor this none the seventh verse ex xx in the septuagint marking the real power rather than the english which i suppose is literal to the hebrew  to my laymans mind of practical needs in the present state of the church nothing is so immediate as that of explaining to the congregation the meaning of being gathered in his name and having him in the midst of them as on the other hand of being gathered in blasphemy of his name and having the devil in the midst of thempresiding over the prayers which have become an abomination  231 for the entire body of the texts in the gospel against hypocrisy are one and all nothing but the expansion of the threatening that closes the third commandment for as the name whereby he shall be called is the lord our righteousnessso the taking that name in vain is the sum of the deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish  without dwelling on the possibilitywhich i do not myself however for a moment doubtof an honest clergymans being able actually to prevent the entrance among his congregation of persons leading openly wicked lives could any subject be more vital to the purposes of your meetings than the difference between the present and the probable state of the christian church which would result were it more the effort of zealous parish priests instead of getting wicked poor people to come to church to get wicked rich ones to stay out of it  lest in any discussion of such question it might be as it too often is alleged that the lord looketh upon the heart etc let me be permitted to saywith as much positiveness as may express my deepest convictionthat while indeed it is the lords business to look upon the heart it is the pastors to look upon the hands and the lips and that the foulest oaths of the thief and the streetwalker are in the ears of god sinless as the hawks cry or the gnats murmur compared to the responses in the church service on the lips of the usurer and the adulterer who have destroyed not their own souls only but those of the outcast ones whom they have made their victims  it is for the meeting of clergymen themselvesnot for a layman addressing themto ask further how much the name of god may be taken in vain and profaned instead of hallowedin the pulpit as well as under it    ever affectionately yours   j ruskin   vii    greek elthetô ê basilheia sou    adveniat regnum tuum    brantwood 14th july 1879  232 dear mr mallesonsincere thanks for both your letters and the proofs159 sent your comment and conducting link when needed will be of the greatest help and value i am well assured suggesting what you know will be the probable feeling of your hearers and the point that will come into question  yes certainly that his in the fourth line was meant to imply that eternal presence of christ as in another passage160 referring to the creation when his right hand strewed the snow on lebanon and smoothed the slopes of calvary but in so far as we dwell on that truth hast thou seen me philip and not the father161 we are not teaching the people what is specially the gospel of christ as having a distinct functionnamely to serve the father and do the fathers will and in all his human relations to us and commands to us it is as the son of man not as the power of god and wisdom of god that he acts and speaks not as the power for he must pray like one of us not as the wisdom for he must not know if it be possible his prayer should be heard  233 and in what i want to say of the third clause of his prayer his not merely as his ordering but his using it is especially this comparison between his kingdom and his fathers that i want to see the disciples guarded against i believe very few even of the most earnest using that petition realize that it is the fathersnot the sonskingdom that they pray may comealthough the whole prayer is foundational on that fact for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory and i fancy that the mind of the most faithful christian is quite led away from its proper hope by dwelling on the reignor the coming againof christ which indeed they are to look for and watch for but not to pray for their prayer is to be for the greater kingdom to which he risen and having all his enemies under his feet is to surrender his that god may be all in all  and though the greatest it is that everlasting kingdom which the poorest of us can advance we cannot hasten christs coming of the day and hour knoweth none but the kingdom of god is as a grain of mustard seedwe can sow of it it is as a foamglobe of leavenwe can mingle it and its glory and its joy are that even the birds of the air can lodge in the branches thereof  forgive me for getting back to my sparrows but truly in the present state of england the fowls of the air are the only creatures tormented and murdered as they are that yet have here and there nests and peace and joy in the holy ghost and it would be well if many of us in reading that text the kingdom of god is not meat and drink had even got so far as to the understanding that it was at least as much and that until we had fed the hungry there was no power in us to inspire the unhappy    ever affectionately yours   j ruskin  i will write my feeling about the pieces of the life of christ you have sent me in a private letter i may say at once that i am sure it will do much good and will be upright and intelligible which how few religious writings are   viii    greek genêthêtô to thelêma sou hôs en ouranô kaì epì gês    fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo et in terra    brantwood 9th august 1879  234 i was reading the second chapter of malachi this morning by chance and wondering how many clergymen ever read it and took to heart the commandment for them  for they are always ready enough to call themselves priests though they know themselves to be nothing of the sort whenever there is any dignity to be got out of the title but whenever there is any good hot scolding or unpleasant advice given them by the prophets in that selfassumed character of theirs they are as ready to quit it as ever dionysus his lionskin when he finds the character of herakles inconvenient ye have wearied the lord with your words yes and some of his people too in your time yet ye say wherein have we wearied him when ye say everyone that doeth evil is good in the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the god of judgment  how many again and again i wonder of the lively young ecclesiastics supplied to the increasing demand of our westends of flourishing cities of the plain ever consider what sort of sin it is for which god unless they lay it to heart will curse their blessings and spread dung upon their faces or have understood even in the dimmest manner what part they had taken and were taking in corrupting the covenant of the lord with levi and causing many to stumble at the law  235 perhaps the most subtle and unconscious way which the religious teachers upon whom the ends of the world are come have done this is in never telling their people the meaning of the clause in the lords prayer which of all others their most earnest hearers have oftenest on their lips thy will be done they allow their people to use it as if their fathers will were always to kill their babies or do something unpleasant to them instead of explaining to them that the first and intensest article of their fathers will was their own sanctification and following comfort and wealth and that the one only path to national prosperity and to domestic peace was to understand what the will of the lord was and to do all they could to get it done whereas one would think by the tone of the eagerest preachers nowadays that they held their blessed office to be that not of showing men how to do their fathers will on earth but how to get to heaven without doing any of it either here or there  236 i say especially the most eager preachers for nearly the whole missionary body with the hottest evangelistic sect of the english church is at this moment composed of men who think the gospel they are to carry to mend the world with forsooth is that if any man sin he hath an advocate with the father while i have never yet in my own experience met either with a missionary or a town bishop who so much as professed himself to understand what the will of the lord was far less to teach anybody else to do it and for fifty preachers yes and fifty hundreds whom i have heard proclaiming the mediator of the new testament that they which were called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance i have never yet heard so much as one heartily proclaiming against all those deceivers with vain words eph v 6 that no covetous person which is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ or of god and on myself personally and publicly challenging the bishops of england generally and by name the bishop of manchester to say whether usury was or was not according to the will of god i have received no answer from any one of them162    13th august  237 i have allowed myself in the beginning of this letter to dwell on the equivocal use of the word priest in the english church see christopher harvey grosarts edition p 38 because the assumption of the mediatorial in defect of the pastoral office by the clergy fulfill itself naturally and always in their pretending to absolve the sinner from his punishment instead of purging him from his sin and practically in their general patronage and encouragement of all the iniquity of the world by steadily preaching away the penalties of it so that the great cities of the earth which ought to be the places set on its hills with the temple of the lord in the midst of them to which the tribes should go up163centers to the kingdoms and provinces of honor virtue and the knowledge of the law of godhave become instead loathsome centers of fornication and covetousnessthe smoke of their sin going up into the face of heaven like the furnace of sodom and the pollution of it rotting and raging through the bones and the souls of the peasant people round them as if they were each a volcano whose ashes broke out in blains upon man and upon beast164  and in the midst of them their freshlysettip steeples ring the crowd to a weekly prayer that the rest of their lives may be pure and holy while they have not the slightest intention of purifying sanctifying or changing their lives in any the smallest particular and their clergy gather each into himself the curious dual power and janusfaced majesty in mischief of the prophet that prophesies falsely and the priest that bears rule by his means  and the people love to have it so     brantwood 12th august  i am very glad of your little note from brighton i thought it needless to send the two letters there which you will find at home and they pretty nearly end all i want to say for the remaining clauses of the prayer touch on things too high for me but i will send you one concluding letter about them   ix    greek ton arton êmôn ton epiousion dos hêmin sêmeron    panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie    brantwood 19th august  238 i retained the foregoing letter by me till now lest you should think it written in any haste or petulance but it is every word of it deliberate though expressing the bitterness of twenty years of vain sorrow and pleading concerning these things nor am i able to write otherwise anything of the next following clause of the prayerfor no words could be burning enough to tell the evils which have come on the world from mens using it thoughtlessly and blasphemously praying god to give them what they are deliberately resolved to steal for all true christianity is knownas its master wasin breaking of bread and all false christianity in stealing it  let the clergyman only applywith impartial and level sweepto his congregation the great pastoral order the man that will not work neither should he eat and be resolute in requiring each member of his flock to tell him whatday by daythey do to earn their dinnersand he will find an entirely new view of life and its sacraments open upon him and them  239 for the man who is notday by daydoing work which will earn his dinner must be stealing his dinner165 and the actual fact is that the great mass of men calling themselves christians do actually live by robbing the poor of their bread and by no other trade whatsoever and the simple examination of the mode of the produce and consumption of european foodwho digs for it and who eats itwill prove that to any honest human soul  nor is it possible for any christian church to exist but in pollutions and hypocrisies beyond all words until the virtues of a life moderate in its selfindulgence and wide in its offices of temporal ministry to the poor are insisted on as the normal conditions in which only the prayer to god for the harvest of the earth is other than blasphemy  in the second place since in the parable in luke the bread asked for is shown to be also and chiefly the holy spirit luke xi 13 and the prayer give us each day our daily bread is in its fullness the disciples lord evermore give us this breadthe clergymans question to his whole flock primarily literal children have ye here any meat must ultimately be always the greater spiritual one children have ye here any holy spirit or have ye not heard yet whether there be any and instead of a holy ghost the lord and giver of life do you only believe in an unholy mammon lord and giver of death  the opposition between the two lords has been and will be as long as the world lasts absolute irreconcilable mortal and the clergymans

aphiemen   tois opheiletais hêmôn    et dimitte nobis debita nostra sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus   nostris    brantwood 3rd september  240 dear mr mallesoni have been very long before trying to say so much as a word about the sixth clause of the pater for whenever i began thinking of it i was stopped by the sorrowful sense of the hopeless task you poor clergymen had nowadays in recommending and teaching people to love their enemies when their whole energies were already devoted to swindling their friends  but in any days past or now the clause is one of such difficulty that to understand it means almost to know the love of god which passeth knowledge  but at all events it is surely the pastors duty to prevent his flock from misunderstanding it and above all things to keep them from supposing that gods forgiveness is to be had simply for the asking by those who willfully sin after they have received the knowledge of the truth  241 there is one very simple lesson also needed especially by people in circumstances of happy life which i have never heard fully enforced from the pulpit and which is usually the more lost sight of because the fine and inaccurate word trespasses is so often used instead of the single and accurate one debts among people well educated and happily circumstanced it may easily chance that long periods of their lives pass without any such conscious sin as could on any discovery or memory of it make them cry out in truth and in paini have sinned against the lord but scarcely an hour of their happy days can pass over them without leavingwere their hearts opensome evidence written there that they have left undone the things that they ought to have done and giving them bitterer and heavier cause to cry and cry againforever in the pure words of their masters prayer dimitte nobis debita nostra  in connection with the more accurate translation of debts rather than trespasses166 it would surely be well to keep constantly in the mind of complacent and inoffensive congregations that in christs own prophecy of the manner of the last judgment the condemnation is pronounced only on the sins of omission i was hungry and ye gave me no meat  242 but whatever the manner of sin by offense or defect which the preacher fears in his people surely he has of late been wholly remiss in compelling their definite recognition of it in its several and personal particulars nothing in the various inconsistency of human nature is more grotesque than its willingness to be taxed with any quantity of sins in the gross and its resentment at the insinuation of having committed the smallest parcel of them in detail and the english liturgy evidently drawn up with the amiable intention of making religion as pleasant as possible to a people desirous of saving their souls with no great degree of personal inconvenience is perhaps in no point more unwholesomely lenient than in its concession to the popular conviction that we may obtain the present advantage and escape the future punishment of any sort of iniquity by dexterously concealing the manner of it from man and triumphantly confessing the quantity of it to god  243 finally whatever the advantages and decencies of a form of prayer and how wide soever the scope given to its collected passages it cannot be at one and the same time fitted for the use of a body of welltaught and experienced christians such as should join the services of a church nineteen centuries oldand adapted to the needs of the timid sinner who has that day first entered its porch or of the remorseful publican who has only recently become sensible of his call to a pew  and surely our clergy need not be surprised at the daily increasing distrust in the public mind of the efficacy of prayer after having so long insisted on their offering supplication at least every sunday morning at eleven oclock that the rest of their lives hereafter might be pure and holy leaving them conscious all the while that they would be similarly required to inform the lord next week at the same hour that there was no health in them  among the muchrebuked follies and abuses of socalled ritualism none that i have heard of are indeed so dangerously and darkly ritual as this piece of authorized mockery of the most solemn act of human life and only entrance of eternal liferepentance  believe me dear mr malleson

words in your last letter referring to the difference between yourself and me in the degree of hope with which you could regard what could not but appear to the general mind utopian in designs for the action of the christian church surely might best be answered by appeal to the consistent tone of the prayer we have been examining  is not every one of its petitions for a perfect state and is not this last clause of it of which we are to think todayif fully understooda petition not only for the restoration of paradise but of paradise in which there shall be no deadly fruit or at least no tempter to praise it and may we not admit that it is probably only for want of the earnest use of this last petition that not only the preceding ones have become formal with us but that the private and simply restricted prayer for the little things we each severally desire has become by some christians dreaded and unused and by others used faithlessly and therefore with disappointment  245 and is it not for want of this special directness and simplicity of petition and of the sense of its acceptance that the whole nature of prayer has been doubted in our hearts and disgraced by our lips that we are afraid to ask gods blessing on the earth when the scientific people tell us he has made previous arrangements to curse it and that instead of obeying without fear or debate the plain order ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full we sorrowfully sink back into the apology for prayer that it is a wholesome exercise even when fruitless and that we ought piously always to suppose that the text really means no more than ask and ye shall not receive that your joy may be empty  supposing we were first all of us quite sure that we had prayed honestly the prayer against temptation and that we would thankfully be refused anything we had set our hearts upon if indeed god saw that it would lead us into evil might we not have confidence afterwards that he in whose hand the kings heart is as the rivers of water would turn our tiny little hearts also in the way that they should go and that then the special prayer for the joys he taught them to seek would be answered to the last syllable and to overflowing  246 it is surely scarcely necessary to say farther what the holy teachers of all nations have invariably concurred in showingthat faithful prayer implies always correlative exertion and that no man can ask honestly or hopefully to be delivered from temptation unless he has himself honestly and firmly determined to do the best he can to keep out of it but in modern days the first aim of all christian parents is to place their children in circumstances where the temptations which they are apt to call opportunities may be as great and as many as possible where the sight and promise of all these things in satans gift may be brilliantly near and where the act of falling down to worship me may be partly concealed by the shelter and partly excused as involuntary by the pressure of the concurrent crowd  in what respect the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them differ from the kingdom the power and the glory which are gods forever is seldom as far as i have heard intelligibly explained from the pulpit and still less the irreconcilable hostility between the two royalties and realms asserted in its sternness of decision  whether it be indeed utopian to believe that the kingdom we are taught to pray for may comeverily comefor the asking it is surely not for man to judge but it is at least at his choice to resolve that he will no longer render obedience nor ascribe glory and power to the devil if he cannot find strength in himself to advance towards heaven he may at least say to the power of hell get thee behind me and staying himself on the testimony of him who saith surely i come quickly ratify his happy prayer with the faithful amen even so come lord jesus    ever my dear friend   believe me affectionately and gratefully yours   j ruskin  notethe following further letters from mr ruskin to mr malleson were printed in letters to the clergy    sept 13th  247 dear mr mallesoni am so very grateful for your proposal to edit the letters without any further reference to me i think that will be exactly the right way and i believe i can put you at real ease in the doing of it by explaining as i can in very few words the kind of carte blanche i should rejoicingly give you  interrupted today more tomorrow with i hope the last letter    j ruskin    14th sept  ive nearly done the last letter but will keep it till tomorrow rather than finish hurriedly for the first post your nice little note has just come and i can only say that you cannot please me better than by acting with perfect freedom in all ways and that i only want to see or reply to what you wish me for the matters sake and surely there is no occasion for any thought or waste of type about me personally except only to express your knowledge of my real desire for the health and power of the church more than this praise you must not give me for i have learned almost everything i may say that i know by my errors    i am affectionately yours   j ruskin    17th oct  248 i am thankful to see that the letters read clearly and easily and contain all that was in my mind to get said and nothing can possibly be more right in every way than the

to read the sheets as they are issued and put merely letters of reference to be taken up in a short epilogue but i dont want to do or say anything more till you have all in perfect readiness for publication i should merely add my reference letters in the margin and the shortest possible notes at the end    j ruskin   footnotes  footnote 153 these letters were written by mr ruskin to the rev f a malleson vicar of broughtoninfurness by whom they were read after a few introductory remarks before the furness clerical society they originated as may be gathered from the first of them in a request by mr malleson that mr ruskin would address the society on the subject they have been printed in three forms1 in a small pamphlet october 1879 for private circulation only among the members of the furness and one or two other clerical societies 2 in the contemporary review of december 1879 3 in a volume strahan  co 1880 entitled the lords prayer and the church and containing also various replies to mr ruskins letters and an epilogue by way of rejoinder by mr ruskin himself this volume was edited by mr malleson with whose concurrence mr ruskins contributions to it are reprinted hereed

subject during a mountain walkf a m  footnote 156 art xi  footnote 157 homily xi of the second table  footnote 158 arrows of the chace  footnote 159 see postscript to this lettered  footnote 160 referring to the closing sentence of the third paragraph of the fifth ter which seemed to express what i felt could not be mr ruskins full meaning i pointed out to him the following sentence in modern painters  when in the desert jesus was girding himself for the work of life angels of life came and ministered unto him now in the fair world when he is girding himself for the work of death the ministrants come to him from the grave but from the grave conquered one from the tomb under abarim which his own hand had sealed long ago the other from the rest which he had entered without seeing corruption  on this i made a remark somewhat to the following effect that i felt sure mr ruskin regarded the loving work of the father and of the son to be equal in the forgiveness of sins and redemption of mankind that what is done by the father is in reality done also by the son and that it is by a mere accommodation to human infirmity of understanding that the doctrine of the trinity is revealed to us in language inadequate indeed to convey divine truths but still the only language possible and i asked whether some such feeling was not present in his mind when he used the pronoun his in the above passage from modern painters of the son where it would be usually understood of the father and as a corollary whether in the letter he does not himself fully recognize the fact of the redemption of the world by the loving selfsacrifice of the son in entire concurrence with the equally loving will of the father this as well as i can recollect is the origin of the passage in the

you send and can do no more than glance even if it seemed to me desirable that i should do morewhich after said glance it does in no wise let me remind you of what it is absolutely necessary that the readers of the book should clearly understandthat i wrote these letters at your request to be read and discussed at the meeting of a private society of clergymen i declined then to be present at the discussion and i decline still you afterwards asked leave to print the letters to which i replied that they were yours for whatever use you saw good to make of them afterwards your plans expanded while my own notion remained precisely what it had beenthat the discussion should have been private and kept within the limits of the society and that its conclusions if any should have been announced in a few pages of clear print for the parishioners exclusive reading  i am of course flattered by the wider course you have obtained for the letters but am not in the slightest degree interested by the debate upon them nor by any religious debates whatever undertaken without serious conviction that there is a jot wrong in matters as they are or serious resolution to make them a tittle better which so far as i can read the minds of your correspondents appears to me the substantial state of them169  250 one thing i cannot pass without protestthe quantity of talk about the writer of the letters what i am or am not is of no moment whatever to the matters in hand i observe with comfort or at least with complacency that on the strength of a couple of hours talk at a time when i was thinking chiefly of the weatherings of slate you were good enough to show me above goats water you would have ventured to baptize me in the little lakeas not a goat but a sheep the best i can be sure of myself is that i am no wolf and have never aspired to the dignity even of a dog of the lord  you told me if i remember rightly that one of the members of the original meeting denounced me as an archheretic170meaning doubtless an archpagan for a heretic or sectmaker is of all terms of reproach the last that can be used of me and i think he should have been answered that it was precisely as an archpagan that i ventured to request a more intelligible and more unanimous account of the christian gospel from its preachers  251 if anything in the letters offended those of you who hold me a brother surely it had been best to tell me between ourselves or to tell it to the church or to let me be anathema maranatha in peacein any case i must at present so abide correcting only the mistakes about myself which have led to graver ones about the things i wanted to speak of171  the most singular one perhaps in all the letters is that of mr wanstalls that i do not attach enough weight to antiquity i have only come upon the sentence today 29th may but my reply to it is partly written already with reference to the wishes of some other of your correspondents to know more of my reasons for finding fault with the english liturgy  252 if people are taught to use the liturgy rightly and reverently it will bring them all good and for some thirty years of my life i used to read it always through to my servant and myself if we had no protestant church to go to in alpine or italian villages one can always tacitly pray of it what one wants and let the rest pass but as i have grown older and watched the decline in the christian faith of all nations i have got more and more suspicious of the effect of this particular form of words on the truthfulness of the english mind now fast becoming a salt which has lost his savor and is fit only to be trodden underfoot of men and during the last ten years in which my position at oxford has compelled me to examine what authority there was for the code of prayer of which the university is now so ashamed that it no more dares compel its youths so much as to hear much less to utter it i got necessarily into the habit of always looking to the original forms of the prayers of the fully developed christian church nor did i think it a mere chance which placed in my own possession a manuscript of the perfect church service of the thirteenth century written by the monks of the sainte chapelle for st louis together with one of the same date written in england probably for the diocese of lincoln adding some of the collects in which it corresponds with st louiss and the latin hymns so much beloved by dante with the appointed music for them  253 and my wonder has been greater every hour since i examined closely the text of these and other early books that in any state of declining or captive energy the church of england should have contented itself with a service which cast out from beginning to end all these intensely spiritual and passionate utterances of chanted prayer the whole body that is to say of the authentic christian psalms and in adopting what it timidly preserved of the collects mangled or blunted them down to the exact degree which would make them either unintelligible or inoffensiveso vague that everybody might use them or so pointless that nobody could be offended by them for a special instance the prayer for our bishops and curates and all congregations committed to their charge is in the lincoln servicebook for our bishop and all congregations committed to his charge the change from singular to plural seems a slight one but it suffices to take the eyes of the people off their own bishop into infinite space to change a prayer which was intended to be uttered in personal anxiety and affection into one for the general good of the church of which nobody could judge and for which nobody would particularly care and finally to change a prayer to which the answer if given would be visible into one of which nobody could tell whether it were answered or not  254 in the collects the change though verbally slight is thus tremendous in issue but in the litanyword and thought go all wild together the first prayer of the litany in the lincoln servicebook is for the pope and all ranks beneath him implying a very noteworthy piece of theologythat the pope might err in religious matters and that the prayer of the humblest servant of god would be useful to himut dompnum apostolicum et omnes gradus ecclesie in sancta religione conservare digneris meaning that whatever errors particular persons might and must fall into they prayed god to keep the pope right and the collective testimony and conduct of the ranks below him then follows the prayer for their own bishop and his flockthen for the king and the princes chief lords that they not all nations might be kept in concordand then for our bishops and abbotsthe church of england proper every one of these petitions being direct limited and personally heartfeltand then this lovely one for themselves  ut obsequium servitutis nostre rationabile faciasthat thou wouldst make the obedience of our service reasonable which is your reasonable service  this glorious prayer is i believe accurately an early english one it is not in the st louis litany nor in a later elaborate french fourteenth century one but i find it softened in an italian ms of the fifteenth century into ut nosmet ipsos in tuo sancto servitio confortare et conservare digneristhat thou wouldst deign to keep and comfort us ourselves in thy sacred service the comfort observe being here asked for whether reasonable or not and in the best and fullest french servicebook i have printed at rouen in 1520 it becomes ut congregationes omnium sanctorum in tuo sancto servitio conservare digneris while victory as well as concord is asked for the king and the princesthus leading the way to that for our own queens victory over all her enemies a prayer which might now be advisedly altered into one that sheand in her the monarchy of englandmight find more fidelity in their friends  255 i give one more example of the corruption of our prayerbook with reference to the objections taken by some of your correspondents to the distinction implied in my letters between the persons of the father and the christ  the memoria de sancta trinitate in the st louis servicebook runs thus  omnipotens sempiterne deus qui dedisti famulis tuis in confessione vere fidei eterne trinitatis gloriam agnoscere et in potentia majestatis adorare unitatem quesumus ut ejus fidei firmitate ab omnibus semper muniemur adversis qui vivis et regnas deus per omnia secula seculorum amen  almighty and everlasting god who has given to thy servants in confession of true faith to recognize the glory of the eternal trinity and in the power of majesty to pray to the unity we ask that by the firmness of that faith we may be always defended from all adverse things who livest and reignest god through all ages amen  256 turning to our collect we find we have first slipped in the word us before thy servants and by that little insertion have slipped in the squire and his jockey and the publichouse landlordand anyone else who may chance to have been coaxed swept or threatened into church on trinity sunday and required the entire company of them to profess themselves servants of god and believers in the mystery of the trinity and we think we have done god a service  grace not a word about grace in the original you dont believe by having grace but by having wit  to acknowledge agnosco is to recognize not to acknowledge to see that there are three lights in a chandelier is a great deal more than to acknowledge that they are there  to worship adorare is to pray to not to worship you may worship a mere magistrate but you pray to the father son and holy ghost  the last sentence in the english is too horribly mutilated to be dealt with in any patience the meaning of the great old collect is that by the shield of that faith we may quench all the fiery darts of the devil the english prayer means if it means anything please keep us in our faith without our taking any trouble and besides please dont let us lose our money nor catch cold  who livest and reignest right but how many of any extant or instant congregations understand what the two words mean that god is a living god not a dead law and that he is a reigning god putting wrong things to rights and that sooner or later with a strong hand and a rod of iron and not at all with a soft sponge and warm water washing everybody as clean as a baby every sunday morning whatever dirty work they may have been about all the week  257 on which latter supposition your modern liturgy in so far as it has supplemented instead of corrected the old one has entirely modeled itselfproducing in its first address to the congregation before the almighty precisely the faultfulest and foolishest piece of english language that i know in the whole compass of english or american literature in the seventeen lines of it as printed in my oldfashioned largeprint prayerbook there are seven times over two words for one idea    1 acknowledge and confess    2 sins and wickedness    3 dissemble nor cloke    4 goodness and mercy    5 assemble and meet    6 requisite and necessary    7 pray and beseech  there is indeed a shade of difference in some of these ideas for a good scholar none for a general congregation172 and what difference they can guess at merely muddles their heads to acknowledge sin is indeed different from confessing it but it cannot be done at a minutes notice and goodness is a different thing from mercy but it is by no means gods infinite goodness that forgives our badness but that judges it  258 the faultfulest i said and the foolishest after using fourteen words where seven would have done what is it that the whole speech gets said with its much speaking this morning service of all england begins with the assertion that the scripture moveth us in sundry places to confess our sins before god does it so have your congregations ever been referred to those sundry places or do they take the assertion on trust or remain under the impression that unless with the advantage of their own candor god must remain illinformed on the subject of their sins  that we should not dissemble nor cloke them can we then are these grownup congregations of the enlightened english church in the nineteenth century still so young in their nurseries that the thou god seest me is still not believed by them if they get under the bed  259 let us look up the sundry moving passages referred to  i suppose myself a simple lamb of the flock and only able to use my english bible  i find in my concordance confess and confession together fortytwo occurrences of the word sixteen of these including johns confession that he was not the christ and the confession of the faithful fathers that they were pilgrims on the earth do indeed move us strongly to confess christ before men have you ever taught your congregations what that confession means they are ready enough to confess him in church that is to say in their own private synagogue will they in parliament will they in a ballroom will they in a shop sixteen of the texts are to enforce their doing that  the most important one 1 tim vi 13 refers to christs own good confession which i suppose was not of his sins but of his obedience how many of your congregations can make any such kind of confession or wish to make it  the eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth 1 kings viii 33 2 chron vi 26 heb xiii 15 speak of confessing thankfully that god is god and not a putrid plasma nor a theory of development and the twentyfirst job xl 14 speaks of gods own confession that no doubt we are the people and that wisdom shall die with us and on what conditions he will make it  260 there remains twentyone texts which do speak of the confession of our sinsvery moving ones indeedand heaven grant that some day the british public may be moved by them  1 the first is lev v 5 he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing and if you can get any soul of your congregation to say he has sinned in anything he may do it in two words for one if he likes and it will yet be good liturgy  2 the second is indeed generallev xvi 21 the command that the whole nation should afflict its soul on the great day of atonement once a year the church of england i believe enjoins no such unpleasant ceremony her festivals are passed by her people often indeed in the extinction of their souls but by no means in their intentional affliction  3 4 5 the third fourth and fifth lev xxvi 40 numb v 7 nehem i 6 refer all to national humiliation for definite idolatry accompanied with an entire abandonment of that idolatry and of idolatrous persons how soon that form of confession is likely to find a place in the english congregations the defenses of their main idol mammon in the vilest and cruelest shape of itusurywith which this book has been defiled show very sufficiently  261 6 the sixth is psalm xxxii 5virtually the whole of that psalm which does indeed entirely refer to the greater confession once for all opening the heart to god which can be by no means done fiftytwo times a year and which once done puts men into a state in which they will never again say there is no health in them nor that their hearts are desperately wicked but will obey forever the instantly following order rejoice in the lord ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are true of heart  7 the seventh acts xxiv 14 is the one confession in which i can myself shareafter the way which they call heresy so worship i the lord god of my fathers  8 the eighth james v 16 tells us to confess our faultsnot to god but one to anothera practice not favored by english catechumensby the way what do you all mean by auricular confessionconfession that can be heard and is the protestant pleasanter form one that cant be  9 the ninth is that passage of st john i 9 the favorite evangelical text which is read and preached by thousands of false preachers every day without once going on to read its great companion beloved if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things but if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god make your people understand the second text and they will understand the first at present you leave them understanding neither  262 and the entire body of the remaining texts is summed in joshua vii 19 and ezra x 11 in which whether it be achan with his babylonish garment or the people of israel with their babylonish lusts the meaning of confession is simply what it is to every brave boy girl man and woman who knows the meaning of the word honor before god or mannamely to say what they have done wrong and to take the punishment of it not to get it blanched over by any means and to do it no morewhich is so far from being a tone of mind generally enforced either by the english or any other extant liturgy that though all my maids are exceedingly pious and insist on the privilege of going to church as a quite inviolable one i think it a scarcely to be hoped for crown and consummation of virtue in them that they should tell me when they have broken a plate and i should expect to be met only with looks of indignation and astonishment if i ventured to ask one of them how she had spent her sunday afternoon  without courage said sir walter scott there is no truth and without truth there is no virtue the sentence would have been itself more true if sir walter had written candor for truth for it is possible to be true in insolence or true in cruelty but in looking back from the ridges of the hill difficulty in my own past life and in all the vision that has been given me of the wanderings in the ways of othersthis of all principles has become to me surestthat the first virtue to be required of man is frankness of heart and lip and i believe that every youth of sense and honor putting himself to faithful question would feel that he had the devil for confessor if he had not his father or his friend  263 that a clergyman should ever be so truly the friend of his parishioners as to deserve their confidence from childhood upwards may be flouted as a sentimental ideal but he is assuredly only their enemy in showing his lutheran detestation of the sale of indulgences by broadcasting these gratis from his pulpit  the inconvenience and unpleasantness of a catechism concerning itself with the personal practice as well as the general theory of duty are indeed perfectly conceivable by me yet i am not convinced that such manner of catechism would therefore be less medicinal and during the past ten years it has often been matter of amazed thought with me while our president at corpus read prayers to the chapel benches what might by this time have been the effect on the learning as well as the creed of the university if forty years ago our stern old dean gaisford of the house of christ instead of sending us to chapel as to the house of correction when we missed a lecture had inquired before he allowed us to come to chapel at all whether we were gamblers harlotmongers or in concealed and selfish debt  264 i observe with extreme surprise in the preceding letters the unconsciousness of some of your correspondents that there ever was such a thing as discipline in the christian church indeed the last wholesome instance of it i can remember was when my own greatgreat uncle maitland lifted lady  from his altarrails and led her back to her seat before the congregation when she offered to take the sacrament being at enmity with her son173 but i believe a few hours honestly spent by any clergyman on his church history would show him that the churchs confidence in her prayer has been always exactly proportionate to the strictness of her discipline that her present fright at being caught praying by a chemist or an electrician results mainly from her having allowed her twos and threes gathered in the name of christ to become sixes and sevens gathered in the name of belial and that therefore her now needfulest duty is to explain to her stammering votaries extremely doubtful as they are of the effect of their supplications either on politics or the weather that although elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he had them better under command and that while the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the formal and lukewarm one of an iniquitous man availethmuch the other way  such an instruction coupled with due explanation of the nature of righteousness and iniquity directed mainly to those who have the power of both in their own hands being makers of law and holders of property would without any further debate bring about a very singular change in the position and respectability of english clergymen  265 how far they may at present be considered as merely the squires left hand bound to know nothing of what he is doing with his right it is for their own consciences to determine  for instance a friend wrote to me the other day will you not come here you will see a noble duke destroying a village as old as the conquest and driving out dozens of families whose names are in domesday book because owing to the neglect of his ancestors and rackrenting for a hundred years the place has fallen out of repair and the people are poor and may become paupers a local paper ventured to tell the truth the dukes agent called on the editor and threatened him with destruction if he did not hold his tongue the noble duke doubtless has proper protestant horror of auricular confession but suppose instead of the local editor the local parson had ventured to tell the truth from his pulpit and even to intimate to his grace that he might no longer receive the body and blood of the lord at the altar of that parish the parson would scarcelyin these dayshave been therefore made bonfire of and had a pretty martyrs memorial by mr scotts pupils but he would have lighted a goodly light nevertheless in this england of ours whose pettifogging piety has now neither the courage to deny a dukes grace in its church nor to declare christs in its parliament  266 lastly several of your contributors i observe have rashly dipped their feet in the brim of the water of that raging question of usury and i cannot but express my extreme regret that you should yourself have yielded to the temptation of expressing opinions which you have had no leisure either to sound or to test my assertion however that the rich lived mainly by robbing the poor referred not to usury but to rent and the facts respecting both these methods of extortion are perfectly and indubitably ascertainable by any person who himself wishes to ascertain them and is able to take the necessary time and pains i see no sign throughout the whole of these letters of any wish whatever on the part of one of their writers to ascertain the facts but only to defend practices which they hold to be convenient in the world and are afraid to blame in their congregations of the presumption with which several of the writers utter their notions on the subject i do not think it would be right to speak farther in an epilogue to which there is no reply in the terms which otherwise would have been deserved in their bearing on other topics let me earnestly thank you so far as my own feelings may be permitted voice in the matter for the attention with which you have examined and the courage with which you have ratified or at least endured letters which could not but bear at first the aspect of being written in a hostilesometimes even in a mocking spirit that aspect is untrue nor am i answerable for it the things of which i had to speak could not be shortly described but in terms which might sound satirical for all error if frankly shown is precisely most ridiculous when it is most dangerous and i have written no word which is not chosen as the exactest for its occasion whether it move sigh or smile in my earlier days i wrote much with the desire to please and the hope of influencing the reader as i grow older and older i recognize the truth of the preachers saying desire shall fail and the mourners go about the streets and i content myself with saying to whoso it may concern that the thing is verily thus whether they will hear or whether they will forbear no man more than i has ever loved the places where gods honor dwells or yielded truer allegiance to the teaching of his evident servants no man at this time grieves more for the danger of the church which supposes him her enemy while she whispers procrastinating pax vobiscum in answer to the spurious kiss of those who would fain toll curfew over the last fires of english faith and watch the sparrow find nest where she may lay her young around the altars of the lord    ever affectionately yours   j ruskin   footnotes  footnote 169 the following extracts from letters of mr ruskin

years ago a wealthy gentleman farmer was rebuked by the kirk session of the dissenting church to which he belonged for infidelity to his wife  at the scottish halfyearly communion the ceremony of fencing the tables used to be observed that is turning away all those whose lives were supposed to have made them unfit to receive the sacrament     the nature and authority of miracle174   267 every age of the world has its own special sins and special simplicities and among our own most particular humors in both kinds must be reckoned the tendency to parade our discoveries of the laws of nature as if nobody had ever heard of a law of nature before  the most curious result of this extremely absurd condition of mind is perhaps the alarm of religious persons on subjects of which one would have fancied most of the palpable difficulties had been settled before the nineteenth century the theory of prayer for instance and of miracles i noticed a lengthy discussion in the newspapers a month or two ago on the propriety of praying for or against rain it had suddenly it seems occurred to the public mind and to that of the gentlemen who write the theology of the breakfasttable that rain was owing to natural causes and that it must be unreasonable to expect god to supply on our immediate demand what could not be provided but by previous evaporation i noticed farther that this alarming difficulty was at least softened to some of our metropolitan congregations by the assurances of their ministers that although since the last lecture by professor tyndall at the royal institution it had become impossible to think of asking god for any temporal blessing they might still hope their applications for spiritual advantages would occasionally be successfulthus implying that though material processes were necessarily slow and the laws of heaven respecting matter inviolable mental processes might be instantaneous and mental laws at any moment disregarded by their institutor so that the spirit of a man might be brought to maturity in a moment though the resources of omnipotence would be overtaxed or its consistency abandoned in the endeavor to produce the same result on a greengage  more logically though not more wisely other divines have asserted that prayer is medicinally beneficial to ourselves whether we obtain what we ask for or not and that our moral state is gradually elevated by the habit of praying daily that the kingdom of god may comethough nothing would more astonish us than its coming  268 with these doubts respecting the possibility or propriety of miracle a more immediate difficulty occurs as to its actual nature or definition what is the quality of any event which may be properly called miraculous what are the degrees of wonderfulnesswhat the surpassing degree of it which changes the wonder into the sign or may be positively recognized by human intelligence as an interruption instead of a new operation of those laws of nature with which of late we have become so exhaustively acquainted for my own part i can only say that i am so haunted by doubt of the security of our best knowledge and by discontent in the range of it that it seems to me contrary to modesty whether in a religious or scientific point of view to regard anything as miraculous i know so little and this little i know is so inexplicable that i dare not say anything is wonderful because it is strange to me or not wonderful because it is familiar i have not the slightest idea how i compel my hand to write these words or my lips to read them and the question which was the thesis of mr wards very interesting paper can experience prove the uniformity of nature175 is in my mind so assuredly answerable with the negative which the writer appeared to desire that precisely on that ground the performance of any socalled miracle whatever would be morally unimpressive to me if a second joshua tomorrow commanded the sun to stand still and it obeyed him and he therefore claimed deference as a miracleworker i am afraid i should answer what a miracle that the sun stands stillnot at all i was always expecting it would the only wonder to me was its going on  269 but even assuming the demonstrable uniformity of the laws or customs of nature which are known to us it remains a difficult question what manner of interference with such law or custom we might logically hold miraculous and what on the contrary we should treat only as proof of the existence of some other law hitherto undiscovered  for instance there is a case authenticated by the signatures of several leading physicists in paris in which a peasant girl under certain conditions of morbid excitement was able to move objects at some distance from her without touching them taking the evidence for what it may be worth the discovery of such a faculty would only i suppose justify us in concluding that some new vital energy was developing itself under the conditions of modern bodily health and not that any interference with the laws of nature had taken place yet the generally obstinate refusal of men of science to receive any verbal witness of such facts is a proof that they believe them contrary to a code of law which is more or less complete in their experience and altogether complete in their conception and i think it is therefore their province to lay down for us the true principle by which we may distinguish the miraculous violation of a known law from the sudden manifestation of an unknown one  270 in the meantime supposing ourselves ever so incapable of defining law or discerning its interruption we need not therefore lose our conception of the one nor our faith in the other some of us may no more be able to know a genuine miracle when we see it than others to know a genuine picture but the ordinary impulse to regard therefore all claim to miraculous power as imposture or selfdeception reminds me always of the speech of a french lady to me whose husbands collection of old pictures had brought unexpectedly low prices in the auctionroomhow can you be so senseless she said as to attach yourself to the study of an art in which you see that all excellence is a mere matter of opinion some of us have thus come to imagine that the laws of nature as well as those of art may be matters of opinion and i recollect an ingenious paper by mr frederic harrison some two years ago on the subjective synthesiswhich after proving what does not seem to stand in need of so elaborate proof that we can only know of the universe what we can see and understand went on to state that the laws of nature were not objective realities any more than they were absolute truths176 which decision it seems to me is as if some modest and rational gnat who had submitted to the humiliating conviction that it could know no more of the world than might be traversed by flight or tasted by puncture yet in the course of an experiment on a philosopher with its proboscis hearing him speak of the institutes of justinian should observe on its return to the society of gnats that the institutes of justinian were not objective realities any more than they were absolute truths and indeed the careless use of the word truth itself often misleads even the most accurate thinkers a law cannot be spoken of as a truth either absolute or concrete it is a law of nature that is to say of my own particular nature that i fall asleep after dinner and my confession of this fact is a truth but the bad habit is no more a truth than the statement of it is a bad habit  271 nevertheless in spite of the treachery of our conceptions and language and in just conclusion even from our narrow experience the conviction is fastened in our hearts that the habits or laws of nature are more constant than our own and sustained by a firmer intelligence so that without in the least claiming the faculty of recognition of miracle we may securely define its essence the phenomena of the universe with which we are acquainted are assumed to be under general conditions constant but to be maintained in that constancy by a supreme personal mind and it is farther supposed that under particular conditions this ruling person interrupts the constancy of these phenomena in order to establish a particular relation with inferior creatures  272 it is indeed singular how ready the inferior creatures are to imagine such a relation without any very decisive evidence of its establishment the entire question of miracle is involved with that of the special providences which are supposed in some theories of religion sometimes to confound the enemies and always to protect the darlings of god and in the minds of amiable persons the natural and very justifiable sense of their own importance to the wellbeing of the world may often encourage the pleasant supposition that the deity however improvident for others will be provident for them i recollect a paper on this subject by dr guthrie published not long ago in some religious periodical in which the writer mentioned as a strikingly providential circumstance the catching of his foot on a ledge of rock which averted what might otherwise have been a fatal fall under the sense of the loss to the cause of religion and the society of edinburgh which might have been the consequence of the accident it is natural that dr guthrie should refer to it with strongly excited devotional feelings yet perhaps with better reason a junior member of the alpine club less secure of the value of his life would have been likely on the same occasion rather to be provoked by his own awkwardness than impressed by the providential structure of the rock at the root of every error on these subjects we may trace either an imperfect conception of the universality of deity or an exaggerated sense of individual importance and yet it is no less certain that every train of thought likely to lead us in a right direction must be founded on the acknowledgment that the personality of a deity who has commanded the doing of justice and the showing of mercy can be no otherwise manifested than in the signal support of causes which are just and favor of persons who are kind the beautiful tradition of the deaths of cleobis and bito indeed expresses the sense proper to the wisest men that we are unable either to discern or decide for ourselves in what the favor of god consists but the promises of the christian religion imply that its true disciples will be enabled to ask with prudence what is to be infallibly granted  273 and indeed the relations between god and his creatures which it is the function of miracle to establish depend far more on the correspondence of events with human volition than on the marvelous character of the events themselves these relations are in the main twofold miracles are either to convince or to assist we are apt to think of them as meant only to establish faith but many are for mere convenience of life elishas making the axhead swim and the poisoned soup wholesome were not to convince anybody but merely to give help in the quickest way conviction is indeed in many of the most interesting miracles quite a secondary end and often an unattained one the hungry multitude are fed the ship in danger relieved by sudden calm the disciples disregard the multiplying of the loaves yet are strongly affected by the change in the weather  but whether for conviction aid or aid in the terrific form of punishment the essence of miracle is as the manifestation of a power which can direct or modify the otherwise constant phenomena of nature and it is i think by attaching too great importance to what may be termed the missionary work of miracle instead of what may in distinction be called its pastoral work that many pious persons no less than infidels are apt to despise and therefore to deny miraculous power altogether  274 we do not need to be convinced they say of the existence of god by the capricious exertion of his power we are satisfied in the normal exertion of it and it is contrary to the idea of his excellent majesty that there should be any other  but all arguments and feelings must be distrusted which are founded on our own ideas of what it is proper for deity to do nor can i even according to our human modes of judgment find any impropriety in the thought that an energy may be natural without being normal and divine without being constant the wise missionary may indeed require no miracle to confirm his authority but the despised pastor may need miracle to enforce it or the compassionate governor to make it beneficial and it is quite possible to conceive of pastoral miracle as resulting from a power as natural as any other though not as perpetual the wind bloweth where it listeth and some of the energies granted to men born of the spirit may be manifested only on certain conditions and on rare occasions and therefore be always wonderful or miraculous though neither disorderly nor unnatural  thus st pauls argument to agrippa why should it be thought with you a thing impossible that god should raise the dead would be suicidal if he meant to appeal to the miracle as a proof of the authority of his mission but claiming no authority he announces as a probable and acceptable fact the opening of a dispensation in which it was as natural for the dead to be raised as for the gospel to be preached to the poor though both the one and the other were miraculous signs that the master of nature had come down to be emmanuel among men and that no prophet was in future to look for another  we have indeed fallen into a careless habit of using the words supernatural and superhuman as if equivalent a human act may be superdoggish and a divine act superhuman yet all three acts absolutely natural it is perhaps as much the virtue of a spirit to be inconstant as of a poison to be sure and therefore always impossible to weigh the elements of moral force in the balance of an apothecary  275 it is true that in any abstract reflection on these things one is instantly brought to pause by questions of the reasonableness the necessity or the expedient degree of miracle christ walks on the water overcoming gravity to that extent why not have flown and overcome it altogether he feeds the multitude by breaking existent loaves why not have commanded the stones into bread or instead of miraculously feeding either an assembly or a nation why not enable them like himself miraculously to fast for the needful time and in generally admitting the theories of pastoral miracle the instant question submits itselfsupposing a nation wisely obedient to divinely appointed ministers of a sensible theocracy how much would its government be miraculously assisted and how many of its affairs brought to miraculous prosperity of issue would its enemies be destroyed by angels and its food poured down upon it from the skies or would the supernatural aid be limited to diminishing the numbers of its slain in battle177 or to conducting its merchant ships safely or instantaneously to the land whither they would go  but no progress can be made and much may be prevented in the examination of any really difficult human problem by thus approaching it on the hypothetical side such approach is easy to the foolish pleasant to the proud and convenient to the malicious but absolutely fruitless of practical result our modesty and wisdom consist alike in the simple registry of the facts cognizable by us and our duty in making active use of them for the present without concerning ourselves as to the possibilities of the future and the two main facts we have to deal with are that the historical record of miracle is always of inconstant power and that our own actual energies are inconstant almost in exact proportion to their worthiness  276 first i say the history of miracle is of inconstant power st paul raises eutychus from death and his garments effect miraculous cure yet he leaves trophimus sick at miletum recognizes only the mercy of god in the recovery of epaphroditus and like any uninspired physician recommends timothy wine for his infirmities and in the second place our own energies are inconstant almost in proportion to their nobleness we breathe with regularity and can calculate upon the strength necessary for common tasks but the record of our best work and of our happiest moments is always one of success which we did not expect and of enthusiasm which we could not prolong  277 and therefore we can only look for an imperfect and interrupted but may surely insist on an occasional manifestation of miraculous credentials by every minister of religion there is no practical difficulty in the discernment of marvel properly to be held superhuman it is indeed frequently alleged by the admirers of scientific discovery that many things which were wonderful fifty years ago have ceased to be so now and i am perfectly ready to concede to them that what they now themselves imagine to be admirable will not in the future be admired but the petty sign said to have been wrought by the augur attus before tarquin would be as impressive at this instant as it was then while the utmost achievements of recent scientific miracle have scarcely yet achieved the feeding of lazarus their beggar still less the resurrection of lazarus their friend our christian faith at all events stands or falls by this test these signs shall follow them that believe are words which admit neither of qualification nor misunderstanding and it is far less arrogant in any man to look for such divine attestation of his authority as a teacher than to claim without it any authority to teach and assuredly it is no proof of any unfitness or unwisdom in such expectations that for the last thousand years miraculous powers seem to have been withdrawn from or at least indemonstrably possessed by a church which having been again and again warned by its master that riches were deadly to religion and love essential to it has nevertheless made wealth the reward of theological learning and controversy its occupation there are states of moral death no less amazing than physical resurrection and a church which permits its clergy to preach what they have ceased to believe and its people to trust what they refuse to obey is perhaps more truly miraculous in impotence than it would be miraculous in power if it could move the fatal rocks of california to the pole and plant the sycamore and the vine between the ridges of the sea   footnotes  footnote 174 contemporary review march 1873  footnote 175 read at the november meeting of the metaphysical society  footnote 176 i quote from memory but am sure of

nineteenth century january 1878                                         an oxford lecture178   278 i am sure that all in this audience who were present yesterday at dr aclands earnest and impressive lecture must have felt how deeply i should be moved by his closing reference to the friendship begun in our undergraduate daysof which i will but say that if it alone were all i owed to oxford the most gracious kindness of the alma mater would in that gift have been fulfilled to me  but his affectionate words in their very modesty as if even standing on the defense of his profession the noblest of human occupations and of his sciencethe most wonderful and awful of human intelligences showed me that i had yet not wholly made clear to you the exactly limited measure in which i have ventured to dispute the fitness of method of study now assigned to you in this university  279 of the dignity of physical science and of the happiness of those who are devoted to it for the healing and the help of mankind i never have meant to utter and i do not think i have uttered one irreverent word but against the curiosity of science leading us to call virtually nothing gained but what is new discovery and to despise every use of our knowledge in its acquisition of the insolence of science in claiming for itself a separate function of that human mind which in its perfection is one and indivisible in the image of its creator and of the perversion of science in hoping to discover by the analysis of death what can only be discovered by the worship of lifeof these i have spoken not only with sorrow but with a fear which every day i perceive to be more surely grounded that such labor in effacing from within you the sense of the presence of god in the garden of the earth may awaken within you the prevailing echo of the first voice of its destroyer ye shall be as gods  280 today i have little enough time to concludenone to reviewwhat i have endeavored thus to say but one instance given me directly in conversation after lecture by one of yourselves will enable me to explain to you precisely what i mean  after last lecture in which you remember i challenged our physiologists to tell me how a bird flies one of you whose pardon if he thinks it needful i ask for this use of his most timely and illustrative statement came to me saying you know the way in which we are shown how a bird flies is that any one a dove for instance is given to us plucked and partly skinned and incised at the insertion of the wing bone and then with a steel point the ligament of the muscle at the shoulder is pulled up and out and made distinct from other ligaments and we are told that is the way a bird flies and on that matter it is thought we have been told enough  i say that this instance given me was timely i will say morein the choice of this particular bird providential let me take in their order the two subjects of inquiry and instruction which are indeed offered to us in the aspect and form of that one living creature  281 of the splendor of your own true life you are told in the words which today let me call as your fathers did words of inspirationyet shall ye be as the wings of a dove that is covered with silver wings and her feathers with gold of the manifold iris of color in the doves plumage watched carefully in sunshine as the bird moves i cannot hope to give you any conception by words but that it is the most exquisite in the modesty of its light and in the myriad mingling of its hue of all plumage i may partly prove to you in this one fact that out of all studies of color the one which i would desire most to place within your reach in these schools is turners drawing of a dove done when he was in happy youth at farnley but of the causes of this color and of the peculiar subtlety in its iridescence nothing is told you in any scientific book i have ever seen on ornithology  282 of the power of flight in these wings and the tender purpose of their flight you hear also in your fathers book to the church flying from her enemies into desolate wilderness there were indeed given two wings as of a great eagle but the weary saint of god looking forward to his home in calm of eternal peace prays ratheroh that i had wings like a dove for then should i flee away and be at rest and of these wings and this mind of hers this is what reverent science should teach you first with what parting of plume and what soft pressure and rhythmic beating of divided air she reaches that miraculous swiftness of undubious motion compared with which the tempest is slow and the arrow uncertain and secondly what clew there is visible or conceivable to thought of man by which to her living conscience and errorless pointing of magnetic soul her distant home is felt afar beyond the horizon and the straight path through concealing clouds and over trackless lands made plain to her desire and her duty by the finger of god  283 and lastly since in the tradition of the old covenant she was made the messenger of forgiveness to those eight souls saved through the baptism unto death and in the gospel of the new covenant under her image was manifested the wellpleasing of god in the fulfillment of all righteousness by his son in the baptism unto lifesurely alike all christian people old and young should be taught to be gladdened by her sweet presence and in every city and village in christendom she should have such home as in venice she has had for ages and be among the sculptured marbles of the temple the sweetest sculpture and fluttering at your childrens feet their neverangered friend and surely also therefore of the thousand evidences which any carefully thoughtful person may see not only of the ministration of good but of the deceiving and deadly power of the evil angels there is no one more distinct in its gratuitous and unreconcilable sin than that thisof all the living creatures between earth and skyshould be the one chosen to amuse the apathy of our murderous idleness with skillless effortless merciless slaughter  284 i pass to the direct subject on which i have to speak finally todaythe reality of that ministration of the good angels and of that real adversity of the principalities and powers of satan in which without exception all earnest christians have believed and the appearance of which to the imagination of the greatest and holiest of them has been the root without exception of all the greatest art produced by the human mind or hand in this world  that you have at present no art properly so called in england at allwhether of painting sculpture or architecture179i for one do not care in midst of scottish lothians in the days of scott there was by how much less art by so much purer life than in the midst of italy in the days of raphael but that you should have lost not only the skill of art but the simplicity of faith and life all in one and not only here deface your ancient streets by the ford of the waters of sacred learning but also deface your ancient hills with guilt of mercenary desolation driving their ancient shepherd life into exile and diverting the waves of their streamlets into the cities which are the very centers of pollution of avarice and impiety for this i do carefor this you have blamed me for caring instead of merely trying to teach you drawing i have nevertheless yet done my best to show you what real drawing is and must yet again bear your blame for trying to show you through that somewhat more  285 i was asked as we came out of chapel this morning by one of the fellows of my college to say a word to the undergraduates about thirlmere his request being that of a faithful friend came to enforce on me the connection between this form of spoliation of our native land of its running waters and the gaining disbelief in the power of prayer over the distribution of the elements of our bread and water in rain and sunshineseedtime and harvest respecting which i must ask you to think with me today what is the meaning of the myth if you call it so of the great prophet of the old testament who is to be again sent before the coming of the day of the lord for truly you will find that if any part of your ancient faith be true it is needful for every soul which is to take up its cross with christ to be also first transfigured in the light of christtalking with moses and with elias  the contest of moses is with the temporal servitudeof elijah with the spiritual servitude of the people and the war of elijah is with their servitude essentially to two gods baal or the sun god in whose hand they thought was their life and baalzebubthe fly godof corruption in whose hand they thought was the arbitration of death  the entire contest is summed in the first assertion by elijah of his authority as the servant of god over those elemental powers by which the heart of man whether jew or heathen was filled with food and gladness  and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word  286 your modern philosophers have explained to you the absurdity of all that you think of all the shallow follies of this age that proclamation of the vanity of prayer for the sunshine and rain and the cowardly equivocations to meet it of the clergy who never in their lives really prayed for anything i think excel do these modern scientific gentlemen fancy that nobody before they were born knew the laws of cloud and storm or that the mighty human souls of former ages who every one of them lived and died by prayer and in it did not know that in every petition framed on their lips they were asking for what was not only foreordained but just as probably foredone or that the mother pausing to pray before she opens the letter from alma or balaclava does not know that already he is saved for whom she prays or already lies festering in his shroud the whole confidence and glory of prayer is in its appeal to a father who knows our necessities before we ask who knows our thoughts before they rise in our hearts and whose decrees as unalterable in the eternal future as in the eternal past yet in the close verity of visible fact bend like reeds before the foreordained and faithful prayers of his children  287 of elijahs contest on carmel with that sunpower in which literally you again now are seeking your life you know the story however little you believe it but of his contest with the deathpower on the hill of samaria you read less frequently and more doubtfully  oh thou man of god the king hath said come down and elijah answered and said if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty  how monstrous how revolting cries your modern religionist that a prophet of the lord should invoke death on fifty men and he sits himself enjoying his muffin and times and contentedly allows the slaughter of fifty thousand men so it be in the interests of england and of his own stock on exchange  but note elijahs message because thou hast sent to inquire of baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not go down from the bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die  because thou hast sent to inquire he had not sent to pray to the god of ekron only to ask of him the priests of baal prayed to baal but ahaziah only questions the flygod  he does not pray let me recover but he asks shall i recover of this disease  the scientific mind again you perceivesanitary investigation by oracle of the god of death whatever can be produced of disease by flies by aphides by lice by communication of corruption shall not we moderns also wisely inquire and so recover of our diseases  all which may for aught i know be well and when i hear of the vine disease or potato disease being stayed i will hope also that plague may be or diphtheria or aught else of human plague by due sanitary measures  288 in the meantime i see that the common cleanliness of the earth and its water is despised as if it were a plague and after myself laboring for three years to purify and protect the source of the loveliest stream in the english midlands the wandel i am finally beaten because the road commissioners insist on carrying the road washings into it at its source but thats nothing two years ago i went for the first time since early youth to see scotts country by the shores of yarrow teviot and gala waters i will read you once again though you will remember it his description of one of those pools which you are about sanitarily to draw off into your engineboilers and then i will tell you what i saw myself in that sacred country    oft in my mind such thoughts awake   by lone saint marys silent lake   thou knowst it wellnor fen nor sedge   pollute the pure lakes crystal edge   abrupt and sheer the mountains sink   at once upon the level brink   and just a trace of silver sand   marks where the water meets the land    far in the mirror bright and blue   each hills huge outline you may view   shaggy with heath but lonely bare   nor tree nor bush nor brake is there   save where of land yon slender line   bears thwart the lake the scatterd pine                                           and silence aidsthough the steep hills   send to the lake a thousand rills   in summer tide so soft they weep   the sound but lulls the ear asleep   your horses hooftread sounds too rude   so stilly is the solitude    nought living meets the eye or ear   but well i ween the dead are near   for though in feudal strife a foe   hath laid our ladys chapel low   yet still beneath the hallowd soil   the peasant rests him from his toil   and dying bids his bones be laid   where erst his simple fathers prayd  289 what i saw myself in that fair country of which the sight remains with me i will next tell you i saw the teviot oozing not flowing between its wooded banks a mere sluggish injection among the filthy stones of poisonous pools of scumcovered ink and in front of jedburgh abbey where the foaming river used to dash round the sweet ruins as if the rod of moses had freshly cleft the rock for it bare and foul nakedness of its bed the whole stream carried to work in the mills the dry stones and crags of it festering unseemly in the evening sun and the carcass of a sheep brought down in the last flood lying there in the midst of the children at their play literal and ghastly symbol in the sweetest pastoral country in the world of the lost sheep of the house of israel  that is your symbol today of the lamb as it had been slain and that the work of your prayerless sciencethe issues these of your enlightened teaching and of all the toils and the deaths of the covenanters on those barren hills of the prophetic martyrs here in your crossing streets and of the highest sincerest simplest patriot of catholic england sir thomas more within the walls of englands central tower so is ended with prayer for the bread of this life also the hope of the life that is to come yet i will take leave to show you the light of that hope as it shone on and guided the children of the ages of faith  290 of that legend of st ursula which i read to you so lately you remember i doubt not that the one great meaning is the victory of her faith over all fears of death it is the laying down of all the joy of all the hope nay of all the love of this life in the eager apprehension of the rejoicing and the love of eternity what truth there was in such faith i dare not say that i know but what manner of human souls it made you may for yourselves see here are enough brought to you of the thoughts of a believing people180 this maid in her purity is no fable this is a venetian maid as she was seen in the earthly dawn and breathed on by the breeze of her native sea and here she is in her womanhood in her courage and perfect peace waiting for her death  i have sent for this drawing for you from sheffield where it is to stay they needing it more than you it is the best of all that my friend did with me at venice for st george and with st georges help and st ursulas it shows you only a piece of the great picture of the martyrdomnearly all have fallen around the maid and she kneels with her two servant princesses waiting for her own death faithful behind their mistress they wait with hernot feebler but less raised in thought as less conceiving their immortal destiny the one a gentle girl conceiving not in her quiet heart any horror of death bows her fair head towards the earth almost with a smile the other fearful lest her faith should for an instant fail bursts into passion of prayer through burning tears st ursula kneels as daily she knelt before the altar giving herself up to god forever  and so you see her here in the days of childhood and here in her sacred youth and here in her perfect womanhood and here borne to her grave  such creatures as these have liveddo live yet thank god in the faith of christ  291 you hear it openly said that this their faith was a foolish dream do you choose to find out whether it was or not you may if you will but you can find it out in one way only  take the dilemma in perfect simplicity either christianity is true or not let us suppose it first one then the other and see what follows  let it first be supposed untrue then rational investigation will in all probability discover that untruth while on the other hand irrational submission to what we are told may lead us into any form of absurdity or insanity and as we read history we shall find that this insanity has perverted as in the crusades half the strength of europe to its ruin and been the source of manifold dissension and misery to society  start with the supposition that christianity is untrue much more with the desire that it should be and that is the conclusion at which you will certainly arrive  but on the other hand let us suppose that it is or may be true then in order to find out whether it is or not we must attend to what it says of itself and its first saying is an order to adopt a certain line of conduct do that first and you shall know more its promise is of blessing and of teaching more than tongue can utter or mind conceive if you choose to do this and it refuses to teach or help you on any other terms than these  292 you may think it strange that such a trial is required of you surely the evidences of our future state might have been granted on other termsnay a plain account might have been given with all mystery explained away in the clearest language then we should have believed at once  yes but as you see and hear that if it be our way is not gods he has chosen to grant knowledge of his truth to us on one condition and no other if we refuse that condition the rational evidence around us is all in proof of our death and that proof is true for god also tells us that in such refusal we shall die  you see therefore that in either case be christianity true or false death is demonstrably certain to us in refusing it as philosophers we can expect only death and as unbelievers we are condemned to it  there is but one chance of lifein admitting so far the possibility of the christian verity as to try it on its own terms there is not the slightest possibility of finding out whether it be true or not first  show me a sign first and i will come you say no answers god come first then you shall see a sign  hard you think you will find it is not so on thinking more for this which you are commanded is not a thing unreasonable in itself so far from that it is merely the wisest thing you could do for your own and for others happiness if there were no eternal truth to be discovered  you are called simply to be the servant of christ and of other men for his sake that is to say to hold your life and all its faculties as a means of service to your fellows all you have to do is to be sure it is the service you are doing them and not the service you do yourself which is uppermost in your minds  293 now you continually hear appeals to you made in a vague way which you dont know how far you can follow you shall not say that today i both can and will tell you what christianity requires of you in simplest terms  read your bible as you would any other bookwith strictest criticism frankly determining what you think beautiful and what you think false or foolish but be sure that you try accurately to understand it and transfer its teaching to modern need by putting other names for those which have become superseded by time for instance in such a passage as that which follows and supports the lie not one to another of colossians iiiseeing that ye have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the spirit of him that created him where meaning in that great creation where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free in applying that verse to the conduct and speech of modern policy it falls nearly dead because we suffer ourselves to remain under a vague impressionvague but practically paralyzingthat though it was very necessary to speak the truth in the countries of scythians and jews there is no objection to any quantity of lying in managing the affairs of christendom but now merely substitute modern for ancient names and see what a difference it will make in the force and appeal of the passage lie not one to another brethren seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed to knowledge greek eis epignôsin according to the knowledge of him that created him in that great creation where there is neither englishman nor german baptism nor want of baptism turk nor russian slave nor free but christ is all and in all  294 read your bible then making it the first morning business of your life to understand some piece of it clearly and your daily business to obey of it all that you understand beginning first with the most human and most dear obedienceto your father and mother doing all things as they would have you do for the present if they want you to be lawyersbe lawyers if soldierssoldiers if to get on in the worldeven to get moneydo as they wish and that cheerfully after distinctly explaining to them in what points you wish otherwise theirs is for the present the voice of god to you  but at the same time be quite clear about your own purpose and the carrying out of that so far as under the conditions of your life you can and any of you who are happy enough to have wise parents will find them contented in seeing you do as i now tell you  295 first cultivate all your personal powers not competitively but patiently and usefully you have no business to read in the long vacation come here to make scholars of yourselves and go to the mountains or the sea to make men of yourselves give at least a month in each year to rough sailors work and sea fishing dont lounge and flirt on the beach but make yourselves good seamen then on the mountains go and help the shepherd at his work the woodmen at theirs and learn to know the hills by night and day if you are staying in level country learn to plow and whatever else you can that is useful then here in oxford read to the utmost of your power and practice singing fencing wrestling and riding no rifle practice and no racingboat or other leave the river quiet for the naturalist the angler and the weary student like me  you may think all these matters of no consequence to your studies of art and divinity and that i am merely crotchety and absurd well that is the way the devil deceives you it is not the sins which we feel sinful by which he catches us but the apparently healthy onesthose which nevertheless waste the time harden the heart concentrate the passions on mean objects and prevent the course of gentle and fruitful thought  296 having thus cultivated in the time of your studentship your powers truly to the utmost then in your manhood be resolved they shall be spent in the true service of mennot in being ministered unto but in ministering begin with the simplest of all ministriesbreaking of bread to the poor think first of that not of your own pride learning comfort prospects in life nay not now once come to manhood may even the obedience to parents check your own conscience of what is your masters work whoso loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me take the perfectly simple words of the judgment inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these ye did it unto me but you must do it not preach it and you must not be resolved that it shall be done only in a gentlemanly manner your pride must be laid down as your avarice and your fear whether as fishermen on the sea plowmen on the earth laborers at the forge or merchants at the shopcounter you must break and distribute bread to the poor set down in companiesfor that also is literally told youupon the green grass not crushed in heaps under the pavement of cities take christ at his literal word and so sure as his word is true he will be known of you in breaking of bread refuse that servants duty because it is plainseek either to serve god or know him in any other way your service will become mockery of him and your knowledge darkness every day your virtues will be used by the evil spirits to conceal or to make respectable national crime every day your felicities will become baits for the iniquity of others your heroisms wreckers beacons betraying them to destruction and before your own deceived eyes and wandering hearts every false meteor of knowledge will flash and every perishing pleasure glow to lure you into the gulf of your grave  297 but obey the word in its simplicity in wholeness of purpose and with serenity of sacrifice like this of the venetian maids and truly you shall receive sevenfold into your bosom in this present life as in the world to come life everlasting all your knowledge will become to you clear and sure all your footsteps safe in the present brightness of domestic life you will foretaste the joy of paradise and to your childrens children bequeath not only noble fame but endless virtue he shall give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus   footnotes  footnote 178 left at the editors request with
