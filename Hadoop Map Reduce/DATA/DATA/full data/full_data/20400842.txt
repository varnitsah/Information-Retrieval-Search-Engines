20400842	psmith journalist  by pelham grenville wodehouse     preface   the conditions of life in new york are so different from those of london that a story of this kind calls for a little explanation there are several million inhabitants of new york not all of them eke out a precarious livelihood by murdering one another but there is a definite section of the population which murdersnot casually on the spur of the moment but on definitely commercial lines at so many dollars per murder the gangs of new york exist in fact i have not invented them most of the incidents in this story are based on actual happenings the rosenthal case where four men headed by a genial individual calling himself gyp the blood shot a fellowcitizen in cold blood in a spot as public and fashionable as piccadilly circus and escaped in a motorcar made such a stir a few years ago that the noise of it was heard all over the world and not as is generally the case with the doings of the gangs in new york only rosenthal cases on a smaller and less sensational scale are frequent occurrences on manhattan island it was the prominence of the victim rather than the unusual nature of the occurrence that excited the new york press most gang victims get a quarter of a column in small type  p g wodehouse new york 1915     chapter i  cosy moments  the man in the street would not have known it but a great crisis was imminent in new york journalism  everything seemed much as usual in the city the cars ran blithely on broadway newsboys shouted wuxtry into the ears of nervous pedestrians with their usual carusolike vim society passed up and down fifth avenue in its automobiles and was there a furrow of anxiety upon societys brow none at a thousand street corners a thousand policemen preserved their air of massive superiority to the things of this world not one of them showed the least sign of perturbation nevertheless the crisis was at hand mr j fillken wilberfloss editorinchief of cosy moments was about to leave his post and start on a ten weeks holiday  in new york one may find every class of paper which the imagination can conceive every grade of society is catered for if an esquimau came to new york the first thing he would find on the bookstalls in all probability would be the blubber magazine or some similar production written by esquimaux for esquimaux everybody reads in new york and reads all the time the new yorker peruses his favourite paper while he is being jammed into a crowded compartment on the subway or leaping like an antelope into a moving street car  there was thus a public for cosy moments cosy moments as its name an inspiration of mr wilberflosss own is designed to imply is a journal for the home it is the sort of paper which the father of the family is expected to take home with him from his office and read aloud to the chicks before bedtime it was founded by its proprietor mr benjamin white as an antidote to yellow journalism one is forced to admit that up to the present yellow journalism seems to be competing against it with a certain measure of success headlines are still of as generous a size as heretofore and there is no tendency on the part of editors to scamp the details of the last murdercase  nevertheless cosy moments thrives it has its public  its contents are mildly interesting if you like that sort of thing there is a moments in the nursery page conducted by luella granville waterman to which parents are invited to contribute the bright speeches of their offspring and which bristles with little stories about the nursery canary by jane aged six and other works of rising young authors there is a moments of meditation page conducted by the reverend edwin t philpotts a moments among the masters page consisting of assorted chunks looted from the literature of the past when foreheads were bulgy and thoughts profound by mr wilberfloss himself one or two other pages a short story answers to correspondents on domestic matters and a moments of mirth page conducted by an alleged humorist of the name of b henderson asher which is about the most painful production ever served up to a confiding public  the guiding spirit of cosy moments was mr wilberfloss circumstances had left the development of the paper mainly to him for the past twelve months the proprietor had been away in europe taking the waters at carlsbad and the sole control of cosy moments had passed into the hands of mr wilberfloss nor had he proved unworthy of the trust or unequal to the duties in that year cosy moments had reached the highest possible level of domesticity anything not calculated to appeal to the home had been rigidly excluded and as a result the circulation had increased steadily two extra pages had been added moments among the shoppers and moments with society and the advertisements had grown in volume but the work had told upon the editor work of that sort carries its penalties with it success means absorption and absorption spells softening of the brain  whether it was the strain of digging into the literature of the past every week or the effort of reading b henderson ashers moments of mirth is uncertain at any rate his duties combined with the heat of a new york summer had sapped mr wilberflosss health to such an extent that the doctor had ordered him ten weeks complete rest in the mountains this mr wilberfloss could perhaps have endured if this had been all there are worse places than the mountains of america in which to spend ten weeks of the tailend of summer when the sun has ceased to grill and the mosquitoes have relaxed their exertions but it was not all the doctor a farseeing man who went down to first causes had absolutely declined to consent to mr wilberflosss suggestion that he should keep in touch with the paper during his vacation he was adamant he had seen copies of cosy moments once or twice and he refused to permit a man in the editors state of health to come in contact with luella granville watermans moments in the nursery and b henderson ashers moments of mirth the medicineman put his foot down firmly  you must not see so much as the cover of the paper for ten weeks he said and im not so sure that it shouldnt be longer you must forget that such a paper exists you must dismiss the whole thing from your mind live in the open and develop a little flesh and muscle  to mr wilberfloss the sentence was almost equivalent to penal servitude it was with tears in his voice that he was giving his final instructions to his subeditor in whose charge the paper would be left during his absence he had taken a long time doing this for two days he had been fussing in and out of the office to the discontent of its inmates more especially billy windsor the subeditor who was now listening moodily to the last harangue of the series with the air of one whose heart is not in the subject billy windsor was a tall wiry loosejointed young man with unkempt hair and the general demeanour of a caged eagle looking at him one could picture him astride of a bronco rounding up cattle or cooking his dinner at a campfire somehow he did not seem to fit into the cosy moments atmosphere  well i think that that is all mr windsor chirruped the editor he was a little man with a long neck and large pincenez and he always chirruped you understand the general lines on which i think the paper should be conducted the subeditor nodded mr wilberfloss made him tired sometimes he made him more tired than at other times at the present moment he filled him with an aching weariness the editor meant well and was full of zeal but he had a habit of covering and recovering the ground he possessed the art of saying the same obvious thing in a number of different ways to a degree which is found usually only in politicians if mr wilberfloss had been a politician he would have been one of those dealers in glittering generalities who used to be fashionable in american politics  there is just one thing he continued mrs julia burdett parslow is a little inclinedi may have mentioned this before  you did said the subeditor  mr wilberfloss chirruped on unchecked  a little inclined to be late with her moments with budding girlhood if this should happen while i am away just write her a letter quite a pleasant letter you understand pointing out the necessity of being in good time the machinery of a weekly paper of course cannot run smoothly unless contributors are in good time with their copy she is a very sensible woman and she will understand i am sure if you point it out to her  the subeditor nodded  and there is just one other thing i wish you would correct a slight tendency i have noticed lately in mr asher to be just a triflewell not precisely risky but perhaps a shade broad in his humour  his what said billy windsor  mr asher is a very sensible man and he will be the first to acknowledge that his sense of humour has led him just a little beyond the bounds you understand well that is all i think now i must really be going or i shall miss my train goodbye mr windsor  goodbye said the subeditor thankfully  at the door mr wilberfloss paused with the air of an exile bidding farewell to his native land sighed and trotted out  billy windsor put his feet upon the table and with a deep scowl resumed his task of reading the proofs of luella granville watermans moments in the nursery    chapter ii  billy windsor  billy windsor had started life twentyfive years before this story opens on his fathers ranch in wyoming from there he had gone to a local paper of the type whose society column consists of such items as pawnee jim williams was to town yesterday with a bunch of other cheap skates we take this opportunity of once more informing jim that he is a liar and a skunk and whose editor works with a revolver on his desk and another in his hippocket graduating from this he had proceeded to a reporters post on a daily paper in a kentucky town where there were blood feuds and other southern devices for preventing life from becoming dull all this time new york the magnet had been tugging at him all reporters dream of reaching new york at last after four years on the kentucky paper he had come east minus the lobe of one ear and plus a long scar that ran diagonally across his left shoulder and had worked without much success as a freelance he was tough and ready for anything that might come his way but these things are a great deal a matter of luck the cubreporter cannot make a name for himself unless he is favoured by fortune things had not come billy windsors way his work had been confined to turning in reports of fires and small street accidents which the various papers to which he supplied them cut down to a couple of inches  billy had been in a bad way when he had happened upon the subeditorship of cosy moments he despised the work with all his heart and the salary was infinitesimal but it was regular and for a while billy felt that a regular salary was the greatest thing on earth but he still dreamed of winning through to a post on one of the big new york dailies where there was something doing and a man would have a chance of showing what was in him  the unfortunate thing however was that cosy moments took up his time so completely he had no chance of attracting the notice of big editors by his present work and he had no leisure for doing any other  all of which may go to explain why his normal aspect was that of a caged eagle  to him brooding over the outpourings of luella granville waterman there entered pugsy maloney the officeboy bearing a struggling cat  say said pugsy  he was a nonchalant youth with a freckled masklike face the expression of which never varied he appeared unconscious of the cat its existence did not seem to occur to him  well said billy looking up hello what have you got there  master maloney eyed the cat as if he were seeing it for the first time  its a kitty what i got in de street he said  dont hurt the poor brute put her down  master maloney obediently dropped the cat which sprang nimbly on to an upper shelf of the bookcase  i wasnt hoitin her he said without emotion dere was two fellers in de street sickin a dawg on to her an i comes up an says gwan what do youse tink youre doin fussin de poor dumb animal an one of de guys he says gwan who do youse tink youse is an i says im de guy whats goin to swat youse one on de coco if youse dont quit fussin de poor dumb animal so wit dat he makes a break at swattin me one but i swats him one an i swats de odder feller one an den i swats dem bote some more an i gets de kitty an i brings her in here cos i tinks maybe yousell look after her  and having finished this homeric narrative master maloney fixed an expressionless eye on the ceiling and was silent  billy windsor like most men of the plains combined the toughest of muscle with the softest of hearts he was always ready at any moment to become the champion of the oppressed on the slightest provocation his alliance with pugsy maloney had begun on the occasion when he had rescued that youth from the clutches of a large negro who probably from the soundest of motives was endeavouring to slay him billy had not inquired into the rights and wrongs of the matter he had merely sailed in and rescued the officeboy and pugsy though he had made no verbal comment on the affair had shown in many ways that he was not ungrateful  bully for you pugsy he cried youre a little sport here he produced a dollarbillgo out and get some milk for the poor brute shes probably starving keep the change  sure thing assented master maloney he strolled slowly out while billy windsor mounting a chair proceeded to chirrup and snap his fingers in the effort to establish the foundations of an entente cordiale with the rescued cat  by the time that pugsy returned carrying a fivecent bottle of milk the animal had vacated the bookshelf and was sitting on the table washing her face the milk having been poured into the lid of a tobaccotin in lieu of a saucer she suspended her operations and adjourned for refreshments billy business being business turned again to luella granville waterman but pugsy having no immediate duties on hand concentrated himself on the cat  say he said  well  dat kitty  what about her  pipe de leather collar shes wearing  billy had noticed earlier in the proceedings that a narrow leather collar encircled the cats neck he had not paid any particular attention to it what about it he said  guess i know where dat kitty belongs dey all have dose collars i guess shes one of bat jarviss kitties hes got a lot of dem for fair and every one wit one of dem collars round deir neck  whos bat jarvis do you mean the gangleader  sure hes a cousin of mine said master maloney with pride  is he said billy nice sort of fellow to have in the family so you think thats his cat  sure

retiring  oh and pugsy     huh  go out and get a good big basket i shall want one to carry this animal home in  sure said master maloney    chapter iii  at the gardenia  it would ill beseem me comrade jackson said psmith thoughtfully sipping his coffee to run down the metropolis of a great and friendly nation but candour compels me to state that new york is in some respects a singularly blighted town  whats the matter with it asked mike  too decorous comrade jackson i came over here principally it is true to be at your side should you be in any way persecuted by scoundrels but at the same time i confess that at the back of my mind there lurked a hope that stirring adventures might come my way i had heard so much of the place report had it that an earnest seeker after amusement might have a tolerably spacious rag in this modern byzantium i thought that a few weeks here might restore that keen edge to my nervous system which the languor of the past term had in a measure blunted i wished my visit to be a tonic rather than a sedative i anticipated that on my return the cry would go round cambridge psmith has been to new york he is full of oats for he on honeydew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise he is hot stuff rah but what do we find  he paused and lit a cigarette  what do we find he asked again  i dont know said mike what  a very judicious query comrade jackson what indeed we find a town very like london a quiet selfrespecting town admirable to the apostle of social reform but disappointing to one who like myself arrives with a brush and a little bucket of red paint all eager for a treat i have been here a week and i have not seen a single citizen clubbed by a policeman no negroes dance cakewalks in the street no cowboy has let off his revolver at random in broadway the cables flash the message across the ocean psmith is losing his illusions  mike had come to america with a team of the mcc which was touring the cricketplaying section of the united states psmith had accompanied him in a private capacity it was the end of their first year at cambridge and mike with a century against oxford to his credit had been one of the first to be invited to join the tour psmith who had played cricket in a rather desultory way at the university had not risen to these heights he had merely taken the opportunity of mikes visit to the other side to accompany him cambridge had proved pleasant to psmith but a trifle quiet he had welcomed the chance of getting a change of scene  so far the visit had failed to satisfy him mike whose tastes in pleasure were simple was delighted with everything the cricket so far had been rather of the picnic order but it was very pleasant and there was no limit to the hospitality with which the visitors were treated it was this more than anything which had caused psmiths grave disapproval of things american he was not a member of the team so that the advantages of the hospitality did not reach him he had all the disadvantages he saw far too little of mike when he wished to consult his confidential secretary and adviser on some aspect of life that invaluable official was generally absent at dinner with the rest of the team tonight was one of the rare occasions when mike could get away psmith was becoming bored new york is a better city than london to be alone in but it is never pleasant to be alone in any big city  as they sat discussing new yorks shortcomings over their coffee a young man passed them carrying a basket and seated himself at the next table he was a tall loosejointed young man with unkempt hair  a waiter made an ingratiating gesture towards the basket but the young man stopped him not on your life sonny he said this stays right here he placed it carefully on the floor beside his chair and proceeded to order dinner  psmith watched him thoughtfully  i have a suspicion comrade jackson he said that this will prove to be a somewhat stout fellow if possible we will engage him in conversation i wonder what hes got in the basket i must get my sherlock holmes system to work what is the most likely thing for a man to have in a basket you would reply in your unthinking way sandwiches error a man with a basketful of sandwiches does not need to dine at restaurants we must try again  the young man at the next table had ordered a jug of milk to be accompanied by a saucer these having arrived he proceeded to lift the basket on to his lap pour the milk into the saucer and remove the lid from the basket instantly with a yell which made the young mans table the centre of interest to all the diners a large grey cat shot up like a rocket and darted across the room psmith watched with silent interest  it is hard to astonish the waiters at a new york restaurant but when the cat performed this feat there was a squeal of surprise all round the room waiters rushed to and fro futile but energetic the cat having secured a strong strategic position on the top of a large oilpainting which hung on the far wall was expressing loud disapproval of the efforts of one of the waiters to drive it from its post with a walkingstick the young man seeing these manoeuvres uttered a wrathful shout and rushed to the rescue  comrade jackson said psmith rising we must be in this  when they arrived on the scene of hostilities the young man had just possessed himself of the walkingstick and was deep in a complex argument with the headwaiter on the ethics of the matter the headwaiter a stout impassive german had taken his stand on a point of etiquette id is he said to bring gats into der grillroom vorbidden no gendleman would gats into der grillroom bring der gendleman  the young man meanwhile was making enticing sounds to which the cat was maintaining an attitude of reserved hostility he turned furiously on the headwaiter  for goodness sake he cried cant you see the poor brutes scared stiff why dont you clear your gang of german comedians away and give her a chance to come down  der gendleman argued the headwaiter  psmith stepped forward and touched him on the arm  may i have a word with you in private  zo  psmith drew him away  you dont know who that is he whispered nodding towards the young man  no gendleman he is asserted the headwaiter der gendleman would not der gat into  psmith shook his head pityingly  these petty matters of etiquette are not for his gracebut hush he wishes to preserve his incognito  ingognito  you understand you are a man of the world comrademay i call you freddie you understand comrade freddie that in a man in his graces position a few little eccentricities may be pardoned you follow me frederick  the headwaiters eye rested upon the young man with a new interest and respect  he is noble he inquired with awe  he is here strictly incognito you understand said psmith warningly the headwaiter nodded  the young man meanwhile had broken down the cats reserve and was now standing with her in his arms apparently anxious to fight allcomers in her defence the headwaiter approached deferentially  der gendleman he said indicating psmith who beamed in a friendly manner through his eyeglass haf everything exblained all will now quite satisfactory be  the young man looked inquiringly at psmith who winked encouragingly the headwaiter bowed  let me present comrade jackson said psmith the pet of our english smart set i am psmith one of the shropshire psmiths this is a great moment shall we be moving back we were about to order a second instalment of coffee to correct the effects of a fatiguing day perhaps you would care to join us  sure said the alleged duke  this said psmith when they were seated and the headwaiter had ceased to hover is a great meeting i was complaining with some acerbity to comrade jackson before you introduced your very interesting performinganimal speciality that things in new york were too quiet too decorous i have an inkling comrade  windsors my name  i have an inkling comrade windsor that we see eye to eye on the subject  i guess thats right i was raised in the plains and i lived in kentucky a while theres more doing there in a day than there is here in a month say how did you fix it with the old man  with comrade freddie i have a certain amount of influence with him he is content to order his movements in the main by my judgment i assured him that all would be well and he yielded psmith gazed with interest at the cat which was lapping milk from the saucer are you training that animal for a show of some kind comrade windsor or is it a domestic pet  ive adopted her the officeboy on our paper got her away from a dog this morning and gave her to me  your paper  cosy moments said billy windsor with a touch of shame  cosy moments said psmith reflectively i regret that the bright little sheet has not come my way up to the present i must seize an early opportunity of perusing it  dont you do it  youve no paternal pride in the little journal  its bad enough to hurt said billy windsor disgustedly if you really want to see it come along with me to my place and ill show you a copy  it will be a pleasure said psmith comrade jackson have you any previous engagement for tonight  im not doing anything said mike  then let us stagger forth with comrade windsor while he is loading up that basket we will be collecting our hats    i am not half sure comrade jackson he added as they walked out that comrade windsor may not prove to be the genial spirit for whom i have been searching if you could give me your undivided company i should ask no more but with you constantly away mingling with the gay throng it is imperative that i have some solid man to accompany me in my ramblings hither and thither it is possible that comrade windsor may possess the qualifications necessary for the post but here he comes let us foregather with him and observe him in private life before arriving at any premature decision    chapter iv  bat jarvis  billy windsor lived in a single room on east fourteenth street space in new york is valuable and the average bachelors apartments consist of one room with a bathroom opening off it during the daytime this one room loses all traces of being used for sleeping purposes at night billy windsors room was very much like a publicschool study along one wall ran a settee at night this became a bed but in the daytime it was a settee and nothing but a settee there was no space for a great deal of furniture there was one rockingchair two ordinary chairs a table a bookstand a typewriternobody uses pens in new yorkand on the walls a mixed collection of photographs drawings knives and skins relics of their owners prairie days over the door was the head of a young bear  billys first act on arriving in this sanctum was to release the cat which having moved restlessly about for some moments finally came to the conclusion that there was no means of getting out and settled itself on a corner of the settee psmith sinking gracefully down beside it stretched out his legs and lit a cigarette mike took one of the ordinary chairs and billy windsor planting himself in the rocker began to rock rhythmically to and fro a performance which he kept up untiringly all the time  a peaceful scene observed psmith three great minds keen alert restless during business hours relax all is calm and pleasant chitchat you have snug quarters up here comrade windsor i hold that there is nothing like ones own rooftree it is a great treat to one who like myself is located in one of these vast caravanseraito be exact the astorto pass a few moments in the quiet privacy of an apartment such as this  its beastly expensive at the astor said mike  the place has that drawback also anon comrade jackson i think we will hunt around for some such cubbyhole as this built for two our nervous systems must be conserved  on fourth avenue said billy windsor you can get quite good flats very cheap furnished too you should move there its not much of a neighbourhood i dont know if you mind that  far from it comrade windsor it is my aim to see new york in all its phases if a certain amount of harmless revelry can be whacked out of fourth avenue we must dash there with the vim of highlytrained smelldogs are you with me comrade jackson  all right said mike  and now comrade windsor it would be a pleasure to me to peruse that little journal of which you spoke i have had so few opportunities of getting into touch with the literature of this great country  billy windsor stretched out an arm and pulled a bundle of papers from the bookstand he tossed them on to the settee by psmiths side  there you are he said if you really feel like it dont say i didnt warn you if youve got the nerve read on  psmith had picked up one of the papers when there came a shuffling of feet in the passage outside followed by a knock upon the door the next moment there appeared in the doorway a short stout young man there was an indescribable air of toughness about him partly due to the fact that he wore his hair in a welloiled fringe almost down to his eyebrows which gave him the appearance of having no forehead at all his eyes were small and set close together his mouth was wide his jaw prominent not in short the sort of man you would have picked out on sight as a model citizen  his entrance was marked by a curious sibilant sound which on acquaintance proved to be a whistled tune during the interview which followed except when he was speaking the visitor whistled softly and unceasingly  mr windsor he said to the company at large  psmith waved a hand towards the rockingchair that he said is comrade windsor to your right is comrade jackson englands favourite son i am psmith  the visitor blinked furtively and whistled another tune as he looked round the room his eye fell on the cat his face lit up  say he said stepping forward and touching the cats collar mine mister  are you bat jarvis asked windsor with interest  sure said the visitor not without a touch of complacency as of a monarch abandoning his incognito  for mr jarvis was a celebrity  by profession he was a dealer in animals birds and snakes he had a fanciers shop in groome street in the heart of the bowery this was on the groundfloor his living abode was in the upper story of that house and it was there that he kept the twentythree cats whose necks were adorned with leather collars and whose numbers had so recently been reduced to twentytwo but it was not the fact that he possessed twentythree cats with leather collars that made mr jarvis a celebrity  a man may win a purely local reputation if only for eccentricity by such means but mr jarviss reputation was far from being purely local broadway knew him and the tenderloin tammany hall knew him long island city knew him in the underworld of new york his name was a byword for bat jarvis was the leader of the famous groome street gang the most noted of all new yorks collections of apaches more he was the founder and originator of it and curiously enough it had come into being from motives of sheer benevolence in groome street in those days there had been a dancehall named the shamrock and presided over by one maginnis an irishman and a friend of bats at the shamrock nightly dances were given and well attended by the youth of the neighbourhood at ten cents a head all might have been well had it not been for certain other youths of the neighbourhood who did not dance and so had to seek other means of getting rid of their surplus energy it was the practice of these lighthearted sportsmen to pay their ten cents for admittance and once in to make hay and this habit mr maginnis found was having a marked effect on his earnings for genuine lovers of the dance fought shy of a place where at any moment philistines might burst in and break heads and furniture in this crisis the proprietor thought of his friend bat jarvis bat at that time had a solid reputation as a man of his hands it is true that as his detractors pointed out he had killed no onea defect which he had subsequently corrected but his admirers based his claim to respect on his many meritorious performances with fists and with the blackjack and mr maginnis for one held him in the very highest esteem to bat accordingly he went and laid his painful case before him he offered him a handsome salary to be on hand at the nightly dances and check undue revelry by his own robust methods bat had accepted the offer he had gone to shamrock hall and with him faithful adherents had gone such stalwarts as long otto red logan tommy jefferson and pete brodie shamrock hall became a place of joy and order andmore important stillthe nucleus of the groome street gang had been formed the work progressed offshoots of the main gang sprang up here and there about the east side small thieves pickpockets and the like flocked to mr jarvis as their tribal leader and protector and he protected them for he with his followers were of use to the politicians the new york gangs and especially the groome street gang have brought to a fine art the gentle practice of repeating which broadly speaking is the art of voting a number of different times at different pollingstations on election days a man who can vote say ten times in a single day for you and who controls a great number of followers who are also prepared if they like you to vote ten times in a single day for you is worth cultivating so the politicians passed the word to the police and the police left the groome street gang unmolested and they waxed fat and flourished  such was bat jarvis                         pipe de collar said mr jarvis touching the cats neck mine mister  pugsy said it must be said billy windsor we found two fellows setting a dog on to it so we took it in for safety  mr jarvis nodded approval  theres a basket here if you want it said billy  nope here kit  mr jarvis stooped and still whistling softly lifted the cat he looked round the company met psmiths eyeglass was transfixed by it for a moment and finally turned again to billy windsor  say he said and paused obliged he added  he shifted the cat on to his left arm and extended his right hand to billy  shake he said  billy did so  mr jarvis continued to stand and whistle for a few moments more  say he said at length fixing his roving gaze once more upon billy obliged fond of de kit i am  psmith nodded approvingly  and rightly he said rightly comrade jarvis she is not unworthy of your affection a most companionable animal full of the highest spirits her knockabout act in the restaurant would have satisfied the most jaded critic no dinerout can afford to be without such a cat such a cat spells death to boredom  mr jarvis eyed him fixedly as if pondering over his remarks then he turned to billy again  say he said any time youre in bad glad to be of service you know the address groome street bat jarvis good night obliged  he paused and whistled a few more bars then nodded to psmith and mike and left the room they heard him shuffling downstairs  a blithe spirit said psmith not garrulous perhaps but what of that i am a man of few words myself comrade jarviss massive silences appeal to me he seems to have taken a fancy to you comrade windsor  billy windsor laughed  i dont know that hes just the sort of sidepartner id go out of my way to choose from what ive heard about him still if one got mixed up with any of that eastside crowd he would be a mighty useful friend to have i guess theres no harm done by getting him grateful  assuredly not said psmith we should not despise the humblest and now comrade windsor he said taking up the paper again let me concentrate myself tensely on this very entertaining little journal of yours comrade jackson here is one for you for sound clearheaded criticism he added to billy comrade jacksons name is a byword in our english literary salons his opinion will be both of interest and of profit to you comrade windsor    chapter v  planning improvements  by the way said psmith what is your exact position on this paper practically we know well you are its backbone its lifeblood but what is your technical position when your proprietor is congratulating himself on having secured the ideal man for your job what precise job does he congratulate himself on having secured the ideal man for  im subeditor  merely sub you deserve a more responsible post than that comrade windsor where is your proprietor i must buttonhole him and point out to him what a wealth of talent he is allowing to waste itself you must have scope  hes in europe at carlsbad or somewhere he never comes near the paper he just sits tight and draws the profits he lets the editor look after things just at present im acting as editor  ah then at last you have your big chance you are free untrammelled  you bet im not said billy windsor guess again theres no room for developing free untrammelled ideas on this paper when youve looked at it youll see that each page is run by some one im simply the fellow who minds the shop  psmith clicked his tongue sympathetically it is like setting a gifted french chef to wash up dishes he said a man of your undoubted powers comrade windsor should have more scope that is the cry more scope i must look into this matter when i gaze at your broad bulging forehead when i see the clear light of intelligence in your eyes and hear the grey matter splashing restlessly about in your cerebellum i say to myself without hesitation comrade windsor must have more scope he looked at mike who was turning over the leaves of his copy of cosy moments in a sort of dull despair well comrade jackson and what is your verdict  mike looked at billy windsor he wished to be polite yet he could find nothing polite to say billy interpreted the look  go on he said say it it cant be worse than what i think  i expect some people would like it awfully said mike  they must or they wouldnt buy it ive never met any of them yet though  psmith was deep in lucia granville watermans moments in the nursery he turned to billy windsor  luella granville waterman he said is not by any chance your nomdeplume comrade windsor  not on your life dont think it  i am glad said psmith courteously for speaking as man to man i must confess that for sheer concentrated bilge she gets away with the biscuit with almost insolent ease luella granville waterman must go  how do you mean  she must go repeated psmith firmly your first act now that you have swiped the editorial chair must be to sack her  but say i cant the editor thinks a heap of her stuff  we cannot help his troubles we must act for the good of the paper moreover you said i think that he was away  so he is but hell come back  sufficient unto the day comrade windsor i have a suspicion that he will be the first to approve your action his holiday will have cleared his brain make a note of improvement number onethe sacking of luella granville waterman  i guess itll be followed pretty quick by improvement number twothe sacking of william windsor i cant go monkeying about with the paper that way  psmith reflected for a moment  has this job of yours any special attractions for you comrade windsor  i guess not  as i suspected you yearn for scope what exactly are your ambitions  i want to get a job on one of the big dailies i dont see how im going to fix it though at the present rate  psmith rose and tapped him earnestly on the chest  comrade windsor you have touched the spot you are wasting the golden hours of your youth you must move you must hustle you must make windsor of cosy moments a name to conjure with you must boost this sheet up till new york rings with your exploits on the present lines that is impossible you must strike out a line for yourself you must show the world that even cosy moments cannot keep a good man down  he resumed his seat  how do you mean said billy windsor  psmith turned to mike  comrade jackson if you were editing this paper is there a single feature you would willingly retain  i dont think there is said mike its all pretty bad rot  my opinion in a nutshell said psmith approvingly comrade jackson he explained turning to billy has a secure reputation on the other side for the keenness and lucidity of his views upon literature you may safely build upon him in england when comrade jackson says turn we all turn now my views on the matter are as follows cosy moments in my opinion worthless were it not backed by such a virtuoso as comrade jackson needs more snap more go all these putrid pages must disappear letters must be despatched tomorrow morning informing luella granville waterman and the others and in particular b henderson asher who from a cursory glance strikes me as an ideal candidate for a lethal chamber that unless they cease their contributions instantly you will be compelled to place yourself under police protection after that we can begin to move  billy windsor sat and rocked himself in his chair without replying he was trying to assimilate this idea so far the grandeur of it had dazed him it was too spacious too revolutionary could it be done it would undoubtedly mean the sack when mr j fillken wilberfloss returned and found the apple of his eye torn asunder and so to speak deprived of its choicest pips on the other hand    his brow suddenly cleared after all what was the sack one crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name and he would have no name as long as he clung to his present position the editor would be away ten weeks he would have ten weeks in which to try himself out hope leaped within him in ten weeks he could change cosy moments into a real live paper he wondered that the idea had not occurred to him before the trifling fact that the despised journal was the property of mr benjamin white and that he had no right whatever to tinker with it without that gentlemans approval may have occurred to him but if it did it occurred so momentarily that he did not notice it in these crises one cannot think of everything  im on he said briefly  psmith smiled approvingly  that he said is the right spirit you will i fancy have little cause to regret your decision fortunately if i may say so i happen to have a certain amount of leisure just now it is at your disposal i have had little experience of journalistic work but i foresee that i shall be a quick learner i will become your subeditor without salary  bully for you said billy windsor  comrade jackson continued psmith is unhappily more fettered the exigencies of his cricket tour will compel him constantly to be gadding about now to philadelphia now to saskatchewan anon to onehorseville ga his services therefore cannot be relied upon continuously from him accordingly we shall expect little but moral support an occasional congratulatory telegram now and then a bright smile of approval the bulk of the work will devolve upon our two selves  let it devolve said billy windsor enthusiastically  assuredly said psmith and now to decide upon our main scheme you of course are the editor and my suggestions are merely suggestions subject to your approval but briefly my idea is that cosy moments should become redhot stuff i could wish its tone to be such that the public will wonder why we do not print it on asbestos we must chronicle all the live events of the day murders fires and the like in a manner which will make our readers spines thrill above all we must be the guardians of the peoples rights we must be a searchlight showing up the dark spot in the souls of those who would endeavour in any way to do the people in the eye we must detect the wrongdoer and deliver him such a series of resentful buffs that he will abandon his little games and become a model citizen the details of the campaign we must think out after but i fancy that if we follow those main lines we shall produce a bright readable little sheet which will in a measure make this city sit up and take notice are you with me comrade windsor  surest thing you know said billy with fervour    chapter vi  the tenements  to alter the scheme of a weekly from cover to cover is not a task that is completed without work the dismissal of cosy moments entire staff of contributors left a gap in the paper which had to be filled and owing to the nearness of press day there was no time to fill it before the issue of the next number the editorial staff had to be satisfied with heading every page with the words look out look out look out see foot of page printing in the space at the bottom the legend next week see editorial and compiling in conjunction a snappy editorial setting forth the proposed changes this was largely the work of psmith  comrade jackson he said to mike as they set forth one evening in search of their new flat i fancy i have found my metier commerce many considered was the line i should take and doubtless had i stuck to that walk in life i should soon have become a financial magnate but something seemed to whisper to me even in the midst of my triumphs in the new asiatic bank that there were other fields for the moment it seems to me that i have found the job for which nature specially designed me at last i have scope and without scope where are we wedged tightly in among the ribstons there are some very fine passages in that editorial the last paragraph beginning cosy moments cannot be muzzled in particular i like it it strikes the right note it should stir the blood of a free and independent people till they sit in platoons on the doorstep of our office waiting for the next number to appear  how about that next number asked mike are you and windsor going to fill the whole paper yourselves  by no means it seems that comrade windsor knows certain stout fellows reporters on other papers who will be delighted to weigh in with stuff for a moderate fee  how about luella whatshername and the others how have they taken it  up to the present we have no means of ascertaining the letters giving them the missinbaulk in no uncertain voice were only despatched yesterday but it cannot affect us how they writhe beneath the blow there is no reprieve  mike roared with laughter  its the rummiest business i ever struck he said im jolly glad its not my paper its pretty lucky for you two lunatics that the proprietors in europe  psmith regarded him with pained surprise  i do not understand you comrade jackson do you insinuate that we are not acting in the proprietors best interests when he sees the receipts after we have handled the paper for a while he will go singing about his hotel his beaming smile will be a byword in carlsbad visitors will be shown it as one of the sights his only doubt will be whether to send his money to the bank or keep it in tubs and roll in it we are on to a big thing comrade jackson wait till you see our first number  and how about the editor i should think that first number would bring him back foaming at the mouth  i have ascertained from comrade windsor that there is nothing to fear from that quarter by a singular stroke of good fortune comrade wilberflosshis name is wilberflosshas been ordered complete rest during his holiday the kindly medico realising the fearful strain inflicted by reading cosy moments in its old form specifically mentioned that the paper was to be withheld from him until he returned  and when he does return what are you going to do  by that time doubtless the paper will be in so flourishing a state that he will confess how wrong his own methods were and adopt ours without a murmur in the meantime comrade jackson i would call your attention to the fact that we seem to have lost our way in the exhilaration of this little chat our footsteps have wandered where we are goodness only knows i can only say that i shouldnt care to have to live here  theres a name up on the other side of that lamppost  let us wend in that direction ah pleasant street i fancy that the mastermind who chose that name must have had the rudiments of a sense of humour  it was indeed a repellent neighbourhood in which they had arrived the new york slum stands in a class of its own it is unique the height of the houses and the narrowness of the streets seem to condense its unpleasantness all the smells and noises which are many and varied are penned up in a sort of canyon and gain in vehemence from the fact the masses of dirty clothes hanging from the fireescapes increase the depression nowhere in the city does one realise so fully the disadvantages of a lack of space new york being an island has had no room to spread it is a town of human sardines in the poorer quarters the congestion is unbelievable  psmith and mike picked their way through the groups of ragged children who covered the roadway there seemed to be thousands of them  poor kids said mike it must be awful living in a hole like this  psmith said nothing he was looking thoughtful he glanced up at the grimy buildings on each side on the lower floors one could see into dark bare rooms these were the star apartments of the tenementhouses for they opened on to the street and so got a little light and air the imagination jibbed at the thought of the back rooms  i wonder who owns these places said psmith it seems to me that theres what you might call room for improvement it wouldnt be a scaly idea to turn that cosy moments searchlight we were talking about on to them  they walked on a few steps  look here said psmith stopping this place makes me sick im going in to have a look round i expect some muscular householder will resent the intrusion and boot us out but well risk it  followed by mike he turned in at one of the doors a group of men leaning against the opposite wall looked at them without curiosity probably they took them for reporters hunting for a story reporters were the only tolerably welldressed visitors pleasant street ever entertained  it was almost pitch dark on the stairs they had to feel their way up most of the doors were shut but one on the second floor was ajar through the opening they had a glimpse of a number of women sitting round on boxes the floor was covered with little heaps of linen all the women were sewing mike stumbling in the darkness almost fell against the door none of the women looked up at the noise time was evidently money in pleasant street  on the fourth floor there was an open door the room was empty it was a good representative pleasant street back room the architect in this case had given rein to a passion for originality he had constructed the room without a window of any sort whatsoever there was a square opening in the door through this it was to be presumed the entire stock of air used by the occupants was supposed to come  they stumbled downstairs again and out into the street by contrast with the conditions indoors the street seemed spacious and breezy  this said psmith as they walked on is where cosy moments gets busy at a singularly early date  what are you going to do asked mike  i propose comrade jackson said psmith if comrade windsor is agreeable to make things as warm for the owner of this place as i jolly well know how what he wants of course he proceeded in the tone of a family doctor prescribing for a patient is disembowelling i fancy however that a mawkishly sentimental legislature will prevent our performing that national service we must endeavour to do what we can by means of kindly criticism in the paper and now having settled that important point let us try and get out of this place of wrath and find fourth avenue    chapter vii  visitors at the office  on the following morning mike had to leave with the team for philadelphia psmith came down to the ferry to see him off and hung about moodily until the time of departure  it is saddening me to a great extent comrade jackson he said this perpetual parting of the ways when i think of the happy moments we have spent handinhand across the seas it fills me with a certain melancholy to have you flitting off in this manner without me yet there is another side to the picture to me there is something singularly impressive in our unhesitating reply to the calls of duty your duty summons you to philadelphia to knock the cover off the local bowling mine retains me here to play my part in the great work of making new york sit up by the time you return with a century or two i trust in your bag the good work should i fancy be getting something of a move on i will complete the arrangements with regard to the flat  after leaving pleasant street they had found fourth avenue by a devious route and had opened negotiations for a large flat near thirtieth street it was immediately above a saloon which was something of a drawback but the landlord had assured them that the voices of the revellers did not penetrate to it                        when the ferryboat had borne mike off across the river psmith turned to stroll to the office of cosy moments the day was fine and on the whole despite mikes desertion he felt pleased with life psmiths was a nature which required a certain amount of stimulus in the way of gentle excitement and it seemed to him that the conduct of the remodelled cosy moments might supply this he liked billy windsor and looked forward to a not unenjoyable time till mike should return  the offices of cosy moments were in a large building in the street off madison avenue they consisted of a sort of outer lair where pugsy maloney spent his time reading tales of life in the prairies and heading off undesirable visitors a small room which would have belonged to the stenographer if cosy moments had possessed one and a larger room beyond which was the editorial sanctum  as psmith passed through the front door pugsy maloney rose  say said master maloney  say on comrade maloney said psmith  deyre in dere  who precisely  a whole bunch of dem  psmith inspected master maloney through his eyeglass can you give me any particulars he asked patiently you are wellmeaning but vague comrade maloney who are in there  de whole bunch of dem deres mr asher and the rev philpotts and a gazebo what calls himself waterman and about steen more of dem  a faint smile appeared upon psmiths face  and is comrade windsor in there too in the middle of them  nope mr windsors out to lunch  comrade windsor knows his business why did you let them in  sure dey just butted in said master maloney complainingly i was sittin here readin me book when de foist of de guys blew in boy says he is de editor in nope i says ill go in an wait says he nuttin doin says i nix on de goin in act i might as well have saved me breat in he butts and hes in der now well in about tree minutes along comes another gazebo boy says he is de editor in nope i says ill wait says he lightin out for de door wit dat i sees de propositions too fierce for muh i cant keep dese big husky guys out if deys for buttin in so when de rest of de bunch comes along i dont try to give dem de trun down i says well gents i says its up to youse de editor aint in but if youse wants to join de giddy trong push troo inter de inner room i cant be boddered  and what more could you have said agreed psmith approvingly tell me comrade maloney what was the general average aspect of these determined spirits  huh  did they seem to you to be gay lighthearted did they carol snatches of song as they went or did they appear to be looking for some one with a hatchet  dey was hoppinmad de whole bunch of dem  as i suspected but we must not repine comrade maloney these trifling contretemps are the penalties we pay for our high journalistic aims i will interview these merchants i fancy that with the aid of the diplomatic smile and the honeyed word i may manage to pull through it is as well perhaps that comrade windsor is out the situation calls for the handling of a man of delicate culture and nice tact comrade windsor would probably have endeavoured to clear the room with a chair if he should arrive during the seance comrade maloney be so good as to inform him of the state of affairs and tell him not to come in give him my compliments and tell him to go out and watch the snowdrops growing in madison square garden  sure said master maloney  then psmith having smoothed the nap of his hat and flicked a speck of dust from his coatsleeve walked to the door of the inner room and went in    chapter viii  the honeyed word  master maloneys statement that about steen visitors had arrived in addition to messrs asher waterman and the rev philpotts proved to have been due to a great extent to a somewhat feverish imagination there were only five men in the room  as psmith entered every eye was turned upon him to an outside spectator he would have seemed rather like a very welldressed daniel introduced into a den of singularly irritable lions five pairs of eyes were smouldering with a longnursed resentment five brows were corrugated with wrathful lines such however was the simple majesty of psmiths demeanour that for a moment there was dead silence not a word was spoken as he paced wrapped in thought to the editorial chair stillness brooded over the room as he carefully dusted that piece of furniture and having done so to his satisfaction hitched up the knees of his trousers and sank gracefully into a sitting position  this accomplished he looked up and started he gazed round the room  ha i am observed he murmured  the words broke the spell instantly the five visitors burst simultaneously into speech  are you the acting editor of this paper  i wish to have a word with you sir  mr windsor i presume  pardon me  i should like a few moments conversation  the start was good and even but the gentleman who said pardon me necessarily finished first with the rest nowhere  psmith turned to him bowed and fixed him with a benevolent gaze through his eyeglass  are you mr windsor sir may i ask inquired the favoured one  the others paused for the reply  alas no said psmith with manly regret  then who are you  i am psmith  there was a pause  where is mr windsor  he is i fancy champing about forty cents worth of lunch at some neighbouring hostelry  when will he return  anon but how much anon i fear i cannot say  the visitors looked at each other  this is exceedingly annoying said the man who had said pardon me i came for the express purpose of seeing mr windsor  so did i chimed in the rest same here so did i  psmith bowed courteously  comrade windsors loss is my gain is there anything i can do for you  are you on the editorial staff of this paper  i am acting subeditor the work is not light added psmith gratuitously sometimes the cry goes round can psmith get through it all will his strength support his unquenchable spirit but i stagger on i do not repine  then maybe you can tell me what all this means said a small round gentleman who so far had done only chorus work  if it is in my power to do so it shall be done comradei have not the pleasure of your name  my name is waterman sir i am here on behalf of my wife whose name you doubtless know  correct me if i am wrong said psmith but i should say it also was waterman  luella granville waterman sir said the little man proudly psmith removed his eyeglass polished it and replaced it in his eye he felt that he must run no risk of not seeing clearly the husband of one who in his opinion stood alone in literary circles as a purveyor of sheer bilge  my wife continued the little man producing an envelope and handing it to psmith has received this extraordinary communication from a man signing himself w windsor we are both at a loss to make head or tail of it  psmith was reading the letter  it seems reasonably clear to me he said  it is an outrage my wife has been a contributor to this journal from its foundation her work has given every satisfaction to mr wilberfloss and now without the slightest warning comes this peremptory dismissal from w windsor who is w windsor where is mr wilberfloss  the chorus burst forth it seemed that that was what they all wanted to know who was w windsor where was mr wilberfloss  i am the reverend edwin t philpotts sir said a cadaverous looking man with pale blue eyes and a melancholy face i have contributed moments of meditation to this journal for a very considerable period of time  i have read your page with the keenest interest said psmith i may be wrong but yours seems to me work which the world will not willingly let die  the reverend edwins frosty face thawed into a bleak smile  and yet continued psmith i gather that comrade windsor on the other hand actually wishes to hurry on its decease it is these strange contradictions these clashings of personal taste which make up what we call life here we have on the one hand  a man with a face like a walnut who had hitherto lurked almost unseen behind a stout person in a serge suit bobbed into the open and spoke his piece  wheres this fellow windsor w windsor thats the man we want to see ive been working for this paper without a break except when i had the mumps for four years and ive reason to know that my page was as widely read and appreciated as any in new york and now up comes this windsor fellow if you please and tells me in so many words the papers got no use for me  these are lifes tragedies murmured psmith  whats he mean by it thats what i want to know and thats what these gentlemen want to knowsee here  i am addressing said psmith  ashers my name b henderson asher i write moments of mirth  a look almost of excitement came into psmiths face such a look as a visitor to a foreign land might wear when confronted with some great national monument that he should be privileged to look upon the author of moments of mirth in the flesh face to face was almost too much  comrade asher he said reverently may i shake your hand  the other extended his hand with some suspicion  your moments of mirth said psmith shaking it have frequently reconciled me to the toothache  he reseated himself  gentlemen he said this is a painful case the circumstances as you will readily admit when you have heard all are peculiar you have asked me where mr wilberfloss is i do not know  you dont know exclaimed mr waterman  i dont know you dont know they said psmith indicating the rest with a wave of the hand dont know nobody knows his locality is as hard to ascertain as that of a black cat in a coalcellar on a moonless night shortly before i joined this journal mr wilberfloss by his doctors orders started out on a holiday leaving no address no letters were to be forwarded he was to enjoy complete rest where is he now who shall say possibly legging it down some rugged slope in the rockies with two bears and a wild cat in earnest pursuit possibly in the midst of some florida everglade making a noise like a piece of meat in order to snare crocodiles possibly in canada baiting moosetraps we have no data  silent consternation prevailed among the audience finally the rev edwin t philpotts was struck with an idea  where is mr white he asked  the point was well received  yes wheres mr benjamin white chorused the rest  psmith shook his head  in europe i cannot say more  the audiences consternation deepened  then do you mean to say demanded mr asher that this fellow windsors the boss here that what he says goes  psmith bowed  with your customary clearheadedness comrade asher you have got home on the bullseye first pop comrade windsor is indeed the boss a man of intensely masterful character he will brook no opposition i am powerless to sway him suggestions from myself as to the conduct of the paper would infuriate him he believes that radical changes are necessary in the programme of cosy moments and he means to put them through if it snows doubtless he would gladly consider your work if it fitted in with his ideas a snappy account of a glovefight a spineshaking wordpicture of a railway smash or something on those lines would be welcomed but  i have never heard of such a thing said mr waterman indignantly  psmith sighed  some time ago he said how long it seemsi remember saying to a young friend of mine of the name of spiller comrade spiller never confuse the unusual with the impossible it is my guiding rule in life it is unusual for the substituteeditor of a weekly paper to do a captain kidd act and take entire command of the journal on his own account but is it impossible alas no comrade windsor has done it that is where you comrade asher and you gentlemen have landed yourselves squarely in the broth you have confused the unusual with the impossible  but what is to be done cried mr asher  i fear that there is nothing to be done except wait the present régime is but an experiment it may be that when comrade wilberfloss having dodged the bears and eluded the wild cat returns to his post at the helm of this journal he may decide not to continue on the lines at present mapped out he should be back in about ten weeks  ten weeks  i fancy that was to be the duration of his holiday till then my advice to you gentlemen is to wait you may rely on me to keep a watchful eye upon your interests when your thoughts tend to take a gloomy turn say to yourselves all is well psmith is keeping a watchful eye upon our interests  all the same i should like to see this w windsor said mr asher  psmith shook his head  i shouldnt he said i speak in your best interests comrade windsor is a man of the fiercest passions he cannot brook interference were you to question the wisdom of his plans there is no knowing what might not happen he would be the first to regret any violent action when once he had cooled off but would that be any consolation to his victim i think not of course if you wish it i could arrange a meeting  mr asher said no he thought it didnt matter  i guess i can wait he said  that said psmith approvingly is the right spirit wait that is the watchword and now he added rising i wonder if a bit of lunch somewhere might not be a good thing we have had an interesting but fatiguing little chat our tissues require restoring if you gentlemen would care to join me  ten minutes later the company was seated in complete harmony round a table at the knickerbocker psmith with the dignified bonhomie of a seigneur of the old school was ordering the wine while b henderson asher brimming over with goodhumour was relating to an attentive circle an anecdote which should have appeared in his next instalment of moments of mirth    chapter ix  full steam ahead  when psmith returned to the office he found billy windsor in the doorway just parting from a thickset young man who seemed to be expressing his gratitude to the editor for some good turn he was shaking him warmly by the hand  psmith stood aside to let him pass  an old college chum comrade windsor he asked  that was kid brady  the name is unfamiliar to me another contributor  hes from my part of the countrywyoming he wants to fight any one in the world at a hundred and thirtythree pounds  we all have our hobbies comrade brady appears to have selected a somewhat exciting one he would find stampcollecting less exacting  it hasnt given him much excitement so far poor chap said billy windsor hes in the championship class and here he has been pottering about new york for a month without being able to get a fight its always the way in this rotten east continued billy warming up as was his custom when discussing a case of oppression and injustice its all graft here youve got to let half a dozen brutes dip into every dollar you earn or you dont get a chance if the kid had a manager hed get all the fights he wanted and the manager would get nearly all the money ive told him that we will back him up  you have hit it comrade windsor said psmith with enthusiasm cosy moments shall be comrade bradys manager we will give him a muchneeded boost up in our columns a sporting section is what the paper requires more than anything  if things go on as theyve started what it will require still more will be a fightingeditor pugsy tells me you had visitors while i was out  a few said psmith one or two very entertaining fellows comrades asher philpotts and others i have just been giving them a bite of lunch at the knickerbocker  lunch  a most pleasant little lunch we are now as brothers i fear i have made you perhaps a shade unpopular with our late contributors but these things must be we must clench our teeth and face them manfully if i were you i think i should not drop in at the house of comrade asher and the rest to take potluck for some little time to come in order to soothe the squad i was compelled to curse you to some extent  dont mind me  i think i may say i didnt  say look here you must charge up the price of that lunch to the office necessary expenses you know  i could not dream of doing such a thing comrade windsor the whole affair was a great treat to me i have few pleasures comrade asher alone was worth the money i found his society intensely interesting i have always believed in the darwinian theory comrade asher confirmed my views  they went into the inner office psmith removed his hat and coat  and now once more to work he said psmith the flaneur of fifth avenue ceases to exist in his place we find psmith the hardheaded subeditor be so good as to indicate a job of work for me comrade windsor i am champing at my bit  billy windsor sat down and lit his pipe  what we want most he said thoughtfully is some big topic thats the only way to get a paper going look at everybodys magazine they didnt amount to a row of beans till lawson started his frenzied finance articles directly they began the whole country was squealing for copies everybodys put up their price from ten to fifteen cents and now they lead the field  the country must squeal for cosy moments said psmith firmly i fancy i have a scheme which may not prove wholly scaly wandering yesterday with comrade jackson in a search for fourth avenue i happened upon a spot called pleasant street do you know it  billy windsor nodded  i went down there once or twice when i was a reporter its a beastly place  it is a singularly beastly place we went into one of the houses  theyre pretty bad  who owns them  i dont know probably some millionaire those tenement houses are about as paying an investment as you can have  hasnt anybody ever tried to do anything about them  not so far as i know its pretty difficult to get at these fellows you see but theyre fierce arent they those houses  what asked psmith is the precise difficulty of getting at these merchants  well its this way there are all sorts of laws about the places but any one who wants can get round them as easy as falling off a log the law says a tenement house is a building occupied by more than two families well when theres a fuss all the man has to do is to clear out all the families but two then when the inspector fellow comes along and says lets say wheres your running water on each floor thats what the law says youve got to have and here are these people having to go downstairs and out of doors to fetch their water supplies the landlord simply replies nothing doing this isnt a tenement house at all there are only two families here and when the fuss has blown over back come the rest of the crowd and things go on the same as before  i see said psmith a very cheery scheme  then theres another thing you cant get hold of the man whos really responsible unless youre prepared to spend thousands ferreting out evidence the land belongs in the first place to some corporation or other they lease it to a lessee when theres a fuss they say they arent responsible its up to the lessee and he lies so low that you cant find out who he is its all just like the east everything in the east is as crooked as pearl street if you want a square deal youve got to come out wyoming way  the main problem then said psmith appears to be the discovery of the lessee lad surely a powerful organ like cosy moments with its vast ramifications could bring off a thing like that  i doubt it well try anyway theres no knowing but what we may have luck  precisely said psmith full steam ahead and trust to luck the chances are that if we go on long enough we shall eventually arrive somewhere after all columbus didnt know that america existed when he set out all he knew was some highly interesting fact about an egg what that was i do not at the moment recall but it bucked columbus up like a tonic it made him fizz ahead like a twoyearold the facts which will nerve us to effort are two in the first place we know that there must be some one at the bottom of the business secondly as there appears to be no law of libel whatsoever in this great and free country we shall be enabled to haul up our slacks with a considerable absence of restraint  sure said billy windsor which of us is going to write the first article  you may leave it to me comrade windsor i am no hardened old journalist i fear but i have certain qualifications for the post a young man once called at the office of a certain newspaper and asked for a job have you any special line asked the editor yes said the bright lad i am rather good at invective any special kind of invective queried the man up top no replied our hero just general invective such is my own case comrade windsor i am a very fair purveyor of good general invective and as my visit to pleasant street is of such recent date i am tolerably full of my subject taking full advantage of the benevolent laws of this country governing libel i fancy i will produce a screed which will make this anonymous lessee feel as if he had inadvertently seated himself upon a tintack give me pen and paper comrade windsor instruct comrade maloney to suspend his whistling till such time as i am better able to listen to it and i think we have got a success    chapter x  going some  there was once an editor of a paper in the far west who was sitting at his desk musing pleasantly of life when a bullet crashed through the window and embedded itself in the wall at the back of his head a happy smile lit up the editors face ah he said complacently i knew that personal column of ours was going to be a success  what the bullet was to the far west editor the visit of mr francis parker to the offices of cosy moments was to billy windsor  it occurred in the third week of the new régime of the paper cosy moments under its new management had bounded ahead like a motorcar when the throttle is opened incessant work had been the order of the day billy windsors hair had become more dishevelled than ever and even psmith had at moments lost a certain amount of his dignified calm sandwiched in between the painful case of kid brady and the matter of the tenements which formed the star items of the papers contents was a mass of bright reading dealing with the events of the day billy windsors newspaper friends had turned in some fine snappy stuff in their best yellow journal manner relating to the more stirring happenings in the city psmith who had constituted himself guardian of the literary and dramatic interests of the paper had employed his gift of general invective to considerable effect as was shown by a conversation between master maloney and a visitor one morning heard through the open door  i wish to see the editor of this paper said the visitor  editor not in said master maloney untruthfully  ha then when he returns i wish you to give him a message  sure  i am aubrey bodkin of the national theatre give him my compliments and tell him that mr bodkin does not lightly forget  an unsolicited testimonial which caused psmith the keenest satisfaction  the section of the paper devoted to kid brady was attractive to all those with sporting blood in them each week there appeared in the same place on the same page a portrait of the kid looking moody and important in an attitude of selfdefence and under the portrait the legend jimmy garvin must meet this boy jimmy was the present holder of the lightweight title he had won it a year before and since then had confined himself to smoking cigars as long as walkingsticks and appearing nightly as the star in a musichall sketch entitled a fight for honour his reminiscences were appearing weekly in a sunday paper it was this that gave psmith the idea of publishing kid bradys autobiography in cosy moments an idea which made the kid his devoted adherent from then on like most pugilists the kid had a passion for bursting into print and his life had been saddened up to the present by the refusal of the press to publish his reminiscences to appear in print is the fighters accolade it signifies that he has arrived psmith extended the hospitality of page four of cosy moments to kid brady and the latter leaped at the chance he was grateful to psmith for not editing his contributions other pugilists contributing to other papers groaned under the supervision of a member of the staff who cut out their best passages and altered the rest into addisonian english the readers of cosy moments got kid brady raw  comrade brady said psmith to billy has a singularly pure and pleasing style it is bound to appeal powerfully to the manyheaded listen to this bit our hero is fighting battling jack benson in that eminent artists native town of louisville and the citizens have given their native son the approving hand while receiving comrade brady with chilly silence here is the kid on the subject i looked around that house and i seen i hadnt a friend in it and then the gong goes and i says to myself how i has one friend my poor old mother way out in wyoming and i goes in and mixes it and then i seen benson losing his goat so i ups with an awful halfscissor hook to the plexus and in the next round i seen benson has a chunk of yellow and i gets in with a haymaker and i picks up another sleepproducer from the floor and hands it him and he takes the count all right   crisp lucid and to the point that is what the public wants if this does not bring comrade garvin up to the scratch nothing will  but the feature of the paper was the tenement series it was late summer now and there was nothing much going on in new york the public was consequently free to take notice the sale of cosy moments proceeded briskly as psmith had predicted the change of policy had the effect of improving the sales to a marked extent letters of complaint from old subscribers poured into the office daily but as billy windsor complacently remarked they had paid their subscriptions so that the money was safe whether they read the paper or not and meanwhile a large new public had sprung up and was growing every week advertisements came trooping in cosy moments in short was passing through an era of prosperity undreamed of in its history  young blood said psmith nonchalantly young blood that is the secret a paper must keep up to date or it falls behind its competitors in the race comrade wilberflosss methods were possibly sound but too limited and archaic they lacked ginger we of the younger generation have our fingers more firmly on the public pulse we read off the publics unspoken wishes as if by intuition we know the game from a to z  at this moment master maloney entered bearing in his hand a card  francis parker said billy taking it dont know him  nor i said psmith we make new friends daily  hes a guy with a tallshaped hat volunteered master maloney an hes wearin a dude suit an shiny shoes  comrade parker said psmith approvingly has evidently not been blind to the importance of a visit to cosy moments he has dressed himself in his best he has felt rightly that this is no occasion for the old straw hat and the baggy flannels i would not have it otherwise it is the right spirit shall we give him audience comrade windsor  i wonder what he wants  that said psmith we shall ascertain more clearly after a personal interview comrade maloney show the gentleman in we can give him three and a quarter minutes  pugsy withdrew  mr francis parker proved to be a man who might have been any age between twentyfive and thirtyfive he had a smooth cleanshaven face and a catlike way of moving as pugsy had stated in effect he wore a tailcoat trousers with a crease which brought a smile of kindly approval to psmiths face and patentleather boots of pronounced shininess gloves and a tall hat which he carried completed an impressive picture  he moved softly into the room  i wished to see the editor  psmith waved a hand towards billy  the treat has not been denied you he said before you is comrade windsor the wyoming crackerjack he is our editor i myselfi am psmiththough but a subordinate may also claim the title in a measure technically i am but a subeditor but such is the mutual esteem in which comrade windsor and i hold each other that we may practically be said to be inseparable we have no secrets from each other you may address us both impartially will you sit for a space  he pushed a chair towards the visitor who seated himself with the care inspired by a perfect trousercrease there was a momentary silence while he selected a spot on the table on which to place his hat  the style of the paper has changed greatly has it not during the past few weeks he said i have never been shall i say a constant reader of cosy moments and i may be wrong but is not its interest in current affairs a recent development  you are very right responded psmith comrade windsor a man of alert and restless temperament felt that a change was essential if cosy moments was to lead public thought comrade wilberflosss methods were good in their way i have no quarrel with comrade wilberfloss but he did not lead public thought he catered exclusively for children with water on the brain and men and women with solid ivory skulls comrade windsor with a broader view feels that there are other and larger publics he refuses to content himself with ladling out a weekly dole of mental predigested breakfast food he provides meat he  thenexcuse me said mr parker turning to billy you i take it are responsible for this very vigorous attack on the tenementhouse owners  you can take it i am said billy  psmith interposed  we are both responsible comrade parker if any husky guy as i fancy master maloney would phrase it is anxious to aim a swift kick at the man behind those articles he must distribute it evenly between comrade windsor and myself  i see mr parker paused they areervery outspoken articles he added  warm stuff agreed psmith distinctly warm stuff  may i speak frankly said mr parker  assuredly comrade parker there must be no secrets no restraint between us we would not have you go away and say to yourself did i make my meaning clear was i too elusive say on  i am speaking in your best interests  who would doubt it comrade parker nothing has buoyed us up more strongly during the hours of doubt through which we have passed than the knowledge that you wish us well  billy windsor suddenly became militant there was a feline smoothness about the visitor which had been jarring upon him ever since he first spoke billy was of the plains the home of blunt speech where you looked your man in the eye and said it quick mr parker was too bland for human consumption he offended billys honest soul  see here cried he leaning forward whats it all about lets have it if youve anything to say about those articles say it right out never mind our best interests we can look after them lets have whats worrying you  psmith waved a deprecating hand  do not let us be abrupt on this happy occasion to me it is enough simply to sit and chat with comrade parker irrespective of the trend of his conversation still as time is money and this is our busy day possibly it might be as well sir if you unburdened yourself as soon as convenient have you come to point out some flaw in those articles do they fall short in any way of your standard for such work  mr parkers smooth face did not change its expression but he came to the point  i should not go on with them if i were you he said  why demanded billy  there are reasons why you should not said mr parker  and there are reasons why we should  less powerful ones  there proceeded from billy a noise not describable in words it was partly a snort partly a growl it resembled more than anything else the preliminary sniffing snarl a bulldog emits before he joins battle billys cowboy blood was up he was rapidly approaching the state of mind in which the men of the plains finding speech unequal to the expression of their thoughts reach for their guns  psmith intervened  we do not completely gather your meaning comrade parker i fear we must ask you to hand it to us with still more breezy frankness do you speak from purely friendly motives are you advising us to discontinue the articles merely because you fear that they will damage our literary reputation or are there other reasons why you feel that they should cease do you speak solely as a literary connoisseur is it the style or the subjectmatter of which you disapprove  mr parker leaned forward  the gentleman whom i represent  then this is no matter of your own personal taste you are an emissary  these articles are causing a certain inconvenience to the gentleman whom i represent or rather he feels that if continued they may do so  you mean broke in billy explosively that if we kick up enough fuss to make somebody start a commission to inquire into this rotten business your friend who owns the private hades were trying to get improved will have to get busy and lose some of his money by making the houses fit to live in is that it  it is not so much the money mr windsor though of course the expense would be considerable my employer is a wealthy man  i bet he is said billy disgustedly ive no doubt he makes a mighty good pile out of pleasant street  it is not so much the money repeated mr parker as the publicity involved i speak quite frankly there are reasons why my employer would prefer not to come before the public just now as the owner of the pleasant street property i need not go into those reasons it is sufficient to say that they are strong ones  well he knows what to do i guess the moment he starts in to make those houses decent the articles stop its up to him  psmith nodded  comrade windsor is correct he has hit the mark and rung the bell no conscientious judge would withhold from comrade windsor a cigar or a cocoanut according as his private preference might dictate that is the matter in a nutshell remove the reason for those very scholarly articles and they cease  mr parker shook his head  i fear that is not feasible the expense of reconstructing the houses makes that impossible  then theres no use in talking said billy the articles will go on  mr parker coughed a tentative cough suggesting that the situation was now about to enter upon a more delicate phase billy and psmith waited for him to begin from their point of view the discussion was over if it was to be reopened on fresh lines it was for their visitor to effect that reopening  now im going to be frank gentlemen said he as who should say we are all friends here let us be hearty im going to put my cards on the table and see if we cant fix something up now see here we dont want unpleasantness you arent in this business for your healths eh youve got your living to make just like everybody else i guess well see here this is how it stands to a certain extant i dont mind admitting seeing that were being frank with one another you two gentlemen have got usthats to say my employerin a cleft stick frankly those articles are beginning to attract attention and if they go on theres going to be a lot of inconvenience for my employer thats clear i reckon well now heres a square proposition how much do you want to stop those articles thats straight ive been frank with you and i want you to be frank with me whats your figure name it and if its not too high i guess we neednt quarrel  he looked expectantly at billy billys eyes were bulging he struggled for speech he had got as far as say when psmith interrupted him psmith gazing sadly at mr parker through his monocle spoke quietly with the restrained dignity of some old roman senator dealing with the enemies of the republic  comrade parker he said i fear that you have allowed constant communication with the conscienceless commercialism of this worldly city to undermine your moral sense it is useless to dangle rich bribes before our eyes cosy moments cannot be muzzled you doubtless mean well according to yourif i may say sosomewhat murky lights but we are not for sale except at ten cents weekly from the hills of maine to the everglades of florida from sandy hook to san francisco from portland oregon to melonsquashville tennessee one sentence is in every mans mouth and what is that sentence i give you three guesses you give it up it is this cosy moments cannot be muzzled  mr parker rose  theres nothing more to be done then he said  nothing agreed psmith except to make a noise like a hoop and roll away  and do it quick yelled billy exploding like a firecracker  psmith bowed  speed he admitted would be no bad thing franklyif i may borrow the expressionyour square proposition has wounded us i am a man of powerful selfrestraint one of those strong silent men and i can curb my emotions but i fear that comrade windsors generous temperament may at any moment prompt him to start throwing inkpots and in wyoming his deadly aim with the inkpot won him among the admiring cowboys the sobriquet of crackshot cuthbert as man to man comrade parker i should advise you to bound swiftly away  im going said mr parker picking up his hat and ill give you a piece of advice too those articles are going to be stopped and if youve any sense between you youll stop them yourselves before you get hurt thats all ive got to say and that goes  he went out closing the door behind him with a bang that added emphasis to his words  to men of nicely poised nervous organisation such as ourselves comrade windsor said psmith smoothing his waistcoat thoughtfully these scenes are acutely painful we wince before them our ganglions quiver like cinematographs gradually recovering command of ourselves we review the situation did our visitors final remarks convey anything definite to you were they the mere casual badinage of a parting guest or was there something solid behind them  billy windsor was looking serious  i guess he meant it all right hes evidently working for somebody pretty big and that sort of man would have a pull with all kinds of thugs we shall have to watch out now that they find we cant be bought theyll try the other way they mean business sure enough but by george let em were up against a big thing and im going to see it through if they put every gang in new york on to us  precisely comrade windsor cosy moments as i have had occasion to observe before cannot be muzzled  thats right said billy windsor and he added with the contented look the far west editor must have worn as the bullet came through the window we must have got them scared or they wouldnt have shown their hand that way i guess were making a hit cosy moments is going some now    chapter xi  the man at the astor  the duties of master pugsy maloney at the offices of cosy moments were not heavy and he was accustomed to occupy his large store of leisure by reading narratives dealing with life in the prairies which he acquired at a neighbouring shop at cut rates in consideration of their being shopsoiled it was while he was engrossed in one of these on the morning following the visit of mr parker that the seedylooking man made his appearance he walked in from the street and stood before master maloney  hey kid he said  pugsy looked up with some hauteur he resented being addressed as kid by perfect strangers  editor in tommy inquired the man  pugsy by this time had taken a thorough dislike to him to be called kid was bad the subtle insult of tommy was still worse  nope he said curtly fixing his eyes again on his book a movement on the part of the visitor attracted his attention the seedy man was making for the door of the inner room pugsy instantly ceased to be the student and became the man of action he sprang from his seat and wriggled in between the man and the door  youse cant butt in dere he said authoritatively chase yerself  the man eyed him with displeasure  fresh kid he observed disapprovingly  fade away urged master maloney  the visitors reply was to extend a hand and grasp pugsys left ear between a long finger and thumb since time began small boys in every country have had but one answer for this action pugsy made it he emitted a piercing squeal in which pain fear and resentment strove for supremacy  the noise penetrated into the editorial sanctum losing only a small part of its strength on the way psmith who was at work on a review of a book of poetry looked up with patient sadness  if comrade maloney he said is going to take to singing as well as whistling i fear this journal must put up its shutters concentrated thought will be out of the question  a second squeal rent the air billy windsor jumped up  somebody must be hurting the kid he exclaimed  he hurried to the door and flung it open psmith followed at a more leisurely pace the seedy man caught in the act released master maloney who stood rubbing his ear with resentment written on every feature  on such occasions as this billy was a man of few words he made a dive for the seedy man but the latter who during the preceding moment had been eyeing the two editors as if he were committing their appearance to memory sprang back and was off down the stairs with the agility of a marathon runner  he blows in said master maloney aggrieved and asks is de editor dere i tells him no cos youse said youse wasnt and he nips me by the ear when i gets busy to stop him gettin troo  comrade maloney said psmith you are a martyr what would horatius have done if somebody had nipped him by the ear when he was holding the bridge the story does not consider the possibility yet it might have made all the difference did the gentleman state his business  nope just tried to butt troo  another of these strong silent men the world is full of us these are the perils of the journalistic life you will be safer and happier when you are rounding up cows on your mustang  i wonder what he wanted said billy when they were back again in the inner room  who can say comrade windsor possibly our autographs possibly five minutes chat on general subjects  i dont like the look of him said billy  whereas what comrade maloney objected to was the feel of him in what respect did his look jar upon you his clothes were poorly cut but such things i know leave you unmoved  it seems to me said billy thoughtfully as if he came just to get a sight of us  and he got it ah providence is good to the poor  whoevers behind those tenements isnt going to stick at any odd trifle we must watch out that man was probably sent to mark us down for one of the gangs now theyll know what we look like and they can get after us  these are the drawbacks to being public men comrade windsor we must bear them manfully without wincing  billy turned again to his work  im not going to wince he said sos you could notice it with a microscope what im going to do is to buy a good big stick and id advise you to do the same                        it was by psmiths suggestion that the editorial staff of cosy moments dined that night in the roofgarden at the top of the astor hotel  the tired brain he said needs to recuperate to feed on such a night as this in some lowdown hostelry on the level of the street with german waiters breathing heavily down the back of ones neck and two fiddles and a piano whacking out beautiful eyes about three feet from ones tympanum would be false economy here fanned by cool breezes and surrounded by fair women and brave men one may do a bit of tissuerestoring moreover there is little danger up here of being slugged by our motheaten acquaintance of this morning a man with trousers like his would not be allowed in we shall probably find him waiting for us at the main entrance with a sandbag when we leave but till then  he turned with gentle grace to his soup  it was a warm night and the roofgarden was full from where they sat they could see the million twinkling lights of the city towards the end of the meal psmiths gaze concentrated itself on the advertisement of a certain brand of gingerale in times square it is a mass of electric light arranged in the shape of a great bottle and at regular intervals there proceed from the bottles mouth flashes of flame representing gingerale the thing began to exercise a hypnotic effect on psmith he came to himself with a start to find billy windsor in conversation with a waiter  yes my names windsor billy was saying  the waiter bowed and retired to one of the tables where a young man in evening clothes was seated psmith recollected having seen this solitary diner looking in their direction once or twice during dinner but the fact had not impressed him  what is happening comrade windsor he inquired i was musing with a certain tenseness at the moment and the rush of events has left me behind  man at that table wanted to know if my name was windsor said billy  ah said psmith interested and was it  here he comes i wonder what he wants i dont know the man from adam  the stranger was threading his way between the tables  can i have a word with you mr windsor he said  billy looked at him curiously recent events had made him wary of strangers  wont you sit down he said  a waiter was bringing a chair the young man seated himself  by the way added billy my friend mr smith  pleased to meet you said the other  i dont know your name billy hesitated  never mind about my name said the stranger it wont be needed is mr smith on your paper excuse my asking  psmith bowed thats all right then i can go ahead he bent forward  neither of you gentlemen are hard of hearing eh  in the old prairie days said psmith comrade windsor was known to the indians as boolabanagosh which as you doubtless know signifies bigchiefwhocanhearaflyclearitsthroat i too can hear as well as the next man why  thats all right then i dont want to have to shout it theres some things its better not to yell  he turned to billy who had been looking at him all the while with a combination of interest and suspicion the man might or might not be friendly in the meantime there was no harm in being on ones guard billys experience as a cubreporter had given him the knowledge that is only given in its entirety to police and newspaper men that there are two new yorks one is a modern wellpoliced city through which one may walk from end to end without encountering adventure the other is a city as full of sinister intrigue of whisperings and conspiracies of battle murder and sudden death in dark byways as any town of mediaeval italy given certain conditions anything may happen to any one in new york and billy realised that these conditions now prevailed in his own case he had come into conflict with new yorks underworld circumstances had placed him below the surface where only his wits could help him  its about that tenement business said the stranger  billy bristled well what about it he demanded truculently  the stranger raised a long and curiously delicately shaped hand dont bite at me he said this isnt my funeral ive no kick coming im a friend  yet you dont tell us your name  never mind my name if you were in my line of business you wouldnt be so durned stuck on this name thing call me smith if you like  you could select no nobler pseudonym said psmith cordially  eh oh i see well make it brown then anything you please it dont signify see here lets get back about this tenement thing you understand certain parties have got it in against you  a charming conversationalist one comrade parker hinted at something of the sort said psmith in a recent interview cosy moments however cannot be muzzled  well said billy  youre up against a big proposition  we can look after ourselves  gum youll need to the man behind is a big bug  billy leaned forward eagerly  who is he  the other shrugged his shoulders  i dont know you wouldnt expect a man like that to give himself away  then how do you know hes a big bug  precisely said psmith on what system have you estimated the size of the gentlemans bughood  the stranger lit a cigar  by the number of dollars he was ready to put up to have you done in  billys eyes snapped  oh he said and which gang has he given the job to  i wish i could tell you hehis agent that iscame to bat jarvis  the catexpert said psmith a man of singularly winsome personality  bat turned the job down  why was that inquired billy  he said he needed the money as much as the next man but when he found out who he was supposed to lay for he gave his job the frozen face said you were a friend of his and none of his fellows were going to put a finger on you i dont know what youve been doing to bat but hes certainly willie the longlost brother with you  a powerful argument in favour of kindness to animals said psmith comrade windsor came into possession of one of comrade jarviss celebrated stud of cats what did he do instead of having the animal made into a nourishing soup he restored it to its bereaved owner observe the sequel he is now as a prize tortoiseshell to comrade jarvis  so bat wouldnt stand for it said billy  not on his life turned it down without a blink and he sent me along to find you and tell you so  we are much obliged to comrade jarvis said psmith  he told me to tell you to watch out because another gang is dead sure to take on the job but he said you were to know he wasnt mixed up in it he also said that any time you were in bad hed do his best for you youve certainly made the biggest kind of hit with bat i havent seen him so worked up over a thing in years well thats all i reckon guess ill be pushing along ive a date to keep glad to have met you glad to have met you mr smith pardon me you have an insect on your coat  he flicked at psmiths coat with a quick movement psmith thanked him gravely  good night concluded the stranger moving off for a few moments after he had gone psmith and billy sat smoking in silence they had plenty to think about  hows the time going asked billy at length psmith felt for his watch and looked at billy with some sadness  i am sorry to say comrade windsor  hullo said billy heres that man coming back again  the stranger came up to their table wearing a light overcoat over his dress clothes from the pocket of this he produced a gold watch  force of habit he said apologetically handing it to psmith youll pardon me good night gentlemen again     chapter xii  a red taximeter  the astor hotel faces on to times square a few paces to the right of the main entrance the times building towers to the sky and at the foot of this the stream of traffic breaks forming two channels to the right of the building is seventh avenue quiet dark and dull to the left is broadway the great white way the longest straightest brightest wickedest street in the world  psmith and billy having left the astor started to walk down broadway to billys lodgings in fourteenth street the usual crowd was drifting slowly up and down in the glare of the white lights  they had reached herald square when a voice behind them exclaimed why its mr windsor  they wheeled round a flashily dressed man was standing with outstetched hand  i saw you come out of the astor he said cheerily i said to myself i know that man darned if i could put a name to you though so i just followed you along and right here it came to me  it did did it said billy politely  it did sir ive never set eyes on you before but ive seen so many photographs of you that i reckon were old friends i know your father very well mr windsor he showed me the photographs you may have heard him speak of mejack lake how is the old man seen him lately  not for some time he was well when he last wrote  good for him he would be tough as a plank old joe windsor we always called him joe  youd have known him down in missouri of course said billy  thats right in missouri we were sidepartners for years now see here mr windsor its early yet wont you and your friend come along with me and have a smoke and a chat i live right here in thirtythird street id be right glad for you to come  i dont doubt it said billy but im afraid youll have to excuse us  in a hurry are you  not in the least  then come right along  no thanks  say why not its only a step  because we dont want to good night  he turned and started to walk away the other stood for a moment staring then crossed the road  psmith broke the silence  correct me if i am wrong comrade windsor he said tentatively but were you not a trifleshall we say abruptwith the old family friend  billy windsor laughed  if my fathers name was joseph he said instead of being william the same as mine and if hed ever been in missouri in his life which he hasnt and if id been photographed since i was a kid which i havent been i might have gone along as it was i thought it better not to  these are deep waters comrade windsor do you mean to intimate  if they cant do any better than that we shant have much to worry us what do they take us for i wonder farmers playing off a comicsupplement bluff like that on us  there was honest indignation in billys voice  you think then that if we had accepted comrade lakes invitation and gone along for a smoke and a chat the chat would not have been of the pleasantest nature  we should have been put out of business  i have heard so much said psmith thoughtfully of the lavish hospitality of the american  taxi sir  a red taximeter cab was crawling down the road at their side billy shook his head  not that a taxi would be an unsound scheme said psmith  not that particular one if you dont mind  something about it that offends your aesthetic taste queried psmith sympathetically  something about it makes my aesthetic taste kick like a mule said billy  ah we highly strung literary men do have these curious prejudices we cannot help it we are the slaves of our temperaments let us walk then after all the night is fine and we are young and strong  they had reached twentythird street when billy stopped i dont know about walking he said suppose we take the elevated  anything you wish comrade windsor i am in your hands  they cut across into sixth avenue and walked up the stairs to the station of the elevated railway a train was just coming in  has it escaped your notice comrade windsor said psmith after a pause that so far from speeding to your lodgings we are going in precisely the opposite direction we are in an uptown train  i noticed it said billy briefly  are we going anywhere in particular  this train goes as far as hundred and tenth street well go up to there  and then  and then well come back  and after that i suppose well make a trip to philadelphia or chicago or somewhere well well i am in your hands comrade windsor the night is yet young take me where you will it is only five cents a go and we have money in our purses we are two young men out for reckless dissipation by all means let us have it  at hundred and tenth street they left the train went down the stairs and crossed the street halfway across billy stopped  what now comrade windsor inquired psmith patiently have you thought of some new form of entertainment  billy was making for a spot some few yards down the road looking in that direction psmith saw his objective in the shadow of the elevated there was standing a taximeter cab  taxi sir said the driver as they approached  we are giving you a great deal of trouble said billy you must be losing money over this job all this while you might be getting fares downtown  these meetings however urged psmith are very pleasant  i can save you worrying said billy my address is 84 east fourteenth street we are going back there now  search me said the driver i dont know what youre talking about  i thought perhaps you did replied billy good night  these things are very disturbing said psmith when they were in the train dignity is impossible when one is compelled to be the hunted fawn when did you begin to suspect that yonder merchant was doing the sleuthhound act  when i saw him in broadway having a hearttoheart talk with our friend from missouri  he must be something of an expert at the game to have kept on our track  not on your life its as easy as falling off a log there are only certain places where you can get off an elevated train all hed got to do was to get there before the train and wait i didnt expect to dodge him by taking the elevated i just wanted to make certain of his game  the train pulled up at the fourteenth street station in the roadway at the foot of the opposite staircase was a red taximeter cab    chapter xiii  reviewing the situation   arriving at the bedsittingroom billy proceeded to occupy the rockingchair and as was his wont began to rock himself rhythmically to and fro psmith seated himself gracefully on the couchbed there was a silence  the events of the evening had been a revelation to psmith he had not realised before the extent of the ramifications of new yorks underworld that members of the gangs should crop up in the astor roofgarden and in gorgeous raiment in the middle of broadway was a surprise when billy windsor had mentioned the gangs he had formed a mental picture of lowbrowed hooligans keeping carefully to their own quarter of the town this picture had been correct as far as it went but it had not gone far enough the bulk of the gangs of new york are of the hooligan class and are rarely met with outside their natural boundaries but each gang has its more prosperous members gentlemen who like the man of the astor roofgarden support life by more delicate and genteel methods than the rest the main body rely for their incomes except at electiontime on such primitive feats as robbing intoxicated pedestrians the aristocracy of the gangs soar higher  it was a considerable time before billy spoke  say he said this thing wants talking over  by all means comrade windsor  its this way theres no doubt now that were up against a mighty big proposition  something of the sort would seem to be the case  its like this im going to see this through it isnt only that i want to do a bit of good to the poor cusses in those tenements though id do it for that alone but as far as im concerned theres something to it besides that if we win out im going to get a job out of one of the big dailies itll give me just the chance i need see what i mean well its different with you i dont see that its up to you to run the risk of getting yourself put out of business with a blackjack and maybe shot once you get mixed up with the gangs theres no saying whats going to be doing well i dont see why you shouldnt quit all this has got nothing to do with you youre over here on a vacation you havent got to make a living this side you want to go about and have a good time instead of getting mixed up with  he broke off  well thats what i wanted to say anyway he concluded  psmith looked at him reproachfully  are you trying to sack me comrade windsor  hows that  in various treatises on how to succeed in literature said psmith sadly which i have read from time to time i have always found it stated that what the novice chiefly needed was an editor who believed in him in you comrade windsor i fancied that i had found such an editor  whats all this about demanded billy im making no kick about your work  i gathered from your remarks that you were anxious to receive my resignation  well i told you why i didnt want you be blackjacked  was that the only reason  sure  then all is well said psmith relieved for the moment i fancied that my literary talents had been weighed in the balance and adjudged below par if that is allwhy these are the mere everyday risks of the young journalists life without them we should be dull and dissatisfied our work would lose its fire men such as ourselves comrade windsor need a certain stimulus a certain fillip if they are to keep up their high standards the knowledge that a lowbrowed gentleman is waiting round the corner with a sandbag poised in air will just supply that stimulus also that fillip it will give our output precisely the edge it requires  then youll stay in this thing youll stick to the work  like a conscientious leech comrade windsor  bully for you said billy  it was not psmiths habit when he felt deeply on any subject to exhibit his feelings and this matter of the tenements had hit him harder than any one who did not know him intimately would have imagined mike would have understood him but billy windsor was too recent an acquaintance psmith was one of those people who are content to accept most of the happenings of life in an airy spirit of tolerance life had been more or less of a game with him up till now in his previous encounters with those with whom fate had brought him in contact there had been little at stake the prize of victory had been merely a comfortable feeling of having had the best of a battle of wits the penalty of defeat nothing worse than the discomfort of having failed to score but this tenement business was different here he had touched the realities there was something worth fighting for his lot had been cast in pleasant places and the sight of actual raw misery had come home to him with an added force from that circumstance he was fully aware of the risks that he must run the words of the man at the astor and still more the episodes of the family friend from missouri and the taximeter cab had shown him that this thing was on a different plane from anything that had happened to him before it was a fight without the gloves and to a finish at that but he meant to see it through somehow or other those tenement houses had got to be cleaned up if it meant trouble as it undoubtedly did that trouble would have to be faced  now that comrade jarvis he said showing a spirit of forbearance which i am bound to say does him credit has declined the congenial task of fracturing our occiputs who should you say comrade windsor would be the chosen substitute  billy shook his head now that bat has turned up the job it might be any one of three gangs there are four main gangs you know bats is the biggest but the smallest of thems large enough to put us away if we give them the chance  i dont quite grasp the nice points of this matter do you mean that we have an entire gang on our trail in one solid mass or will it be merely a section  well a section i guess if it comes to that parker or whoever fixed this thing up would go to the main boss of the gang if it was the three points hed go to spider reilly if it was the table hill lot hed look up dude dawson and so on  and what then  and then the boss would talk it over with his own special partners every gangleader has about a dozen of them a sort of inner circle theyd fix it up among themselves the rest of the gang wouldnt know anything about it the fewer in the game you see the fewer to split up the dollars  i see then things are not so black all we have to do is to look out for about a dozen hooligans with a natural dignity in their bearing the result of intimacy with the main boss carefully eluding these aristocrats we shall win through i fancy comrade windsor that all may yet be well what steps do you propose to take by way of selfdefence  keep out in the middle of the street and not go off the broadway after dark youre pretty safe on broadway theres too much light for them there  now that our sleuthhound friend in the taximeter has ascertained your address shall you change it  it wouldnt do any good theyd soon find where id gone to how about yours  i fancy i shall be tolerably all right a particularly massive policeman is on duty at my very doors so much for our private lives but what of the daytime suppose these sandbagspecialists drop in at the office during business hours will comrade maloneys frank and manly statement that we are not in be sufficient to keep them out i doubt it all unused to the nice conventions of polite society these rugged persons will charge through in such circumstances good work will be hard to achieve your literary man must have complete quiet if he is to give the public of his best but stay an idea  well  comrade brady the peerless kid the man cosy moments is running for the lightweight championship we are his pugilistic sponsors you may say that it is entirely owing to our efforts that he has obtained this match withwho exactly is the gentleman comrade brady fights at the highfield club on friday night  cyclone al wolmann isnt it  you are right as i was saying but for us the privilege of smiting comrade cyclone al wolmann under the fifth rib on friday night would almost certainly have been denied to him  it almost seemed as if he were right from the moment the paper had taken up his cause kid bradys star had undoubtedly been in the ascendant people began to talk about him as a likely man edgren in the evening world had a paragraph about his chances for the lightweight title tad in the journal drew a picture of him finally the management of the highfield club had signed him for a tenround bout with mr wolmann there were therefore reasons why cosy moments should feel a claim on the kids services  he should continued psmith if equipped in any degree with finer feelings be bubbling over with gratitude towards us but for cosy moments he should be saying to himself where should i be among the alsorans i imagine that he will do any little thing we care to ask of him i suggest that we approach comrade brady explain the facts of the case and offer him at a comfortable salary the post of fightingeditor of cosy moments his duties will be to sit in the room opening out of ours girded as to the loins and full of martial spirit and apply some of those halfscissor hooks of his to the persons of any who overcome the opposition of comrade maloney we meanwhile will enjoy that leisure and freedom from interruption which is so essential to the artist  its not a bad idea said billy  it is about the soundest idea said psmith that has ever been struck one of your newspaper friends shall supply us with tickets and friday night shall see us at the highfield    chapter xiv  the highfield  far up at the other end of the island on the banks of the harlem river there stands the old warehouse which modern progress has converted into the highfield athletic and gymnastic club the imagination stimulated by the title conjures up a sort of national sporting club with pictures on the walls padding on the chairs and a sea of white shirtfronts from roof to floor but the highfield differs in some respects from this fancy picture indeed it would be hard to find a respect in which it does not differ but these names are so misleading the title under which the highfield used to be known till a few years back was swifty bobs it was a good honest title you knew what to expect and if you attended séances at swifty bobs you left your gold watch and your little savings at home but a wave of antipugilistic feeling swept over the new york authorities promoters of boxing contests found themselves to their acute disgust raided by the police the industry began to languish people avoided places where at any moment the festivities might be marred by an inrush of large men in blue uniforms armed with locuststicks  and then some bigbrained person suggested the club idea which stands alone as an example of american dry humour there are now no boxing contests in new york swifty bob and his fellows would be shocked at the idea of such a thing all that happens now is exhibition sparring bouts between members of the club it is true that next day the papers very tactlessly report the friendly exhibition spar as if it had been quite a serious affair but that is not the fault of swifty bob  kid brady the chosen of cosy moments was billed for a tenround exhibition contest to be the main event of the evenings entertainment no decisions are permitted at these clubs unless a regrettable accident occurs and one of the sparrers is knocked out the verdict is left to the newspapers next day it is not uncommon to find a man win easily in the world draw in the american and be badly beaten in the evening mail the system leads to a certain amount of confusion but it has the merit of offering consolation to a muchsmitten warrior  the best method of getting to the highfield is by the subway to see the subway in its most characteristic mood one must travel on it during the rushhour when its patrons are packed into the carriages in one solid jam by muscular guards and policemen shoving in a manner reminiscent of a rugby football scrum when psmith and billy entered it on the friday evening it was comparatively empty all the seats were occupied but only a few of the straps and hardly any of the space reserved by law for the conductor alone  conversation on the subway is impossible the ingenious gentlemen who constructed it started with the object of making it noisy not ordinarily noisy like a ton of coal falling on to a sheet of tin but really noisy so they fashioned the pillars of thin steel and the sleepers of thin wood and loosened all the nuts and now a subway train in motion suggests a prolonged dynamite explosion blended with the voice of some great cataract  psmith forced into temporary silence by this combination of noises started to make up for lost time on arriving in the street once more  a thoroughly unpleasant neighbourhood he said critically surveying the dark streets i fear me comrade windsor that we have been somewhat rash in venturing as far into the middle west as this if ever there was a blighted locality where lowbrowed desperadoes might be expected to spring with whoops of joy from every corner this blighted locality is that blighted locality but we must carry on in which direction should you say does this arena lie  it had begun to rain as they left billys lodgings psmith turned up the collar of his burberry  we suffer much in the cause of literature he said let us inquire of this genial soul if he knows where the highfield is  the pedestrian referred to proved to be going there himself they went on together psmith courteously offering views on the weather and forecasts of the success of kid brady in the approaching contest  rattling on he was alluding to the prominent part cosy moments had played in the affair when a rough thrust from windsors elbow brought home to him his indiscretion  he stopped suddenly wishing he had not said as much their connection with that militant journal was not a thing even to be suggested to casual acquaintances especially in such a particularly illlighted neighbourhood as that through which they were now passing  their companion however who seemed to be a man of small speech made no comment psmith deftly turned the conversation back to the subject of the weather and was deep in a comparison of the respective climates of england and the united states when they turned a corner and found themselves opposite a gloomy barnlike building over the door of which it was just possible to decipher in the darkness the words highfield athletic and gymnastic club  the tickets which billy windsor had obtained from his newspaper friend were for one of the boxes these proved to be sort of sheeppens of unpolished wood each with four hard chairs in it the interior of the highfield athletic and gymnastic club was severely free from anything in the shape of luxury and ornament along the four walls were raised benches in tiers on these were seated as toughlooking a collection of citizens as one might wish to see on chairs at the ringside were the reporters with tickers at their sides by means of which they tapped details of each round through to their downtown offices where writeup reporters were waiting to read off and elaborate the messages in the centre of the room brilliantly lighted by half a dozen electric chandeliers was the ring  there were preliminary bouts before the main event a burly gentleman in shirtsleeves entered the ring followed by two slim youths in fighting costume and a massive person in a red jersey blue serge trousers and yellow braces who chewed gum with an abstracted air throughout the proceedings  the burly gentleman gave tongue in a voice that cleft the air like a cannonball  exhibition fourround bout between patsy milligan and tommy goodley members of this club patsy on my right tommy on my left gentlemen will kindly stop smokin  the audience did nothing of the sort possibly they did not apply the description to themselves possibly they considered the appeal a mere formula somewhere in the background a gong sounded and patsy from the right stepped briskly forward to meet tommy approaching from the left  the contest was short but energetic at intervals the combatants would cling affectionately to one another and on these occasions the redjerseyed man still chewing gum and still wearing the same air of being lost in abstract thought would split up the mass by the simple method of ploughing his way between the pair towards the end of the first round thomas eluding a left swing put patrick neatly to the floor where the latter remained for the necessary ten seconds  the remaining preliminaries proved disappointing so much so that in the last of the series a soured sportsman on one of the benches near the roof began in satirical mood to whistle the merry widow waltz it was here that the redjerseyed thinker for the first and last time came out of his meditative trance he leaned over the ropes and spokewithout heat but firmly  if that guy whistling back up yonder thinks he can do better than these boys he can come right down into the ring  the whistling ceased  there was a distinct air of relief when the last preliminary was finished and preparations for the main bout began it did not commence at once there were formalities to be gone through introductions and the like the burly gentleman reappeared from nowhere ushering into the ring a sheepishlygrinning youth in a flannel suit  interdoocin young leary he bellowed impressively a noo member of this chub who will box some good boy here in september  he walked to the other side of the ring and repeated the remark a raucous welcome was accorded to the new member  two other notable performers were introduced in a similar manner and then the building became suddenly full of noise for a tall youth in a bathrobe attended by a little army of assistants had entered the ring one of the army carried a bright green bucket on which were painted in white letters the words cyclone al wolmann a moment later there was another though a far lesser uproar as kid brady his pleasant face wearing a selfconscious smirk ducked under the ropes and sat down in the opposite corner  exhibition tenround bout thundered the burly gentleman between cyclone al wolmann  loud applause mr wolmann was one of the famous a fighter with a reputation from new york to san francisco he was generally considered the most likely man to give the hitherto invincible jimmy garvin a hard battle for the lightweight championship  oh you al roared the crowd  mr wolmann bowed benevolently  and kid brady members of this  there was noticeably less applause for the kid he was an unknown a few of those present had heard of his victories in the west but these were but a small section of the crowd when the faint applause had ceased psmith rose to his feet  oh you kid he observed encouragingly  i should not like comrade brady he said reseating himself to think that he has no friend but his poor old mother as you will recollect occurred on a previous occasion  the burly gentleman followed by the two armies of assistants dropped down from the ring and the gong sounded  mr wolmann sprang from his corner as if somebody had touched a spring he seemed to be of the opinion that if you are a cyclone it is never too soon to begin behaving like one he danced round the kid with an indiarubber agility the cosy moments representative exhibited more stolidity except for the fact that he was in fighting attitude with one gloved hand moving slowly in the neighbourhood of his stocky chest and the other pawing the air on a line with his square jaw one would have said that he did not realise the position of affairs he wore the friendly smile of the goodnatured guest who is led forward by his hostess to join in some round game  suddenly his opponents long left shot out the kid who had been strolling forward received it under the chin and continued to stroll forward as if nothing of note had happened he gave the impression of being aware that mr wolmann had committed a breach of good taste and of being resolved to pass it off with ready tact  the cyclone having executed a backward leap a forward leap and a feint landed heavily with both hands the kids genial smile did not even quiver but he continued to move forward his opponents left flashed out again but this time instead of ignoring the matter the kid replied with a heavy right swing and mr wolmann leaping back found himself against the ropes by the time he had got out of that uncongenial position two more of the kids swings had found their mark mr wolmann somewhat perturbed scuttered out into the middle of the ring the kid following in his selfcontained solid way  the cyclone now became still more cyclonic he had a left arm which seemed to open out in joints like a telescope several times when the kid appeared well out of distance there was a thud as a brown glove ripped in over his guard and jerked his head back but always he kept boring in delivering an occasional right to the body with the pleased smile of an infant destroying a noahs ark with a tackhammer despite these efforts however he was plainly getting all the worst of it energetic mr wolmann relying on his long left was putting in three blows to his one when the gong sounded ending the first round the house was practically solid for the cyclone whoops and yells rose from everywhere the building rang with shouts of oh you al  psmith turned sadly to billy  it seems to me comrade windsor he said that this merry meeting looks like doing comrade brady no good i should not be surprised at any moment to see his head bounce off on to the floor  wait said billy hell win yet  you think so  sure he comes from wyoming said billy with simple confidence  rounds two and three were a repetition of round one the cyclone raged almost unchecked about the ring in one lightning rally in the third he brought his right across squarely on to the kids jaw it was a blow which should have knocked any boxer out the kid merely staggered slightly and returned to business still smiling  see roared billy enthusiastically in psmiths ear above the uproar he doesnt mind it he likes it he comes from wyoming  with the opening of round four there came a subtle change the cyclones fury was expending itself that long left shot out less sharply instead of being knocked back by it the cosy moments champion now took the hits in his stride and came shuffling in with his damaging bodyblows there were cheers and oh you als at the sound of the gong but there was an appealing note in them this time the gallant sportsmen whose connection with boxing was confined to watching other men fight and betting on what they considered a certainty and who would have expired promptly if any one had tapped them sharply on their wellfilled waistcoats were beginning to fear that they might lose their money after all  in the fifth round the thing became a certainty like the month of march the cyclone who had come in like a lion was going out like a lamb a slight decrease in the pleasantness of the kids smile was noticeable his expression began to resemble more nearly the gloomy importance of the cosy moments photographs yells of agony from panicstricken speculators around the ring began to smite the rafters the cyclone now but a gentle breeze clutched repeatedly hanging on like a leech till removed by the redjerseyed referee  suddenly a grisly silence fell upon the house it was broken by a cowboy yell from billy windsor for the kid battered but obviously content was standing in the middle of the ring while on the ropes the cyclone drooping like a wet sock was sliding slowly to the floor  cosy moments wins said psmith an omen i fancy comrade windsor    chapter xv  an addition to the staff  penetrating into the kids dressingroom some moments later the editorial staff found the winner of the tenround exhibition bout between members of the club seated on a chair having his right leg rubbed by a shockheaded man in a sweater who had been one of his seconds during the conflict the kid beamed as they entered  gents he said come right in mighty glad to see you  it is a relief to me comrade brady said psmith to find that you can see us i had expected to find that comrade wolmanns purposeful buffs had completely closed your starlikes  sure i never felt them hes a good quick boy is al but continued the kid with powerful imagery he couldnt hit a hole in a block of icecream not if he was to use a hammer  and yet at one period in the proceedings comrade brady said psmith i fancied that your head would come unglued at the neck but the fear was merely transient when you began to administer thoseam i correct in sayinghalfscissor hooks to the body why then i felt like some watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes he stared at the pacific  the kid blinked  hows that he inquired  and why did i feel like that comrade brady i will tell you because my faith in you was justified because there before me stood the ideal fightingeditor of cosy moments it is not a post that any weakling can fill there charm of manner cannot qualify a man for the position no one can hold down the job simply by having a kind heart or being good at farmyard imitations no we want a man of thews and sinews a man who would rather be hit on the head with a halfbrick than not and you comrade brady are such a man  the kid turned appealingly to billy  say this gets past me mr windsor put me wise  can we have a couple of words with you alone kid said billy we want to talk over something with you  sure sit down gents jackll be through in a minute  jack who during this conversation had been concentrating himself on his subjects left leg now announced that he guessed that would about do and having advised the kid not to stop and pick daisies but to get into his clothes at once before he caught a chill bade the company good night and retired  billy shut the door  kid he said you know those articles about the tenements weve been having in the paper  sure i read em theyre to the good  psmith bowed  you stimulate us comrade brady this is praise from sir hubert stanley  it was about time some strong josher came and put it across to em added the kid  so we thought comrade parker however totally disagreed with us  parker  thats what im coming to said billy the day before yesterday a man named parker called at the office and tried to buy us off  billys voice grew indignant at the recollection  you gave him the hook i guess queried the interested kid  to such an extent comrade brady said psmith that he left breathing threatenings and slaughter and it is for that reason that we have ventured to call upon you  its this way said billy were pretty sure by this time that whoever the man is this fellow parkers working for has put one of the gangs on to us  you dont say exclaimed the kid gum mr windsor theyre tough propositions those gangs  weve been followed in the streets and once they put up a bluff to get us where they could do us in so weve come along to you we can look after ourselves out of the office you see but what we want is some one to help in case they try to rush us there  in brief a fightingeditor said psmith at all costs we must have privacy no writer can prune and polish his sentences to his satisfaction if he is compelled constantly to break off in order to eject boisterous hooligans we therefore offer you the job of sitting in the outer room and intercepting these bravoes before they can reach us the salary we leave to you there are doubloons and to spare in the old oak chest take what you need and put the restif anyback how does the offer strike you comrade brady  we dont want to get you in under false pretences kid said billy of course they may not come anywhere near the office but still if they did there would be something doing what do you feel about it  gents said the kid its this way  he stepped into his coat and resumed  now that ive made good by getting the decision over al theyll be giving me a chance of a big fight maybe with jimmy garvin well if that happens see what i mean ill have to be going away somewhere and getting into training i shouldnt be able to come and sit with you but if you gents feel like it id be mighty glad to come in till im wanted to go into trainingcamp  great said billy that would suit us all the way up if youd do that kid wed be tickled to death  and touching salary put in psmith  shucks said the kid with emphasis nix on the salary thing i wouldnt take a dime if it hadnt abeen for you gents id have been waiting still for a chance of lining up in the championship class thats good enough for me any old thing you gents want me to do ill do it and glad too  comrade brady said psmith warmly you are if i may say so the goods you are beyond a doubt supremely the stuff we three then handinhand will face the foe and if the foe has good sound sense he will keep right away you appear to be ready shall we meander forth  the building was empty and the lights were out when they emerged from the dressingroom they had to grope their way in darkness it was still raining when they reached the street and the only signs of life were a moist policeman and the distant glare of publichouse lights down the road  they turned off to the left and after walking some hundred yards found themselves in a blind alley  hullo said billy where have we come to  psmith sighed  in my trusting way he said i had imagined that either you or comrade brady was in charge of this expedition and taking me by a known route to the nearest subway station i did not think to ask i placed myself without hesitation wholly in your hands  i thought the kid knew the way said billy  i was just taggin along with you gents protested the lightweight i thought you was taking me right this is the first time i been up here  next time we three go on a little jaunt anywhere said psmith resignedly it would be as well to take a map and a corps of guides with us otherwise we shall start for broadway and finish up at minneapolis  they emerged from the blind alley and stood in the dark street looking doubtfully up and down it  aha said psmith suddenly i perceive a native several natives in fact quite a little covey of them we will put our case before them concealing nothing and rely on their advice to take us to our goal  a little knot of men was approaching from the left in the darkness it was impossible to say how many of them there were psmith stepped forward the kid at his side  excuse me sir he said to the leader but if you can spare me a moment of your valuable time  there was a sudden shuffle of feet on the pavement a quick movement on the part of the kid a chunky sound as of wood striking wood and the man psmith had been addressing fell to the ground in a heap  as he fell something dropped from his hand on to the pavement with a bump and a rattle stooping swiftly the kid picked it up and handed it to psmith his fingers closed upon it it was a short wickedlooking little bludgeon the blackjack of the new york tough  get busy advised the kid briefly    chapter xvi  the first battle  the promptitude and despatch with which the kid had attended to the gentleman with the blackjack had not been without its effect on the followers of the stricken one physical courage is not an outstanding quality of the new york hooligan his personal preference is for retreat when it is a question of unpleasantness with a stranger and in any case even when warring among themselves the gangs exhibit a lively distaste for the hard knocks of handtohand fighting their chosen method of battling is to lie down on the ground and shoot this is more suited to their physique which is rarely great the gangsman as a rule is stunted and slight of build  the kids rapid work on the present occasion created a good deal of confusion there was no doubt that much had been hoped for from speedy attack also the generalship of the expedition had been in the hands of the fallen warrior his removal from the sphere of active influence had left the party without a head and to add to their discomfiture they could not account for the kid psmith they knew and billy windsor they knew but who was this stranger with the square shoulders and the uppercut that landed like a cannonball something approaching a panic prevailed among the gang  it was not lessened by the behaviour of the intended victims billy windsor armed with the big stick which he had bought after the visit of mr parker was the first to join issue he had been a few paces behind the others during the blackjack incident but dark as it was he had seen enough to show him that the occasion was as psmith would have said one for the shrewd blow rather than the prolonged parley with a whoop of the purest wyoming brand he sprang forward into the confused mass of the enemy a moment later psmith and the kid followed and there raged over the body of the fallen leader a battle of homeric type  it was not a long affair the rules and conditions governing the encounter offended the delicate sensibilities of the gang like artists who feel themselves trammelled by distasteful conventions they were damped and could not do themselves justice their forte was longrange fighting with pistols with that they felt en rapport but this vulgar brawling in the darkness with muscular opponents who hit hard and often with sticks and hands was distasteful to them they could not develop any enthusiasm for it they carried pistols but it was too dark and the combatants were too entangled to allow them to use these besides this was not the dear homely old bowery where a gentleman may fire a pistol without exciting vulgar comment it was uptown where curious crowds might collect at the first shot  there was but one thing to be done reluctant as they might be to abandon their fallen leader they must tear themselves away already they were suffering grievously from the stick the blackjack and the lightning blows of the kid for a moment they hung wavering then stampeded in half a dozen different directions melting into the night whence they had come  billy full of zeal pursued one fugitive some fifty yards down the street but his quarry exhibiting a rare turn of speed easily outstripped him  he came back panting to find psmith and the kid examining the fallen leader of the departed ones with the aid of a match which went out just as billy arrived  it is our friend of the earlier part of the evening comrade windsor said psmith the merchant with whom we hobnobbed on our way to the highfield in a moment of imprudence i mentioned cosy moments i fancy that this was his first intimation that we were in the offing his visit to the highfield was paid i think purely from sportloving motives he was not on our trail he came merely to see if comrade brady was proficient with his hands subsequent events must have justified our fighting editor in his eyes it seems to be a moot point whether he will ever recover consciousness  mighty good thing if he doesnt said billy uncharitably  from one point of view comrade windsor yes such an event would undoubtedly be an excellent thing for the public good but from our point of view it would be as well if he were to sit up and take notice we could ascertain from him who he is and which particular collection of hornyhandeds he represents light another match comrade brady  the kid did so the head of it fell off and dropped upon the upturned face the hooligan stirred shook himself sat up and began to mutter something in a foggy voice  hes still woozy said the kid  stillwhat exactly comrade brady  in the air explained the kid bats in the belfry dizzy see what i mean its often like that when a feller puts one in with a bit of weight behind it just where that one landed gum i remember when i fought martin kelly i was only starting to learn the game then martin and me was mixing it good and hard all over the ring when suddenly he puts over a stiff one right on the point what do you think i done fall down and take the count not on your life i just turns round and walks straight out of the ring to my dressingroom willie harvey who was seconding me comes tearing in after me and finds me getting into my clothes whats doing kid he asks im going fishin willie i says its a lovely day youve lost the fight he says fight says i what fight see what i mean i hadnt a notion of what had happened it was a half an hour and more before i could remember a thing  during this reminiscence the man on the ground had contrived to clear his mind of the mistiness induced by the kids uppercut the first sign he showed of returning intelligence was a sudden dash for safety up the road but he had not gone five yards when he sat down limply  the kid was inspired to further reminiscence guess hes feeling pretty poor he said its no good him trying to run for a while after hes put his chin in the way of a real live one i remember when joe peterson put me out way back when i was new to the gameit was the same year i fought martin kelly he had an awful punch had old joe and he put me down and out in the eighth round after the fight they found me on the fireescape outside my dressingroom come in kid says they its all right chaps i says im dying like that its all right chaps im dying same with this guy see what i mean  they formed a group about the fallen blackjack expert  pardon us said psmith courteously for breaking in upon your reverie but if you could spare us a moment of your valuable time there are one or two things which we should like to know  sure thing agreed the kid  in the first place continued psmith would it be betraying professional secrets if you told us which particular bevy of energetic sandbaggers it is to which you are attached  gent explained the kid wants to know whats your gang  the man on the ground muttered something that to psmith and billy was unintelligible  it would be a charity said the former if some philanthropist would give this blighter elocution lessons can you interpret comrade brady  says its the three points said the kid  the three points let me see is that dude dawson comrade windsor or the other gentleman  its spider reilly dude dawson runs the table hill crowd  perhaps this is spider reilly  nope said the kid i know the spider this aint him this is some other mutt  which other mutt in particular asked psmith try and find out comrade brady you seem to be able to understand what he says to me personally his remarks sound like the output of a gramophone with a hot potato in its mouth  says hes jack repetto announced the interpreter  there was another interruption at this moment the bashful mr repetto plainly a man who was not happy in the society of strangers made another attempt to withdraw reaching out a pair of lean hands he pulled the kids legs from under him with a swift jerk and wriggling to his feet started off again down the road once more however desire outran performance he got as far as the nearest streetlamp but no farther the giddiness seemed to overcome him again for he grasped the lamppost and sliding slowly to the ground sat there motionless  the kid whose fall had jolted and bruised him was inclined to be wrathful and vindictive he was the first of the three to reach the elusive mr repetto and if that worthy had happened to be standing instead of sitting it might have gone hard with him but the kid was not the man to attack a fallen foe he contented himself with brushing the dust off his person and addressing a richly abusive flow of remarks to mr repetto  under the rays of the lamp it was possible to discern more closely the features of the blackjack exponent there was a subtle but noticeable resemblance to those of mr bat jarvis apparently the latters oiled forelock worn low over the forehead was more a concession to the general fashion prevailing in gang circles than an expression of personal taste mr repetto had it too in his case it was almost white for the fallen warrior was an albino his eyes which were closed had white lashes and were set as near together as nature had been able to manage without actually running them into one another his underlip protruded and drooped looking at him one felt instinctively that no judging committee of a beauty contest would hesitate a moment before him  it soon became apparent that the light of the lamp though bestowing the doubtful privilege of a clearer view of mr repettos face held certain disadvantages scarcely had the staff of cosy moments reached the faint yellow pool of light in the centre of which mr repetto reclined than with a suddenness which caused them to leap into the air there sounded from the darkness down the road the crackcrackcrack of a revolver instantly from the opposite direction came other shots three bullets flicked grooves in the roadway almost at billys feet the kid gave a sudden howl psmiths hat suddenly imbued with life sprang into the air and vanished whirling into the night  the thought did not come to them consciously at the moment there being little time to think but it was evident as soon as diving out of the circle of light into the sheltering darkness they crouched down and waited for the next move that a somewhat skilful ambush had been effected the other members of the gang who had fled with such remarkable speed had by no means been eliminated altogether from the game while the questioning of mr repetto had been in progress they had crept back unperceived except by mr repetto himself it being too dark for successful shooting it had become mr repettos task to lure his captors into the light which he had accomplished with considerable skill  for some minutes the battle halted there was dead silence the circle of light was empty now mr repetto had vanished a tentative shot from nowhere ripped through the air close to where psmith lay flattened on the pavement and then the pavement began to vibrate and give out a curious resonant sound to psmith it conveyed nothing but to the opposing army it meant much they knew it for what it was somewhereit might be near or fara policeman had heard the shots and was signalling for help to other policemen along the line by beating on the flagstones with his nightstick the new york constables substitute for the london policewhistle  the noise grew filling the still air from somewhere down the road sounded the ring of running feet  de cops cried a voice beat it  next moment the night was full of clatter the gang was beating it  psmith rose to his feet and dusted his clothes ruefully for the first time he realised the horrors of war his hat had gone for ever his trousers could never be the same again after their close acquaintance with the pavement  the rescue party was coming up at the gallop  the new york policeman may lack the quiet dignity of his london rival but he is a hustler  whats doing  nothing now said the disgusted voice of billy windsor from the shadows theyve beaten it  the circle of lamplight became as if by mutual consent a general rendezvous three greyclad policemen tough cleanshaven men with keen eyes and square jaws stood there revolver in one hand nightstick in the other psmith hatless and dusty joined them billy windsor and the kid the latter bleeding freely from his left ear the lobe of which had been chipped by a bullet were the last to arrive  whats bin the rough house inquired one of the policemen mildly interested  do you know a sportsman of the name of repetto inquired psmith  jack repetto sure  he belongs to the three points said another intelligent officer as one naming some fashionable club  when next you see him said psmith i should be obliged if you would use your authority to make him buy me a new hat i could do with another pair of trousers too but i will not press the trousers a new hat is however essential mine has a sixinch hole in it  shot at you did they said one of the policemen as who should say dash the lads theyre always up to some of their larks  shot at us burst out the ruffled kid what do you thinks bin happening think an aeroplane ran into my ear and took half of it off think the noise was somebody opening bottles of pop think those guys that sneaked off down the road was just training for a marathon  comrade brady said psmith touches the spot he  say are you kid brady inquired one of the officers for the first time the constabulary had begun to display any real animation  reckoned id seen you somewhere said another you licked cyclone al all right kid i hear  and who but a bonehead thought he wouldnt demanded the third warmly he could whip a dozen cyclone als in the same evening with his eyes shut  hes the next champeen admitted the first speaker  if he puts it over jimmy garvin argued the second  jimmy garvin cried the third he can whip twenty jimmy garvins with his feet tied i tell you  i am loath observed psmith to interrupt this very impressive brainbarbecue but trivial as it may seem to you to me there is a certain interest in this other little matter of my ruined hat i know that it may strike you as hypersensitive of us to protest against being riddled with bullets but  well whats bin doin inquired the force it was a nuisance this perpetual harping on trifles when the deep question of the lightweight championship of the world was under discussion but the sooner it was attended to the sooner it would be over  billy windsor undertook to explain  the three points laid for us he said jack repetto was bossing the crowd i dont know who the rest were the kid put one over on to jack repettos chin and we were asking him a few questions when the rest came back and started into shooting then we got to cover quick and you came up and they beat it  that said psmith nodding is a very fair précis of the evenings events we should like you if you will be so good to corral this comrade repetto and see that he buys me a new hat  well round jack up said one of the policemen indulgently  do it nicely urged psmith dont go hurting his feelings  the second policeman gave it as his opinion that jack was getting too gay the third policeman conceded this jack he said had shown signs for some time past of asking for it in the neck it was an error on jacks part he gave his hearers to understand to assume that the lid was completely off the great city of new york  too blamed fresh hes gettin the trio agreed they could not have been more disapproving if they had been prefects at haileybury and mr repetto a firsttermer who had been detected in the act of wearing his cap on the back of his head  they seemed to think it was too bad of jack  the wrath of the law said psmith is very terrible we will leave the matter then in your hands in the meantime we should be glad if you would direct us to the nearest subway station just at the moment the cheerful lights of the great white way are what i seem to chiefly need    chapter xvii  guerilla warfare  thus ended the opening engagement of the campaign seemingly in a victory for the cosy moments army billy windsor however shook his head  weve got mighty little out of it he said  the victory said psmith was not bloodless comrade bradys ear my hatthese are not slight casualties on the other hand surely we are one up surely we have gained ground the elimination of comrade repetto from the scheme of things in itself is something i know few men i would not rather meet in a lonely road than comrade repetto he is one of natures sandbaggers probably the thing crept upon him slowly he started possibly in a merely tentative way by slugging one of the family circle his nurse let us say or his young brother but once started he is unable to resist the craving the thing grips him like dramdrinking he sandbags now not because he really wants to but because he cannot help himself to me there is something consoling in the thought that comrade repetto will no longer be among those present  what makes you think that  i should imagine that a benevolent law will put him away in his little cell for at least a brief spell  not on your life said billy hell prove an alibi  psmiths eyeglass dropped out of his eye he replaced it and gazed astonished at billy  an alibi when three keeneyed men actually caught him at it  he can find thirty toughs to swear he was five miles away  and get the court to believe it said psmith  sure said billy disgustedly you dont catch them hurting a gangsman unless theyre pushed against the wall the politicians dont want the gangs in gaol especially as the aldermanic elections will be on in a few weeks did you ever hear of monk eastman  i fancy not comrade windsor if i did the name has escaped me who was this cleric  he was the first boss of the east side gang before kid twist took it on  yes  he was arrested dozens of times but he always got off do you know what he said once when they pulled him for thugging a fellow out in new jersey  i fear not comrade windsor tell me all  he said youre arresting me huh say you want to look where youre goin i cut some ice in this town i made half the big politicians in new york that was what he said  his smalltalk said psmith seems to have been bright and wellexpressed what happened then was he restored to his friends and his relations  sure he was what do you think well jack repetto isnt monk eastman but hes in with spider reilly and the spiders in with the men behind jackll get off  it looks to me comrade windsor said psmith thoughtfully as if my stay in this great city were going to cost me a small fortune in hats  billys prophecy proved absolutely correct the police were as good as their word in due season they rounded up the impulsive mr repetto and he was haled before a magistrate and then what a beautiful exhibition of brotherly love and auldlangsyne camaraderie was witnessed one by one smirking sheepishly but giving out their evidence with unshaken earnestness eleven greasy wanderingeyed youths mounted the witnessstand and affirmed on oath that at the time mentioned dear old jack had been making merry in their company in a genial and lawabiding fashion many many blocks below the scene of the regrettable assault the magistrate discharged the prisoner and the prisoner meeting billy and psmith in the street outside leered triumphantly at them  billy stepped up to him you may have wriggled out of this he said furiously but if you dont get a move on and quit looking at me like that ill knock you over the singer building hump yourself  mr repetto humped himself  so was victory turned into defeat and billys jaw became squarer and his eye more full of the light of battle than ever and there was need of a square jaw and a battlelit eye for now began a period of guerilla warfare such as no new york paper had ever had to fight against  it was wheeler the gaunt manager of the business side of the journal who first brought it to the notice of the editorial staff wheeler was a man for whom in business hours nothing existed but his job and his job was to look after the distribution of the paper as to the contents of the paper he was absolutely ignorant he had been with cosy moments from its start but he had never read a line of it he handled it as if it were so much soap the scholarly writings of mr wilberfloss the mirthprovoking sallies of mr b henderson asher the tender outpourings of louella granville watermanall these were things outside his ken he was a distributor and he distributed  a few days after the restoration of mr repetto to east side society mr wheeler came into the editorial room with information and desire for information  he endeavoured to satisfy the latter first  whats doing anyway he asked he then proceeded to his information some ones got it in against the paper sure he said i dont know what its all about i hant never read the thing dont see what any one could have against a paper with a name like cosy moments anyway the way things have been going last few days seems it might be the organ of a blamed miningcamp what the boys have took a dislike to  whats been happening asked billy with gleaming eyes  why nothing in the world to fuss about only our carriers cant go out without being beaten up by gangs of toughs pat harrigans in the hospital now just been looking in on him pats a feller who likes to fight rather fight he would than see a ballgame but this was too much for him know what happened why see here just like this it was pat goes out with his cart passing through a lowdown street on his way uptown hes held up by a bunch of toughs he shows fight half a dozen of them attend to him while the rest gets clean away with every copy of the paper there was in the cart when the cop comes along theres pat in pieces on the ground and nobody in sight but a dago chewing gum cop asks the dago whats been doing and the dago says hes only just come round the corner and hant seen nothing of anybody what i want to know is whats it all about whos got it in for us and why  mr wheeler leaned back in his chair while billy his hair rumpled more than ever and his eyes glowing explained the situation mr wheeler listened absolutely unmoved and when the narrative had come to an end gave it as his opinion that the editorial staff had sand that was his sole comment its up to you he said rising you know your business say though some one had better get busy right quick and do something to stop these guys roughhousing like this if we get a few more carriers beat up the way pat was therell be a strike its not as if they were all irishmen the most of them are dagoes and such and they dont want any more fight than they can get by beating their wives and kicking kids off the sidewalk ill do my best to get this paper distributed right and its a shame if it aint because its going big just nowbut its up to you good day gents  he went out psmith looked at billy  as comrade wheeler remarks he said it is up to us what do you propose to do about it this is a move of the enemy which i have not anticipated i had fancied that their operations would be confined exclusively to our two selves if they are going to strew the street with our carriers we are somewhat in the soup  billy said nothing he was chewing the stem of an unlighted pipe psmith went on  it means of course that we must buck up to a certain extent if the campaign is to be a long one they have us where the hair is crisp we cannot stand the strain cosy moments cannot be muzzled but it can undoubtedly be choked what we want to do is to find out the name of the man behind the tenements as soon as ever we can and publish it and then if we perish fall yelling the name  billy admitted the soundness of this scheme but wished to know how it was to be done  comrade windsor said psmith i have been thinking this thing over and it seems to me that we are on the wrong track or rather we arent on any track at all we are simply marking time what we want to do is to go out and hustle round till we stir up something our line up to the present has been to sit at home and scream vigorously in the hope of some stout fellow hearing and rushing to help in other words weve been saying in the paper what an outsize in scugs the merchant must be who owns those tenements in the hope that somebody else will agree with us and be sufficiently interested to get to work and find out who the blighter is thats all wrong what we must do now comrade windsor is put on our hats such hats as comrade repetto has left us and sally forth as sleuthhounds on our own account  yes but how demanded billy thats all right in theory but hows it going to work in practice the only thing that can corner the man is a commission  far from it comrade windsor the job may be worked more simply i dont know how often the rents are collected in these places but i should say at a venture once a week my idea is to hang negligently round till the rentcollector arrives and when he has loomed up on the horizon buttonhole him and ask him quite politely as man to man whether he is collecting those rents for himself or for somebody else and if somebody else who that somebody else is simple i fancy yet brainy do you take me comrade windsor  billy sat up excited i believe youve hit it  psmith shot his cuffs modestly     chapter xviii  an episode by the way  it was pugsy maloney who on the following morning brought to the office the gist of what is related in this chapter pugsys version was however brief and unadorned as was the way with his narratives such things as first causes and piquant details he avoided as tending to prolong the telling excessively thus keeping him from perusal of his cowboy stories the way pugsy put it was as follows he gave the thing out merely as an item of general interest a bubble on the surface of the life of a great city he did not know how nearly interested were his employers in any matter touching that gang which is known as the three points pugsy said deres trouble down where i live dude dawsons mad at spider reilly an now de table hills are layin for de tree points sure he had then retired to his outer fastness yielding further details jerkily and with the distrait air of one whose mind is elsewhere  skilfully extracted and pieced together these details formed themselves into the following typical narrative of east side life in new york  the really important gangs of new york are four there are other less important institutions but these are little more than mere friendly gatherings of old boyhood chums for purposes of mutual companionship in time they may grow as did bat jarviss coterie into formidable organisations for the soil is undoubtedly propitious to such growth but at present the amount of ice which good judges declare them to cut is but small they stick up an occasional wayfarer for his cush and they carry canisters and sometimes fire them off but these things do not signify the cutting of ice in matters political there are only four gangs which count the east side the groome street the three points and the table hill greatest of these by virtue of their numbers are the east side and the groome street the latter presided over at the time of this story by mr bat jarvis these two are colossal and though they may fight each other are immune from attack at the hands of lesser gangs but between the other gangs and especially between the table hill and the three points which are much of a size warfare rages as briskly as among the republics of south america there has always been bad blood between the table hill and the three points and until they wipe each other out after the manner of the kilkenny cats it is probable that there always will be little events trifling in themselves have always occurred to shatter friendly relations just when there has seemed a chance of their being formed thus just as the table hillites were beginning to forgive the three points for shooting the redoubtable paul horgan down at coney island a three pointer injudiciously wiped out another of the rival gang near canal street he pleaded selfdefence and in any case it was probably mere thoughtlessness but nevertheless the table hillites were ruffled  that had been a month or so back during that month things had been simmering down and peace was just preparing to brood when there occurred the incident to which pugsy had alluded the regrettable falling out of dude dawson and spider reilly at mr maginniss dancing saloon shamrock hall the same which bat jarvis had been called in to protect in the days before the groome street gang began to be  shamrock hall being under the eyes of the great bat was of course forbidden ground and it was with no intention of spoiling the harmony of the evening that mr dawson had looked in he was there in a purely private and peaceful character  as he sat smoking sipping and observing the revels there settled at the next table mr robert nigger coston an eminent member of the three points  there being temporary peace between the two gangs the great men exchanged a not unfriendly nod and after a short pause a word or two mr coston alluding to an italian who had just pirouetted past remarked that there sure was some class to the way that wop hit it up mr dawson said yup there sure was you would have said that all nature smiled  alas the next moment the sky was covered with black clouds and the storm broke for mr dawson continuing in this vein of criticism rather injudiciously gave it as his opinion that one of the lady dancers had two left feet  for a moment mr coston did not see which lady was alluded to  de goil in de pink skoit said mr dawson facilitating the others search by pointing with a muchchewed cigarette it was at this moment that natures smile was shut off as if by a tap for the lady in the pink skirt had been in receipt of mr costons respectful devotion for the past eight days  from this point onwards the march of events was rapid  mr coston rising asked mr dawson who he thought he mr dawson was  mr dawson extinguishing his cigarette and placing it behind his ear replied that he was the fellow who could bite his mr costons head off  mr coston said huh  mr dawson said sure  mr coston called mr dawson a piefaced rubbernecked fourflusher  mr dawson called mr coston a coon  and that was where the trouble really started  it was secretly a great grief to mr coston that his skin was of so swarthy a hue to be permitted to address mr coston face to face by his nickname was a sign of the closest friendship to which only spider reilly jack repetto and one or two more of the gang could aspire others spoke of him as nigger or more briefly nigstrictly behind his back for mr coston had a wide reputation as a fighter and his particular mode of battling was to descend on his antagonist and bite him into this action he flung himself with the passionate abandonment of the artist when he bit he bit he did not nibble  if a friend had called mr coston nig he would have been running grave risks a stranger and a leader of a rival gang who addressed him as coon was more than asking for trouble he was pleading for it  great men seldom waste time mr coston leaning towards mr dawson promptly bit him on the cheek mr dawson bounded from his seat such was the excitement of the moment that instead of drawing his canister he forgot that he had one on his person and seizing a mug which had held beer bounced it vigorously on mr costons skull which being of solid wood merely gave out a resonant note and remained unbroken  so far the honours were comparatively even with perhaps a slight balance in favour of mr coston but now occurred an incident which turned the scale and made war between the gangs inevitable in the far corner of the room surrounded by a crowd of admiring friends sat spider reilly monarch of the three points he had noticed that there was a slight disturbance at the other side of the hall but had given it little attention till the dancing ceasing suddenly and the floor emptying itself of its crowd he had a plain view of mr dawson and mr coston squaring up at each other for the second round we must assume that mr reilly was not thinking what he did for his action was contrary to all rules of gangetiquette in the street it would have been perfectly legitimate even praiseworthy but in a dancehall belonging to a neutral power it was unpardonable  what he did was to produce his canister and pick off the unsuspecting mr dawson just as that exquisite was preparing to get in some more good work with the beermug the leader of the table hillites fell with a crash shot through the leg and spider reilly together with mr coston and others of the three points sped through the doorway for safety fearing the wrath of bat jarvis who it was known would countenance no such episodes at the dancehall which he had undertaken to protect  mr dawson meanwhile was attended to and helped home willing informants gave him the name of his aggressor and before morning the table hill camp was in ferment shooting broke out in three places though there were no casualties when the day dawned there existed between the two gangs a state of war more bitter than any in their record for this time it was no question of obscure nonentities chieftain had assaulted chieftain royal blood had been spilt                            comrade windsor said psmith when master maloney had spoken his last word we must take careful note of this little matter i rather fancy that sooner or later we may be able to turn it to our profit i am sorry for dude dawson anyhow though i have never met him i have a sort of instinctive respect for him a man such as he would feel a bullet through his trouserleg more than one of common clay who cared little how his clothes looked    chapter xix  in pleasant street  careful inquiries conducted incognito by master maloney among the denizens of pleasant street brought the information that rents in the tenements were collected not weekly but monthly a fact which must undoubtedly cause a troublesome hitch in the campaign rentday announced pugsy fell on the last day of the month  i rubbered around he said and did de sleut act and i finds tings out deres a feller comes round bout supper time dat day an den its up to de famlies what lives in de tenements to dig down into deir jeans fer de stuff or out dey goes dat same night  evidently a hustler our nameless friend said psmith  i got dat from a kid what knows anuder kid what lives dere explained master maloney say he proceeded confidentially dat kids in bad sure he is dat second kid de one what lives dere hes a wop kid an  a what comrade maloney  a wop a dago why dont you get next why an italian sure dats right well dis kid he is sure to de bad cos his father come over from italy to work on de subway  i dont see why that puts him in bad said billy windsor wonderingly  nor i agreed psmith your narratives comrade maloney always seem to me to suffer from a certain lack of construction you start at the end and then you go back to any portion of the story which happens to appeal to you at the moment eventually winding up at the beginning why should the fact that this striplings father has come over from italy to work on the subway be a misfortune  why sure because he got fired an went an swatted de foreman one on de coco an de magistrate gives him toity days  and then comrade maloney this thing is beginning to get clearer you are like sherlock holmes after youve explained a thing from start to finishor as you prefer to do from finish to startit becomes quite simple  why den dis kids in bad for fair cos der aint nobody to pungle de bones  pungle de what comrade maloney  de bones de stuff dats right de dollars hes all alone dis kid so when de rentguy blows in whos to slip him over de simoleons itll be outside for his quick  billy warmed up at this tale of distress in his usual way somebody ought to do something its a vile shame the kid being turned out like that  we will see to it comrade windsor cosy moments shall step in we will combine business with pleasure paying the striplings rent and corralling the rentcollector at the same time what is today how long before the end of the month another week a murrain on it comrade windsor two murrains this delay may undo us  but the days went by without any further movement on the part of the enemy a strange quiet seemed to be brooding over the other camp as a matter of fact the sudden outbreak of active hostilities with the table hill contingent had had the effect of taking the minds of spider reilly and his warriors off cosy moments and its affairs much as the unexpected appearance of a mad bull would make a man forget that he had come out butterflyhunting psmith and billy could wait they were not likely to take the offensive but the table hillites demanded instant attention  war had broken out as was usual between the gangs in a somewhat tentative fashion at first sight there had been sniping and skirmishes by the wayside but as yet no pitched battle the two armies were sparring for an opening                         the end of the week arrived and psmith and billy conducted by master maloney made their way to pleasant street to get there it was necessary to pass through a section of the enemys country but the perilous passage was safely negotiated the expedition reached its unsavoury goal intact  the wop kid whose name it appeared was giuseppe orloni inhabited a small room at the very top of the building next to the one psmith and mike had visited on their first appearance in pleasant street he was out when the party led by pugsy up dark stairs arrived and on returning seemed both surprised and alarmed to see visitors pugsy undertook to do the honours pugsy as interpreter was energetic but not wholly successful he appeared to have a fixed idea that the italian language was one easily mastered by the simple method of saying da instead of the and tacking on a final a to any word that seemed to him to need one  say kid he began has da rentaman come yeta  the black eyes of the wop kid clouded he gesticulated and said something in his native language  he hasnt got next reported master maloney he cant git on to me curves dese wop kids is all boneheads say kid looka here he walked out of the room and closed the door then rapping on it smartly from the outside reentered and assuming a look of extreme ferocity stretched out his hand and thundered unbelta slipa me da stuff  the wop kids puzzlement became pathetic  this said psmith deeply interested is getting about as tense as anything i ever struck dont give in comrade maloney who knows but that you may yet win through i fancy the trouble is that your too perfect italian accent is making the youth homesick once more to the breach comrade maloney  master maloney made a gesture of disgust im troo dese dagoes makes me tired dey dont know enough to go upstairs to take de elevated beat it you mutt he observed with moody displeasure to the wop kid accompanying the words with a gesture which conveyed its own meaning the wop kid plainly glad to get away slipped out of the door like a shadow  pugsy shrugged his shoulders  gents he said resignedly its up to youse  i fancy said psmith that this is one of those moments when it is necessary for me to unlimber my sherlock holmes system as thus if the rent collector had been here it is certain i think that comrade spaghetti or whatever you said his name was wouldnt have been that is to say if the rent collector had called and found no money waiting for him surely comrade spaghetti would have been out in the cold night instead of under his own rooftree do you follow me comrade maloney  thats right said billy windsor of course  elementary my dear watson elementary murmured psmith  so all we have to do is to sit here and wait  all said psmith sadly surely it is enough for of all the scaly localities i have struck this seems to me the scaliest the architect of this stately home of america seems to have had a positive hatred for windows his idea of ventilation was to leave a hole in the wall about the size of a lima bean and let the thing go at that if our friend does not arrive shortly i shall pull down the roof why gadzooks not to mention stap my vitals isnt that a trapdoor up there make a longarm comrade windsor  billy got on a chair and pulled the bolt the trapdoor opened downwards it fell disclosing a square of deep blue sky  gum he said fancy living in this atmosphere when you dont have to fancy these fellows keeping that shut all the time  i expect it is an acquired taste said psmith like limburger cheese they dont begin to appreciate air till it is thick enough to scoop chunks out of with a spoon then they get up on their hind legs and inflate their chests and say this is fine this beats ozone hollow leave it open comrade windsor and now as to the problem of dispensing with comrade maloneys services  sure said billy beat it pugsy my lad  pugsy looked up indignant  beat it he queried  while your shoe leathers good said billy this is no place for a ministers son there may be a rough house in here any minute and you would be in the way  i want to stop and pipe de fun objected master maloney  never mind cut off well tell you all about it tomorrow  master maloney prepared reluctantly to depart as he did so there was a sound of a wellshod foot on the stairs and a man in a snuffcoloured suit wearing a brown homburg hat and carrying a small notebook in one hand walked briskly into the room it was not necessary for psmith to get his sherlock holmes system to work his whole appearance proclaimed the newcomer to be the longexpected collector of rents    chapter xx  cornered  he stood in the doorway looking with some surprise at the group inside he was a smallish palefaced man with protruding eyes and teeth which gave him a certain resemblance to a rabbit  hello he said  welcome to new york said psmith  master maloney who had taken advantage of the interruption to edge farther into the room now appeared to consider the question of his departure permanently shelved he sidled to a corner and sat down on an empty soapbox with the air of a dramatic critic at the opening night of a new play the scene looked good to him it promised interesting developments master maloney was an earnest student of the drama as exhibited in the theatres of the east side and few had ever applauded the hero of escaped from singsing or hissed the villain of nellie the beautiful cloakmodel with more fervour than he he liked his drama to have plenty of action and to his practised eye this one promised well psmith he looked upon as a quite amiable lunatic from whom little was to be expected but there was a set expression on billy windsors face which suggested great things  his pleasure was abruptly quenched billy windsor placing a firm hand on his collar led him to the door and pushed him out closing the door behind him  the rent collector watched these things with a puzzled eye he now turned to psmith  say seen anything of the wops that live here he inquired  i am addressing said psmith courteously  my names gooch  psmith bowed  touching these wops comrade gooch he said i fear there is little chance of your seeing them tonight unless you wait some considerable time with one of themthe son and heir of the family i should saywe have just been having a highly interesting and informative chat comrade maloney who has just left us acted as interpreter the father i am told is in the dungeon below the castle moat for a brief spell for punching his foreman in the eye the result the rent is not forthcoming  then its outside for theirs said mr gooch definitely  its a big shame broke in billy turning the kid out wheres he to go  thats up to him nothing to do with me im only acting under orders from up top  whose orders comrade gooch inquired psmith  the gent who owns this joint  who is he said billy  suspicion crept into the protruding eyes of the rent collector he waxed wroth say he demanded who are you two guys anyway and what do you think youre doing here thats what id like to know what do you want with the name of the owner of this place what business is it of yours  the fact is comrade gooch we are newspaper men  i guessed you were said mr gooch with triumph you cant bluff me well its no good boys ive nothing for you youd better chase off and try something else  he became more friendly  say though he said i just guessed you were from some paper i wish i could give you a story but i cant i guess its this cosy moments business thats been and put your editor on to this joint aint it say though thats a queer thing that paper why only a few weeks ago it used to be a sort of takehomeandreadtothekids affair a friend of mine used to buy it regular and then suddenly it comes out with a regular whoop and started knocking these tenements and boosting kid brady and all that i cant understand it all i know is that its begun to get this place talked about why you see for yourselves how it is here is your editor sending you down to get a story about it but say those cosy moments guys are taking big risks i tell you straight they are and that goes i happen to know a thing or two about whats going on on the other side and i tell you theres going to be something doing if they dont cut it out quick mr he stopped and chuckled mr jones isnt the man to sit still and smile hes going to get busy say what paper do you boys come from  cosy moments comrade gooch psmith replied immediately behind you between you and the door is comrade windsor our editor i am psmith i subedit  for a moment the inwardness of the information did not seem to come home to mr gooch then it hit him he spun round billy windsor was standing with his back against the door and a more than nasty look on his face  whats all this demanded mr gooch  i will explain all said psmith soothingly in the first place however this matter of comrade spaghettis rent sooner than see that friend of my boyhood slung out to do the wanderingchild inthesnow act i will brass up for him  confound his rent let me out  business before pleasure how much is it twelve dollars for the privilege of suffocating in this compact little black hole by my halidom comrade gooch that gentleman whose name you are so shortly to tell us has a very fair idea of how to charge but who am i that i should criticise here are the simoleons as our young friend comrade maloney would call them push me over a receipt  let me out  anon gossip anonshakespeare first the receipt  mr gooch scribbled a few words in his notebook and tore out the page psmith thanked him  i will see that it reaches comrade spaghetti he said and now to a more important matter dont put away that notebook turn to a clean page moisten your pencil and write as follows are you ready by the way what is your christian name    gooch gooch this is no way to speak well if you are sensitive on the point we will waive the christian name it is my duty to tell you however that i suspect it to be percy let us push on are you ready once more pencil moistened very well then icomma being of sound mind and bodycommaand a bright little chap altogethercommawhy youre not writing  let me out bellowed mr gooch ill summon you for assault and battery playing a fool game like this get away from that door  there has been no assault and battery yet comrade gooch but who shall predict how long so happy a state of things will last do not be deceived by our gay and smiling faces comrade gooch we mean business let me put the whole position of affairs before you and i am sure a man of your perception will see that there is only one thing to be done  he dusted the only chair in the room with infinite care and sat down billy windsor who had not spoken a word or moved an inch since the beginning of the interview continued to stand and be silent mr gooch shuffled restlessly in the middle of the room  as you justly observed a moment ago said psmith the staff of cosy moments is taking big risks we do not rely on your unsupported word for that we have had practical demonstration of the fact from one j repetto who tried some few nights ago to put us out of business well it struck us both that we had better get hold of the name of the blighter who runs these tenements as quickly as possible before comrade repettos next night out that is what we should like you to give us comrade gooch and we should like it in writing and on second thoughts in ink i have one of those patent nonleakable fountain pens in my pocket the old journalists best friend most of the ink has come out and is permeating the lining of my coat but i think there is still sufficient for our needs remind me later comrade gooch to continue on the subject of fountain pens i have much to say on the theme meanwhile however business business that is the cry  he produced a pen and an old letter the last page of which was blank and began to write  how does this strike you he said ii have left a blank for the christian name you can write it in yourself lateri blank gooch being a collector of rents in pleasant street new york do hereby swearhush comrade gooch there is no need to do it yetthat the name of the owner of the pleasant street tenements who is responsible for the perfectly foul conditions there is and that is where you come in comrade gooch that is where we need your specialised knowledge who is he  billy windsor reached out and grabbed the rent collector by the collar having done this he proceeded to shake him  billy was muscular and his heart was so much in the business that mr gooch behaved as if he had been caught in a high wind it is probable that in another moment the desired information might have been shaken out of him but before this could happen there was a banging at the door followed by the entrance of master maloney for the first time since psmith had known him pugsy was openly excited  say he began youse had better beat it quick you had deys coming  and now go back to the beginning comrade maloney said psmith patiently which in the exuberance of the moment you have skipped who are coming  why dem de guys  psmith shook his head  your habit of omitting essentials comrade maloney is going to undo you one of these days when you get to that ranch of yours you will probably start out to gallop after the cattle without remembering to mount your mustang there are four million guys in new york which section is it that is coming  gum i dont know how many dere is ob dem i seen spider reilly an jack repetto an  say no more said psmith if comrade repetto is there that is enough for me i am going to get on the roof and pull it up after me  billy released mr gooch who fell puffing on to the low bed which stood in one corner of the room  they must have spotted us as we were coming here he said and followed us where did you see them pugsy  on de street just outside dere was a bunch of dem talkin togedder and i hears dem say you was in here one of dem seen you come in an dere aint no ways out but de front so dey aint hurryin dey just reckon to pike along upstairs lookin into each room till dey finds you an deres a bunch of dem goin to wait on de street in case youse beat it past down de stairs while de udder guys is rubberin for youse say gents its pretty fierce dis proposition what are youse goin to do  mr gooch from the bed laughed unpleasantly  i guess you aint the only assaultandbattery artists in the business he said looks to me as if some one else was going to get shaken up some  billy looked at psmith  well he said what shall we do go down and try and rush through  psmith shook his head  not so comrade windsor but about as much otherwise as you can jolly well imagine  well what then  we will stay here or rather we will hop nimbly up on to the roof through that skylight once there we may engage these varlets on fairly equal terms they can only get through one at a time and while they are doing it i will give my celebrated imitation of horatius we had better be moving our luggage fortunately is small merely comrade gooch if you will get through the skylight i will pass him up to you  mr gooch with much verbal embroidery stated that he would not go psmith acted promptly gripping the struggling rent collector round the waist and ignoring his frantic kicks as mere errors in taste he lifted him to the trapdoor whence the head shoulders and arms of billy windsor protruded into the room billy collected the collector and then psmith turned to pugsy  comrade maloney  huh  have i your ear  huh  are you listening till you feel that your ears are the size of footballs then drink this in for weeks you have been praying for a chance to show your devotion to the great cause or if you havent you ought to have been that chance has come you alone can save us in a sense of course we do not need to be saved they will find it hard to get at us i fancy on the roof but it ill befits the dignity of the editorial staff of a great new york weekly to roost like pigeons for any length of time and consequently it is up to you  shall i go for de cops mr smith  no comrade maloney i thank you i have seen the cops in action and they did not impress me we do not want allies who will merely shake their heads at comrade repetto and the others however sternly we want some one who will swoop down upon these merry roisterers and as it were soak to them good do you know where dude dawson lives  the light of intelligence began to shine in master maloneys face his eye glistened with respectful approval this was strategy of the right sort  dude dawson nope but i can ask around  do so comrade maloney and when found tell him that his old college chum spider reilly is here he will not be able to come himself i fear but he can send representatives  sure  thats all then go downstairs with a gay and jaunty air as if you had no connection with the old firm at all whistle a few lively bars make careless gestures thus shall you win through and now it would be no bad idea i fancy for me to join the rest of the brains of the paper up aloft off you go comrade maloney and in passing dont take a week about it leg it with all the speed you possess  pugsy vanished and psmith closed the door behind him inspection revealed the fact that it possessed no lock as a barrier it was useless he left it ajar and jumping up gripped the edge of the opening in the roof and pulled himself through  billy windsor was seated comfortably on mr goochs chest a few feet away by his side was his big stick psmith possessed himself of this and looked about him the examination was satisfactory the trapdoor appeared to be the only means of access to the roof and between their roof and that of the next house there was a broad gulf  practically impregnable he murmured only one thing can dish us comrade windsor and that is if they have the sense to get on to the roof next door and start shooting even in that case however we have cover in the shape of the chimneys i think we may fairly say that all is well how are you getting along has the patient responded at all  not yet said billy but hes going to  he will be in your charge i must devote myself exclusively to guarding the bridge it is a pity that the trap has not got a bolt this side if it had the thing would be a perfect picnic as it is we must leave it open but we mustnt expect everything  billy was about to speak but psmith suddenly held up his hand warningly from the room below came a sound of feet  for a moment the silence was tense then from mr goochs lips there escaped a screech  this way theyre up  the words were cut short as billy banged his hand over the speakers mouth but the thing was done  on top de roof cried a voice deyve beaten it for de roof  the chair rasped over the floor feet shuffled and then like a jackinthebox there popped through the opening a head and shoulders    chapter xxi  the battle of pleasant street  the new arrival was a young man with a shock of red hair an ingrowing roman nose and a mouth from which force or the passage of time had removed three front teeth he held on to the edges of the trap with his hands and stared in a glassy manner into psmiths face which was within a foot of his own  there was a momentary pause broken by an oath from mr gooch who was still undergoing treatment in the background  aha said psmith genially historic picture doctor cook discovers the north pole  the redheaded young man blinked the strong light of the open air was trying to his eyes  youse had better come down he observed coldly weve got youse  and continued psmith unmoved is instantly handed a gumdrop by his faithful esquimaux  as he spoke he brought the stick down on the knuckles which disfigured the edges of the trap the intruder uttered a howl and dropped out of sight in the room below there were whisperings and mutterings growing gradually louder till something resembling coherent conversation came to psmiths ears as he knelt by the trap making meditative billiardshots with the stick at a small pebble  aw gwan dont be a quitter  whos a quitter  youse is a quitter get on top de roof he cant hoit youse  de guys gotten a big stick psmith nodded appreciatively i and roosevelt he murmured  a somewhat baffled silence on the part of the attacking force was followed by further conversation  gum some guys got to go up murmur of assent from the audience a voice in inspired tones let sam do it  this suggestion made a hit there was no doubt about that it was a success from the start quite a little chorus of voices expressed sincere approval of the very happy solution to what had seemed an insoluble problem psmith listening from above failed to detect in the choir of glad voices one that might belong to sam himself probably gratification had rendered the chosen one dumb  yes let sam do it cried the unseen chorus the first speaker unnecessarily perhapsfor the motion had been carried almost unanimouslybut possibly with the idea of convincing the one member of the party in whose bosom doubts might conceivably be harboured went on to adduce reasons  sam bein a coon he argued aint goin to git hoit by no stick youse cant hoit a coon by soakin him on de coco can you sam  psmith waited with some interest for the reply but it did not come possibly sam did not wish to generalise on insufficient experience  solvitur ambulando said psmith softly turning the stick round in his fingers comrade windsor  hullo  is it possible to hurt a coloured gentleman by hitting him on the head with a stick  if you hit him hard enough  i knew there was some way out of the difficulty said psmith with satisfaction how are you getting on up at your end of the table comrade windsor  fine  any result yet  not at present  dont give up  not me  the right spirit comrade win  a report like a cannon in the room below interrupted him it was merely a revolver shot but in the confined space it was deafening the bullet sang up into the sky  never hit me said psmith with dignified triumph  the noise was succeeded by a shuffling of feet psmith grasped his stick more firmly this was evidently the real attack the revolver shot had been a mere demonstration of artillery to cover the infantrys advance  sure enough the next moment a woolly head popped through the opening and a pair of rolling eyes gleamed up at the old etonian  why sam said psmith cordially this is well met i remember you yes indeed i do wasnt you the feller with the open umbereller that i met one rainy morning on the avenue what are you coming up sam i hate to do it but  a yell rang out  what was that asked billy windsor over his shoulder  your statement comrade windsor has been tested and proved correct  by this time the affair had begun to draw a gate the noise of the revolver had proved a fine advertisement the roof of the house next door began to fill up only a few of the occupants could get a clear view of the proceedings for a large chimneystack intervened there was considerable speculation as to what was passing between billy windsor and mr gooch psmiths share in the entertainment was more obvious the early comers had seen his interview with sam and were relating it with gusto to their friends their attitude towards psmith was that of a group of men watching a terrier at a rathole they looked to him to provide entertainment for them but they realised that the first move must be with the attackers they were fairminded men and they did not expect psmith to make any aggressive move  their indignation when the proceedings began to grow slow was directed entirely at the dilatory three pointers with an aggrieved air akin to that of a crowd at a cricket match when batsmen are playing for a draw they began to barrack they hooted the three pointers they begged them to go home and tuck themselves up in bed the men on the roof were mostly irishmen and it offended them to see what should have been a spirited fight so grossly bungled  gwan away home ye quitters roared one  call yersilves the three points do ye an would ye know what i call ye the young ladies seminary bellowed another with withering scorn  a third member of the audience alluded to them as stiffs  i fear comrade windsor said psmith that our blithe friends below are beginning to grow a little unpopular with the manyheaded they must be up and doing if they wish to retain the esteem of pleasant street aha  another and a longer explosion from below and more bullets wasted themselves on air psmith sighed  they make me tired he said this is no time for a feu de joie action that is the cry action get busy you blighters  the irish neighbours expressed the same sentiment in different and more forcible words there was no doubt about itas warriors the three pointers had failed to give satisfaction  a voice from the room called up to psmith  say  you have our ear said psmith  whats that  i said you had our ear  are youse stiffs comin down off out of dat roof  would you mind repeating that remark  are youse guys goin to quit off out of dat roof  your grammar is perfectly beastly said psmith severely  hey  well  are youse guys  no my lad said psmith since you ask we are not and why because the air up here is refreshing the view pleasant and we are expecting at any moment an important communication from comrade gooch  were goin to wait here till youse come down  if you wish it said psmith courteously by all means do who am i that i should dictate your movements the most i aspire to is to check them when they take an upward direction  there was silence below the time began to pass slowly the irishmen on the other roof now definitely abandoning hope of further entertainment proceeded with hoots of scorn to climb down one by one into the recesses of their own house  suddenly from the street far below there came a fusillade of shots and a babel of shouts and countershouts the roof of the house next door which had been emptying itself slowly and reluctantly filled again with a magical swiftness and the low wall facing into the street became black with the backs of those craning over  whats that inquired billy  i rather fancy said psmith that our allies of the table hill contingent must have arrived i sent comrade maloney to explain matters to dude dawson and it seems as if that goldenhearted sportsman had responded there appear to be great doings in the street  in the room below confusion had arisen a scout clattering upstairs had brought the news of the table hillites advent and there was doubt as to the proper course to pursue certain voices urged going down to help the main body others pointed out that that would mean abandoning the siege of the roof the scout who had brought the news was eloquent in favour of the first course  gum he cried dont i keep tellin youse dat de table hills is here sure deres a whole bunch of dem and unless youse come on down deyll bite de hull head off of us lot leave those stiffs on de roof let sam wait here with his canister and den dey cant get down cos samll pump dem full of lead while deyre beatin it troo de trapdoor sure  psmith nodded reflectively  there is certainly something in what the bright boy says he murmured it seems to me the grand rescue scene in the third act has sprung a leak this will want thinking over  in the street the disturbance had now become terrific both sides were hard at it and the irishmen on the roof rewarded at last for their long vigil were yelling encouragement promiscuously and whooping with the unfettered ecstasy of men who are getting the treat of their lives without having paid a penny for it  the behaviour of the new york policeman in affairs of this kind is based on principles of the soundest practical wisdom the unthinking man would rush in and attempt to crush the combat in its earliest and fiercest stages the new york policeman knowing the importance of his own safety and the insignificance of the gangsmans permits the opposing forces to hammer each other into a certain distaste for battle and then when both sides have begun to have enough of it rushes in himself and clubs everything in sight it is an admirable process in its results but it is sure rather than swift  proceedings in the affair below had not yet reached the police interference stage the noise what with the shots and yells from the street and the earpiercing approval of the roofaudience was just working up to a climax  psmith rose he was tired of kneeling by the trap and there was no likelihood of sam making another attempt to climb through he walked towards billy  as he did so billy got up and turned to him his eyes were gleaming with excitement his whole attitude was triumphant in his hand he waved a strip of paper  ive got it he cried  excellent comrade windsor said psmith surely we must win through now all we have to do is to get off this roof and fate cannot touch us are two mammoth minds such as ours unequal to such a feat it can hardly be let us ponder  why not go down through the trap theyve all gone to the street  psmith shook his head  all he replied save sam sam was the subject of my late successful experiment when i proved that coloured gentlemens heads could be hurt with a stick he is now waiting below armed with a pistol readyeven anxiousto pick us off as we climb through the trap how would it be to drop comrade gooch through first and so draw his fire comrade gooch i am sure would be delighted to do a little thing like that for old friends of our standing orbut whats that  whats the matter  is that a ladder that i see before me its handle to my hand it is comrade windsor we win through cosy moments editorial staff may be treed but it cannot be put out of business comrade windsor take the other end of that ladder and follow me  the ladder was lying against the farther wall it was long more than long enough for the purpose for which it was needed psmith and billy rested it on the coping and pushed it till the other end reached across the gulf to the roof of the house next door mr gooch eyeing them in silence the while  psmith turned to him  comrade gooch he said do nothing to apprise our friend sam of these proceedings i speak in your best interests sam is in no mood to make nice distinctions between friend and foe if you bring him up here he will probably mistake you for a member of the staff of cosy moments and loose off in your direction without waiting for explanations i think you had better come with us i will go first comrade windsor so that if the ladder breaks the paper will lose merely a subeditor not an editor  he went down on allfours and in this attitude wormed his way across to the opposite roof whose occupants engrossed in the fight in the street in which the police had now joined had their backs turned and did not observe him mr gooch pallid and obviously illattuned to such feats followed him and finally billy windsor reached the other side  neat said psmith complacently uncommonly neat comrade gooch reminded me of the untamed chamois of the alps leaping from crag to crag  in the street there was now comparative silence the police with their clubs had knocked the last remnant of fight out of the combatants shooting had definitely ceased  i think said psmith that we might now descend if you have no other engagements comrade windsor i will take you to the knickerbocker and buy you a square meal i would ask for the pleasure of your company also comrade gooch were it not that matters of private moment relating to the policy of the paper must be discussed at the table some other day perhaps we are infinitely obliged to you for your sympathetic cooperation in this little matter and now goodbye comrade windsor let us debouch    chapter xxii  concerning mr waring  psmith pushed back his chair slightly stretched out his legs and lit a cigarette the resources of the knickerbocker hotel had proved equal to supplying the fatigued staff of cosy moments with an excellent dinner and psmith had stoutly declined to talk business until the coffee arrived this had been hard on billy who was bursting with his news beyond a hint that it was sensational he had not been permitted to go  more bright young careers than i care to think of said psmith have been ruined by the fatal practice of talking shop at dinner but now that we are through comrade windsor by all means let us have it whats the name which comrade gooch so eagerly divulged  billy leaned forward excitedly  stewart waring he whispered  stewart who asked psmith  billy stared  great scott man he said havent you heard of stewart waring  the name seems vaguely familiar like isinglass or posttoasties i seem to know it but it conveys nothing to me  dont you ever read the papers  i toy with my american of a morning but my interest is confined mainly to the sporting page which reminds me that comrade brady has been matched against one eddie wood a month from today gratifying as it is to find one of the staff getting on in life i fear this will cause us a certain amount of inconvenience comrade brady will have to leave the office temporarily in order to go into training and what shall we do then for a fighting editor however possibly we may not need one now cosy moments should be able shortly to give its message to the world and ease up for a while which brings us back to the point who is stewart waring  stewart waring is running for city alderman hes one of the biggest men in new york  do you mean in girth if so he seems to have selected the right career for himself  hes one of the bosses he used to be commissioner of buildings for the city  commissioner of buildings what exactly did that let him in for  it let him in for a lot of graft  how was that  oh he took it off the contractors shut his eyes and held out his hands when they ran up rotten buildings that a strong breeze would have knocked down and places like that pleasant street hole without any ventilation  why did he throw up the job inquired psmith it seems to me that it was among the worlds softest certain drawbacks to it perhaps to the man with the hairtrigger conscience but i gather that comrade waring did not line up in that class what was his trouble  his trouble said billy was that he stood in with a contractor who was putting up a musichall and the contractor put it up with material about as strong as a heap of meringues and it collapsed on the third night and killed half the audience  and then  the papers raised a howl and they got after the contractor and the contractor gave waring away it killed him for the time being  i should have thought it would have had that excellent result permanently said psmith thoughtfully do you mean to say he got back again after that  he had to quit being commissioner of course and leave the town for a time but affairs move so fast here that a thing like that blows over he made a bit of a pile out of the job and could afford to lie low for a year or two  how long ago was that  five years people dont remember a thing here that happened five years back unless theyre reminded of it  psmith lit another cigarette  we will remind them he said  billy nodded  of course he said one or two of the papers against him in this aldermanic election business tried to bring the thing up but they didnt cut any ice the other papers said it was a shame hounding a man who was sorry for the past and who was trying to make good now so they dropped it everybody thought that waring was on the level now hes been shooting off a lot of hot air lately about philanthropy and so on not that he has actually done a thingnot so much as given a supper to a dozen newsboys but hes talked and talk gets over if you keep it up long enough  psmith nodded adhesion to this dictum  so that naturally he wants to keep it dark about these tenements itll smash him at the election when it gets known  why is he so set on becoming an alderman inquired psmith  theres a lot of graft to being an alderman explained billy  i see no wonder the poor gentleman was so energetic in his methods what is our move now comrade windsor  billy stared  why publish the name of course  but before then how are we going to ensure the safety of our evidence we stand or fall entirely by that slip of paper because weve got the beggars name in the writing of his own collector and thats proof positive  thats all right said billy patting his breastpocket nobodys going to get it from me  psmith dipped his hand into his trouserpocket  comrade windsor he said producing a piece of paper how do we go  he leaned back in his chair surveying billy blandly through his eyeglass billys eyes were goggling he looked from psmith to the paper and from the paper to psmith  whatwhat the he stammered why its it  psmith nodded  how on earth did you get it  psmith knocked the ash off his cigarette  comrade windsor he said i do not wish to cavil or carp or rub it in in any way i will merely remark that you pretty nearly landed us in the soup and pass on to more congenial topics didnt you know we were followed to this place  followed  by a merchant in what comrade maloney would call a tallshaped hat i spotted him at an early date somewhere down by twentyninth street when we dived into sixth avenue for a space at thirtythird street did he dive too he did and when we turned into fortysecond street there he was i tell you comrade windsor leeches were aloof and burrs nonadhesive compared with that tallshapedhatted blighter  yes  do you remember as you came to the entrance of this place somebody knocking against you  yes there was a pretty big crush in the entrance  there was but not so big as all that there was plenty of room for this merchant to pass if he had wished instead of which he butted into you i happened to be waiting for just that so i managed to attach myself to his wrist with some vim and give it a fairly hefty wrench the paper was inside his hand  billy was leaning forward with a pale face  jove he muttered  that about sums it up said psmith  billy snatched the paper from the table and extended it towards him  here he said feverishly you take it gum i never thought i was such a mutt im not fit to take charge of a toothpick fancy me not being on the watch for something of that sort i guess i was so tickled with myself at the thought of having got the thing that it never struck me they might try for it but im through no more for me youre the man in charge now  psmith shook his head  these stately compliments he said do my old heart good but i fancy i know a better plan it happened that i chanced to have my eye on the blighter in the tallshaped hat and so was enabled to land him among the ribstones but who knows but that in the crowd on broadway there may not lurk other unidentified blighters in equally tallshaped hats one of whom may work the same sleightofhand speciality on me it was not that you were not capable of taking care of that paper it was simply that you didnt happen to spot the man now observe me closely for what follows is an exhibition of brain  he paid the bill and they went out into the entrancehall of the hotel psmith sitting down at a table placed the paper in an envelope and addressed it to himself at the address of cosy moments after which he stamped the envelope and dropped it into the letterbox at the back of the hall  and now comrade windsor he said let us stroll gently homewards down the great white way what matter though it be fairly stiff with lowbrowed bravoes in tallshaped hats they cannot harm us from me if they search me thoroughly they may scoop a matter of eleven dollars a watch two stamps and a packet of chewinggum whether they would do any better with you i do not know at any rate they wouldnt get that paper and thats the main thing  youre a genius said billy windsor  you think so said psmith diffidently well well perhaps you are right perhaps you are right did you notice the hired ruffian in the flannel suit who just passed he wore a baffled look i fancy and hark wasnt that a muttered failed i heard or was it the breeze moaning in the treetops tonight is a cold disappointing night for hired ruffians comrade windsor    chapter xxiii  reductions in the staff  the first member of the staff of cosy moments to arrive at the office on the following morning was master maloney this sounds like the beginning of a plod and punctuality or how great fortunes have been made story but as a matter of fact master maloney was no early bird larks who rose in his neighbourhood rose alone he did not get up with them he was supposed to be at the office at nine oclock it was a point of honour with him a sort of daily declaration of independence never to put in an appearance before ninethirty on this particular morning he was punctual to the minute or half an hour late whichever way you choose to look at it  he had only whistled a few bars of my little irish rose and had barely got into the first page of his story of life on the prairie when kid brady appeared the kid as was his habit when not in training was smoking a big black cigar master maloney eyed him admiringly the kid unknown to that gentleman himself was pugsys ideal he came from the plains and had indeed once actually been a cowboy he was a coming champion and he could smoke black cigars it was therefore without his usual wellwhatisitnow air that pugsy laid down his book and prepared to converse  say mr smith or mr windsor about pugsy asked the kid  naw mr brady they aint came yet replied master maloney respectfully  late aint they  sure mr windsor generally blows in before i do  wonder whats keepin them  praps deyve bin put out of business suggested pugsy nonchalantly  hows that  pugsy related the events of the previous day relaxing something of his austere calm as he did so when he came to the part where the table hill allies swooped down on the unsuspecting three pointers he was almost animated  say said the kid approvingly that smith guys got more grey matter under his thatch than youd think to look at him i  comrade brady said a voice in the doorway you do me proud  why say said the kid turning i guess the laughs on me i didnt see you mr smith pugsys been tellin me how you sent him for the table hills yesterday that was cute it was mighty smart but say those guys are goin some aint they now seems as if they was dead set on puttin you out of business  their manner yesterday comrade brady certainly suggested the presence of some sketchy outline of such an ideal in their minds one sam in particular an ebonyhued sportsman threw himself into the task with great vim i rather fancy he is waiting for us with his revolver to this moment but why worry here we are safe and sound and comrade windsor may be expected to arrive at any moment i see comrade brady that you have been matched against one eddie wood  its about that i wanted to see you mr smith say now that things have been and brushed up so what with these gang guys layin for you the way theyre doin i guess youll be needin me around here isnt that right say the word and ill call off this eddie wood fight  comrade brady said psmith with some enthusiasm i call that a sporting offer im very much obliged but we mustnt stand in your way if you eliminate this comrade wood they will have to give you a chance against jimmy garvin wont they  i guess thats right sir said the kid eddie stayed nineteen rounds against jimmy and if i can put him away it gets me into line with jimmy and he cant sidestep me  then go in and win comrade brady we shall miss you it will be as if a ray of sunshine had been removed from the office but you mustnt throw a chance away we shall be all right i think  ill train at white plains said the kid that aint far from here so ill be pretty near in case im wanted hullo whos here  he pointed to the door a small boy was standing there holding a note  mr smith  sir to you said psmith courteously  p smith  the same this is your lucky day  cop at jefferson market give me dis to take to youse  a cop in jefferson market repeated psmith i did not know i had friends among the constabulary there why its from comrade windsor he opened the envelope and read the letter thanks he said giving the boy a quarterdollar  it was apparent the kid was politely endeavouring to veil his curiosity master maloney had no such scruples  whats in de letter boss he inquired  the letter comrade maloney is from our mr windsor and relates in terse language the following facts that our editor last night hit a policeman in the eye and that he was sentenced this morning to thirty days on blackwells island  hes de guy admitted master maloney approvingly  whats that said the kid mr windsor bin punchin cops whats he bin doin that for  he gives no clue i must go and find out could you help comrade maloney mind the shop for a few moments while i push round to jefferson market and make inquiries  sure but say fancy mr windsor cuttin loose that way said the kid admiringly  the jefferson market police court is a little way down town near washington square it did not take psmith long to reach it and by the judicious expenditure of a few dollars he was enabled to obtain an interview with billy in a back room  the chief editor of cosy moments was seated on a bench looking upon the world through a pair of much blackened eyes his general appearance was dishevelled he had the air of a man who has been caught in the machinery  hullo smith he said you got my note all right then  psmith looked at him concerned  comrade windsor he said what on earth has been happening to you  oh thats all right said billy thats nothing  nothing you look as if you had been run over by a motorcar  the cops did that said billy without any apparent resentment they always turn nasty if you put up a fight i was a fool to do it i suppose but i got so mad they knew perfectly well that i had nothing to do with any poolroom downstairs  psmiths eyeglass dropped from his eye  poolroom comrade windsor  yes the house where i live was raided late last night it seems that some gamblers have been running a poolroom on the ground floor why the cops should have thought i had anything to do with it when i was sleeping peacefully upstairs is more than i can understand anyway at about three in the morning there was the dickens of a banging at my door i got up to see what was doing and found a couple of policemen there they told me to come along with them to the station i asked what on earth for i might have known it was no use arguing with a new york cop they said they had been tipped off that there was a poolroom being run in the house and that they were cleaning up the house and if i wanted to say anything id better say it to the magistrate i said all right id put on some clothes and come with them they said they couldnt wait about while i put on clothes i said i wasnt going to travel about new york in pyjamas and started to get into my shirt one of them gave me a shove in the ribs with his nightstick and told me to come along quick and that made me so mad i hit out a chuckle escaped billy he wasnt expecting it and i got him fair he went down over the bookcase the other cop took a swipe at me with his club but by that time i was so mad id have taken on jim jeffries if he had shown up and got in my way i just sailed in and was beginning to make the man think that he had stumbled on stanley ketchel or kid brady or a dynamite explosion by mistake when the other fellow loosed himself from the bookcase and they started in on me together and there was a general rough house in the middle of which somebody seemed to let off about fifty thousand dollars worth of fireworks all in a bunch and i didnt remember anything more till i found myself in a cell pretty nearly knocked to pieces thats my little lifehistory i guess i was a fool to cut loose that way but i was so mad i didnt stop to think  psmith sighed  you have told me your painful story he said now hear mine after parting with you last night i went meditatively back to my fourth avenue address and with a courtly good night to the large policeman who as i have mentioned in previous conversations is stationed almost at my very door i passed on into my room and had soon sunk into a dreamless slumber at about three oclock in the morning i was aroused by a somewhat hefty banging on the door  what  a banging at the door repeated psmith there standing on the mat were three policemen from their remarks i gathered that certain bright spirits had been running a gambling establishment in the lower regions of the buildingwhere i think i told you there is a saloonand the law was now about to clean up the place very cordially the honest fellows invited me to go with them a conveyance it seemed waited in the street without i pointed out even as you appear to have done that seagreen pyjamas with old rose frogs were not the costume in which a shropshire psmith should be seen abroad in one of the worlds greatest cities but they assured memore by their manner than their wordsthat my misgivings were out of place so i yielded these men i told myself have lived longer in new york than i they know what is done and what is not done i will bow to their views so i went with them and after a very pleasant and cosy little ride in the patrol waggon arrived at the police station this morning i chatted a while with the courteous magistrate convinced him by means of arguments and by silent evidence of my open honest face and unwavering eye that i was not a professional gambler and came away without a stain on my character  billy windsor listened to this narrative with growing interest  gum its them he cried  as comrade maloney would say said psmith meaning what comrade windsor  why the fellows who are after that paper they tipped the police off about the poolrooms knowing that we should be hauled off without having time to take anything with us ill bet anything you like they have been in and searched our rooms by now  as regards yours comrade windsor i cannot say but it is an undoubted fact that mine which i revisited before going to the office in order to correct what seemed to me even on reflection certain drawbacks to my costume looks as if two cyclones and a threshing machine had passed through it  theyve searched it  with a finetoothed comb not one of my objects of vertu but has been displaced  billy windsor slapped his knee  it was lucky you thought of sending that paper by post he said we should have been done if you hadnt but say he went on miserably this is awful things are just warming up for the final burst and im out of it all  for thirty days sighed psmith what cosy moments really needs is a sitzredacteur  a what  a sitzredacteur comrade windsor is a gentleman employed by german newspapers with a taste for lèse majesté to go to prison whenever required in place of the real editor the real editor hints in his bright and snappy editorial for instance that the kaisers moustache reminds him of a bad dream the police force swoops down en masse on the office of the journal and are met by the sitzredacteur who goes with them peaceably allowing the editor to remain and sketch out plans for his next weeks article on the crown prince we need a sitzredacteur on cosy moments almost as much as a fighting editor and we have neither  the kid has had to leave then  he wants to go into training at once he very sportingly offered to cancel his match but of course that would never do unless you consider comrade maloney equal to the job i must look around me for some one else i shall be too fully occupied with purely literary matters to be able to deal with chance callers but i have a scheme  whats that  it seems to me that we are allowing much excellent material to lie unused in the shape of comrade jarvis  bat jarvis  the same the catspecialist to whom you endeared yourself somewhat earlier in the proceedings by befriending one of his wandering animals little deeds of kindness little acts of love as you have doubtless heard help etc should we not give comrade jarvis an opportunity of proving the correctness of this statement i think so shortly after youif you will forgive me for touching on a painful subjecthave been haled to your dungeon i will push round to comrade jarviss address and sound him on the subject unfortunately his affection is confined i fancy to you whether he will consent to put himself out on my behalf remains to be seen however there is no harm in trying if nothing else comes of the visit i shall at least have had the opportunity of chatting with one of our most prominent citizens  a policeman appeared at the door  say pal he remarked to psmith youll have to be fading away soon i guess give you three minutes more say it quick  he retired billy leaned forward to psmith  i guess they wont give me much chance he whispered but if you see me around in the next day or two dont be surprised  i fail to follow you comrade windsor  men have escaped from blackwells island before now not many its true but it has been done  psmith shook his head  i shouldnt he said theyre bound to catch you and then you will be immersed in the soup beyond hope of recovery i shouldnt wonder if they put you in your little cell for a year or so  i dont care said billy stoutly id give a year later on to be round and about now  i shouldnt urged psmith all will be well with the paper you have left a good man at the helm  i guess i shant get a chance but ill try it if i do  the door opened and the policeman reappeared  times up i reckon  well goodbye comrade windsor said psmith regretfully abstain from undue worrying its a walkover from now on and theres no earthly need for you to be around the office once i admit this could not have been said but now things have simplified themselves have no fear this act is going to be a scream from start to finish     chapter xxiv  a gathering of catspecialists  master maloney raised his eyes for a moment from his book as psmith reentered the office  deres a guy in dere waitin ter see youse he said briefly jerking his head in the direction of the inner room  a guy waiting to see me comrade maloney with or without a sandbag  says his names jackson said master maloney turning a page  psmith moved quickly to the door of the inner room  why comrade jackson he said with the air of a father welcoming home the prodigal son this is the maddest merriest day of all the glad new year where did you come from  mike looking very brown and in excellent condition put down the paper he was reading  hullo psmith he said i got back this morning were playing a game over in brooklyn tomorrow  no engagements of any importance today  not a thing why  because i propose to take you to visit comrade jarvis whom you will doubtless remember  jarvis said mike puzzled i dont remember any jarvis  let your mind wander back a little through the jungle of the past do you recollect paying a visit to comrade windsors room  by the way where is windsor  in prison well on that evening  in prison  for thirty days for slugging a policeman more of this however anon let us return to that evening dont you remember a certain gentleman with just about enough forehead to keep his front hair from getting all tangled up with his eyebrows  oh the cat chap i know  as you very justly observe comrade jackson the cat chap for going straight to the mark and seizing on the salient point of a situation i know of no one who can last two minutes against you comrade jarvis may have other sides to his characterpossibly manybut it is as a cat chap that i wish to approach him today  whats the idea what are you going to see him for  we corrected psmith i will explain all at a little luncheon at which i trust that you will be my guest already such is the stress of this journalistic life i hear my tissues crying out imperatively to be restored an oyster and a glass of milk somewhere round the corner comrade jackson i think so i think so                        i was reading cosy moments in there said mike as they lunched you certainly seem to have bucked it up rather kid bradys reminiscences are hot stuff  somewhat sizzling comrade jackson admitted psmith they have however unfortunately cost us a fighting editor  hows that  such is the boost we have given comrade brady that he is now never without a match he has had to leave us today to go to white plains to train for an encounter with a certain mr wood a fourounceglove juggler of established fame  i expect you need a fighting editor dont you  he is indispensable comrade jackson indispensable  no rotting has anybody cut up rough about the stuff youve printed  cut up rough gadzooks i need merely say that one critical reader put a bullet through my hat  rot not really  while others kept me treed on top of a roof for the space of nearly an hour assuredly they have cut up rough comrade jackson  great scott tell us  psmith briefly recounted the adventures of the past few weeks  but man said mike when he had finished why on earth dont you call in the police  we have mentioned the matter to certain of the force they appeared tolerably interested but showed no tendency to leap excitedly to our assistance the new york policeman comrade jackson like all great men is somewhat peculiar if you go to a new york policeman and exhibit a black eye he will examine it and express some admiration for the abilities of the citizen responsible for the same if you press the matter he becomes bored and says aint youse satisfied with what youse got gwan his advice in such cases is good and should be followed no since coming to this city i have developed a habit of taking care of myself or employing private help that is why i should like you if you will to come with me to call upon comrade jarvis he is a person of considerable influence among that section of the populace which is endeavouring to smash in our occiputs indeed i know of nobody who cuts a greater quantity of ice if i can only enlist comrade jarviss assistance all will be well if you are through with your refreshment shall we be moving in his direction by the way it will probably be necessary in the course of our interview to allude to you as one of our most eminent living catfanciers you do not object remember that you have in your english home seventyfour fine cats mostly angoras are you on to that then let us be going comrade maloney has given me the address it is a goodish step down on the east side i should like to take a taxi but it might seem ostentatious let us walk                        they found mr jarvis in his groome street fanciers shop engaged in the intellectual occupation of greasing a cats paws with butter he looked up as they entered and began to breathe a melody with a certain coyness  comrade jarvis said psmith we meet again you remember me  nope said mr jarvis pausing for a moment in the middle of a bar and then taking up the air where he had left off psmith was not discouraged  ah he said tolerantly the fierce rush of new york life how it wipes from the retina of today the image impressed on it but yesterday are you with me comrade jarvis  the catexpert concentrated himself on the cats paws without replying  a fine animal said psmith adjusting his eyeglass to which particular family of the felis domestica does that belong in colour it resembles a neapolitan ice more than anything  mr jarviss manner became unfriendly  say what do youse want thats straight aint it if youse want to buy a boid or a snake why dont youse say so  i stand corrected said psmith i should have remembered that time is money i called in here partly on the strength of being a colleague and sidepartner of comrade windsor  mr windsor de gent what caught my cat  the sameand partly in order that i might make two very eminent catfanciers acquainted this he said with a wave of his hand in the direction of the silently protesting mike is comrade jackson possibly the best known of our english catfanciers comrade jacksons stud of angoras is celebrated wherever the kings english is spoken and in hoxton  mr jarvis rose and having inspected mike with silent admiration for a while extended a wellbuttered hand towards him psmith looked on benevolently  what comrade jackson does not know about cats he said is not knowledge his information on angoras alone would fill a volume  saymr jarvis was evidently touching on a point which had weighed deeply upon himwhys catnip called catnip  mike looked at psmith helplessly it sounded like a riddle but it was obvious that mr jarviss motive in putting the question was not frivolous he really wished to know  the word as comrade jackson was just about to observe said psmith is a corruption of catmint why it should be so corrupted i do not know but what of that the subject is too deep to be gone fully into at the moment i should recommend you to read comrade jacksons little brochure on the matter passing lightly on from that  did youse ever have a cat dat ate beetles inquired mr jarvis  there was a time when many of comrade jacksons felidae supported life almost entirely on beetles  did they git thin  mike felt that it was time if he was to preserve his reputation to assert himself  no he replied firmly  mr jarvis looked astonished  english beetles said psmith dont make cats thin passing lightly  i had a cat oncest said mr jarvis ignoring the remark and sticking to his point dat ate beetles and got thin and used to tie itself into knots  a versatile animal agreed psmith  say mr jarvis went on now plainly on a subject near to his heart dem beetles is fierce sure cant keep de cats off of eatin dem i cant first ting you know deyve swallowed dem and den dey gits thin and ties theirselves into knots  you should put them into straitwaistcoats said psmith passing however lightly  say ever have a crosseyed cat  comrade jacksons cats said psmith have happily been almost free from strabismus  deys lucky crosseyed cats is you has a crosseyed cat and notin dont never go wrong but say was dere ever a cat wit one blue eye and one yaller one in your bunch gum its fierce when its like dat its a real skiddoo is a cat wit one blue eye and one yaller one puts you in bad surest ting you know oncest a guy give me a cat like dat and first ting you know im in bad all round it wasnt till i give him away to de cop on de corner and gets me one dats crosseyed dat i lifts de skiddoo off of me  and what happened to the cop inquired psmith interested  oh he got in bad sure enough said mr jarvis without emotion one of de boys what hed pinched and had sent to de island once lays for him and puts one over him wit a blackjack sure dats what comes of havin a cat wit one blue eye and one yaller one  mr jarvis relapsed into silence he seemed to be meditating on the inscrutable workings of fate psmith took advantage of the pause to leave the cat topic and touch on matter of more vital import  tense and exhilarating as is this discussion of the optical peculiarities of cats he said there is another matter on which if you will permit me i should like to touch i would hesitate to bore you with my own private troubles but this is a matter which concerns comrade windsor as well as myself and i know that your regard for comrade windsor is almost an obsession  hows that  i should say said psmith that comrade windsor is a man to whom you give the glad hand  sure hes to the good mr windsor is he caught me cat  he did by the way was that the one that used to tie itself into knots  nope dat was anudder  ah however to resume the fact is comrade jarvis we are much persecuted by scoundrels how sad it is in this world we look to every side we look north east south and west and what do we see mainly scoundrels i fancy you have heard a little about our troubles before this in fact i gather that the same scoundrels actually approached you with a view to engaging your services to do us in but that you very handsomely refused the contract  sure said mr jarvis dimly comprehending  a guy comes to me and says he wants you and mr windsor put through it but i gives him de trun down nuttin done i says mr windsor caught me cat  so i was informed said psmith well failing you they went to a gentleman of the name of reilly  spider reilly  you have hit it comrade jarvis spider reilly the lessee and manager of the three points gang  dose tree points deyre to de bad deyre fresh  it is too true comrade jarvis  say went on mr jarvis waxing wrathful at the recollection what do youse tink dem fresh stiffs done de udder night started some rough woik in me own dancejoint  shamrock hall said psmith  dats right shamrock hall got gay dey did wit some of de table hillers say i got it in for dem gazebos sure i have surest ting you know  psmith beamed approval  that he said is the right spirit nothing could be more admirable we are bound together by our common desire to check the evergrowing spirit of freshness among the members of the three points add to that the fact that we are united by a sympathetic knowledge of the manners and customs of cats and especially that comrade jackson englands greatest fancier is our mutual friend and what more do we want nothing  mr jacksons to de good assented mr jarvis eyeing mike in friendly fashion  we are all to de good said psmith now the thing i wished to ask you is this the office of the paper on which i work was until this morning securely guarded by comrade brady whose name will be familiar to you  de kid  on the bullseye as usual comrade jarvis kid brady the coming lightweight champion of the world well he has unfortunately been compelled to leave us and the way into the office is consequently clear to any sandbag specialist who cares to wander in matters connected with the paper have become so poignant during the last few days that an inrush of these same specialists is almost a certainty unlessand this is where you come in  me  will you take comrade bradys place for a few days  hows that  will you come in and sit in the office for the next day or so and help hold the fort i may mention that there is money attached to the job we will pay for your services how do we go comrade jarvis  mr jarvis reflected but a brief moment  why sure he said me fer dat when do i start  excellent comrade jarvis nothing could be better i am obliged i rather fancy that the gay band of three pointers who will undoubtedly visit the offices of cosy moments in the next few days probably tomorrow are due to run up against the surprise of their lives could you be there at ten tomorrow morning  sure ting ill bring me canister  i should said psmith in certain circumstances one canister is worth a flood of rhetoric till tomorrow then comrade jarvis i am very much obliged to you                        not at all a bad hours work said psmith complacently as they turned out of groome street a vote of thanks to you comrade jackson for your invaluable assistance  it strikes me i didnt do much said mike with a grin  apparently no in reality yes your manner was exactly right reserved yet not haughty just what an eminent catfanciers manner should be i could see that you made a pronounced hit with comrade jarvis by the way if you are going to show up at the office tomorrow perhaps it would be as well if you were to look up a few facts bearing on the feline world there is no knowing what thirst for information a nights rest may not give comrade jarvis i do not presume to dictate but if you were to make yourself a thorough master of the subject of catnip for instance it might quite possibly come in useful    chapter xxv  trapped  mr jarvis was as good as his word on the following morning at ten oclock to the minute he made his appearance at the office of cosy moments his forelock more than usually well oiled in honour of the occasion and his right coatpocket bulging in a manner that betrayed to the initiated eye the presence of the faithful canister with him in addition to his revolver he brought a long thin young man who wore under his brown tweed coat a blueandred striped jersey whether he brought him as an ally in case of need or merely as a kindred soul with whom he might commune during his vigil was not ascertained  pugsy startled out of his wonted calm by the arrival of this distinguished company observed the pair as they passed through into the inner office with protruding eyes and sat speechless for a full five minutes psmith received the newcorners in the editorial sanctum with courteous warmth mr jarvis introduced his colleague  thought id bring him along long ottos his monaker  you did very rightly comrade jarvis psmith assured him your unerring instinct did not play you false when it told you that comrade otto would be as welcome as the flowers in may with comrade otto i fancy we shall make a combination which will require a certain amount of tackling  mr jarvis confirmed this view long otto he affirmed was no rube but a scrapper from biffvilleontheslosh the hardiest hooligan would shrink from introducing roughhouse proceedings into a room graced by the combined presence of long otto and himself  then said psmith i can go about my professional duties with a light heart i may possibly sing a bar or two you will find cigars in that box if you and comrade otto will select one apiece and group yourselves tastefully about the room in chairs i will start in to hit up a slightly spicy editorial on the coming election  mr jarvis regarded the paraphernalia of literature on the table with interest so did long otto who however being a man of silent habit made no comment throughout the seance and the events which followed it he confined himself to an occasional grunt he seemed to lack other modes of expression a charming chap however  is dis where youse writes up pieces fer de paper inquired mr jarvis eyeing the table  it is said psmith in comrade windsors predungeon days he was wont to sit where i am sitting now while i bivouacked over there at the smaller table on busy mornings you could hear our brains buzzing in madison square garden but wait a thought strikes me he called for pugsy  comrade maloney he said if the editorial staff of this paper were to give you a day off could you employ it to profit  surest ting you know replied pugsy with some fervour id take me goil to de bronx zoo  your girl said psmith inquiringly i had heard no inkling of this comrade maloney i had always imagined you one of those strong rugged bloodandiron men who were above the softer emotions who is she  aw shes a kid said pugsy her pa runs a delicatessen shop down our street she aint a bad mutt added the ardent swain im her steady  see that i have a card for the wedding comrade maloney said psmith and in the meantime take her to the bronx as you suggest  wont youse be wantin me today  not today you need a holiday unflagging toil is sapping your physique go up and watch the animals and remember me very kindly to the peruvian llama whom friends have sometimes told me i resemble in appearance and if two dollars would in any way add to the gaiety of the jaunt     sure ting tanks boss  it occurred to me said psmith when he had gone that the probable first move of any enterprising three pointer who invaded this office would be to knock comrade maloney on the head to prevent his announcing him comrade maloneys services are too valuable to allow him to be exposed to unnecessary perils any visitors who call must find their way in for themselves and now to work work the whatsitsname of the thingummy and the thingumabob of the what dyoucallit  for about a quarter of an hour the only sound that broke the silence of the room was the scratching of psmiths pen and the musical expectoration of messrs otto and jarvis finally psmith leaned back in his chair with a satisfied expression and spoke  while as of course you know comrade jarvis he said there is no agony like the agony of literary composition such toil has its compensations the editorial i have just completed contains its measure of balm comrade otto will bear me out in my statement that there is a subtle joy in the manufacture of the wellformed phrase am i not right comrade otto  the long one gazed appealingly at mr jarvis who spoke for him  hes a bit shy on handin out woids is otto he said  psmith nodded  i understand i am a man of few words myself all great men are like that von moltke comrade otto and myself but what are words action is the thing that is the cry action if that is comrade ottos forte so much the better for i fancy that action rather than words is what we may be needing in the space of about a quarter of a minute at least if the footsteps i hear without are as i suspect those of our friends of the three points  jarvis and long otto turned towards the door psmith was right some one was moving stealthily in the outer office judging from the sound more than one person  it is just as well said psmith softly that comrade maloney is not at his customary post now in about a quarter of a minute as i saidaha  the handle of the door began to revolve slowly and quietly the next moment three figures tumbled into the room it was evident that they had not expected to find the door unlocked and the absence of resistance when they applied their weight had had surprising effects two of the three did not pause in their career till they cannoned against the table the third who was holding the handle was more fortunate  psmith rose with a kindly smile to welcome his guests  why surely he said in a pleased voice i thought i knew the face comrade repetto this is a treat have you come bringing me a new hat  the whitehaired leaders face as he spoke was within a few inches of his own psmiths observant eye noted that the bruise still lingered on the chin where kid bradys uppercut had landed at their previous meeting  i cannot offer you all seats he went on unless you care to dispose yourselves upon the tables i wonder if you know my friend mr bat jarvis and my friend mr l otto let us all get acquainted on this merry occasion  the three invaders had been aware of the presence of the great bat and his colleague for some moments and the meeting seemed to be causing them embarrassment this may have been due to the fact that both mr jarvis and mr otto had produced and were toying meditatively with distinctly uglylooking pistols  mr jarvis spoke  well he said whats doin  mr repetto to whom the remark was directly addressed appeared to have some difficulty in finding a reply he shuffled his feet and looked at the floor his two companions seemed equally at a loss  goin to start any rough stuff inquired mr jarvis casually  the cigars are on the table said psmith hospitably draw up your chairs and lets all be jolly i will open the proceedings with a song  in a rich baritone with his eyeglass fixed the while on mr repetto he proceeded to relieve himself of the first verse of i only know i love thee  chorus please he added as he finished come along comrade repetto why this shrinking coyness fling out your chest and cut loose  but mr repettos eye was fastened on mr jarviss revolver the sight apparently had the effect of quenching his desire for song  lov muh ahnd ther world isahmine concluded psmith  he looked round the assembled company  comrade otto he observed will now recite that pathetic little poem babys sock is now a bluebag pray gentlemen silence for comrade otto  he looked inquiringly at the long youth who remained mute psmith clicked his tongue regretfully  comrade jarvis he said i fear that as a smokingconcert this is not going to be a success i understand however comrade repetto and his colleagues have come here on business and nothing will make them forget it typical new york men of affairs they close their minds to all influences that might lure them from their business let us get on then what did you wish to see me about comrade repetto  mr repettos reply was unintelligible  mr jarvis made a suggestion  youse had better beat it he said  long otto grunted sympathy with this advice  and youse had better go back to spider reilly continued mr jarvis and tell him that theres nothin doin in the way of rough house wit dis gent here he indicated psmith who bowed and you can tell de spider went on bat with growing ferocity dat next time he gits gay and starts in to shoot guys in me dancejoint ill bite de head offn him see does dat go if he tinks his little twobyfour gang can put it across de groome street he can try dats right an dont fergit dis gent here and me is pals and any one dat starts anyting wit dis gent is going to have to git busy wit me does dat go  psmith coughed and shot his cuffs  i do not know he said in the manner of a chairman addressing a meeting that i have anything to add to the very wellexpressed remarks of my friend comrade jarvis he has in my opinion covered the ground very thoroughly and satisfactorily it now only remains for me to pass a vote of thanks to comrade jarvis and to declare this meeting at an end  beat it said mr jarvis pointing to the door  the delegation then withdrew  i am very much obliged said psmith for your courtly assistance comrade jarvis but for you i do not care to think with what a splash i might not have been immersed in the gumbo thank you comrade jarvis and you comrade otto  aw chee said mr jarvis handsomely dismissing the matter mr otto kicked the leg of the table and grunted                        for half an hour after the departure of the three pointers psmith chatted amiably to his two assistants on matters of general interest the exchange of ideas was somewhat onesided though mr jarvis had one or two striking items of information to impart notably some hints on the treatment of fits in kittens  at the end of this period the conversation was once more interrupted by the sound of movements in the outer office  if dats dose stiffs come back began mr jarvis reaching for his revolver  stay your hand comrade jarvis said as a sharp knock sounded on the door i do not think it can be our late friends comrade repettos knowledge of the usages of polite society is too limited i fancy to prompt him to knock on doors come in  the door opened it was not mr repetto or his colleagues but another old friend no other in fact than mr francis parker he who had come as an embassy from the man up top in the very beginning of affairs and had departed wrathful mouthing declarations of war as on his previous visit he wore the dude suit the shiny shoes and the tallshaped hat  welcome comrade parker said psmith it is too long since we met comrade jarvis i think you know if i am right that is to say in supposing that it was you who approached him at an earlier stage in the proceedings with a view to engaging his sympathetic aid in the great work of putting comrade windsor and myself out of business the gentleman on your left is comrade otto  mr parker was looking at bat in bewilderment it was plain that he had not expected to find psmith entertaining such company  did you come purely for friendly chitchat comrade parker inquired psmith or was there woven into the social motives of your call a desire to talk business of any kind  my business is private i didnt expect a crowd  especially of ancient friends such as comrade jarvis well well you are breaking up a most interesting little symposium comrade jarvis i think i shall be forced to postpone our very entertaining discussion of fits in kittens till a more opportune moment meanwhile as comrade parker wishes to talk over some private business  bat jarvis rose  ill beat it he said  reluctantly i hope comrade jarvis as reluctantly as i hint that i would be alone if i might drop in some time at your private residence  sure said mr jarvis warmly  excellent well for the present goodbye and many thanks for your invaluable cooperation  aw chee said mr jarvis  and now comrade parker said psmith when the door had closed let her rip what can i do for you  you seem to be all to the merry with bat jarvis observed mr parker  the phrase exactly expresses it comrade parker i am as a tortoiseshell kitten to him but touching your business  mr parker was silent for a moment  see here he said at last arent you going to be good say whats the use of keeping on at this fool game why not quit it before you get hurt  psmith smoothed his waistcoat reflectively  i may be wrong comrade parker he said but it seems to me that the chances of my getting hurt are not so great as you appear to imagine the person who is in danger of getting hurt seems to me to be the gentleman whose name is on that paper which is now in my possession  where is it demanded mr parker quickly  psmith eyed him benevolently  if you will pardon the expression comrade parker he said aha meaning that i propose to keep that information to myself  mr parker shrugged his shoulders  you know your own business i guess  psmith nodded  you are absolutely correct comrade parker i do now that cosy moments has our excellent friend comrade jarvis on its side are you not to a certain extent among the blenheim oranges i think so i think so  as he spoke there was a rap at the door a small boy entered in his hand was a scrap of paper  guy asks me give dis to gazebo named smiff he said  there are many gazebos of that name my lad one of whom i am which as artemus ward was wont to observe possibly the missive is for me  he took the paper it was dated from an address on the east side  dear smith it ran come here as quick as you can and bring some money explain when i see you  it was signed w w  so billy windsor had fulfilled his promise he had escaped  a feeling of regret for the futility of the thing was psmiths first emotion billy could be of no possible help in the campaign at its present point all the work that remained to be done could easily be carried through without his assistance and by breaking out from the island he had committed an offence which was bound to carry with it serious penalties for the first time since his connection with cosy moments began psmith was really disturbed  he turned to mr parker  comrade parker he said i regret to state that this office is now closing for the day but for this i should be delighted to sit chatting with you as it is  very well said mr parker then you mean to go on with this business  though it snows comrade parker  they went out into the street psmith thoughtful and hardly realising the others presence by the side of the pavement a few yards down the road a taximetercab was standing psmith hailed it  mr parker was still beside him it occurred to psmith that it would not do to let him hear the address billy windsor had given in his note  turn and go on down the street he said to the driver  he had taken his seat and was closing the door when it was snatched from his grasp and mr parker darted on to the seat opposite the next moment the cab had started up the street instead of down and the hard muzzle of a revolver was pressing against psmiths waistcoat  now what said mr parker smoothly leaning back with the pistol resting easily on his knee    chapter xxvi  a friend in need  the point is well taken said psmith thoughtfully  you think so said mr parker  i am convinced of it  good but dont move put that hand back where it was  you think of everything comrade parker  he dropped his hand on to the seat and remained silent for a few moments the taxicab was buzzing along up fifth avenue now looking towards the window psmith saw that they were nearing the park the great white mass of the plaza hotel showed up on the left  did you ever stop at the plaza comrade parker  no said mr parker shortly  dont bite at me comrade parker why be brusque on so joyous an occasion better men than us have stopped at the plaza ah the park how fresh the leaves comrade parker how green the herbage fling your eye at yonder grassy knoll  he raised his hand to point instantly the revolver was against his waistcoat making an unwelcome crease in that immaculate garment  i told you to keep that hand where it was  you did comrade parker you did the fault said psmith handsomely was entirely mine carried away by my love of nature i forgot it shall not occur again  it had better not said mr parker unpleasantly if it does ill blow a hole through you  psmith raised his eyebrows  that comrade parker he said is where you make your error you would no more shoot me in the heart of the metropolis than i trust you would wear a madeup tie with evening dress your skin however unhealthy to the eye of the casual observer is doubtless precious to yourself and you are not the man i take you for if you would risk it purely for the momentary pleasure of plugging me with a revolver the cry goes round criminal circles in new york comrade parker is not such a fool as he looks think for a moment what would happen the shot would ring out and instantly bicyclepolicemen would be pursuing this taxicab with the purposeful speed of greyhounds trying to win the waterloo cup you would be headed off and stopped ha what is this psmith the peoples pet weltering in his gore death to the assassin i fear nothing could save you from the fury of the mob comrade parker i seem to see them meditatively plucking you limb from limb she loves me off comes an arm she loves me not a leg joins the little heap of limbs on the ground that is how it would be and what would you have left out of it merely as i say the momentary pleasure of potting me and it isnt as if such a feat could give you the thrill of successful marksmanship anybody could hit a man with a pistol at an inch and a quarter i fear you have not thought this matter out with sufficient care comrade parker you said to yourself happy thought i will kidnap psmith and all your friends said parker is the man with the big brain but now while it is true that i cant get out you are moaning what on earth shall i do with him now that i have got him  you think so do you  i am convinced of it your face is contorted with the anguish of mental stress let this be a lesson to you comrade parker never to embark on any enterprise of which you do not see the end  i guess i see the end of this all right  you have the advantage of me then comrade parker it seems to me that we have nothing before us but to go on riding about new york till you feel that my society begins to pall  you figure youre clever i guess  there are few brighter brains in this city comrade parker but why this sudden tribute  you reckon youve thought it all out eh  there may be a flaw in my reasoning but i confess i do not at the moment see where it lies have you detected one  i guess so  ah and what is it  you seem to think new yorks the only place on the map  meaning what comrade parker  it might be a fool trick to shoot you in the city as you say but you see we arent due to stay in the city this cab is moving on  like john browns soul said psmith nodding i see then you propose to make quite a little tour in this cab  youve got it  and when we are out in the open country where there are no witnesses things may begin to move  thats it  then said psmith heartily till that moment arrives what we must do is to entertain each other with conversation you can take no step of any sort for a full halfhour possibly more so let us give ourselves up to the merriment of the passing instant are you good at riddles comrade parker how much wood would a woodchuck chuck assuming for purposes of argument that it was in the power of a woodchuck to chuck wood  mr parker did not attempt to solve this problem he was sitting in the same attitude of watchfulness the revolver resting on his knee he seemed mistrustful of psmiths right hand which was hanging limply at his side it was from this quarter that he seemed to expect attack the cab was bowling easily up the broad street past rows on rows of high houses all looking exactly the same occasionally to the right through a break in the line of buildings a glimpse of the river could be seen  psmith resumed the conversation  you are not interested in woodchucks comrade parker well well many people are not a passion for the flora and fauna of our forests is innate rather than acquired let us talk of something else tell me about your homelife comrade parker are you married are there any little parkers running about the house when you return from this very pleasant excursion will baby voices crow gleefully fahzers come home  mr parker said nothing  i see said psmith with ready sympathy i understand say no more you are unmarried she wouldnt have you alas comrade parker however thus it is we look around us and what do we see a solid phalanx of the girls we have loved and lost tell me about her comrade parker was it your face or your manners at which she drew the line  mr parker leaned forward with a scowl psmith did not move but his right hand as it hung closed another moment and mr parkers chin would be in just the right position for a swift uppercut    this fact appeared suddenly to dawn on mr parker himself he drew back quickly and half raised the revolver psmiths hand resumed its normal attitude  leaving more painful topics said psmith let us turn to another point that note which the grubby stripling brought to me at the office purported to come from comrade windsor and stated that he had escaped from blackwells island and was awaiting my arrival at some address in the bowery would you mind telling me purely to satisfy my curiosity if that note was genuine i have never made a close study of comrade windsors handwriting and in an unguarded moment i may have assumed too much  mr parker permitted himself a smile  i guess you arent so clever after all he said the note was a fake all right  and you had this cab waiting for me on the chance  mr parker nodded  sherlock holmes was right said psmith regretfully you may remember that he advised doctor watson never to take the first cab or the second he should have gone further and urged him not to take cabs at all walking is far healthier  youll find it so said mr parker  psmith eyed him curiously  what are you going to do with me comrade parker he asked  mr parker did not reply psmiths eye turned again to the window they had covered much ground since last he had looked at the view they were off manhattan island now and the houses were beginning to thin out soon travelling at their present rate they must come into the open country psmith relapsed into silence it was necessary for him to think he had been talking in the hope of getting the other off his guard but mr parker was evidently too keenly on the lookout the hand that held the revolver never wavered the muzzle pointing in an upward direction was aimed at psmiths waist there was no doubt that a move on his part would be fatal if the pistol went off it must hit him if it had been pointed at his head in the orthodox way he might have risked a sudden blow to knock it aside but in the present circumstances that would be useless there was nothing to do but wait  the cab moved swiftly on now they had reached the open country an occasional wooden shack was passed but that was all at any moment the climax of the drama might be reached psmiths muscles stiffened for a spring there was little chance of its being effective but at least it would be better to put up some kind of a fight and he had a faint hope that the suddenness of his movement might upset the others aim he was bound to be hit somewhere that was certain but quickness might save him to some extent  he braced his leg against the back of the cab in another moment he would have sprung but just then the smooth speed of the cab changed to a series of jarring bumps each more emphatic than the last it slowed down then came to a halt one of the tyres had burst  there was a thud as the chauffeur jumped down they heard him fumbling in the toolbox presently the body of the machine was raised slightly as he got to work with the jack  it was about a minute later that somebody in the road outside spoke  had a breakdown inquired the voice psmith recognised it it was the voice of kid brady     chapter xxvii  psmith concludes his ride  the kid as he had stated to psmith at their last interview that he intended to do had begun his training for his match with eddie wood at white plains a village distant but a few miles from new york it was his practice to open a course of training with a little gentle roadwork and it was while jogging along the highway a couple of miles from his trainingcamp in company with the two thicknecked gentlemen who acted as his sparringpartners that he had come upon the brokendown taxicab  if this had happened after his training had begun in real earnest he would have averted his eyes from the spectacle however alluring and continued on his way without a pause but now as he had not yet settled down to genuine hard work he felt justified in turning aside and looking into the matter the fact that the chauffeur who seemed to be a taciturn man lacking the conversational graces manifestly objected to an audience deterred him not at all one cannot have everything in this world and the kid and his attendant thicknecks were content to watch the process of mending the tyre without demanding the additional joy of sparkling smalltalk from the man in charge of the operations  guys had a breakdown sure said the first of the thicknecks  surest thing you know agreed his colleague  seems to me the tyres punctured said the kid  all three concentrated their gaze on the machine  kids right said thickneck number one guys been an bust a tyre  surest thing you know said thickneck number two  they observed the perspiring chauffeur in silence for a while  wonder how he did that now speculated the kid  guy ran over a nail i guess said thickneck number one  surest thing you know said the other who while perhaps somewhat lacking in the matter of original thought was a most useful fellow to have by one a sort of boswell  did you run over a nail the kid inquired of the chauffeur  the chauffeur ignored the question  this is his busy day said the first thickneck with satire guys too full of work to talk to us  deaf shouldnt wonder surmised the kid  say wonder what hes doin with a taxi so far out of the city  some guy tells him to drive him out here i guess say itll cost him something too hell have to strip off a few from his roll to pay for this  psmith in the interior of the cab glanced at mr parker  you heard comrade parker he is right i fancy the bill  mr parker dug viciously at him with the revolver  keep quiet he whispered or youll get hurt  psmith suspended his remarks  outside the conversation had begun again  pretty rich guy inside said the kid following up his companions train of thought im goin to rubber in at the window  psmith meeting mr parkers eye smiled pleasantly there was no answering smile on the others face  there came the sound of the kids feet grating on the road as he turned and as he heard it mr parker that eminent tactician for the first time lost his head with a vague idea of screening psmith from the eyes of the man in the road he half rose for an instant the muzzle of the pistol ceased to point at psmiths waistcoat it was the very chance psmith had been waiting for his left hand shot out grasped the others wrist and gave it a sharp wrench the revolver went off with a deafening report the bullet passing through the back of the cab then fell to the floor as the fingers lost their hold the next moment psmiths right fist darting upwards took mr parker neatly under the angle of the jaw  the effect was instantaneous psmith had risen from his seat as he delivered the blow and it consequently got the full benefit of his weight which was not small mr parker literally crumpled up his head jerked back then fell limply on his chest he would have slipped to the floor had not psmith pushed him on to the seat  the interested face of the kid appeared at the window behind him could be seen portions of the faces of the two thicknecks  ah comrade brady said psmith genially i heard your voice and was hoping you might look in for a chat  whats doin mr smith queried the excited kid  much comrade brady much i will tell you all anon meanwhile however kindly knock that chauffeur down and sit on his head hes a bad person  de guys beat it volunteered the first thickneck  surest thing you know said the other  whats been doin mr smith asked the kid  ill tell you about it as we go comrade brady said psmith stepping into the road riding in a taxi is pleasant provided it is not overdone for the moment i have had sufficient a bit of walking will do me good  what are you going to do with this guy mr smith asked the kid pointing to parker who had begun to stir slightly  psmith inspected the stricken one gravely  i have no use for him comrade brady he said our ride together gave me as much of his society as i desire for today unless you or either of your friends are collecting parkers i propose that we leave him where he is we may as well take the gun however in my opinion comrade parker is not the proper man to have such a weapon he is too prone to go firing it off in any direction at a moments notice causing inconvenience to all he groped on the floor of the cab for the revolver now comrade brady he said straightening himself up i am at your disposal shall we be pushing on                        it was late in the evening when psmith returned to the metropolis after a pleasant afternoon at the brady trainingcamp the kid having heard the details of the ride offered once more to abandon his match with eddie wood but psmith would not hear of it he was fairly satisfied that the opposition had fired their last shot and that their next move would be to endeavour to come to terms they could not hope to catch him off his guard a second time and as far as hired assault and battery were concerned he was as safe in new york now that bat jarvis had declared himself on his side as he would have been in the middle of a desert what bat said was law on the east side no hooligan however eager to make money would dare to act against a protégé of the groome street leader  the only flaw in psmiths contentment was the absence of billy windsor on this night of all nights the editorial staff of cosy moments should have been together to celebrate the successful outcome of their campaign psmith dined alone his enjoyment of the rather special dinner which he felt justified in ordering in honour of the occasion somewhat diminished by the thought of billys hard case he had seen mr william collier in the man from mexico and that had given him an understanding of what a term of imprisonment on blackwells island meant billy during these lean days must be supporting life on bread bean soup and water psmith toying with the hors doeuvre was somewhat saddened by the thought                        all was quiet at the office on the following day bat jarvis again accompanied by the faithful otto took up his position in the inner room prepared to repel all invaders but none arrived no sounds broke the peace of the outer office except the whistling of master maloney  things were almost dull when the telephone bell rang psmith took down the receiver  hullo he said  im parker said a moody voice  psmith uttered a cry of welcome  why comrade parker this is splendid how goes it did you get back all right yesterday i was sorry to have to tear myself away but i had other engagements but why use the telephone why not come here in person you know how welcome you are hire a taxicab and come right round  mr parker made no reply to the invitation  mr waring would like to see you  who comrade parker  mr stewart waring  the celebrated tenement houseowner  silence from the other end of the wire well said psmith what step does he propose to take towards it  he tells me to say that he will be in his office at twelve oclock tomorrow morning his office is in the morton building nassau street  psmith clicked his tongue regretfully  then i do not see how we can meet he said i shall be here  he wishes to see you at his office  i am sorry comrade parker it is impossible i am very busy just now as you may know preparing the next number the one in which we publish the name of the owner of the pleasant street tenements otherwise i should be delighted perhaps later when the rush of work has diminished somewhat  am i to tell mr waring that you refuse  if you are seeing him at any time and feel at a loss for something to say perhaps you might mention it is there anything else i can do for you comrade parker  see here  nothing then goodbye look in when youre this way  he hung up the receiver  as he did so he was aware of master maloney standing beside the table  yes comrade maloney  telegram said pugsy for mr windsor  psmith ripped open the envelope  the message ran  returning today will be at office tomorrow morning and it was signed wilberfloss  see whos here said psmith softly    chapter xxviii  standing room only  in the light of subsequent events it was perhaps the least bit unfortunate that mr jarvis should have seen fit to bring with him to the office of cosy moments on the following morning two of his celebrated squad of cats and that long otto who as usual accompanied him should have been fired by his example to the extent of introducing a large and rather boisterous yellow dog they were not to be blamed of course they could not know that before the morning was over space in the office would be at a premium still it was unfortunate  mr jarvis was slightly apologetic  tought id bring de kits along he said dey started in scrappin yesterday when i was here so today i says ill keep my eye on dem  psmith inspected the menagerie without resentment  assuredly comrade jarvis he said they add a pleasantly cosy and domestic touch to the scene the only possible criticism i can find to make has to do with their probable brawling with the dog  oh dey wont scrap wit de dawg dey knows him  but is he aware of that he looks to me a somewhat impulsive animal well well the matters in your hands if you will undertake to look after the refereeing of any pogrom that may arise i say no more  mr jarviss statement as to the friendly relations between the animals proved to be correct the dog made no attempt to annihilate the cats after an inquisitive journey round the room he lay down and went to sleep and an era of peace set in the cats had settled themselves comfortably one on each of mr jarviss knees and long otto surveying the ceiling with his customary glassy stare smoked a long cigar in silence bat breathed a tune and scratched one of the cats under the ear it was a soothing scene  but it did not last ten minutes had barely elapsed when the yellow dog sitting up with a start uttered a whine in the outer office could be heard a stir and movement the next moment the door burst open and a little man dashed in he had a peeled nose and showed other evidences of having been living in the open air behind him was a crowd of uncertain numbers psmith recognised the leaders of this crowd they were the reverend edwin t philpotts and mr b henderson asher  why comrade asher he said this is indeed a moment of mirth i have been wondering for weeks where you could have got to and comrade philpotts am i wrong in saying that this is the maddest merriest day of all the glad new year  the rest of the crowd had entered the room  comrade waterman too cried psmith why we have all met before except  he glanced inquiringly at the little man with the peeled nose  my name is wilberfloss said the other with austerity will you be so good as to tell me where mr windsor is  a murmur of approval from his followers  in one moment said psmith first however let me introduce two important members of our staff on your right mr bat jarvis on your left mr long otto both of groome street  the two bowery boys rose awkwardly the cats fell in an avalanche to the floor long otto in his haste trod on the dog which began barking a process which it kept up almost without a pause during the rest of the interview  mr wilberfloss said psmith in an aside to bat is widely known as a cat fancier in brooklyn circles  honest said mr jarvis he tapped mr wilberfloss in friendly fashion on the chest say he asked did youse ever have a cat wit one blue and one yellow eye  mr wilberfloss sidestepped and turned once more to psmith who was offering b henderson asher a cigarette  who are you he demanded  who am i repeated psmith in an astonished tone  who are you  i am psmith said the old etonian reverently there is a preliminary p before the name this however is silent like the tomb compare such words as ptarmigan psalm and phthisis  these gentlemen tell me youre acting editor who appointed you  psmith reflected  it is rather a nice point he said it might be claimed that i appointed myself you may say however that comrade windsor appointed me  ah and where is mr windsor  in prison said psmith sorrowfully  in prison  psmith nodded  it is too true such is the generous impulsiveness of comrade windsors nature that he hit a policeman was promptly gathered in and is now serving a sentence of thirty days on blackwells island  mr wilberfloss looked at mr philpotts mr asher looked at mr wilberfloss mr waterman started and stumbled over a cat  i never heard of such a thing said mr wilberfloss  a faint sad smile played across psmiths face  do you remember comrade watermani fancy it was to you that i made the remarkmy commenting at our previous interview on the rashness of confusing the unusual with the improbable here we see comrade wilberfloss bigbrained though he is falling into error  i shall dismiss mr windsor immediately said the bigbrained one  from blackwells island said psmith i am sure you will earn his gratitude if you do they live on bean soup there bean soup and bread and not much of either  he broke off to turn his attention to mr jarvis and mr waterman between whom bad blood seemed to have arisen mr jarvis holding a cat in his arms was glowering at mr waterman who had backed away and seemed nervous  what is the trouble comrade jarvis  dat guy dere wit two left feet said bat querulously goes and treads on de kit i  i assure you it was a pure accident the animal  mr wilberfloss eyeing bat and the silent otto with disgust intervened  who are these persons mr smith he inquired  poisson yourself rejoined bat justly incensed whos de little guy wit de peeled breezer mr smith  psmith waved his hands  gentlemen gentlemen he said let us not descend to mere personalities i thought i had introduced you this comrade jarvis is mr wilberfloss the editor of this journal these comrade wilberflosszambuk would put your nose right in a dayare respectively bat jarvis and long otto our acting fightingeditors vice kid brady absent on unavoidable business  kid brady shrilled mr wilberfloss i insist that you give me a full explanation of this matter i go away by my doctors orders for ten weeks leaving mr windsor to conduct the paper on certain welldefined lines i return yesterday and getting into communication with mr philpotts what do i find why that in my absence the paper has been ruined  ruined said psmith on the contrary examine the returns and you will see that the circulation has gone up every week cosy moments was never so prosperous and flourishing comrade otto do you think you could use your personal influence with that dog to induce it to suspend its barking for a while it is musical but renders conversation difficult  long otto raised a massive boot and aimed it at the animal which dodging with a yelp cannoned against the second cat and had its nose scratched piercing shrieks cleft the air  i demand an explanation roared mr wilberfloss above the din  i think comrade otto said psmith it would make things a little easier if you removed that dog  he opened the door the dog shot out they could hear it being ejected from the outer office by master maloney when there was silence psmith turned courteously to the editor  you were saying comrade wilberfloss  who is this person brady with mr philpotts i have been going carefully over the numbers which have been issued since my departure  an intellectual treat murmured psmith  and in each there is a picture of this young man in a costume which i will not particularise  there is hardly enough of it to particularise  together with a page of disgusting autobiographical matter  psmith held up his hand  i protest he said we court criticism but this is mere abuse i appeal to these gentlemen to say whether this for instance is not bright and interesting  he picked up the current number of cosy moments and turned to the kids page  this he said describing a certain tenround unpleasantness with one mexican joe joe comes up for the second round and he gives me a nasty look but i thinks of my mother and swats him one in the lower ribs he hollers foul but nix on that referee says fight on joe gives me another nasty look all right kid he says now ill knock you up into the gallery and with that he cuts loose with a right swing but i falls into the clinch and then  bah exclaimed mr wilberfloss  go on boss urged mr jarvis approvingly its to de good dat stuff  there said psmith triumphantly you heard comrade jarvis one of the most firmly established critics east of fifth avenue stamps kid bradys reminiscences with the hallmark of his approval  i falls fer de kid every time assented mr jarvis  assuredly comrade jarvis you know a good thing when you see one why he went on warmly there is stuff in these reminiscences which would stir the blood of a jellyfish let me quote you another passage to show that they are not only enthralling but helpful as well let me see where is it ah i have it a bully good way of putting a guy out of business is this you dont want to use it in the ring because by queensberry rules its a foul but you will find it mighty useful if any thickneck comes up to you in the street and tries to start anything its this way while hes setting himself for a punch just place the tips of the fingers of your left hand on the right side of his chest then bring down the heel of your left hand there isnt a guy living that could stand up against that the fingers give you a leverage to beat the band the guy doubles up and you uppercut him with your right and out he goes now i bet you never knew that before comrade philpotts try it on your parishioners  cosy moments said mr wilberfloss irately is no medium for exploiting low prizefighters  low prizefighters comrade wilberfloss you have been misinformed the kid is as decent a little chap as youd meet anywhere you do not seem to appreciate the philanthropic motives of the paper in adopting comrade bradys cause think of it comrade wilberfloss there was that unfortunate stripling with only two pleasures in life to love his mother and to knock the heads off other youths whose weight coincided with his own and misfortune until we took him up had barred him almost completely from the second pastime our editorial heart was melted we adopted comrade brady and look at him now matched against eddie wood and comrade waterman will support me in my statement that a victory over eddie wood means that he gets a legitimate claim to meet jimmy garvin for the championship  it is abominable burst forth mr wilberfloss it is disgraceful i never heard of such a thing the paper is ruined  you keep reverting to that statement comrade wilberfloss can nothing reassure you the returns are excellent prosperity beams on us like a sun the proprietor is more than satisfied  the proprietor gasped mr wilberfloss does he know how you have treated the paper  he is cognisant of our every move  and he approves  he more than approves  mr wilberfloss snorted  i dont believe it he said  the assembled excontributors backed up this statement with a united murmur b henderson asher snorted satirically  they dont believe it sighed psmith nevertheless it is true  it is not true thundered mr wilberfloss hopping to avoid a perambulating cat nothing will convince me of it mr benjamin white is not a maniac  i trust not said psmith i sincerely trust not i have every reason to believe in his complete sanity what makes you fancy that there is even a possibility of his beinger  nobody but a lunatic would approve of seeing his paper ruined  again said psmith i fear that the notion that this journal is ruined has become an obsession with you comrade wilberfloss once again i assure you that it is more than prosperous  if said mr wilberfloss you imagine that i intend to take your word in this matter you are mistaken i shall cable mr white today and inquire whether these alterations in the paper meet with his approval  i shouldnt comrade wilberfloss cables are expensive and in these hard times a penny saved is a penny earned why worry comrade white he is so far away so out of touch with our new york literary life i think it is practically a certainty that he has not the slightest inkling of any changes in the paper  mr wilberfloss uttered a cry of triumph  i knew it he said i knew it i knew you would give up when it came to the point and you were driven into a corner now perhaps you will admit that mr white has given no sanction for the alterations in the paper  a puzzled look crept into psmiths face  i think comrade wilberfloss he said we are talking at crosspurposes you keep harping on comrade white and his views and tastes one would almost imagine that you fancied that comrade white was the proprietor of this paper  mr wilberfloss stared b henderson asher stared every one stared except mr jarvis who since the readings from the kids reminiscences had ceased had lost interest in the discussion and was now entertaining the cats with a ball of paper tied to a string  fancied that mr white    repeated mr wilberfloss i dont follow you who is if he isnt  psmith removed his monocle polished it thoughtfully and put it back in its place  i am he said    chapter xxix  the knockout for mr waring  you cried mr wilberfloss  the same said psmith  you exclaimed messrs waterman asher and the reverend edwin philpotts  on the spot said psmith  mr wilberfloss groped for a chair and sat down  am i going mad he demanded feebly  not so comrade wilberfloss said psmith encouragingly all is well the cry goes round new york comrade wilberfloss is to the good he does not gibber  do i understand you to say that you own this paper  i do  since when  roughly speaking about a month  among his audience still excepting mr jarvis who was tickling one of the cats and whistling a plaintive melody there was a tendency toward awkward silence to start ballyragging a seeming nonentity and then to discover he is the proprietor of the paper to which you wish to contribute is like kicking an apparently empty hat and finding your rich uncle inside it mr wilberfloss in particular was disturbed editorships of the kind which he aspired to are not easy to get if he were to be removed from cosy moments he would find it hard to place himself anywhere else editors like manuscripts are rejected from want of space  very early in my connection with this journal said psmith i saw that i was on to a good thing i had long been convinced that about the nearest approach to the perfect job in this world where good jobs are so hard to acquire was to own a paper all you had to do once you had secured your paper was to sit back and watch the other fellows work and from time to time forward big cheques to the bank nothing could be more nicely attuned to the tastes of a shropshire psmith the glimpses i was enabled to get of the workings of this little journal gave me the impression that comrade white was not attached with any paternal fervour to cosy moments he regarded it i deduced not so much as a lifework as in the light of an investment i assumed that comrade white had his price and wrote to my father who was visiting carlsbad at the moment to ascertain what that price might be he cabled it to me it was reasonable now it so happens that an uncle of mine some years ago left me a considerable number of simoleons and though i shall not be legally entitled actually to close in on the opulence for a matter of nine months or so i anticipated that my father would have no objection to staking me to the necessary amount on the security of my little bit of money my father has spent some time of late hurling me at various professions and we had agreed some time ago that the law was to be my long suit paperowning however may be combined with being lord chancellor and i knew he would have no objection to my being a napoleon of the press on this side so we closed with comrade white and  there was a knock at the door and master maloney entered with a card  guys waiting outside he said  mr stewart waring read psmith comrade maloney do you know what mahomet did when the mountain would not come to him  search me said the officeboy indifferently  he went to the mountain it was a wise thing to do as a general rule in life you cant beat it remember that comrade maloney  sure said pugsy shall i send the guy in  surest thing you know comrade maloney  he turned to the assembled company  gentlemen he said you know how i hate to have to send you away but would you mind withdrawing in good order a somewhat delicate and private interview is in the offing comrade jarvis we will meet anon your services to the paper have been greatly appreciated if i might drop in some afternoon and inspect the remainder of your zoo  any time youre down groome street way glad  i will make a point of it comrade wilberfloss would you mind remaining as editor of this journal you should be present if the rest of you would look in about this time tomorrowshow mr waring in comrade maloney  he took a seat  we are now comrade wilberfloss he said at a crisis in the affairs of this journal but i fancy we shall win through  the door opened and pugsy announced mr waring  the owner of the pleasant street tenements was of what is usually called commanding presence he was tall and broad and more than a little stout his face was cleanshaven and curiously expressionless bushy eyebrows topped a pair of cold grey eyes he walked into the room with the air of one who is not wont to apologise for existing there are some men who seem to fill any room in which they may be mr waring was one of these  he set his hat down on the table without speaking after which he looked at mr wilberfloss who shrank a little beneath his gaze  psmith had risen to greet him  wont you sit down he said  i prefer to stand  just as you wish this is liberty hall  mr waring again glanced at mr wilberfloss  what i have to say is private he said  all is well said psmith reassuringly it is no stranger that you see before you no mere irresponsible lounger who has butted in by chance that is comrade j fillken wilberfloss the editor of this journal  the editor i understood  i know what you would say you have comrade windsor in your mind he was merely acting as editor while the chief was away hunting sandeels in the jungles of texas in his absence comrade windsor and i did our best to keep the old journal booming along but it lacked the masterhand but now all is well comrade wilberfloss is once more doing stunts at the old stand you may speak as freely before him as you would before well let us say comrade parker  who are you then if this gentleman is the editor  i am the proprietor  i understood that a mr white was the proprietor  not so said psmith there was a time when that was the case but not now things move so swiftly in new york journalistic matters that a man may well be excused for not keeping abreast of the times especially one who like yourself is interested in politics and houseownership rather than in literature are you sure you wont sit down  mr waring brought his hand down with a bang on the table causing mr wilberfloss to leap a clear two inches from his chair  what are you doing it for he demanded explosively i tell you you had better quit it it isnt healthy  psmith shook his head  you are merely stating in otherand if i may say so inferiorwords what comrade parker said to us i did not object to giving up valuable time to listen to comrade parker he is a fascinating conversationalist and it was a privilege to hobnob with him but if you are merely intending to cover the ground covered by him i fear i must remind you that this is one of our busy days have you no new light to fling upon the subject  mr waring wiped his forehead he was playing a lost game and he was not the sort of man who plays lost games well the waring type is dangerous when it is winning but it is apt to crumple up against strong defence  his next words proved his demoralisation  ill sue you for libel said he  psmith looked at him admiringly  say no more he said for you will never beat that for pure richness and whimsical humour it stands alone during the past seven weeks you have been endeavouring in your cheery fashion to blot the editorial staff of this paper off the face of the earth in a variety of ingenious and entertaining ways and now you propose to sue us for libel i wish comrade windsor could have heard you say that it would have hit him right  mr waring accepted the invitation he had refused before he sat down  what are you going to do he said  it was the white flag the fight had gone out of him  psmith leaned back in his chair  ill tell you he said ive thought the whole thing out the right plan would be to put the complete kybosh if i may use the expression on your chances of becoming an alderman on the other hand i have been studying the papers of late and it seems to me that it doesnt much matter who gets elected of course the opposition papers may have allowed their zeal to run away with them but even assuming that to be the case the other candidates appear to be a pretty fair contingent of blighters if i were a native of new york perhaps i might take a more fervid interest in the matter but as i am merely passing through your beautiful little city it doesnt seem to me to make any very substantial difference who gets in to be absolutely candid my view of the thing is this if the people are chumps enough to elect you then they deserve you i hope i dont hurt your feelings in any way i am merely stating my own individual opinion  mr waring made no remark  the only thing that really interests me resumed psmith is the matter of these tenements i shall shortly be leaving this country to resume the stranglehold on learning which i relinquished at the beginning of the long vacation if i were to depart without bringing off improvements down pleasant street way i shouldnt be able to enjoy my meals the startled cry would go round cambridge something is the matter with psmith he is off his feed he should try blenkinsops balm for the bilious but no balm would do me any good i should simply droop and fade slowly away like a neglected lily and you wouldnt like that comrade wilberfloss would you  mr wilberfloss thus suddenly pulled into the conversation again leaped in his seat  what i propose to do continued psmith without waiting for an answer is to touch you for the good round sum of five thousand and three dollars  mr waring half rose  five thousand dollars  five thousand and three dollars said psmith it may possibly have escaped your memory but a certain minion of yours one j repetto utterly ruined a practically new hat of mine if you think that i can afford to come to new york and scatter hats about as if they were mere dross you are making the culminating error of a misspent life three dollars are what i need for a new one the balance of your cheque the five thousand i propose to apply to making those tenements fit for a tolerably fastidious pig to live in  five thousand cried mr waring its monstrous  it isnt said psmith its more or less of a minimum i have made inquiries so out with the good old chequebook and lets all be jolly  i have no chequebook with me  i have said psmith producing one from a drawer cross out the name of my bank substitute yours and fate cannot touch us  mr waring hesitated for a moment then capitulated psmith watched as he wrote with an indulgent and fatherly eye  finished he said comrade maloney  youse hollering fer me asked that youth appearing at the door  bet your life i am comrade maloney have you ever seen an untamed mustang of the prairie  nope but ive read about dem  well run like one down to wall street with this cheque and pay it in to my account at the international bank  pugsy disappeared  cheques said psmith have been known to be stopped who knows but what on reflection you might not have changed your mind  what guarantee have i asked mr waring that these attacks on me in your paper will stop  if you like said psmith i will write you a note to that effect but it will not be necessary i propose with comrade wilberflosss assistance to restore cosy moments to its old style some days ago the editor of comrade windsors late daily paper called up on the telephone and asked to speak to him i explained the painful circumstances and later went round and hobnobbed with the great man a very pleasant fellow he asks to reengage comrade windsors services at a pretty sizeable salary so as far as our prison expert is concerned all may be said to be well he has got where he wanted cosy moments may therefore ease up a bit if at about the beginning of next month you should hear a deafening squeal of joy ring through this city it will be the infants of new york and their parents receiving the news that cosy moments stands where it did may i count on your services comrade wilberfloss excellent i see i may then perhaps you would not mind passing the word round among comrades asher waterman and the rest of the squad and telling them to burnish their brains and be ready to wade in at a moments notice i fear you will have a pretty tough job roping in the old subscribers again but it can be done i look to you comrade wilberfloss are you on  mr wilberfloss wriggling in his chair intimated that he was    conclusion  it was a drizzly november evening the streets of cambridge were a compound of mud mist and melancholy but in psmiths rooms the fire burned brightly the kettle droned and all as the proprietor had just observed was joy jollity and song psmith in pyjamas and a college blazer was lying on the sofa mike who had been playing football was reclining in a comatose state in an armchair by the fire  how pleasant it would be said psmith dreamily if all our friends on the other side of the atlantic could share this very peaceful moment with us or perhaps not quite all let us say comrade windsor in the chair over there comrades brady and maloney on the table and our old pal wilberfloss sharing the floor with b henderson asher bat jarvis and the cats by the way i think it would be a graceful act if you were to write to comrade jarvis from time to time telling him how your angoras are getting on he regards you as the worlds most prominent citizen a line from you every now and then would sweeten the lads existence  mike stirred sleepily in his chair  what he said drowsily  never mind comrade jackson let us pass lightly on i am filled with a strange content tonight i may be wrong but it seems to me that all is singularly to de good as comrade maloney would put it advices from comrade windsor inform me that that prince of blighters waring was rejected by an intelligent electorate those keen clearsighted citizens refused to vote for him to an extent that you could notice without a microscope still he has one consolation he owns what when the improvements are completed will be the finest and most commodious tenement houses in new york millionaires will stop at them instead of going to the plaza are you asleep comrade jackson  umm said mike  that is excellent you could not be better employed keep listening comrade windsor also statedas indeed did the sporting papersthat comrade brady put it all over friend eddie wood administering the sleepproducer in the eighth round my authorities are silent as to whether or not the lethal blow was a halfscissor hook but i presume such to have been the case the kid is now definitely matched against comrade garvin for the championship and the experts seem to think that he should win he is a stout fellow is comrade brady and i hope he wins through he will probably come to england later on when he does we must show him round i dont think you ever met him did you comrade jackson  urr said mike  say no more said psmith i take you  he reached out for a cigarette  these he said comfortably are the moments in life to which we look back with that wistful pleasure what of my boyhood at eton do i remember with the keenest joy the braintourneys in the old formroom and the bally rot which used to take place on the fourth of june no burned deeply into my memory is a certain hot bath i took after one of the foulest crosscountry runs that ever occurred outside dantes inferno so with the present moment this peaceful scene comrade jackson will remain with me when i have forgotten that such a person as comrade repetto ever existed these are the real cosy moments and while on that subject you will be glad to hear that the little sheet is going strong the man wilberfloss is a marvel in his way he appears to have gathered in the majority of the old subscribers again hopping mad but a brief while ago they now eat out of his hand youve really no notion what a feeling of quiet pride it gives you owning a paper i try not to show it but i seem to myself to be looking down on the world from some lofty peak yesterday night when i was looking down from the peak without a cap and gown a proctor slid up today i had to dig down into my jeans for a matter of two plunks but what of it life must inevitably be dotted with these minor tragedies i do not repine the whisper goes round psmith bites the bullet and wears a brave smile comrade jackson  a snore came from the chair  psmith sighed but he did not repine he bit the bullet his eyes closed  five minutes later a slight snore came from the sofa too the man behind cosy moments slept
