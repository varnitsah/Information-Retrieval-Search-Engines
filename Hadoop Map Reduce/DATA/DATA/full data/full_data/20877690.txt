20877690	the clyde mystery a study in forgeries and folklore   by andrew lang ma oxford hon fellow of merton college lld st andrews dlitt oxford dcl durham  glasgow james maclehose and sons publishers to the university 1905  glasgow printed at the university press by robert maclehose and co ltd     preface   the author would scarcely have penned this little specimen of what scott called antiquarian old womanries but for the interest which he takes in the universally diffused archaic patterns on rocks and stones which offer a singular proof of the identity of the working of the human mind anthropology and folklore are the natural companions and aids of prehistoric and protohistoric archaeology and suggest remarks which may not be valueless whatever view we may take of the disputed objects from the clyde sites  while only an open verdict on these objects is at present within the competence of science the author speaking for himself must record his private opinion that as a rule they are ancient though anomalous  he cannot pretend to certainty as to whether the upper parts of the marine structures were throughout built of stone as in dr munros theory which is used as the fundamental assumption in this book or whether they were of wood as in the hypothesis of mr donnelly illustrated by him in the glasgow evening times sept 11 1905  the point seems unessential  the author learns from mr donnelly that experiments in shaping piles with an ancient stone axe have been made by mr joseph downes of irvine as by monsieur hippolyte muller in france with similar results a fact which should have been mentioned in the book  it appears too that a fragment of fallow deer horn at dumbuck mentioned by dr munro turned out to be a decayed humerus of the bos longifrons and therefore no evidence as to date as postroman  mr donnelly also protests that his records of his excavations were exceptionally complete and that he took daily notes and sketches of all features and finds with measurements  i must mention these facts as in the book i say that mr donnelly kept no minute and hourly dated log book of his explorations with full details as to the precise positions of the objects discovered  if in any respect i have misconceived the facts and arguments i trust that the fault will be ascribed to nothing worse than human fallibility  i have to thank mr donnelly for permission to photograph some objects from dumbuck and for much information  to dr munro apart from his most valuable books of crannog lore i owe his kind attention to my private inquiries and hope that i successfully represent his position and arguments  it is quite undeniable that the disputed objects are most anomalous as far as our present knowledge goes and i do not think that science can give more than all i plead for an open verdict  dr ricardo severe generously permitted me to reproduce a few by no means the most singular of his designs and photographs of the disputed portuguese objects  a serious illness has prevented him from making a visit recently to the scene of the discoveries see his paper in portugalia vol ii part 1  i trust that dr de vasconcellos from whom i have not yet heard will pardon the reproduction of three or four figures from his religioes an important work on prehistoric portugal  to dr joseph anderson of the national museum i owe much gratitude for information and for his great kindness in superintending the photographing of some objects now in that museum  dr david murray obliged me by much information as to the early navigation of the clyde and the alterations made in the bed of the river  to mr david boyle ontario i owe the knowledge of red indian magic stones parallel to the perforated and inscribed stone from tappock  as i have quoted from dr munro the humorous tale of the palaeolithic designs which deceived m lartet and mr christie i ought to observe that in lanthropologie august 1905 a reviewer of dr munros book prof boule

contemplation of the fiscal question and turn his eyes upon the mystery of the clyde  popular this puzzle cannot be for there is no demmed demp disagreeable body in the mystery  no such object was found in clyde near dumbarton but a set of odd and inexpensive looking yet profoundly enigmatic scraps of stone bone slate horn and so forth were discovered and now repose in a glass case at the national museum in queen street edinburgh  there as in the morgue lies awaiting explanation the corpus delicti of the clyde mystery  we stare at it and ask what are these slate spear heads engraved with rude ornament and certainly never meant to be used as lethal weapons  what are these manyshaped perforated plaques of slate shale and schist scratched with some of the old mysterious patterns that in almost every part of the world remain inscribed on slabs and faces of rock  who incised similar patterns on the oystershells some old and local some freshand american  why did any one scratch them  what is the meaning if meaning there be of the broken figurines or stone dolls  they have been styled totems by persons who do not know the meaning of the word totem which merely denotes the natural objectusually a plant or animalafter which sets of kinsfolk are named among certain savage tribes  let us call the little figures figurines for that commits us to nothing  then there are grotesque human heads carved in stone bits of sandstone marked with patterns and so forth  mixed with these are the common rude appliances quern stones for grinding grain stone hammers stone polishers cut antlers of deer pointed bones such as rude peoples did actually use in early britain and may have retained into the early middle ages say 400700 ad  this mixed set of objects plus the sites in which they were found and a huge canoe 35 feet long is the material part of the clyde mystery the querns and canoe and stonepolishers and bones and horns are commonly found we say in dwellings of about 400700 ad  the peculiar and enigmatic things are not elsewhere known to scottish antiquaries how did the two sets of objects come to be all mixed up together in an old hill fort at dunbuie on clyde and among the wooden foundations of two mysterious structures excavated in the mud of the clyde estuary at dumbuck and langbank near dumbarton  they were dug up between 1896 and 1902  this is the question which has been debated mainly in newspaper controversy for nearly ten years  a most rambling controversy it has been casting its feelers as far as central australia in space and as far back as say 1200 bc in time  either the disputed objects at the museum are actual relics of life lived in the clyde basin many centuries ago or the discoverers and excavators of the old sites are dogged by a forger who dumps down false relics of kinds unknown to scottish antiquaries or some of the unfamiliar objects are really old while others are jocose imitations of these orthere is some other explanation  the modern clyde artists are credited by dr robert munro with some practical artistic skill and some acquaintance with the very old and mysterious designs on great rocks among the neighbouring hills 4  what man of artistic skill no conscience and a knowledge of archaic patterns is associated with the clyde  the faker is not the mere mischievous wag of the farmhouse or the country shop  it is possible that a few interpolations of false objects have been made by another and less expert hand but the weight of the problem rests on these alternativesthe disputed relics which were found are mainly genuine though unfamiliar or a forger not destitute of skill and knowledge has invented and executed themorthere is some other explanation  three paths as usual are open to science in the present state of our knowledge of the question  we may pronounce the unfamiliar relics genuine and prove it if we can  we may declare them to be false objects manufactured within the last ten years  we may possess our souls in patience and put the objects to a suspense account awaiting the results of future researches and of new information  this attitude of suspense is not without precedent in archaeology antiquarian lore as dr munro remarks by implication can distinguish between true and false antiquities 5a  but time is needed for the verdict as we see when dr munro describes the breonio controversy about disputed stone objects a controversy which began in 1885 and appears to be undecided in 1905 5b  i propose to advocate the third course the waiting game and i am to analyse dr munros very able arguments for adopting the second course and deciding that the unfamiliar relics are assuredly impostures of yesterdays manufacture     iidr munros book on the mystery   dr munros acute and interesting book archaeology and false antiquities 6 does not cover the whole of its amusing subject  false gems coins inscriptions statues and pictures are scarcely touched upon the author is concerned chiefly with false objects of the prehistoric and protohistoric periods and with these as bearing on the clyde controversy of 18961905  out of 292 pages at least 130 treat directly of that local dispute others bear on it indirectly  i have taken great interest in this subject since i first heard of it by accident in the october or november of 1898  as against dr munro from whose opinions i provisionally dissent i may be said to have no locus standi  he is an eminent and experienced archaeologist in matters of european prehistoric and protohistoric times  any one is at liberty to say of me what another celebrated archaeologist mr charles hercules read said in a letter to dr munro on december 7 1901 about some one else a person designated as  and described as a merely literary man who cannot understand that to practised people the antiquities are as readable as print and a good deal more accurate 7  but though merely literary like mr  i have spent much time in the study of comparative anthropology of the manners ideas customs implements and sacred objects of uncivilised and peasant peoples  mr  may not have done so whoever he is  again as practised people often vary widely in their estimates of antique objects or objects professing to be antique i cannot agree with mr read that the antiquities are as readable as printif by antiquities he means antiquities in general at the british museum i can show mr read several admirable specimens of the art of faking standing like the abomination of desolation where they ought not  it was not by unpractised persons that they were purchased at the national expense  we are all fallible even the oldest of us  i conceive mr read however to mean the alleged and disputed antiquities of the clyde sites and in that case his opinion that they are a curious swindle is of the most momentous weight  but as to practised opinion on antiquities in general dr munro and i agree that it is really very fallible now and again  the best authorities he proves may read antiquities differently  he is not certain that he has not himself on occasion taken fakes for true antiques 8a  the savants of the louvre were lately caught by the notorious tiara of saitaphernes to the pecuniary loss of france were caught on april 1 1896 and were made poissons davril to the golden tune of 200000 francs 8000 pounds  again m lartet and mr christy betted a friend that he could not hoax them with a forged palaeolithic drawing  they lost their bet and after m lartets death the forged object was published as genuine in the scientific journal materiaux 1874 8b  as m reinach says of another affair it was a fumisterie 8c  every archaeologist may be the victim of a fumisterie few have wholly escaped and we find dr furtwangler and mr cecil smith at odds as to whether a head of zeus in terracotta be of the fifth century bc or quite the contrary of the nineteenth or twentieth century ad  verily all practised people do not find antiquities as readable as print  on the other hand my late friend dr a s murray keeper of classical antiquities in the british museum read the mycenaean antiquities erroneously placing them many centuries too late  m de mortillet reckoned them forgeries and wrote of the discoverer dr schliemann and even of mrs schliemann in a tone unusual in men of science and gentlemen  the great palaeolithic discoveries of m boucher de perthes the very bases of our study of the most ancient men were read as impostures by many practised people  m cartailhac again has lately in the most candid and honourable way recanted his own original disbelief in certain wallpaintings in spanish caves of the period called palaeolithic for long suspected by him of being clerical impostures 9  thus even the most practised people like general councils may err and have erred when confronted either with forgeries or with objects old in fact but new to them  they have not always found antiquities as readable as print  dr munro touches but faintly on these follies of the wise but they are not unusual follies  this must never be forgotten  where practised people may be mistaken through a too confirmed scepticism the merely literary man may once in an azure moon happen to be right or not demonstrably wrong that is my excuse for differing provisionally from practised people  it is only provisionally that i dissent from dr munro as to some of the points at issue in the clyde controversy  i entered on it with very insufficient knowledge i remain we all remain imperfectly informed and like people rich in practicedr joseph anderson and sir arthur mitchelli suspend my judgement for the present 10  this appears to me the most scientific attitude  time is the great revealer  but dr munro as we saw prefers not to suspend his judgment and says plainly and pluckily that the disputed objects in the clyde controversy are spurious are what the world calls fakes though from a delicate sense of the proprieties of language he will not call them forgeries  they are reckoned by him among false antiquities while for my part i know not of what age they are but incline i believe that many of them are not of the nineteenth century  this is the extent of our difference  on the other hand i heartily concur with dr munro in regretting that his adviceto subject the disputed objects at the earliest possible stage of the proceedings to a jury of expertswas not accepted 11a  one observation must be made on dr munros logical method as announced by himself  my role on the present occasion is to advocate the correctness of my own views on purely archaeological grounds without any special effort to refute those of my opponents 11b  as my view is that the methods of dr munro are perhapsand i say it with due deference and with doubtcapable of modification i shall defend my opinions as best i may  moreover my views in the course of seven long years 18981905 have necessarily undergone some change partly in deference to the arguments of dr munro partly because much new information has come to my knowledge since 189899  moreover on one occasion i misstated my own view and though i later made my real opinion perfectly dear some confusion was generated     iiithe clyde controversy   it is necessary after these prefatory remarks to give an account of the rise of the clyde controversy and i may be pardoned for following the example of dr munro who adds and cannot but add a pretty copious narrative of his own share in the discussion  in 1896 the hill fort of dunbuie about a mileandahalf to the east of dumbarton castle and three miles to the west of the roman wall 12 was discovered by mr w a donnelly that is to say mr donnelly suggested that the turf might conceal something worth excavating and the work was undertaken under his auspices by the helensburgh antiquarian society  as mr donnellys name constantly occurs in the discussion it may be as well to state that by profession he is an artista painter and designer in black and whiteand that while keenly interested in the prehistoric or protohistoric relics of clydesdale he makes no claim to be regarded as a trained archaeologist or widelyread student  thus after mr donnelly found a submarine structure at dumbuck in the estuary of the clyde dr munro writes i sent mr donnelly some literature on crannogs 13a  so mr donnelly it appears had little book lore as to crannogs  he is in fact a field worker in archaeology rather than an archaeologist of the study and of books  he is a member of a local archaeological society at helensburgh on the clyde and before he found the hill fort of dunbuie he had discovered an interesting set of cup and ring marked rocks at auchentorlie only a short distance from dunbuie 13b  mr donnellys position then as regards archaeological research was in 18961898 very like that of dr schliemann when he explored troy like dr schliemann he was no erudite savant but an enthusiast with an eye for likely sites  like dr schliemann he discovered certain objects hitherto unknown to science at least to scottish science and like dr schliemann he has had to take the consequences of being found in such a situation  it must be added that again like dr schliemann he was not an excavator of trained experience  i gather that he kept no minute and hourlydated logbook of his explorations with full details as to the precise positions of the objects discovered while again like dr schliemann he had theories of his own with some of which i do not concur  dr munro justly insists on the absolute necessity of correctly recording the facts and relics brought to light by excavations 14a  an excavator should be an engineer or be accompanied by a specialist who can assign exact measurements for the position of every object discovered  thus dr munro mentions the case of a man who while digging a drain in his garden in scotland found an adze of jade and a prehistoric urn  dr munro declares with another expert that the jade adze is a modern australian implement which is the more amazing as i am not aware that the australians possess any jade  the point is that the modern australian adze was not as falsely reported in the pre historic urn 14b  here i cannot but remark that while dr munro justly regrets the absence of record as to precise place of certain finds he is not more hospitable to other finds of which the precise locality is indicated  things are found by mr bruce as he clears out the interior of a canoe or imbedded in the dock on the removal of the canoe 15 or in the kitchen middenthe refuse heapbut dr munro does not esteem the objects more highly because we have a distinct record as to the precise place of their finding     ivdunbuie   to return to the site first found the hill fort of dunbuie excavated in 1896  dr munro writes     there is no peculiarity about the position or structure of this fort    which differentiates it from many other forts in north britain  before    excavation there were few indications that structural remains lay    beneath the debris but when this was accomplished there were exposed    to view the foundations of a circular wall 135 feet thick enclosing    a space 30 to 32 feet in diameter  through this wall there was one    entrance passage on a level with its base 3 feet 2 inches in width    protected by two guard chambers one on each side analogous to those    so frequently met with in the brochs  the height of the remaining    part of the wall varied from 18 inches to 3 feet 6 inches  the    interior contained no dividing walls nor any indications of secondary    occupation  thus writes dr munro pp 130 131 repeating his remarks on p 181 with this addition     had any remains of intramural chambers or of a stone stair been    detected it would unhesitatingly be pronounced a broch nor in the    absence of such evidence can it be definitely dissociated from that    peculiar class of scottish buildings because the portion of wall then    remaining was not sufficiently high to exclude the possibility of    these broch characteristics having been present at a higher levela    structural deviation which has occasionally been met with  all the brochs dr munro goes on hitherto investigated have shown more or less precise evidence of a postroman civilisation their range according to dr joseph anderson being not earlier than the fifth and not later than the ninth century 17  although from more recent discoveries as for example the broch of torwodlee selkirkshire there is good reason to believe that their range might legitimately be brought nearer to roman times it makes no difference in the correctness of the statement that they all belong to the iron age  so far the broch or hill fort was not unlike other hill forts and brochs of which there are hundreds in scotland  but many of the relics alleged to have been found in the soil of dunbuie were unfamiliar in character in these islands  there was not a shard of pottery there was not a trace of metal but absence of such things is no proof that they were unknown to the inhabitants of the fort  i may go further and say that if any person were capable of interpolating false antiquities they were equally capable of concealing such real antiquities in metal or pottery as they might find to support their theories or to serve other private and obscure ends  thus at langbank were found a bronze brooch and a late celtic 200 bcad comb  these of course upset the theory held by some inquirers that the site was neolithic that is was very much earlier than the christian era  if the excavators held that theory and were unscrupulous was it not as easy for them to conceal the objects which disproved the hypothesis as to insert the disputed objectswhich do not prove it  of course dr munro nowhere suggests that any excavator is the guilty faker  i now quote dr munros account of the unfamiliar objects alleged to have been found in dunbuie  he begins by citing the late mr adam millar fsascot who described dunbuie in the proceedings s a scot vol xxx pp 291308     the fort writes mr millar has been examined very thoroughly by    picking out the stones in the interior one by one and riddling the    fine soil and small stones  the same treatment has been applied to    the refuse heap which was found on the outside and the result of the    search is a very remarkable collection of weapons implements    ornaments and figured stones  there is no description of the    precise position of any of these relics in the ruins with the    exception of two upper stones of querns and a limpet shell having on    its inner surface the presentation of a human face which are stated    to have been found in the interior of the fort  no objects of metal    or fragments of pottery were discovered in course of the excavations    and of bone there were only two small pointed objects and an awl    having a perforation at one end  the majority of the following worked    objects of stone bone and shell are so remarkable and archaic in    character that their presence in a fort which cannot be placed    earlier than the broch period and probably long after the departure    of the romans from north britain has led some archaeologists to    question their genuineness as relics of any phase of scottish    civilisation     objects of stonenine spearheads like arrowpoints of slate six    of which have linear patterns scratched on them  some are perforated    with round holes and all were made by grinding and polishing  one    object of slate shaped like a knife was made by chipping  this    knife says mr millar has a feature common to all these slate    weaponsthey seem to have been saturated with oil or fat as water    does not adhere to them but runs off as from a greasy surface    another highly ornamental piece of cannel coal is in the form of a    short spearhead with a thickish stem  the stem is adorned with a    series of hollows and ridges running across it radiating lines    running from the stem to the margin  another group of these    remarkable objects shows markings of the cupandring order circles    linear incisions and perforations  some of these ornamentations are    deeply cut on the naturally rough surfaces of flat pieces of    sandstone whilst others are on smooth stones artificially prepared    for the purpose  a small piece of flint was supposed to have been    inserted into a partially burnt handle  there are several examples of    hammerstones of the ordinary crannog type rubbingstones    whetstones as well as a large number of waterworn stones which might    have been used as handmissiles or slingstones  these latter were    not native to the hill and must have been transported from burns in    the neighbourhood  there are also two upper quern stones     miscellaneous objectsa number of splintered pieces of bone without    showing any other evidence of workmanship have linear incisions like    those on some of the stones which suggest some kind of cryptic    writing like ogams  there are also a few waterworn shells like    those seen on a sandy beach having round holes bored through them and    sharplycut scratches on their pearly inner surface  but on the whole    the edible molluscs are but feebly represented as only five oyster    one cockle three limpet and two mussel shells were found nearly all    of which bore marks of some kind of ornamentation  but perhaps the    most grotesque object in the whole collection is the limpet shell with    a human face sculptured on its inner surface     the eyes writes mr millar are represented by two holes the nose    by sharplycut lines and the mouth by a welldrawn waved line the    curves which we call cupids bow being faithfully followed  there is    nothing at all of an archaic character however in this example of    shellcarving  we found it in the interior of the fort it was one of    the early findsnothing like it has been found since at the same    time we have no reason for assuming that this shell was placed in the    fort on purpose that we might find it  the fact that it was taken out    of the fort is all that we say about it     mr millars opinion of these novel handicraft remains was that they    were the products of a preceltic civilisation  the articles found    he writes are strongly indicative of a much earlier period than post    roman they point to an occupation of a tribe in their stone age     we have no knowledge of the precise position in which the queer    things of dunbuie were found with the exception of the limpet shell    showing the carved human face which according to a recent statement    in the journal of the british archaeological association september    1901 was excavated from a crevice in the living rock over which    tons of debris had rested  when taken out the incrustations of dirt    prevented any carving from being seen it was only after being dried    and cleaned that the face appeared as well as the suspension holes    on each side     so this unique piece of art was in the fort before it became a ruin    and otherwise presented evidence of great antiquity but yet it is    stated in mr millars report that there was nothing at all of an    archaic character in this example of shellcarving 21  i have nothing to do with statements made in the journal of the british archaeological association about a carved oyster shell  i stick to the limpet shell of mr millar which to my eyes looks anything but archaic     vhow i came into the controversy   thus far i was so much to be sympathised with as never to have heard of the names of dunbuie and of mr donnelly  in this ignorance i remained till late in october or early in november 1898  on an afternoon of that date i was reading the proof sheets kindly lent to me by messrs macmillan of the native tribes of central australia by messrs spencer and gillen a work now justly celebrated which was published early in 1899  i was much interested on finding in this book that certain tribes of central australiathe arunta nation and the kaitishpaint on sacred and other rocks the very same sorts of archaic designs as mr donnelly found incised at auchentorlie of which i had not then heard  these designs are familiar in many other parts of scotland and of the world  they play a great part in the initiations and magic of central australia  designs of the same class are incised by the same australian tribes on stones of various shapes and sizes usually portable and variously shaped which are styled churinga nanja churinga merely means anything sacred that is with a superstitious sense attached to it  they also occur on wooden slats churinga irula commonly styled bull roarers by europeans  the tribes are now in a siderolithic stage using steel when they can get it stone when they cannot  if ever they come to abandon stone implements while retaining their magic or religion they will keep on using their stone churinga nanja  while i was studying these novel australian facts in the autumn of 1898 a friend a distinguished member of clan diarmaid passing by my window in london saw me and came in  he at once began to tell me that in the estuary of the clyde and at dunbuie some one had found small stones marked with the same archaic kinds of patterns cupandring half circles and so forth as exist on our inscribed rocks cists and other large objects  i then showed him the illustrations of portable stones in australia with archaic patterns not then published but figured in the proof sheets of messrs spencer and gillens work  my friend told me later that he had seen small stone incised with concentric circles found in the excavation of a hill fort near tarbert in kintyre  he made a sketch of this object from memory if found in central australia it would have been reckoned a churinga nanja  i was naturally much interested in my friends account of objects found in the clyde estuary which as far as his description went resembled in being archaically decorated the churinga nanja discovered by messrs spencer and gillen in central australia  i wrote an article on the subject of the archaic decorative designs as found all over the world for the contemporary review 24  i had then seen only pen and ink sketches of the objects sent to me by mr donnelly and a few casts which i passed on to an eminent authority  one of the casts showed a round stone with concentric circles  i know not what became of the original or of the casts  while correcting proofs of this article i read in the glasgow herald january 7 1899 a letter by dr munro impugning the authenticity of one set of finds by mr donnelly in a pilestructure at dumbuck on the clyde near dumbarton  i wrote to the glasgow herald adducing the australian churinga nanja as parallel to mr donnellys inscribed stones and thus my share in the controversy began  what dr munro and i then wrote may be passed over in this place     vidumbuck   it was in july 1898 that mr donnelly who had been prospecting during two years for antiquities in the clyde estuary found at low tide certain wooden stumps projecting out of the mud at low water  on august 16 1898 dr munro with mr donnelly inspected these stumps before excavations were made 25a  it is not easy to describe concisely the results of their inspection and of the excavations which followed  so far the facts of the site not of the alleged relics though highly interesting as evidence of the hand of man in the early navigation of the clyde basin present nothing very remarkable or important says dr munro 25b  i shall here quote dr munros descriptions of what he himself observed at two visits of august 16 october 12 1898 to dumbuck  for the present i omit some speculative passages as to the original purpose of the structure     the socalled dumbuck crannog that being the most convenient name    under which to describe the submarine wooden structures lately    discovered by mr w a donnelly in the estuary of the clyde lies    about a mile to the east of the rock of dumbarton and about 250 yards    within highwater mark  at every tide its site is covered with water    to a depth of three to eight feet but at low tide it is left high and    dry for a few hours so that it was only during these tidal intervals    that the excavations could be conducted     on the occasion of my first visit to dumbuck before excavations were    begun mr donnelly and i counted twentyseven piles of oak some 5 or    8 inches in diameter cropping up for a few inches through the mud in    the form of a circle 56 feet in diameter  the area thus enclosed was    occupied with the trunks of small trees laid horizontally close to    each other and directed towards the centre and so superficial that    portions of them were exposed above the surrounding mud but all    hollows and interstices were levelled up with sand or mud  the tops    of the piles which projected above the surface of the logpavement    were considerably worn by the continuous action of the muddy waters    during the ebb and flow of the tides a fact which suggested the    following remarkable hypothesis their tops are shaped in an oval    conical form meant to make a joint in a socket to erect the    superstructure on  these words are quoted from a report of a    conjoint visit of the geological and philosophical societies to the    dumbuck crannog 8th april 1899 26     the result of the excavations so far as i can gather from    observations made during my second visit to the crannog and the    descriptions and plans published by various societies may be briefly    stated as follows     the logpavement within the circle of piles was the upper of three    similar layers of timbers placed one above the other the middle layer    having its beams lying transversely to that immediately above and    below it  one of the piles about 4 feet long when freshly drawn up    clearly showed that it had been pointed by a sharp metal implement    the cutting marks being like those produced by an ordinary axe  the    central portion about 6 feet in diameter had no woodwork and the    circular cavity thus formed when cleared of fallen stones showed    indications of having been walled with stones and clay  surrounding    this walled cavitythe socalled well of the explorers there was a    kind of coping in the form of five or six raised mounds arranged    rosette fashion in regard to which mr donnelly thus writes     one feature that strikes me very much in the configuration of the    structure in the centre is those places marked x fig 20 around    which i have discovered the presence of soft wood piles 5 inches in    diameter driven into the ground and bounding the raised stone    arrangement the stones in these rude circular pavements or cairns are    laid slightly slanting inwards 27     from this description and especially the slanting inwards of these    circular pavements or cairns it would appear that they formed the    bases for wooden stays to support a great central pole a suggestion    which on different grounds has already been made by dr david    murray     the surrounding piles were also attached to the horizontal logs by    various ingenious contrivances such as a fork a natural bend an    artificial check or a mortised hole and some of the beams were    pinned together by treenails the perforations of which were    unmistakable  this binding together of the wooden structures is a    wellknown feature in crannogs as was demonstrated by my    investigations at lochlee and elsewhere 28a  it would be still more    necessary in a substratum of timbers that was intended as will be    afterwards explained to bear the weight of a superincumbent cairn    underneath the layers of horizontal woodwork some portions of heather    bracken and brushwood were detected and below this came a succession    of thin beds of mud loam sand gravel and finally the blue clay    which forms the solum of the river valley 28b  the piles penetrated    this latter but not deeply owing to its consistency and so the blue    clay formed an excellent foundation for a structure whose main object    was resistance to superincumbent pressure     outside the circle of piles there was at a distance of 12 to 14 feet    another wooden structure in the shape of a broad ring of horizontal    beams and piles which surrounded the central area  the breadth of    this outer ring was 7 feet and it consisted of some nine rows of    beams running circumferentially  beyond this lay scattered about some    rough cobble stones as if they had fallen down from a stone structure    which had been raised over the woodwork  the space intervening    between these wooden structures was filled up in its eastern third    with a refuse heap consisting of broken and partially burnt bones of    various animals the shells of edible molluscs and a quantity of    ashes and charcoal evidently the debris of human occupancy  on the    north or landward side the outer and inner basements of woodwork    appeared to coalesce for 5 or 6 yards leaving an open space having    stones embedded in the mud and decayed wood a condition of things    which suggested a rude causeway  when mr donnelly drew my attention    to this i demurred to its being so characterised owing to its    indefiniteness  at the outer limit of this socalled causeway and    about 25 feet northeast of the circle of piles a canoe was    discovered lying in a kind of dock rudely constructed of side stones    and wooden piling  the canoe measures 355 feet long 4 feet broad    and 15 foot deep  it has a square stern with a movable board two    grasping holes near the stem and three round perforations 2 inches    in diameter in its bottom  on the northwest border of the    logpavement a massive ladder of oak was found one end resting on the    margin of the logpavement and the other projecting obliquely into the    timberless zone between the former and the outer woodwork  it is thus    described in the proceedings of the glasgow philosophical    society29     made of a slab of oak which has been split from the tree by wedges    on one side little has been done to dress the work it is 15 feet 3    inches long 2 feet broad and 35 inches thick  six holes are cut    for steps 12 inches by 10 inches the bottom of each is bevelled to    an angle of 60 degrees to make the footing level when the ladder is in    position  on one side those holes show signs of wear by long use     an under quern stone 19 inches in diameter was found about halfway    between the canoe and the margin of the circle of piles and    immediately to the east of the socalled causeway already described     i carefully examined the surface of the logpavement with the view of    finding evidence as to the possibility of its having been at any time    the habitable area of this strange dwellingplace but the result was    absolutely negative as not a single particle of bone or ash was    discovered in any of its chinks  this fact together with the    impossibility of living on a surface that is submerged every twelve    hours and the improbability of any land subsidence having taken place    since prehistoric times or any adequate depression from the shrinkage    of the understructures themselves compels me to summarily reject the    theory that the dumbuck structure in its present form was an ordinary    crannog  the most probable hypothesis and that which supplies a    reasonable explanation of all the facts is that the woodwork was the    foundation of a superstructure of stones built sufficiently high to be    above the action of the tides and waves over which there had been    some kind of dwellingplace  the unique arrangement of the wooden    substructures suggests that the central building was in the form of a    round tower with very thick walls like the brochs and other forts of    north britain  the central space was probably occupied with a pole    firmly fixed at its base in the well and kept in position by    suitable stays resting partly on the stone cairns already    described partly in wooden sockets fixed into the logpavement and    partly on the inner wall of the tower  this suggestion seems to me to    be greatly strengthened by the following description of some holed    treeroots in mr bruces paper to the scottish antiquaries 30     midway between the centre and the outside piles of the structure what    looked at first to be treeroots or snags were noticed partly imbedded    in the sand  on being washed of the adhering soil holes of 12 inches    wide by 25 inches deep were found cut in them at an angle to all    appearance for the insertion of struts for the support of an upper    structure  on the outside 14 inches down on either side holes of 2    inches diameter were found intersecting the central hole apparently    for the insertion of a wooden key or trenail to retain the struts    these were found at intervals and were held in position by stones and    smaller jammers     the outer woodwork formed the foundation of another stone structure    of a horseshoe shape having the open side to the north or landside of    the tower which doubtless was intended as a breakwater  by means of    the ladder placed slantingly against the wall of the central stone    building access could be got to the top in all states of the tides     the people who occupied this watchtower ground their own corn and    fared abundantly on beef mutton pork venison and shellfish  the    food refuse and other debris were thrown into the space between the    central structure and the breakwater forming in the course of time a    veritable kitchenmidden     besides the causeway on the north side mr bruce describes a belt of    stones forming a pavement about six feet wide and just awash with the    mud extending westwards about twenty yards from the central cavity    till it intersected the breakwater 31  these socalled pavements    and causeways were probably formed during the construction of the    tower with its central pole or perhaps at the time of its demolition    as it would be manifestly inconvenient to transport stones to or from    such a place in the midst of so much slush without first making some    kind of firm pathway  their present superficial position alone    demonstrates the absurdity of assigning the dumbuck structures to    neolithic times as if the only change effected in the bed of the    clyde since then would be the deposition of a few inches of mud  at a    little distance to the west of these wooden structures there is the    terminal end of a modern ditch the burn of mr alston extending    towards the shore and having on its eastern bank a row of stepping    stones a fact which in my opinion partly accounts for the    demolition of the stonework which formerly stood over them  so far    the facts disclosed by the excavations of the structures at dumbuck    though highly interesting as evidence of the hand of man in the early    navigation of the clyde basin present nothing very remarkable or    improbable  it is when we come to examine the strange relics which    the occupants of this habitation have left behind them that the real    difficulties begin  dr munro next describes the disputed things found at dumbuck  they were analogous to those alleged to have been unearthed at dunbuie  they were     a number of strange objects like spearheads or daggers showing more    or less workmanship and variously ornamented  one great spearhead    figure 1 like an arrowpoint is 11 inches long and 475 inches    wide at the barbs  the stem is perforated with two holes in one of    which there was a portion of an oak pin  it has a flat body and    rounded edges and is carefully finished by rubbing and grinding  one    surface is ornamented with three cupmarks from which lines radiate    like stars or suns and the other has only small cups and a few    transverse lines  there are some shaped stones sometimes perforated    for suspension made of the same material while another group of    similar objects is made of cannel coal  all these are highly    ornamented by a fantastic combination of circles dots lines cupand    rings with or without gutters and perforations  a small pebble    plate xv no 10 shows on one side a boat with three men plying    their oars and on the other an incised outline of a left hand having    a small cupandring in the palm  the most sensational objects in the    collection are however four rude figures cut out of shale figs 50    53 representing portions of the human face and person  one    evidently a female figure 2 we are informed was found at the bottom    of the kitchen midden a strange restingplace for a goddess the    other three are grotesque efforts to represent a human face  there    are also several oystershells ornamented like some of the shale    ornaments and very similar to the oystershell ornaments of dunbuie    a splinter of a hard stone is inserted into the tine of a deerhorn as    a handle plate xiii no 5 and another small blunt implement no    1 has a bone handle  a few larger stones with cupmarks and some    portions of partially worked pieces of shale complete the art gallery    of dumbuck  it seemed as if some curse were on mr donnelly  whether he discovered an unique old site of human existence in the water or on the land some viewless fiend kept sowing the soil with bizarre objects unfamiliar to dr munro and by him deemed incongruous with the normal and known features of human life on such sites     viilangbank   the curse that is the forger unwearied and relentless next smote mr john bruce fsascot merely as it seems because he and mr donnelly were partners in the perfectly legitimate pastime of archaeological exploration  mr bruces share of the trouble began at dumbuck  the canoe was found the genuine canoe  it was at once cleared out by myself writes mr bruce  in the bottom of the canoe he found a spearshaped slate object and an ornamented oyster shell which has since mouldered away and a stone pendant object and an implement of bone 34  such objects have no business to be found in a canoe just discovered under the mud of clyde and cleared out by mr bruce himself a man or affairs and of undisputed probity  in this case the precise site of the dubious relics is given by a man of honour at first hand  i confess that my knowledge of human nature does not enable me to contest mr bruces written attestation while i marvel at the astuteness of the forger  as a finder on this occasion mr bruce was in precisely the same position as dr munro at elie when as he says as the second piece of pottery was disinterred by myself i was able to locate its precise position at six inches below the surface of the relic bed 35  mr bruce was able to locate his finds at the bottom of the canoe  if i understand mr bruces narrative a canoe was found under the mud and was cleared out inside by mr bruce himself  had the forger already found the canoe kept the discovery dark inserted fraudulent objects and waited for others to rediscover the canoe  or was he present at the first discovery and did he subtly introduce unnoted by any one four objects of shell stone and bone which he had up his sleeve ready for an opportunity  one or other alternative must be correct and either hypothesis has its difficulties  meanwhile sir arthur mitchell not a credulous savant says the evidence of authenticity in regard to these doubted objects from dumbuck is the usual evidence in such circumstances    it is precisely the same evidence of authenticity which is furnished in regard to all the classes of objects found in the dumbuck explorationthat is in regard to the canoe the quern the bones etcabout the authenticity of which no doubts have been expressed as in regard to objects about which doubts have been expressed 36a  of another object found by a workman at dumbuck dr munro writes is it not very remarkable that a workman groping with his hand in the mud should accidentally stumble on this relicthe only one found in this part of the site  is it possible that he was an unconscious thoughtreader and was thus guided to make the discovery of a thing which could as readily have been inserted there halfanhour before 36b  this passage is rote sarcustic  but surely dr munro will not he cannot argue that mr bruce was an unconscious thoughtreader when he cleared out the interior of the canoe and found three disputed objects in the bottom  if we are to be psychical there seems less evidence for unconscious thoughtreading than for the presence of what are technically styled apportsthings introduced by an agency of supranormal character vulgarly called a spirit  undeterred by an event which might have struck fear in constantem virum mr bruce in the summer of 1901 was so reckless as to discover a fresh submarine wooden structure at langbank on the left or south bank of the clyde estuary opposite dumbarton castle  the dangerous object was cautiously excavated under the superintendence of mr bruce and a committee of the glasgow archaeological society  to be brief the larger features were akin to those of dumbuck without the central well or hole supposed by dr munro to have held the pole of a beacon cairn  the wooden piles as at dumbuck had been fashioned by sharp metal tools 37  this is mr bruces own opinion  this evidence of the use of metal tools is a great point of dr munro against such speculative minds as deem dumbuck and langbank neolithic that is of a date long before the christian era  they urged that stone tools could have fashioned the piles but i know not that partisans of either opinion have made experiments in hewing trees with stoneheaded axes like the ingenious monsieur hippolyte muller in france 38a  i am at present of opinion that all the sites are of an age in which iron was well known to the natives and bronze was certainly known  the relics at langbank were 1 of a familiar and 2 of an unfamiliar kind  there was 1 a small bone comb with a late celtic 200 bc ad design of circles and segments of circles there was a very small penannular brooch of brass or bronze there were a few cut fragments of deer horn pointed bones stone polishers and so forth all familiar to science and acceptable 38b  on the other hand the curse fell on mr bruce in the shape of two perforated shale objects on one was cut a grotesque face on the other two incomplete concentric circles a stem line with little nicks and two vague incised marks which may or may not represent fragments of deer horn 38c  we learn from mr bruce that he first observed the langbank circle of stones from the window of a passing train and that he made a few slight excavations apparently at the end of september 1901  more formal research was made in october and again under the superintendence of members of the glasgow archaeological society in september october 1902  no members of the glasgow committee were present when either the undisputed late celtic comb or the inscribed perforated and disputed pieces of cannel coal were discovered  illustrations of these objects and of the bronze penannular ring are here given figures 1 2 3 4 two shale objects are omitted by the kindness of the glasgow archaeological society transactions vol v p 1  the brooch allowed to be genuine might date from romanobritish times say 100400 ad to any date up to late mediaeval times 39  good evidence to date in a wide sense would be the osseous remains the bones left in the refuse at langbank and dumbuck  of the bones i only gather as peculiarly interesting that dr bryce has found those of bos longifrons  of bos longifrons as a proof of date i know little  mr ridgeway disney professor of archaeology in the university of cambridge is not a merely literary man  in his work the early age of greece vol i pp 334 335 cambridge university press 1901 mr ridgeway speaks of bos as the celtic ox coeval with the swiss lake dwellings and known as bos brachycerosshort hornso styled by rutimeyer  if he is celtic i cannot say how early bos may have existed among the celts of britain but the romans are thought by some persons to have brought the celtic ox to the celts of our island  if this be so the clyde sites are not earlier or bos in these sites is not earlier than the roman invasion  he lasted into the seventh or eighth centuries ad at least and is found on a site discovered by dr munro at elie 40a meanwhile archaeology is so lazy that after seven years dr bryces reports on the osseous remains of langbank and dumbuck is but lately published 40b   figs 1 2 p40ajpg  dr bryce in his report to the glasgow archaeological society says that bos longifrons has a wide range in time from neolithic down to perhaps even medieval times  it was the domestic ox in scotland for an unknown period before during and for an unknown time after the roman invasion     the occurrence of extinct probably long extinct breeds and these only make the phenomena in this respect at langbank exactly comparable with those observed at sites of pile buildings in scotland generally and thus it becomes indirect evidence against the thesis that the structure belongs to some different category and to quite recent times 40c   fig 3 p40bjpg  the evidence of the bones then denotes any date except a relatively recent date of 15561758 contrary to an hypothesis to be touched on later  it follows from the presence of bos at elie 700 ad that the occupants of the clyde sites at langbank may have lived there as late as say 750 ad  but when they began to occupy the sites is another question   fig 4 p40cjpg  if roman objects are found as they are in brochs which show many relics of bronze it does not follow that the brochs had not existed for centuries before the inhabitants acquired the waifs and strays of roman civilisation  in the nine caithness brochs described by dr joseph anderson 41 there was a crucible    with a portion of melted bronze a bronze ring moulds for ingots an ingot of bronze bits of roman samian ware but no iron  we can be sure that the broch folk were at some time in touch of roman goods brought by traffickers perhaps but how can we be sure that there were no brochs before the arrival of the romans  we shall return to the question of the disputable relics of the clyde after discussing what science has to say about the probable date and original purpose of the wooden structures in the clyde estuary  nobody it is admitted forged them but on the other hand dr munro the one most learned authority on lake dwellings or crannogs does not think that the sites were ever occupied by regular crannogs or lacustrine settlements lake dwellings     viiithe original date and purpose of dumbuck and langbank   the actual structures of langbank and dumbuck then are confessedly ancient remains they are not of the nineteenth century they are unique in our knowledge and we ask what was the purpose of their constructors and what is their approximate date  dr munro quotes and discusses 43 a theory or a tentative guess of dr david murray  that scholar writes river cairns are commonly built on piled platforms and my doubt is whether this is not the nature of the structure in question dumbuck  a river cairn is a solid pile of stonework with perhaps a pole in the centre  at dumbuck there is the central well of six feet in diameter  dr murray says that a pole carried down to the bottom would probably be sunk in the clay which would produce a hole or welllike cavity similar to that of the dumbuck structure 44  it is not stated that the poles of river cairns usually demand accommodation to the extent of six feet of diameter in the centre of the solid mass of stones and as the langbank site has no central well the tentative conjecture that it was a river cairn is not put forward  dr murray suggests that the dumbuck cairn may have been one of the works of 1556 or 1612 that is of the modern age of queen mary and james vi  the object of such corporation cairns was no doubt to mark the limit of their jurisdiction and also to serve as a beacon to vessels coming up the river  now the corporation with its jurisdiction and beacons is purely modern in 1758 the corporation had a lower cairn if it did not occupy this very spot dumbuck it stood upon the same line and close to it  there are however no remains of such cairn says dr murray  he cites no evidence for the date and expenses of the demolition of the cairn from any municipal book of accounts  now we have to ask 1 is there any evidence that men in 15561758 lived on the tops of such modern cairns dating from the reign of mary stuart 2 if men then lived on the top of a cairn till their food refuse became a veritable kitchen midden as dr munro says 45 would that refuse exhibit bones of bos longifrons and over ninety bone implements sharpened antlers of deer stone polishers hammer stones a saddle stone for corn grinding and the usual debris of sites of the fifth to the twelfth centuries  3 would such a modern site exhibit these archaic relics plus a late celtic comb and penannular brooch and exhibit not one modern article of metal or one trace of old clay tobacco pipes crockery or glass  the answers to these questions are obvious  it is not shown that any men ever lived on the tops of cairns and even if they did so in modern times 15561758 they could not leave abundant relics of the broch and crannog age said to be of 4001100 ad and leave no relics of modern date  this theory or suggestion is therefore demonstrably untenable and unimaginable  dr munro however sees nothing against the supposition that dr murray is right but dr munros remarks about the hypothesis of modern cairns as a theory against which he sees nothing have the air of being an inadvertent obiter dictum  for in his conclusion and summing up he writes we claim to have established that the structures of dunbuie dumbuck and langbank are remains of inhabited sites of the earlyiron age dating to some time between the fifth and twelfth centuries 46a  i accept this conclusion and will say as little as may be about the theory of a modern origin of the sites finally discarded by dr munro  i say discarded for his theory is that the modern corporation utilised an earlier structure as a cairn or beacon or boundary mark which is perfectly possible  but if this occurred it does not affect the question for this use of the structure has left no traces of any kind  there are no relics except relics of the fifth  to twelfth  centuries  in an earlier work by dr munro prehistoric scotland p 439 published in 1899 he observes that we have no evidence as to the when or how of the removal of the stones of the hypothetical corporation cairn or round tower with very thick walls 46b or watch tower which is supposed to have been erected above the wooden substructure at dumbuck  he tentatively suggests that the stones may have been used perhaps for the stone causeway now laid along the bank of the recently made canal from a point close to the crannog to the railway  no record is cited  he now offers guesses as to the stones in the socalled pavements and causeways  first the causeways may have probably been made during the construction of the tower with its central pole here the cairn is a habitable beacon habitable on all hypotheses or again perhaps at the time of its demolition about which demolition we know nothing 47a except that the most of the stones are not now in situ  several authentic stone crannogs in scotland as to which we have information possessed no central pole but had a stone causeway still extant leading eg from the crannog to the shore of the ashgrove loch a causeway of rough blocks of sandstone slabs 47b  if one stone crannog had a stone causeway why should this ancient inhabited cairn or round tower not possess a stone causeway  though useless at high water at low water it would afford better going  in a note to ivanhoe and in his northern tour of 1814 scott describes a stone causeway to a broch on an artificial island in loch cleikhimin near lerwick  now this loch says scott was at the time when the broch was inhabited open to the flow of tide water  as people certainly did live on these structures of langbank and dunbuie during the broch and crannog age centuries 512 it really matters not to our purpose why they did so or how they did so  let us suppose that the circular wall of the stone superstructure slanted inwards as is not unusual  in that case the habitable area at the top may be reduced to any extent that is thought probable with this limitationthe habitable space must not be too small for the accommodation of the persons who filled up the eastern third of an area of from twelve to fourteen feet in breadth and in some places a foot in thickness with a veritable kitchenmidden of broken and partially burned bones of various animals shells of edible molluscs and a quantity of ashes and charcoal     48  but dr munro assures me that the remains discovered could be deposited in a few years of regular occupancy by two or three persons  the structure certainly yielded habitable space enough to accommodate the persons who in the fifth to twelfth centuries left these traces of their occupancy  beyond that fact i do not pretend to estimate the habitable area  why did these people live on this structure in the fifth to twelfth centuries  almost certainly not for the purpose of directing the navigation of the clyde  at that early date which i think we may throw far back in the space of the six centuries of the estimate or may even throw further back still the clyde was mainly navigated by canoes of two feet or so in depth though we ought to have statistics of remains of larger vessels discovered in the river bed 49a  i think we may say that the finances of glasgow in st kentigerns day about 570600 ad would not be applied to the construction of dr munros tower with its central pole and very thick walls 49b erected merely for the purpose of warning canoes off shoals in the clyde  that the purpose of the erection was to direct the navigation of clyde by canoes or by the long vessels of the viking raiders appears to me improbable  i offer periculo meo a different conjecture of which i shall show reason to believe that dr munro may not disapprove  the number of the dwellers in the structure and the duration of their occupancy does not affect my argument  if two natives in a very few years could deposit the veritable kitchen midden with all the sawn horns bone implements and other undisputed relics we must suppose that the term of occupancy was very brief or not continuous and that the stone structure with very thick walls like the brochs represented labours which were utilised for a few years or seldom  my doubt is as to whether the structure was intended for the benefit of navigators of the clydein shallow canoes     ixa guess at the possible purpose of langbank and dumbuck   the dumbuck structure when occupied adjoined and commanded a ford across the undeepened clyde of uncommercial times  so sir arthur mitchell informs us 51a  the langbank structure as i understand is opposite to that of dumbuck on the southern side of the river  if two strongly built structures large enough for occupation exist on opposite sides of a ford their purpose is evident they guard the ford like the two stone camps on each side of the narrows of the avon at clifton  dr munro on the other hand says the smallness of the habitable area on both sites puts them out of the category of military forts 51b my suggestion is that the structure was so far military as is implied in its being occupied with langbank on the opposite bank of clyde by keepers of the ford  in 1901 dr munro wrote even the keepers of the watchtower at the ford of dumbuck had their quern and ground their own corn 52a  this idea has therefore passed through dr munros mind though i did not know the fact till after i had come to the same hypothesis  the habitable area was therefore adequate to the wants of these festive people  i conjecture that these keepers of the watchtower at the ford were military watchers of the ford for that seems to me less improbable than that a round tower with very thick walls 52b like the brochs and other forts of north britain was built in the interests of the navigation of clyde at a very remote period 52c  but really all this is of no importance to the argument  people lived in these sites perhaps as early as 400 ad or earlier  such places of safety were sadly needed during the intermittent and turbulent roman occupation     xthe last day at old dumbuck   suppose the sites were occupied by the watchers of the ford  there they lived no man knows how long on their perch over the waters of clyde they dwelt at top of a stone structure some eight feet above low water mark for they could not live on the ground floor of which the walls fifty feet thick at the base defied the waves of the high tides driven by the west wind  there our friends lived and probably tatooed themselves and slew bos longifrons and the deer that in later ages would have been forbidden game to them  if i may trust bede born in 672 and finishing his history in 731 our friends were picts and spoke a now unknown language not that of the bretonnes or cymri or welsh who lived on the northern side of the firth of clyde  or the occupants of dumbuck on the north side of the river were cymri those of langbank on the south side were picts  i may at once say that i decline to be responsible for bede and his ethnology but he lived nearer to those days than we do  with their ladder of fifteen feet long a slab of oak split from the tree by wedges and having six holes chopped out of the solid for steps they climbed to their perch the first floor of their abode  i never heard of a ladder made in this way but the zunis used simply to cut notches for the feet in the trunk of a tree and sich a getting up stairs it must have been when there was rain and the notches were wet  time passed the kitchen midden grew and the cymri founded ailcluith clyde rock now dumbarton to this day says bede the strongest city of the britons 54  then the scots came and turned the britons out and st columba came and st kentigern from wales 573574 and began to spread the gospel among the pagan picts and cymri  stone amulets and stone idols if the disputed objects are idols and amulets have had their day as bob acres says damns have had their day and with ailcluith in scots hands twas time for us to go thought the picts and cymri of langbank and dumbuck  sadly they evacuate their old towers or cairns before the scots who now command the dumbuck ford from dumbarton  they cross to land on their stone causeway at low water  they abandon the old canoe in the little dock where it was found by mr bruce  they throw down the venerable ladder  they leave behind only the canoe the deer horns stonepolishers sharpened bones the lower stone of a quern and the now obsolete or purely folkloreish stone amulets or pendants and the figurines which to call idols is unscientific while to call them totems is to display facetious and rejoicing ignorance  dr munro merely quotes this foolish use of the term totem by others  these old things the evicted picts and cymri abandoned while they carried with them their more valuable property their early iron axes and knives their treasured bits of red samian ware inherited from roman times their amber beads and the rest of their bibelots down to the minutest fragment of pottery  or it may not have been so the conquering scots may have looted the cairns and borne the pictish cairndwellers into captivity  looking at any broch or hill fort or crannog the fancy dwells on the last day of its occupation the day when the canoe was left to subside into the mud and decaying vegetable matter of the loch  in changed times in new conditions the inhabitants move away to houses less damp and better equipped with more modern appliances  i see the little troop or perhaps only two natives cross the causeway while the minstrel sings in pictish or welsh a version of     the auld hoose the auld hoose    what though the rooms were sma    wi six feet o diameter    and a rung gaun through the ha  the tears come to my eyes as i think of the last day of old dumbuck for take it as you will there was a last day of dumbuck as of windy ilios and of carthage left deserted of the sea  so ends my little idyllic interlude and if i am wrong blame venerable bede     ximy theory of provisional date   provisionally and for the sake of argument merely may i suggest that the occupancy of these sites may be dated by me about 300550 ad  that date is well within the iron age iron had long been known and used in north britain  but to the nonarchaeological reader the terms stone age bronze age iron age are apt to prove misleading  the early iron age like the bronze age was familiar with the use of implements of stone  in the scottish crannogs admirably described by dr munro in his ancient scottish lake dwellings were found implements of flint a polished stone axehead an iron knife at the same lowest level finger rings of gold a forged english coin of the sixth or seventh century ad wellequipped canoes a common attendant of crannogs the greater part of a stone inscribed with concentric circles a cupped stone and a large quartz crystal of the kind which apaches in north america and the euahlayi tribe in new south wales use in crystal gazing  in early ages after the metals had been worked stone bronze and iron were still used as occasion served just as the australian black will now fashion an implement in palaeolithic wise with a few chips now will polish a weapon in neolithic fashion and again will chip a fragment of glass with wonderful delicacy or will put as good an edge as he can on a piece of hoop iron  i venture then merely for the sake of argument to date the origin of the clyde sites in the dark years of unrecorded turmoil which preceded and followed the roman withdrawal  the least unpractical way of getting nearer to their purpose is the careful excavation of a structure of wood and stone near eriska where prince charles landed in 1745  dr munro has seen and described this site but is unable to explain it  certainly it cannot be a corporation cairn     xiithe disputed objects   we now approach the disputed and very puzzling objects found in the three clyde sites  my object is not to demonstrate that they were actually fashioned in say 410550 ad or that they were relics of an age far more remote but merely to restate the argument of dr joseph anderson keeper of the scottish national museum and of sir arthur mitchell both of them most widely experienced and sagacious archaeologists  they play the waiting game and it may be said that they sit upon the fence i am proud to occupy a railing in their company  dr anderson spoke at a meeting of the scots society of antiquaries may 14 1900 when mr bruce read a paper on dumbuck and exhibited the finds  with regard to the relics he said that there was nothing exceptional in the chronological horizon of a portion of them from both sites dumbuck and dunbuie but as regards another portion he could find no place for it in any archaeological series as it had no recognisable affinity with any objects found anywhere else  for my part said dr anderson and he has not altered his mind i do not consider it possible or necessary in the meantime that there should be a final pronouncement on these questions  in the absence of decisive evidence which time may supply i prefer to suspend my judgmentmerely placing the suspected objects as they place themselves in the list of things that must wait for further evidence because they contradict present experience  it has often happened that new varieties of things have been regarded with suspicion on account of their lack of correspondence with things previously known and that the lapse of time has brought corroboration of their genuineness through fresh discoveries if time brings no such corroboration they still remain in their proper classification as things whose special character has not been confirmed by archaeological experience  sir arthur mitchell spoke in the same sense advising suspension of judgment and that we should await the results of fresh explorations both at dumbuck and elsewhere 61  dr murray said that the disputed finds are puzzling but we need not condemn them because we do not understand them  dr munro will not suspend his judgment the objects he declares are spurious     xiiimethod of inquiry   i remarked early in this tract that with due deference and with doubt i think dr munros methods capable of modification  i meant that i prefer unlike dr munro in this case to extend the archaeological gaze beyond the limits of things already known to occur in the scottish area whichby the waymust contain many relics still unknown  i     let observation with extensive view    survey mankind from china to peru  to discover whether objects analogous to those under dispute occur anywhere among early races of the past or present  this kind of wide comparison is the method of anthropology  thus prof rhys and others find so very archaic an institution as the reckoning of descent in the female lineinheritance going through the motheramong the picts of scotland and they even find traces of totemism an institution already outworn among several of the naked tribes of australia who reckon descent in the male line  races do not in fact advance on a straight and unbroken highway of progress  you find that the kurnai of australia are more civilised as regards the evolution of the modern family than were the picts who built crannogs and dug canoes and cultivated the soil and had domesticated animals and used iron all of them things that the kurnai never dreamed of doing  as to traces of totemism in scotland and ireland i am not persuaded by professor rhys that they occur and are attested by celtic legends about the connection of men and kinships with animals and by personal and kinship names derived from animals  the question is very obscure 63 but as the topic of totemism has been introduced i may say that many of the mysterious archaic markings on rocks and decorations of implements in other countries are certainly known to be a kind of shorthand design of the totem animal  thus a circle whence proceeds a line ending in a triple fork represents the raven totem in north america another design to our eyes meaningless stands for the wolf totem a third design a set of bands on a spear shaft does duty for the gerfalcon totem and so on 64a  equivalent marks such as spirals and tracks of emus feet occur on sacred stones found round the graves of australian blacks on the darling river  they were associated with rites which the oldest blacks decline to explain  the markings are understood to be totemic occasionally they are linear as in ogam writing 64b  any one who is interested in the subject of the origin in certain places of the patterns may turn to mr haddons evolution of art 64c  mr haddon shows how the portuguese pattern of horizontal triangles is in the art of the uncivilised natives of brazil meant to represent bats 64d  a cross dotted within a circle is directly derived through several stages from a representation of an alligator 64e  we cannot say whether or not the same pattern found at dumbuck in central australia and in tropical america arose in the schematising of the same object in nature in all three regions or not  without direct evidence we cannot assign a meaning to the patterns     xivthe possible meanings of the marks and objects   my private opinion as to the meaning of the archaic marks and the clyde objects which bear them has in part by my own fault been misunderstood by dr munro  he bases an argument on the idea that i suppose the disputed pendants to have had in clydesdale precisely the same legendary customary and magical significance as the stone churinga of the arunta tribe in australia  that is not my theory  dr munro quotes me without indicating the source which i learn is my first letter on the subject to the glasgow herald jan 10th 1899 as saying that the clyde objects are in absolutely startling agreement with the arunta churinga 65  doubtless before i saw the objects i thus overstated my case in a letter to a newspaper in 1899  but in my essay originally published in the contemporary review march 1899 and reprinted in my book magic and religion of 1901 66 i stated my real opinion  this is a maturely considered account of my views as they were in 18991901 and unlike old newspaper correspondence is easily accessible to the student it is not out of print  i compared the australian marks on small stones and on rock walls and other fixtures in the landscape with the markings on scottish boulders rock walls cists and so forth and also with the marks on the disputed objects  i added the startling analogy between australia and old scottish markings saute aux yeux and i spoke truth  down to the designs which represent footmarks the analogy is startling is of great interest and was never before made the subject of comment  i said that we could not know whether or not the markings in scotland and australia had the same meaning  as to my opinion then namely that we cannot say what is the significance of an archaic pattern in scotland or elsewhere though we may know the meaning assigned to it in central australia there can no longer be any mistake  i take the blame of having misled dr munro by an unguarded expression in a letter to the society of scottish antiquaries 67 saying that if the disputed objects were genuine they implied the survival on clyde of a singularly archaic set of ritual and magical ideas namely those peculiar to the arunta and kaitish tribes of central australia  but that was a slip of the pen merely  this being the case i need not reply to arguments of dr munro pp 248 250 against an hypothesis which no instructed person could entertain beginning with the assumption that from an unknown centre some people who held arunta ideas migrated to central australia and others to the clyde  nobody supposes that the use of identical or similar patterns and of stones of superstitious purpose implies community of race  these things may anywhere be independently evolved and in different regions may have quite different meanings if any while the use of charm stones or witch stones is common among savages and survives in england and scotland to this day  the reader will understand that i am merely applying mr e b tylors method of the study of survivals in culture which all anthropologists have used since the publication of mr tylors primitive culture thirtyfive years ago     xvquestion of method continued   what is admitted to be true of survivals in the family among the picts may also be true as to other survivals in art superstition and so forth  i would therefore compare the disputed clyde objects with others analogous to them of known or unknown purpose wheresoever they may be found  i am encouraged in this course by observing that it is pursued for example by the eminent french archaeologist monsieur cartailhac in his book les ages prehistoriques de france et despagne he does not hesitate as we shall see to compare peculiar objects found in france or spain with analogous objects of doubtful purpose found in america or the antilles  m cartailhac writes that to find anything resembling certain portuguese thin plaques of slate in the form of a crook or crozier he sought through all ethnographic material ancient and modern  he did find the parallels to his portuguese objects one from gaudeloup the other either french or from the antilles 69  sir john evans again compares british with australian objects in fact the practice is recognised  i therefore intend to make use of this comparative method  on the other hand dr munro denies that any of my analogies drawn from remote regions are analogous and it will be necessary to try to prove that they arethat my australian american portuguese and other objects are of the same kind apparently as some of the disputed relics of the clyde  if i succeed one point will be made probable  either the clyde objects are old or the modern maker knew much more of archaeology than many of his critics and used his knowledge to direct his manufacture of spurious things or he kept coinciding accidentally with genuine relics of which he knew nothing     xvimagic   again i must push my method beyond that of dr munro by considering the subject of magic in relation to perforated and other stones whether inscribed with designs or uninscribed  among the disputed objects are many such stones and it is legitimate for me to prove not only that they occur in many sites of ancient life but that their magical uses are still recognised or were very recently recognised in the british folk lore of today  a superstition which has certainly endured to the nineteenth century may obviously have existed among the picts or whoever they were of the crannog and broch period on clyde  the only a priori objection is the absence of such objects among finds made on british soil but our discoveries cannot be exhaustive time may reveal other examples and already we have a few examples apart from the objects in dispute     xviidisputed objects classified   dr munro classifies the disputed objects as weapons implements amulets or pendants cupandring stones human figurines or idols  for reasons of convenience and because what i heard about group 3 the amulets or pendants first led me into this discussion i shall here first examine them  dr munro reproduces some of them in one plate xv p 228  he does not say by what process they are reproduced merely naming them    objects of slate and stone from dumbuck  dr munro describes the amulets or pendants thus     the largest group of objects plate xv consists of the socalled    amulets or pendants of stone shale and shell some fifteen to twenty    specimens of which have been preserved and recorded as having been    found on the different stations viz three from dunbuie exclusive    of a few perforated oyster shells eleven from dumbuck and one from    langbank  their ornamentation is chiefly of the cupandring order    only a few having patterns composed of straight lines  some of them    are so large as to be unfit to be used as amulets or pendants such    for example as that represented by no 14 which is 9 inches long    35 inches broad and 05 inch thick  the ornamentation consists of a    strongly incised line running downwards from the perforation with    small branch lines directed alternately right and left  any human    being who would wear this object either as an ornament or religious    emblem would be endowed with the most archaic ideas of decorative art    known in the history of human civilisation  yet we can have no doubt    that the individual who manufactured it if he were an inhabitant of    any of the clyde sites was at the same time living in a period not    devoid of culture and was in possession of excellent cutting    implements most likely of iron with which he manipulated wood deer    horn and other substances  these objects are nearly all perforated    as if intended for suspension but sometimes in addition to this    there is a large central hole around which there is always an    ornamentation generally consisting of incised circles or semicircles    with divergent lines leading into small hollow points the socalled    cupmarks  i shall return to the theory that the stones were ornaments meanwhile i proceed to the consideration of cupmarks on stones large or small     xviiicup marks in crannogs   as to cup marks or cupules little basins styled also ecuelles now isolated now grouped now separate now joined by hollowed lines they are familiar on rocks funeral cists and so forth in asia europe and north america and australia as m cartailhac remarks in reviewing dr magnis work on cupped rocks near como 73a  their meaning escapes us says m cartailhac  these cups or cupules or ecuelles occur not only at dumbuck but in association with a scottish crannog of the iron age admirably described by dr munro himself 73b  he found a polished celt 73c and a cupped stone and he found a fragmentary block of red sandstone about a foot in length inscribed with concentric circles surrounding a cup  the remainder of the stone with the smaller part of the design was not found  here then we have these archaic patterns and marks on isolated stones one of them about 13 inches long in a genuine scottish crannog of the genuine iron age while flint celts also occur and objects of bronze therefore cup markings and other archaic markings are not unknown or suspicious things in a genuine pile structure in scotland  why then suspect them at dumbuck  at dumbuck the cups occur on a triangular block of sandstone 145 inches long and 4 inches thick  another cupped block is of 215 inches by 165 74  no forger brought these cupped stones in his waistcoat pocket  we have thus made good the point that an isolated cupped stone and an isolated stone inscribed with concentric circles round a cup do occur in a crannog containing objects of the stone bronze and iron ages  the meaning if any of these inscribed stones in the lochlee crannog is unknown  many of the disputed objects vary from them in size while presenting examples of archaic patterns  are they to be rejected because they vary in size  we see that the making of this class of decorative patterns whether they originally had a recognised meaning or whether beginning as mere decorations perhaps schematistic designs of real objects they later had an arbitrary symbolic sense imposed upon them is familiar to australians of today who use indifferently stone implements of the neolithic or of the palaeolithic type  we also know that in a remote corner of tropical america the rocks are inscribed with patterns typically identical with those engraved in the british rocks 75 these markings are in the country of the chiriquis an extinct goldworking neolithic people very considerable artists especially in the making of painted ceramics  the picts and scots have left nothing at all approaching to their pottery work  these identical patterns therefore have been independently evolved in places most remote in space and in stage of civilisation while in galloway as i shall show i have seen some of them scrawled in chalk on the flag stones in front of cottage doors  the identity of many scottish and australian patterns is undenied while i disclaim the opinion that in each region they had the same significance  i have now established the coincidence between the markings of rocks in australia in tropical america and in scotland  i have shown that such markings occur in scotland associated with remains in a crannog of the age of iron  they also occur on stones large cupped and small in dumbuck  my next business is if i can to establish what dr munro denies a parallelism between these disputed clyde stones and the larger or smaller inscribed stones of the arunta and kaitish in australia and other small stones decorated or plain found in many ancient european sites  their meaning we know not but probably they were either reckoned ornamental or magical or both     xixparallelism between the disputed objects and other objects elsewhere   on clyde if the disputed things be genuine we find decorated plaques or slabs of soft stone of very various dimensions and shapes  in australia some of these objects are round many oval others elongated others thin and pointed like a pencil others oblongwhile on clyde some are round one is coffinshaped others are paletteshaped others are pear shaped the oval tapering to one extremity one is triangular one is oblong 77  in australia as on clyde the stones bear some of the archaic markings common on the rock faces both in scotland and in central australia on large rocks they are painted in australia in scotland they are incised  i maintain that there is a singularly strong analogy between the two sets of circumstances scottish and australian large rocks inscribed with archaic designs smaller stones inscribed with some of these designs  is it not so  dr munro on the other hand asserts that there is no such parallelism  but i must point out that there is to some extent an admitted parallelism  the familiar designs which served as models to the clyde artistsplain cups and rings with or without gutter channels spirals circles concentric circles semicircles horseshoe and harp shaped figures etc occur or a selection of them occurs both on the disputed objects and on the rocks of the hills  so dr munro truly says p 260  the same marks plain cups cups and rings spirals concentric circles horseshoes medial lines with short slanting lines proceeding from them like the branches on a larch or the spine of a fish occur on the rocks of the arunta hills and also on plaques of stone cherished and called churinga sacred by the arunta 78  here is what i call parallelism  dr munro denies this parallelism  there are indeed other parallelisms with markings other than those of the rocks at auchentorlie which dr munro regards as the sources of the fakers inspiration  thus on objects from dumbuck munro plate xv figs 11 and 12 there are two signs one is a straight line horizontal with three shorter lines under it at right angles the other a line with four lines under it  these signs are very frequent in trojan antiquities and on almost all the hut urns found below the lava at marino near albano or on ancient tombs near corneto  whatever they mean and prof sayce finds the former of the two signs as a hittite hieroglyph i do not know them at auchentorlie  after a scamper among the surrounding hills the faker may have passed an evening with dr schliemanns troja 1884 pp 126 127 and may have taken a hint from the passages which have just been cited  or he may have cribbed the idea of these archaic markings from don manuel de gongora y martinez his antiguedades prehistoricas de andalucia madrid 1868 p 65 figures 70 71  in these spanish examples the marks are clearly schematised or rudimentary designs of animals in origin  our faker is a man of reading  but enfin the world is full of just such markings which may have had one meaning here another there or may have been purely decorative  race has nothing to do with the markings  they are universally human though in some cases they may have been transmitted by one to another people   fig 5 p80ajpg  the reader must decide as to whether i have proved my parallelisms denied by dr munro between the clyde australian and other markings whether on rocks or on smaller stones 80a   fig 6 p80bjpg  it suffices me to have tried to prove the parallelism between australian and clyde things and to record dr munros denial thereofi unhesitatingly maintain that there is no parallelism whatever between the two sets of objects 80b   fig 7 p80cjpg     xxunmarked charm stones   it must be kept in mind that churinga witch stones charm stones or whatever the smaller stones may be styled are not necessarily marked with any pattern  in australia in portugal in russia in france in north america in scotland as we shall see such stones may be unmarked may bear no inscription or pattern 81  these are plain magic stones such as survive in english peasant superstition  in dr munros ancient lake dwellings of europe plain stone discs perforated do occur but rarely and there are few examples of pendants with cupped marks  of these two as being cupped pendants might look like analogues of the disputed clyde stones but dr munro owing to the subsequent exposure of the horn age forgeries now has a strong suspicion that he was taken in by the things 82a  to return to scottish stones  in mr graham callanders essay on perforated stones 82b he publishes an uninscribed triangular stone with a perforation apparently for suspension  this is one of several such scottish stones and though we cannot prove it may have had a superstitious purpose  happily sir walter scott discovered and describes the magical use to which this kind of charm stone was put in 1814  when a person was unwell in the orkney isles the people like many savages supposed that a wizard had stolen his heart  the parties friends resort to a cunning man or woman who hangs about the patients neck a triangular stone in the shape of a heart 82c  this is a thoroughly wellknown savage superstition the stealing of the heart or vital spirit and its restoration by magic  this use of triangular or heartshaped perforated stones was not inconsistent with the civilisation of the nineteenth century and of course was not inconsistent with the civilisation of the picts  a stone may have magical purpose though it bears no markings  meanwhile most churinga and many of the disputed objects have archaic markings which also occur on rock faces     xxiquality of art on the stones   dr munro next reproduces two wooden churinga churinga irula as being very unlike the clydesdale objects in stone 84a figures 5 6 they are but i was speaking of australian churinga nanja of stone a stone churinga 84b presented i think by mr spencer through me to the scottish society of antiquaries also reproduced by dr munro is a much better piece of work as i saw when it reached me than most of the clyde things  the clyde amulets are says dr munro neither strictly oval nor are very many australian samples nor well finished nor symmetrical being generally waterworn fragments of shale or clay slate     they thus resemble ancient red indian pendants  as to the art of the patterns the australians have a considerable artistic gift as grosse remarks 85a while either the clyde folk had less or the modern artists had not some practical artistic skill but dr munro has said that any one with some practical artistic skill could whittle the clyde objects 85b  he also thinks that in one case they disclose the hand of one not altogether ignorant of art p 231  let me put a crucial question  are the archaic markings on the disputed objects better or worse or much on a level with the general run of such undisputably ancient markings on large rocks cists and cairns in scotland  i think the art in both cases is on the same low level  when the art on the disputed objects is more formal and precise as on some shivered stones at dunbuie the stiffness of the lines and figures reminds one more of rule and compass than of the freehand work of prehistoric artists 85c  the modern faker sometimes drew his marks freehand and carelessly sometimes his regularities suggest line and compass  now as to the use of compasses a small pair were found with late celtic remains at lough crew and plaques of bone decorated by aid of such compasses were also found 85d in a cairn of a set adorned with the archaic markings cup and ring concentric circles medial lines with shorter lines sloping from them on either side and a design representing apparently an early monocycle  for all that i know a dweller in dunbuie might have compasses like the lough crew cairn artist  if i have established the parallelism between arunta churinga nanja and the disputed clyde pendants which dr munro denies we are reduced to one of two theories  either the picts of clyde or whoever they were repeated on stones usually small some of the patterns on the neighbouring rocks or the modern faker for unknown reasons repeated these and other archaic patterns on smaller stones  his motive is inscrutable the australian parallels were unknown to european sciencebut he may have used european analogues  on the other hand while dr munro admits that the early clyde people might have repeated the rock decorations on small objects of slate and shale he says that the objects would have been even then as much out of place as surviving remains of the earlier scottish civilisation as they are at the present day 86  how can we assert that magic stones or any such stone objects perforated or not were necessarily incongruous with the earlier scottish civilisation  no civilisation old or new is incapable of possessing such stones even scotland as i shall show can boast two or three samples such as the stone of the keiss broch a perfect circle engraved with what looks like an attempt at a runic inscription and another in a kind of cursive characters     xxiisurvival of magic of stones   if incongruous with the earlier scottish civilisation the use of charm stones is not incongruous with the british civilisation of the nineteenth century  in the proceedings of the society of antiquaries scot 19021903 p 166 et seq mr graham callander already cited devotes a very careful essay to such perforated stones circular or triangular or otherwise shaped found in the garioch  they are of slate or heather stone and of various shapes and sizes  their original purpose is unknown  the perforation or cup not perforated is sometimes in the centre in a few cases in near the end  mr graham callander heard of a recent old lady in roxburghshire who kept one of these stones of irregularly circular shape behind the door for luck 88  it was always spoken of as a charm though its ancient maker may have intended it for some prosaic practical use   fig 8 p88jpg  i take the next example that comes to hand  thin flat oolite stones having a natural perforation are found in abundance on the yorkshire coast  they are termed witch stones and are tied to door keys or suspended by a string behind the cottage door to keep witches out 89  a thin flat perforated witch stone answers to an uninscribed arunta churinga a magic thing and its use survives in britain as in yorkshire and roxburghshire  we know no limit to the persistence of survival of superstitious things such as magic stones  this is the familiar lesson of anthropology and of folk lore and few will now deny the truth of the lesson     xxiiimodern survival of magical wood churinga   i take another example of modern survival in magic  dr munro perhaps would think wooden churinga used for magical ends incongruous with the earlier scottish civilisation  but such objects have not proved to be incongruous with the scottish civilisation of the nineteenth century  the term churinga sacred is used by the arunta to denote not only the stone churinga nanja a local peculiarity of the arunta and kaitish but also the decorated and widely diffused elongated wooden slats called bull roarers by the english  these are swung at the end of a string and produce a whirring roar supposed to be the voice of a supernormal being all over australia and elsewhere  i am speaking of survivals and these wooden churinga at least survive in scotland and in aberdeenshire they are or were lately called thunner spells or thunder bolts  it was believed that the use of this instrument during a thunderstorm saved one from being struck by the thunner bolt  in north and south america the bull roarer on the other hand is used not to avert but magically to produce thunder and lightning 91  among the kaitish thunder is caused by the churinga of their sky dweller atnatu  wherever the toy is used for a superstitious purpose it is so far churinga and so far modern aberdeenshire had the same churinga irula as the arunta  the object was familiar to palaeolithic man     xxivconclusion of argument from survivals in magic   i have made it perfectly certain that magic stones witch stones charm stones and that churinga irula wooden magical slats of wood exist in australia and other savage regions and survive as magical into modern british life  the point is beyond doubt and it is beyond doubt that in many regions the stones and the slats of wood may be inscribed with archaic markings or may be uninscribed  this will be proved more fully later  thus pictish like modern british civilisation may assuredly have been familiar with charm stones  there is no a priori objection as to the possibility  why should pictish stones not be inscribed with archaic patterns familiar to the dwellers among inscribed rocks perhaps themselves the inscribers of the rocks  manifestly there is no a priori improbability  i have seen the archaic patterns of concentric circles and fish spines or whatever we call the medial line with slanting side lines neatly designed in white on the flag stones in front of cottage doors in galloway  the cottagers dwelt near the rocks with similar patterns on the estate of monreith but are not likely to have copied them the patterns i presume were mere survivals in tradition  the picts or whoever they were might assuredly use charm stones and the only objection to the idea that they might engrave archaic patterns on them is the absence of record of similarly inscribed small stones in britain  the custom of using magic stones was not at all incongruous with the early pictish civilisation which retained a form of the family now long outworn by the civilisation of the arunta  the sole objection is that a silentio silence of archaeological records as to inscribed small stones  that is not a closer of discussion nor is the silence absolute as i shall show  moreover the appearance of an unique and previously unheardof set of inscribed stones in a site of the usual broch and crannog period is not invariably ascribed to forgery even by the most orthodox archaeologists thus sir francis terry found unheardof things not to mention a number of thin flat circular discs of various sizes in his caithness brochs  in wester broch the most remarkable things found were three eggshaped quartzite pearls having their surface painted with spots in a blackish or blackishbrown pigment  he also found a flattish circular disc of sandstone inscribed with a duck or other waterfowl while on one side was an attempt apparently to write runes on the other an inscription in unknown cursive characters  there was a boulder of sandstone with nine cup marks and there were more painted pebbles the ornaments now resembling ordinary cup marks now taking the shape of a cross and now of lines and other patterns one of which on an arunta rock is of unknown meaning among many of known totemic significance  dr joseph anderson compares these to similar pebbles painted with a red pigment which m piette found in the cavern of mas dazil of which the relics are in part at least palaeolithic or mesolithic and of dateless antiquity  in lanthropologie nov 1894 mr arthur bernard cook suggests that the pebbles of mas dazil may correspond to the stone churinga nanja of the arunta a few of which appear to be painted not incised  i argued on the contrary that things of similar appearance at mas dazil in central australia and in caithness need not have had the same meaning and purpose 95a  it is only certain that the pebbles of the caithness brochs are as absolutely unfamiliar as the inscribed stones of dumbuck  but nobody says that the caithness painted pebbles are forgeries or modern fabrications  sauce for the clyde goose is not sauce for the caithness gander 95b  the use of painted pebbles and of inscribed stones may have been merely local  in australia the stone churinga are now since 1904 known to be local confined to the arunta nation and the kaitish with very few sporadic exceptions in adjacent tribes 95c  the purely local range of the inscribed stones in central australia makes one more anxious for further local research in the clyde district and southwest coast     xxvmy misadventure with the charm stone   as dr munro introduces the subject i may draw another example of the survival of charm stones from an amusing misadventure of my own  i was once entrusted with a charm stone used in the nineteenth century for the healing of cattle in the highlands  an acquaintance of mine a mac by the mothers side inherited this heirloom with the curious box patched with wickerwork which was its ark  it was exactly of the shape of a stone churinga of the arunta tribe later reproduced by messrs spencer and gillen 96  on the surfaces of the ends were faintly traced concentric rings that wellknown pattern  i wrote in the glasgow herald that if a neolithic amulet as it appears to be it may supply the missing link in my argument as being not only a magic stone which it certainly was but a magic stone with archaic markings 97a at the british museum i presently learned the real nature of the object to my rueful amusement  it had been the stone pivot of an old farmgate and in turning on the upper and nether stones had acquired the concentric circular marks  not understanding what the thing was the highland maternal ancestors of my friend had for generations used it in the magical healing of cattle a very pretty case of survival   figs 9 10 p96ajpg  writing on october 19th i explained the facts in a letter to the glasgow herald  a pseudonymous person then averred in the same journal that i had recently told its readers that i had found the missing link in the chain that was to bind together the magic stones of the arunta and the discs images and blue points of the clyde crannog man   fig 11 p96bjpg  i never told any mortal that i had found the missing link  i said that if the stone be neolithic it may be the missing link in my argument  dr munro prints the pseudonymous letter with approval but does not correct the inaccurate statement of the writer 97b  dr munro i need not say argues with as much candour as courtesy and the omission of the necessary correction is an oversight   figs 12 13 p96cjpg  however here was a survival of the use of charm stones and i think that had the stone been uninscribed as it was accidentally inscribed with concentric circles by turning in its stone sockets my friends highland ancestors might have been less apt to think it a fairy thing and use it in cattle healing  i trust that i have now established my parallelisms  the archaic patterns of countries now civilised and of savage countries are assuredly parallel  the use of charm stones in civilisation and savagery is assuredly parallel  the application to these stones of the archaic patterns by a rude race in clydesdale familiar with the patterns on rocks in the district has in it nothing a priori improbable     xxvieuropean parallels to the disputed objects   i am not so sure as dr munro is that we have not found small perforated stones sometimes inscribed with archaic patterns sometimes plain even in scotland i shall later mention other places  for the present i leave aside the small stone inscribed with concentric horseshoes and found in a hillfort near tarbert kintyre which a friend already spoken of saw and of which he drew for me a sketch from memory  in country houses any intrinsically valueless object of this kind is apt to fall out of sight and be lost beyond recovery  sir john evans however in his work on ancient stone implements p 463 1897 writes a pendant consisting of a flat pearshaped piece of shale 25 inches long and 2 inches broad and perforated at the narrow end was found along with querns stones with concentric circles and cup shaped indentations worked in them stone balls spindle whorls and an iron axehead in excavating an underground chamber at the tappock torwood stirlingshire  one face of this pendant was covered with scratches in a vandyked pattern  though of smaller size this seems to bear some analogy with the flat amulets of schist of which several have been discovered in portugal with one face ornamented in much the same manner  for these examples sir john evans refers to the transactions of the ethnological society 100a  if by a vandyked pattern sir john means as i suppose a pattern of triangles in horizontal lines such as the portuguese patterns on stone plaques then the elements of this form of decoration appear to have been not unfamiliar to the designers of cups and rings  on the cover of a stone cist at carnwath we see inscribed concentric rings and two large equilateral triangles each containing three contingent triangles round a square space uninscribed 100b  the photograph of the tappock stone figs 9 10 shows that the marks are not of a regular vandyked pattern but are rather scribbles like those on a portuguese perforated stone given by vasconcellos and on a canadian stone pendant published by mr david boyle figs 12 13  sir john evans does not reject the pearshaped object of shale a pendant found in a scottish site and associated with querns and an iron axe and cup and ring stones  sir john sees no harm in the pendant but dr munro rejects a pearshaped claystone pendant decorated with cupshaped indentations found at dunbuie 101  it has a perforation near each end as is common in north american objects of similar nature see fig 11  why should the schist pendant of the tappock chamber be all right if the claystone pendant of dunbuie be all wrong  one of them seems to me to have as good a claim to our respectful consideration as the other and like sir john evans i shall now turn to portugal in search of similar objects of undisputed authenticity     xxviiportuguese and other stone pendants   m cartailhac the very eminent french archaeologist found not in portugal but in the cevennes plaques of slate sometimes pierced with a hole for suspension usually smaller than those of the casa da moura not ornamented yet certainly analogous with these 102a  these are also analogous with engraved plaques of schist found in prehistoric sites of the rio negro some resembling others identical with those shewn at lisbon by carlos ribeiro  but the rio negro objects appear doubtful 102b  portugal has many such plaques some adorned with designs and some plain 102c  the late don estacio da veiga devotes a chapter to them as if they were things peculiar to portugal in europe 103a  when they are decorated the ornament is usually linear in two cases 103b lines incised lead to cups  one plaque is certainly meant to represent the human form  m cartailhac holds that all the plaques with a vandyked pattern in triangles without faces are none the less des representations stylisees de silhouette humaine 103c  illustrations give an idea of them figs 14 15 16 they are more elaborate than the perforated inscribed plaques of shale or schist from dumbuck  two perforated stone plaques from volosova figured by dr munro pp 78 79 fall into line with other inscribed plaques from portugal  of these russian objects referred to by dr munro one is his fig 25 a roughly pearshaped thing in flint perforated at the thin end the other is a formless stone plaque inscribed with a cross three circles not concentric and other now meaningless scratches  it is not perforated  dr munro does not dispute the genuine character of many strange figurines in flint from volosova though the redoubtable m de mortillet denounced them as forgeries they had the misfortune to corroborate other italian finds against which m de mortillet had a grudge  but dr munro thinks that the two plaques of volosova may have been made for sale by knavish boys  in that case the boys fortuitously coincided in their fake with similar plaques of undoubted antiquity and in some prehistoric egyptian stones occasionally inscribed with mere wayward scratches  for these reasons i think the volosova plaques as genuine as any other objects from that site and corroborative so far of similar things from clyde   figs 14 15 p104jpg  to return to portugal m cartailhac recognises that the plain plaques of slate from sites in the cevennes are certainly analogous with the plaques from the casa da moura even when these are elaborately ornamented with vandyked and other patterns  i find one published case of a portuguese plaque with cups and ducts as at dumbuck fig 16 another example is in antiguedades prehistoricas de andalucia p 109 104  however dr munro leaves the cevennes andalusian and portuguese plaques out of his argument  m cartailhac then found inscribed and perforated slate tablets very common in portugues neolithic sepulchres  the perforated holes showed signs of long wear from attachment to something or somebody  one from new jersey with two holes exactly as in the dunbuie example was much akin in ornament to the portuguese plaques  one of slate was plain as plain as a bit of gas coal with a round hole bored through it recorded by dr munro from ashgrove loch crannog  a perforated shale or slate or schist or gas coal plaque as at ashgrove loch ornamented or plain is certainly like another shale schist or slate plaque plain or inscribed  we have shown that these occur in france portugal russia america and scotland not to speak of central australia  my suggestion is that if the clyde objects are forged the forger knew a good deal of archaeologyknew that perforated inscribed plaques of soft mineral occurred in many countriesbut he did not slavishly imitate the patterns  by a pleasant coincidence at the moment of writing comes to me the annual archaeological report 1904 of the canadian bureau of education kindly sent by mr david boyle  he remarks as to stone pendants found in canadian soil the forms of what we call pendants varied greatly and were probably made to adapt themselves to the natural shapes of waterworn stones     this is exactly what dr munro says about the small stone objects from the three clyde stations the pendants amulets and idols appear to have been waterworn pieces of shale or slate before they were perforated decorated and polished munro p 254  the forger may have been guided by the ancient canadian pendants that man knows everything  mr boyle goes on speaking of the superstitious still surviving instinct of treasuring such stones for some unknown reason many of us exhibit a desire to pick up pebbles so marked and examples of the kind are often carried as pocket pieces obviously for luck  he gives one case of such a stone being worn for fifty years as a watch pendant  perforated stones have always had a fetishness attached to them adds mr boyle he then publishes several figures of such stones  two of these with archaic markings like many in portugal and one with an undisputed analogue from a scottish site are reproduced figs 12 13  it is vain to tell us that the uses of such fetishistic stones are out of harmony with any civilisation  the civilisation of the dwellers in the clyde sites was not so highly advanced as to reject a superstition which still survives  nor is there any reason why these people should not have scratched archaic markings on the pebbles as they certainly cut them on stones in a scottish crannog of the iron age  dr munro agrees with me that rude scribings on shale or slate are found of a postchristian date at st blanes in bute 107  the art if art it can be called is totally different of course from the archaic types of decoration but all the things have this in common that they are rudely incised on shale or slate     xxviiiquestion as to the objects as ornaments of the person   dr munro now objects that among the objects reckoned by me as analogous to churinga is a perforated stone with an incised line and smaller slanting side lines said to have been found at dumbuck 9 inches long 35 inches broad and 05 an inch thick 108  i wish that he gave us the weight  he says that no human being would wear this as an ornament  no human being wears any churinga as an ornament  nobody says that they do  messrs spencer and gillen moreover speak of a long stone churinga and of especially large ones made by the mythical first ancestors of the race  churinga over a foot in length they tell us are not usually perforated many churinga are not perforated many are but the arunta do not know why some are perforated  there is a legend that of old men hung up the perforated churinga on the sacred nurtunja pole and so they still have perforated stone churinga not usually more than a foot in length 109  if dr munro has studied messrs spencer and gillen he cannot but know that churinga are not ornaments are not all oval but of many shapes and sizes and that churinga larger than the 9 inch perforated stone from dumbuck are perforated and attached to strings  i cannot tell the reason why any better than the arunta can and of course i cannot know why the 9 inch stone from dumbuck if genuine was perforated  but what i must admire is the amazing luck or learning of dr munros supposed impostor  not being a semidetached idiot he must have known that no mortal would sling about his person as an ornament a chunk of stone 9 inches long 35 broad and 05 an inch thick  dr munro himself insists on the absurdity of supposing that any human being would do such a thing  yet the forger drilled a neat hole as if for a string for suspension at the apex of the chunk  if he knew before any other human being in england that the arunta do this very thing to some stone churinga though seldom to churinga over a foot in lengthand if he imitated the arunta custom the impostor was a very learned impostor  if he did not know he was a very lucky rogue for the arunta coincide in doing the same thing to great stone churinga without being aware of any motive for the performance as they never suspend churinga to anything though they say that their mythical ancestors did  the impostor was also well aware of the many perforated stones that exist in scotland not referred to by dr munro  he perforated some which could not be worn as ornaments just as the arunta do  we shall find that the forger either by dint of wide erudition or by a startling set of chance coincidences keeps on producing objects which are analogous to genuine relics found in many sites of early life  this is what makes the forger so interesting  my theory of the forger is at the opposite pole from the theory of dr munro  he says that in applying these local designs the worldwide archaic patterns to unworked splinters of sandstone and pieces of water worn shale and slate the manufacturers had evidently not sufficient archaeological knowledge to realise the significance of the fact that they were doing what prehistoric man in this country is never known to have done before 111  but dismissing the kintyre and tappock stones the manufacturers did know apparently that perforated and inscribed or uninscribed tablets and plaques of shale and schist and slate and gas coal were found in america france russia and portugal and imitated these things or coincided in the process by sheer luck  the manufacturers were perhaps better informed than many of their critics  but if the things are genuine more may be found by research in the locality     xxixweapons   dr munro is less than kind to the forger in the matter of the weapons found at dunbuie and dumbuck  they are absolutely worthless as real weapons he says with perfect truth for they are made of slate or shale not of hard stony slate which many races used to employ for lack of better material 112a   fig 16 p113ajpg  the forger was obviously not thinking of dumping down serviceable sham weapons  he could easily have bought as many genuine flint celts and arrowheads and knives as he needed had his aim been to prove his sites to be neolithic  so i argued long ago in a newspaper letter  dr munro replies among other things that nothing could be easier than to detect modern imitations of neolithic relics 112b  i said not a word about modern imitations  i said that a forger anxious to fake a neolithic site would of course drop in a few neolithic arrowheads celts and so forth meaning genuine objects very easily to be procured for money   figs 17 18 p113bjpg  as the forger did not adopt a device so easy so obvious and so difficult of detection if he purchased scottish flint implements his aim was not to fake a neolithic site  he put in not wellknown genuine neolithic things but things of a character with which some of his critics were not familiar yet which have analogues elsewhere  why did he do that  as to the blunt decorated slate weapons the forger did not mean i think to pass off these as practicable arms of the neolithic period these he could easily have bought from the dealers  what he intended to dump down were not practical weapons but in one case at least armes dapparat as french archaeologists call them weapons of show or ceremony  the strange vandyked crozierlike stone objects of schist or shale from portugal were possibly armes dapparat or heads of staves of dignity there is a sample in the american room at the british museum uninscribed  i submit that the three very curious and artistic stone axe heads figured by m cartailhac 114 representing one an uncouth animal another a hooded human head the third an extremely pretty girl could never have been used for practical purposes but were armes dapparat  perhaps such stone armes dapparat or magical or sacred arms were not unknown as survivals in scotland in the iron age  a celt or stone axehead of this kind ornamented with a pattern of inter crossing lines is figured and described by the rev mr mackenzie kenmore in the proceedings of the scottish society of antiquaries 19001901 p 310 et seq  this axehead found near a cairn at balnahannait is of five inches long by two and a quarter broad  it is of soft micaceous stone  the owners must have been acquainted with the use of the metals mr mackenzie thinks for the stone exhibits interlaced work of a late variety of this ornamentation  mr mackenzie suggests that the ornament was perhaps added after the axe had obtained some kind of venerated or symbolical character  this implies that a metalworking people finding a stone axe were puzzled by it venerated it and decorated it in their late style of ornament  in that case who in earlier times made an useless axehead of soft micaceous stone and why  it could be of no practical service  on the other hand people who had the metals might fashion a soft stone into an arme dapparat  it cannot have been intended for ordinary use the axe may have been a sacred or ceremonial one says mr mackenzie and he makes the same conjecture as to another scottish stone axehead 115  here then if mr mackenzie be right we have a soft stone axehead decorated with later ornament the property of a people who knew the metals and regarded the object as a sacred or ceremonial one enfin as an arme dapparat  dr munro doubtless knows all that is known about armes dapparat but he unkindly forgets to credit the forger with the same amount of easily accessible information when the forger dumps down a decorated slate spearhead eleven inches long  believe me this forger was no fool he knew what he was about and he must have laughed when critics said that his slate spearheads would be useless  he expected the learned to guess what he was forging not practicable weapons but armes dapparat survivals of a ceremonial kind like mr mackenzies decorated axehead of soft stone  that i think was our forgers little game for even if he thought no more than dr munro seems to do of the theory of survivals he knew that the theory is fashionable  nothing like these spearheads    has hitherto been found in scotland so that they cannot be survivals from a previous state of things in our country says dr munro 116a the argument implies that there is nothing in the soil of our country of a nature still undiscovered  this is a large assumption especially if mr mackenzie be right about the sacred ceremonial decorated axehead of soft stone  the forger however knew that elsewhere if not in scotland there exist useless armes dapparat and he obviously meant to fake a few samples  he was misunderstood  i knew what he was doing for it seems that mr lang    suggested that the spearheads were not meant to be used as weapons but as sacred things 116b  i knew little but i did know the sacred boomerangshaped decorated arunta churinga and later looked up other armes dapparat 116c  apparently i must have coached the forger and told him what kinds of things to fake  but i protest solemnly that i am innocent  he got up the subject for himself and knew more than many of his critics  i had no more to do with the forger than m salomon reinach had to do with faking the golden tiara of saitaphernes bought by the louvre for 8000 pounds  m reinack denies the suave suggestion that he was at the bottom of this imposture 117a  i also am innocent of instructing the clyde forger  he read books english french german american italian portuguese and spanish  from the bulletino di palaetnologia italiana vol xi p 33 1885 plate iv and from professor pigorinis article there he prigged the idea of a huge stone weapon of no use found in a grotto near verona 117b  this object is of flint shaped like a flint arrowhead is ten inches and a half in length and weighs over 35 pounds  pigorini conjectured that it had some religious signification  inspired by this arrowhead of gargantua the clyde forger came in with a still longer decorated slate spearhead weighing i know not how much  it is here photographed figs 17 18  compare the decoration of three parallel horizontal lines with that on the broken portuguese perforated stone figs 9 10  or did the veronese forger come to clyde and carry on the business at dumbuck  the man has read widely  sometimes however he may have resorted to sources which though excellent are accessible and cheap like mr haddons evolution in art  here pp 79 80 the faker could learn all that he needed to know about armes dapparat in the form of stone axeheads unwieldy and probably quite useless objects found by mr haddon in the chain of isles southeast of new guinea  mr romilly and dr wyatt gill attest the existence of similar axes of ceremony  they are not intended for cleaving timber we see the metamorphosis of a practical object into an unpractical one 118  the forger thus had sources for his great decorated slate spearhead the smaller specimens may be sketches for that colossal work     xxxthe figurines   dr munro writes of the carved figurines idols or totems six in number four from dumbuck one from langbank 119a  now first nobody knows the purpose of the rude figurines found in many sites from japan to troy from russia to the lake dwellings of europe and in west africa where the negroes use these figurines when found as fetish knowing nothing of their origin man no 7 july 1905  like a figurine of a woman found in the dumbuck kitchen midden they are discovered in old japanese kitchen middens 119b  the astute forger knowing that figurines were found in japanese kitchen middens knowing it before y koganei published the fact in 1903 thought the dumbuck kitchen midden an appropriate place for a figurine  dr munro possibly less wellinformed regards the bottom of a kitchen midden at dumbuck as a strange resting place for a goddess 120a  now as to goddess nobody knows anything  dr schliemann thought that the many figurines of clay in troy were meant for hera and athene  nobody knows but every one not wholly ignorant sees the absurdity of speaking of figurines as totems of course the term is not dr munros   fig 19 p120ajpg  we know not their original meaning but they occur all over the place in amber on the baltic coast with grotesque faces carved in amber  in russia and finland and in sites of prehistoric egypt on slate and in other materials such grotesques are common 120b  egypt is a great centre of the early slate school of art the things ranging from slate plaques covered with disorderly scratchings without a conscience or an aim to highly decorated palettes  there is even a perforated object like the slate crooks of m cartailhac from portugal but rather more like the silhouette of a bird 121a and there are decorative maceheads in soft stone 121b  some of the prehistoric figurines of human beings from egypt are studded with cups cupules ecuelles or whatever we may be permitted to name them  in short early and rude races turn out much the same set of crude works of art almost everywhere and the extraordinary thing is not that a few are found in a corner of britain but that scarce any have been found   figs 20 21 p120bjpg  as to the russofinnish flint figurines mr abercromby thinks that these objects may have served as household gods or personal amulets and dr munro regards mr abercrombys as the most rational explanation of their meaning and purpose  he speaks of figurines of clay the most usual material in carniola bosnia and transylvania  idols and amulets were indeed universally used in prehistoric times 121c  objects which come under the same category occur in various parts of america  mr bruce 121d refers to m reinachs vast collection of designs of such figurines in lanthropologie vol v 1894  thus rude figurines in sites of many stages are very familiar objects  the forger knew it and dumped down a few at dumbuck  his female figurine photographed in fig 19 seems to me a very plausible figurine in itself  it does not appear to me unlike anything in any collection in the british isles or elsewherei mean elsewhere  dr munro admits that it discloses the hand of one not altogether ignorant of art 122  i add that it discloses the hand of one not at all ignorant of genuine prehistoric figurines representing women  but i know nothing analogous from british sites  either such things do not exist of which we cannot be certain or they have escaped discovery and record  elsewhere they are confessedly well known to science and therefore to the learned forger who nobody can guess why dumped them down with the other fraudulent results of his researches  if the figurines be genuine i suppose that the clyde folk made them for the same reasons as the other peoples who did so whatever those reasons may have been or like the west africans found them relics of a forgotten age and treasured them  if their reasons were religious or superstitious how am i to know what were the theological tenets of the clyde residents  they may have been more or less got at by christianity in saint ninians time but the influence might well be slight  on the other hand neither men nor angels can explain why the forger faked his figurines for which he certainly had a modelat least as regards the female figurein a widely distributed archaic feminine type of dolly the forger knew a good deal  dr munro writes that the disputed objects are amusing playthingsthe sportive productions of idle wags who inhabited the various sitesseems to be the most recent opinion which finds acceptance among local antiquaries  but this view involves the contemporaneity of occupancy of the respective sites of which there is no evidence    123a  there is no evidence for contemporaneity of occupancy if dunbuie be of 300900 ad and dumbuck and langbank of 15561758 123b  but we and apparently dr munro p 264 have rejected the corporation cairn theory the theory of the cairn erected in 1556 or 1612 and lasting till 1758  the genuine undisputed relics according to dr munro are such as are commonly found on crannogs brochs and other early inhabited sites of scotland 124a  the sites are all and the genuine relics in the sites are all of some time between the fifth and twelfth centuries 124b  the sites are all close to each other the remains are all of the same period unless the late celtic comb chance to be earlier yet dr munro says that for contemporaneity of occupancy there is no evidence 124c  he none the less repeats the assertion that they are of precisely the same chronological horizon  the chronological horizon of langbank and dumbuck seems to me to be precisely the same viz a date well on in the early iron age posterior to the roman occupation of that part of britain p 147  thus dr munro assigns to both sites precisely the same chronological horizon and also says that there is no evidence for the contemporaneity of occupancy  this is not as it may appear an example of lack of logical consistency  the range of the occupancy of the sites is uncertain probably it was different in each case writes dr munro 124d  no reason is given for this opinion and as all the undisputed remains are confessedly of one stage of culture the wags at all three sites were probably in the same stage of rudimentary humour and skill  if they made the things the things are not modern forgeries  but the absence of the disputed objects from other sites of the same period remains as great a difficulty as ever  early wags may have made thembut why are they only known in the three clyde sites  also why are the painted pebbles only known in a few brochs of caithness  have the graffiti on slate at st blanes in bute been foundi mean have graffiti on slate like those of st blanes been found elsewhere in scotland 125  the kinds of art writing and celtic ornament at st blanes are all familiar but not their presence on scraps of slate some of the art of the dumbuck things is also familiar but not in scotland on pieces of slate and shale  whether they were done by early wags or by a modern and rather erudite forger i know not of course i only think that the question is open is not settled by dr munro     xxxigrotesque heads  disputed portuguese parallels   figurines are common enough things in ancient sites by no means so common are the grotesque heads found at dumbuck and langbank  they have recently been found in portugal  did the forger know that  did he forge them on portuguese models  or was it chance coincidence  or was it undesigned parallelism  there is such a case according to mortillet  m de mortillet flew upon poor prof pigorinis odd things denouncing them as forgeries he had attacked dr schliemanns finds in his violent way and never apologised to my knowledge  then a lively squabble began  italian archaeologists of the highest standing backed prof pigorini mortillet had not seen the italian things but he stood to his guns  things found near cracow were taken as corroborating the breonio finds also things from volosova in russia mortillet replied by asking why under similar conditions could not forgers very remote in space equally fabricate objects of the same form 127  is it likely  why should they forge similar unheardof things in russia poland and italy  did the same man wander about forging or was telepathy at work or do forging wits jump  the breonio controversy is undecided practised persons can not read the antiquities as easily as print to quote mr read  they often read them in different ways here as fakes there as authentic  m boulle reviewing dr munro in lanthropologie august 1905 says that m cartailhac recognises the genuineness of some of the strange objects from breonio  but as to our dumbuck things the clyde forger went to portugal and forged there or the clyde forger came from portugal or forging wits coincided fairly well in portugal and in scotland as earlier at volosova and breonio  in portugalia a portuguese archaeological magazine edited by don ricardo severe appeared an article by the rev father jose brenha on the dolmens of pouco daguiar  father raphael rodrigues of that place asked father brenha to excavate with him in the christmas holidays of 1894  they published some of their discoveries in magazines and some of the finds were welcomed by dr leite de vasconcellos in his religioes da lusitania vol i p 341  they dug in the remote and not very cultured transmontane province and in one dolmen found objects the most extraordinary possible says father brenha 128  there were perforated plaques with alphabetic inscriptions stones engraved with beasts of certain or of dubious species very fearfully and wonderfully drawn there were stone figurines of females as at dumbuck there were stones with cups and lines connecting the cups common in many places and as at dumbuck there were grotesque heads in stone  see a few examples figs 2024  figures 20 21 24 are cupped or cup and duct stones 22 is a female figurine 23 is a heartshaped charm stone   fig 22 p128jpg  on all this weighty mass of stone objects dr munro writes thus     since the ms of this volume was placed in the hands of the    publishers a new sideissue regarding some strange objects said to    have been found in portuguese dolmens has been imported into the    clyde controversy in which mr astley has taken a prominent part  in    a communication to the antiquary april 1904 he writes i will    merely say here on this point that my arguments are brought to a    scientific conclusion in my paper portuguese parallels to clydeside    discoveries reported in your issue for march which will shortly be    published     i have seen the article in portugalia and the published scientific    conclusion of mr astley journal of baa april and august    1904 and can only say that even had i space to discuss the matter i    would not do so for two reasons  first because i see no parallelism    whatever between the contrasted objects from the portuguese dolmens    and the clyde ancient sites beyond the fact that they are both queer    things  and secondly because some of the most eminent european    scholars regard the objects described and illustrated in portugalia    as forgeries  the learned director of the musee de st germain m    saloman reinach thus writes about them jusqua nouvel ordre cest    adire jusqua preuve formelle du contraire je considere ces pierres    sculptees et gravees comme le produit dune mystification  jaimerais    connaitre a ce sujet lopinion des autres savants du portugal    revue archeologique 4th s vol ii 1903 p 431  i had brought the portuguese things to the notice of english readers long before mr astley did so but that is not to the purpose  the point is that dr munro denies the parallelism between the clyde and portuguese objects  yet i must hold that stone figurines of women grotesque heads in stone cupped stones stones with cup and duct stones with rays proceeding from a central point and perforated stones with linear ornamentation are rather parallel in portugal and in clydesdale  so far the scottish and the portuguese fakers have hit on parallel lines of fraud  meanwhile i know of no archaeologists except portuguese archaeologists who have seen the objects from the dolmen and of no portuguese archaeologist who disputes their authenticity  so there the matter rests 130  the parallelism appears to me to be noticeable  i do not say that the styles of art are akin but that the artists by a common impulse have produced cupped stones perforated and inscribed stones figurines in stone and grotesque heads in stone  is not this common impulse rather curious  and is suspicion of forgery to fall in portugal on respectable priests or on the very uncultured wags of traz os montes  mortillet educated by priests hated and suspected all of them  m cartailhac suspected clericals as to the spanish cave paintings but acknowledged his error  i can guess no motive for the ponderous bulk of portuguese forgeries and am a little suspicious of the tendency to shout forgery in the face of everything unfamiliar  but the portuguese things are suspected by m cartailhac who however again admits that he has been credulously incredulous before as well as by m reinach  the things ought to be inspected in themselves  i still think that they are on parallel lines with the work of the clyde forger who may have read about them in a vida moderna 1895 1896 in archeologo portugues in encyclopedia dar familiar in various numbers and in religioes da lusitania vol i pp 341 342 1897 a work by the learned director of the ethnological museum of portugal  to these sources the dumbuck forger may have gone for inspiration  stated without this elegant irony my opinion is that the parallelism of the figurines and grotesque stone faces of villa daguiar and of clyde rather tends to suggest the genuineness of both sets of objects  but this opinion like my opinion about the australian and other parallelisms is no argument against dr munro for he acknowledges none of these parallelisms  that pointa crucial pointare the various sets of things analogous in character or not must be decided for each reader by himself according to his knowledge taste fancy and bias     xxxiidisputed objects from dunbuie   the faker occasionally changes his style  we have seen what slovenly designs in the archaic cup and ring and incomplete circle style he dumped down at dumbuck  i quote dr munro on his doings at dunbuie where the faker occasionally drops a pearshaped slate perforated stone with a design in cupules  dr munro writes     the most meaningless groupif a degree of comparison be admissible    in regard to a part when the whole is absolutely incomprehensible on    archaeological principlesconsists of a series of unprepared and    irregularly shaped pieces of laminated sandstone plate xvi similar    to some of the stones of which the fort of dunbuie was built 132    having one of their surfaces decorated with small cupmarks sometimes    symmetrically arranged so far as to indicate parts of geometrical    figures and at other times variously combined with lines and circles    two fragments of bones also from dunbuie are similarly adorned    plate xvi nos 13 14  eleven of the twelve sandstone fragments    which make up the group were fractured in such a manner as to suggest    that the line of fracture had intersected the original ornamentation    and had thus detached a portion of it  if this be so there must have    been originally at least two or three other portions which if found    would fit along the margin of each of the extant portions just as the    fragments of a broken urn come together  yet among these decorated    stones not one single bit fits another nor is any of the designs the    counterpart of another  if we suppose that these decorated stones are    portions of larger tablets on which the designs were completed then    either they were broken before being introduced into the debris of the    fort or the designs were intentionally executed in an incomplete    state just as they are now to be seen on the existing natural    splinters of stone  the supposition that the occupiers of the fort    possessed the original tablets and that they had been smashed on the    premises is excluded by the significant fact that only one fragment    of each tablet has been discovered  for in the breaking up of such    tablets it would be inconceivable according to the law of chances    that one portion and only one of each different specimen would    remain while all the others had disappeared  on the other hand the    hypothesis that the occupiers of the fort carved these designs on the    rough and unprepared splinters of stone in the precise manner they now    come before us seems to me to involve premeditated deception for it    is difficult to believe that such uncompleted designs could have any    other finality of purpose     looking at these geometrical figures from the point of technique they    do not make a favourable impression in support of their genuineness    the socalled cupmarks consist of punctures of two or three different    sizes so many corresponding to one size and so many to another  the    stiffness of the lines and circles reminds one more of ruler and    compass than of the freehand work of prehistoric artists  the    patterns are unprecedented for their strange combinations of art    elements  for example no 9 plate xvi looks as if it were a    design for some modern machinery  the main ornament on another    fragment of sandstone no 12 consisting of a cross and circle    composed of a series of cupmarls seems to be a completed design but    yet at the corner there are lines which are absolutely meaningless    unless we suppose that they formed part of a more enlarged tablet    similar remarks apply to nos 3 and 8  is it really contrary to the law of chances that in some 1200 years of unknown fortunes no two fragments of the same plates of red sandstone some dozen in number should be found at dunbuie  think of all that may have occurred towards the scattering of fragments of unregarded sandstone before the rise of soil hid them all from sight  where is the smaller portion of the shattered cup and ring marked sandstone block found in the lochlee crannog  on the other hand in the same crannog a hammerstone broken in two was found each half in a different place as were two parts of a figurine at dumbuck  where are the arms of the venus of milo vainly sought beside and around the rest of the statue  where are the lost noses arms and legs of thousands of statues  nobody can guess where they are or how they vanished  or where are the lost fragments of countless objects in pottery found in old sites  it was as easy for the forger to work over a whole plaque of sandstone break it and bury the pieces as for him to do what he has done  these designs make an unfavourable impression because some not all of them are stiff and regular  the others make an unfavourable impression because they are so laxly executed  for what conceivable purpose did the forger here resort to the aid of compasses and elsewhere do nothing of the kind  why should the artist if an old resident of dunbuie fort not have compasses like the cairnwight of lough crew  on inspecting the pieces in the museum the regularity of design seems to me to be much exaggerated in dr munros figures by whom drawn we are not informed  as to dr munros figure 12 it seems to me to aim at a celtic cross and circle while part of his figure 3 suggests a crozier and there is a cross on figure 18 as on a painted pebble from a broch in caithness  the rest i cannot profess to explain they look like idle work on sandstone but may have had a meaning to their fashioner  his meaning and that of the forger who here changes his style are equally inscrutable  i return to a strange perforated pebble an intaglio from dumbuck   fig 23 p136ajpg  dr munro quotes as to this pebble the journal of the british archaeological association in the september number of the journal p 282 we are informed that a slaty spearhead an arrowhead of bone and a sinker stone were found in the debris inside the canoe  in the cavity of a large bone says the writer was also got an ornament of a peculiar stone  the digger unearthed it from the deposit at the bottom of the canoe about 14 feet from the bow and near to a circular hole cut in the bottom about 35 inches in diameter  what a funny place to hide a precious ornament for i take this peculiar stone to be that with the human hand incised on one side and three men rowing in a boat on the other see plate xv no 10   fig 24 p136bjpg  here the place of discovery in the canoe is given with precision and its place within the cavity of the bone is pronounced by dr munro to be funny  as to the three men in a boat the rev geo wilson of glenluce on feb 14 1887 presented to the scots antiquaries a bugle shaped pendant of black shale or cannelcoal 225 inches long with a central groove for suspension  on one side of the pendant was incised a sketch of two figures standing up in a boat or canoe with a high prow the pendant is undisputed the pebble is disputed and we know nothing more about the matter see fig 25   fig 25 p136cjpg     xxxiiidisputable and certainly forged objects   in his judicious remarks to the society of antiquaries proceedings xxxiv dr joseph anderson observed that opinions would probably vary as to certain among the disputed objects  among these are the inscribed oyster shells  i see nothing a priori improbable in the circumstance that men who incised certain patterns on schist or shale should do so on oyster shells  palaeolithic man did his usual sporting sketches on shells and there was a vast and varied art of designing on shells among the precolumbian natives of north america 137  we here see the most primitive scratches developing into fullblown aztec art  if the markings were only on such inscribed shells as mouldered awayso mr bruce tells uswhen exposed to light and air i do not know whether the designs were copied before the shells crumbled these conchological drawings would not trouble us  no modern could make the designs on shells that were hurrying into dust  we have mr bruces word for these mouldering shells and we have the absolute certainty that such decomposing shells could not be incised by a hand of today as shale slate schist and sandstone can now be engraved upon fraudulently  but when as professor boyd dawkins writes the finds include two fresh shells    unmistakable blue points drilled with perforations or inscribed from dunbuie then there are only two possible alternatives  1  they were made by the faker or  2  they were interpolated into the dunbuie site by somebody  the forger himself is i think far too knowing a man to fake inscriptions on fresh shells even if not being a conchologist he did not know that the oysters were american blue points  i have written in vain if the reader while believing in the hypothesis of a forger thinks him such an egregious ass  for blue points as non existent save in america 1 rely on prof boyd dawkins  as the public were allowed to break off and steal the prow of the dumbuck canoe it is plain that no guard was placed on the sites  they lay open for months to the interpolations of wags and i think for my own part that one of them is likely to have introduced the famous blue points  dr munro tells us how a largeworked stone a grotesque head was foisted through a horizontal hole into the relic bed of his kitchen midden at elie  it lay under four inches of undisturbed black earth but it had been interpolated there by some lousy tykes of fife as the anticovenanting song calls them 139  it was rather easier to interpolate blue point oyster shells at dunbuie on the other hand two splinters of stone inserted into a bone and a tyne of deers horn figured by dr munro among dumbuck and dunbuie finds seem to me rather too stupid fakes for the regular forger and a trifle too clever for the sunday holidaymaker  these two things i do not apologise for or defend my knowledge of primitive implements is that of a literary man but for what it is worth it does not incline me to regard these things as primitive implements     xxxivconclusion   explicit  i have tried to show cause why we should not bluntly dismiss the mass of disputed objects as forgeries but should rest in a balance of judgment file the objects for reference and await the results of future excavations  if there be a faker i hope he appreciates my sympathetic estimate of his knowledge assiduity and skill in leger de main  i am the forgers only friend and i ask him to come forward and make a clean breast of it like the young men who hoaxed the society for psychical research with a faked wraith or phantasm of the living     let it fully now suffice       the gambol has been shown  it seems to me nearly equally improbable that a forger has been at work on a large scale and that sets of objects unexampled in our isle have really turned up in some numbers  but then the caithness painted pebbles were equally without precedent yet are undisputed  the proverbial fence seems in these circumstances to be the appropriate perch for science in fact a statue of the muse of science might represent her as sitting in contemplation on the fence  the strong the very strong point against authenticity is this numbers of the disputed objects were found in sites of the early iron age  now such objects save for a few samples are only knownand that in nonbritish landsin neolithic sites  the theory of survival may be thought not to cover the number of the disputed objects  glasgow printed at the university press by robert maclehose and co ltd     footnotes   4  archaeology and false antiquities pp 259261  by robert munro
