dave       quickly                                                      256     dave porter and his double     chapter i  off for a sleighride   what is the matter dave you look rather mystified  i am mystified laura replied dave porter i have a letter here that i cant understand at all  whom is it from questioned laura porter as she came closer to her brother who was ensconced in the largest easychair the wadsworth library contained  its from a shopkeeper in coburntown mr wecks the shoedealer he wants to know which pair of shoes i have decided to keep and asks me kindly to return the pair i dont want  well what of that dave continued his sister as the youth paused with a wrinkle on his forehead cant you make up your mind which pair of shoes you want to keep  i certainly can not seeing that i havent had any shoes from weckss store returned dave with a faint smile i havent been in his place for nearly a year and the last time i was there i bought a pair of rubbers and paid for them  oh then the letter must be meant for somebody else dave mr wecks has got his customers mixed  perhaps so but in the letter he speaks of the two pairs of shoes i took away with me that looks as if somebody had gotten two pairs of shoes in my name  well as we are going out sleighing this afternoon why dont you drive to coburntown and drop into his shop and explain matters suggested the sister  i guess that would be best laura dave folded up the letter and placed it in his pocket how soon will you be ready  inside of quarter of an hour  and how about jessie  she was almost ready when i came downstairs  good then we can get an early start and have a good long ride besides stopping at coburntown where i suppose you and jessie can do a little shopping while i am at weckss store  that will be fine dave i would like to match some ribbon and the only place i can do it is in the french shop in coburntown and thus speaking laura porter hurried out of the room to get ready for the sleighride  dave had proposed the ride just before lunch and the young people living at the wadsworth mansion had telephoned over to the basswood home asking if ben basswood would accompany them  sure ill gobe glad to daves former school chum had answered over the wire i havent a thing to do this afternoon and a first sleighride of the season will tickle me to death  oh i dont want it to kill you ben dave had answered gaily just the same you be ready for us when we come over and to this ben had agreed  although it was still early in the winter there had been a heavy fall of snow two days before and now the roads in and around crumville were in excellent condition for sleighing the musical sound of sleighbells could be heard in all directions and this had made dave anxious to get out on the road even though he had to spend most of his time indoors studying as we shall learn later  dave had already given orders to the hostler connected with the wadsworth estate and now this man brought to the front of the mansion a fine big sleigh drawn by a pair of sleeklooking highstepping steeds the sleigh was well provided with heavy robes to protect its occupants from the cold  oh dave im so glad to go sleighing burst out jessie wadsworth as she came bounding down the broad stairway of the mansion to meet him isnt it just glorious weather  it sure is he answered as he gave her a warm glance to dave jessie was the most beautiful girl in the world and just now clad as she was in her dainty sealskin coat and her jaunty sealskin hat she looked more bewitching to him than ever  going for a ride eh came from daves uncle dunston porter who had just finished a belated lunch well have a good time and dont let that pair of grays run away with you john was telling me they are feeling quite mettlesome lately i guess they dont get exercise enough  oh dont worry uncle dunston im sure i can manage them answered dave  sure you can returned his uncle heartily too bad you couldnt have asked an old fellow like me to go along he continued making a wry face  why you can come along if you want to cant he dave burst out jessie wed be very glad to have you  hes only fooling jessie answered dave you couldnt hire uncle dunston to go sleighing today i saw him cleaning up his shotgun right after breakfast and ill wager he has just come in from hunting and expects to go out again this afternoon how about it uncleam i right  youve got me davy answered the man with a grin you see i cant get over my old habit of going hunting when i get the chance and now that this snow is on the ground its just fine for tracking rabbits  did you get any this morning  a few i didnt go very far this afternoon i am going deeper into the woods and i guarantee to bring back enough to make the biggest rabbit potpie tomorrow you ever saw and thus speaking the uncle hastened away  he had spent many years of his life roaming the world in quest of game both big and little and now though of late years he had done his best to settle down it was still impossible for him to give up his hunting habit entirely  laura soon appeared ready for the ride dave had already donned his heavy overcoat fur cap and his drivinggloves he assisted the girls into the sleigh and saw to it that they were well tucked in with robes  have a good time and dont stay out too late were the farewell words of mrs wadsworth who had come to the door to see them off  well you know we dont expect to be back to dinner this evening answered dave we can get something to eat at coburntown or some other place and then drive back in the moonlight  very well but dont make it too late answered the lady of the mansion and then dave took up the reins chirped to the team and away the sleigh started out of the wadsworth grounds and down the highway leading to the basswood home  ben was on the lookout for them and by the time dave had drawn up beside the horseblock he was outside to meet them  good afternoon everybody he said gaily lifting his cap this is just fine of you to take me along  let ben come in back here with me said laura and that will give jessie a chance to sit in front i know she always likes to be up ahead and laura smiled knowingly  suits me answered ben quickly and then assisted jessie to make the change which however the miss did not undertake without blushing for it may as well be admitted here jessie thought as much of dave as he did of her  oh dave do you think the grays will behave themselves today asked the girl partly to conceal her embarrassment  im going to make them behave he answered sturdily  i dont believe they have been out of the stable for several days you know we dont use the horses nearly as much as we used to before we got the automobile  ill watch them dave looked behind him all right back there  yes answered his sister but please dont drive too fast  i dont believe sleighing will seem too fast after the riding we have been doing in the auto answered the brother he took up the reins again and once more the turnout sped along the highway  they made a turn passed along the main street of crumville and also passed the large wadsworth jewelry works and then took to a road leading to coburntown some miles distant the air was cold but clear with the bright sunshine sparkling on the snow and all of the young people were in the best of humor  say dave how would you like to be back at oak hall cried ben while the sleigh sped along wouldnt we have the dandy time snowballing each other and snowballing old horsehair  so we would ben answered dave his eyes gleaming we sure did have some good times at that school  how are you and roger getting along with your civil engineering course  all right i think mr ramsdell says he is greatly pleased with our work  thats fine i almost wish i had taken up civil engineering myself but dad wants me to go into real estate with him he thinks there is a big chance in that line these days when crumville is just beginning to wake up  hasnt your dad got a big rival in aaron poole  oh no poole isnt in it any more when it comes to big deals you see he was so close and miserly in all his business affairs that a great many people became afraid of him  what has become of nat poole questioned laura did he go back to oak hall  for a short while only when his folks found out that he had failed to graduate they were awfully angry mr poole claimed that it was the fault of the school and so he took nat away and told him he would have to go to work i think nat is working in some store although where i dont know  i dont think its in crumville or we should have seen him said dave  i never want to meet that boy again pouted jessie ill never get over how meanly he acted toward us  its not so much nats fault as it is his bringing up remarked ben his father never treated him half decently but i hope nat makes a man of himself in spite of the way he used to treat us went on the youth generously  by the way ben didnt you say your father had gone away queried dave a few minutes later  yes he has gone to chicago on very important business it seems an old friend of hisa mr enos who was once his partner in an art storedied and now the lawyers want to see my father about settling up the enos estate  an art store queried dave i never knew that your father had been in any such business  it was years agobefore my folks came to crumville you see my father and this mr enos had been chums from early boyhood my father says that mr enos was a very peculiar sort of man who was all wrapped up in pictures and painting he got my father to advance a thousand dollars he had saved up and on that money the two opened an art store but they couldnt make a go of it and so they gave it up and while mr enos went west my father came here  maybe the dead man left your father some money suggested laura  that is what my mother said to dad but he thinks not he thinks it is more than likely mr enos died in debt and left his affairs all tangled up and that the lawyers want my father to help straighten them out  id like to be able to paint said jessie with a sigh i think some of those little watercolors are just too lovely for anything  why dont you take it up there must be some teacher in crumville returned dave  lets both do it cried laura i used to paint a little before father and i did so much traveling i would like to take it up again it would be very interesting  while the young folks were talking the pair of mettlesome grays had been speeding over the snow of the road at a good rate of speed dave however had them well in hand so that there was little danger of their running away  well be to benson crossroads soon dave remarked ben a while later after they had passed over a long hill lined on either side with tidy farms which road are you going to takethrough hacklebury or around conovers hill  i havent made up my mind answered dave he looked at jessie have you any preference  oh let us go up around conovers hill cried jessie that is always such a splendid ride there is so much of an outlook  yes let us go by way of the hill by all means added laura it isnt very nice through hacklebury past all those woolen mills  all right the conover road it is answered dave and forward they went once more as fast as ever  they soon passed the crossroads and then took the long winding road that led around one side of the hill just mentioned here travel since the snow had fallen had evidently been heavy for the roadway was packed down until it was almost as smooth as glass over this surface the spirited grays dashed at an increased rate of speed  some team believe me was bens comment mr wadsworth ought to put them on a racecourse  papa does not believe in racing answered jessie but he always did like to have a horse that had some go in him  hark cried laura a moment later what is that sound  its an auto coming announced ben looking behind them a big touringcar and whoever is in it seems to be in a tremendous hurry  i wish they wouldnt cut out their muffler was daves comment as he saw the grays pick up their ears they have no right to run with the muffler open  as the touringcar came closer those in the sleigh who were able to look back saw that it was running at a great rate of speed and swaying from side to side of the roadway it contained four young men out evidently for a gloriously good time dave did not dare look back to see what was coming the grays had their ears laid well back and their whole manner showed that they were growing more nervous every instant  hi stop that noise yelled ben jumping up and shaking his hand at the oncoming automobile but those in the car paid no attention to him the fellow at the wheel put on a fresh burst of speed and with a wild rush and a roar the touringcar shot past the sleigh and the frightened horses and in a few seconds more disappeared around a turn of the road  as might have been expected the coming and going of the big machine with its unearthly roar was too much for the mettlesome grays both reared up wildly on their hind legs backing the sleigh off to one side of the roadway  whoa there whoa cried dave and did his best to keep the team in hand but they proved too much for him and in an instant more they came down on all fours and started to run away     chapter ii  something of the past   the horses are running away  oh well be killed  such were the cries from the two girls as the mettlesome grays tore along the country highway at a speed that seemed marvelous  dave can i help you asked ben anxiously  i dont think so answered the young driver between his set teeth i guess i can bring them down anyway i can try  what shall we do wailed jessie  dont do anythingsit still ordered dave he was afraid that jessie in her excitement might fling herself from the flying sleigh  on and on bounded the frightened team each of the grays now had his bit in his teeth and it looked as if it would be impossible for dave to obtain control of the pair and worst of all they were now approaching a turn with the hill on one side of the roadway and a gully on the other  better keep them as far as possible away from the gully suggested ben  that is what im trying to do returned dave setting his teeth grimly  dave porter was a resolute youth always doing his best to accomplish whatever he set out to do had it been otherwise it is not likely that he would have occupied the position in which we found him at the opening of our story  when a very small youth dave had been found wandering along the railroad tracks near crumville he could tell little about himself or how he had come in that position and kind people had taken him in and later on had placed him in the local poorhouse from that institution he had been taken by an old college professor named caspar potts who at that time had been farming for his health  in crumville the main industry was the wadsworth jewelry works owned by mr oliver wadsworth who resided with his wife and his daughter jessie in the finest mansion of that district one day the wadsworth automobile caught fire and jessie was in danger of being burned to death when dave came to her rescue this led mr wadsworth to ask about the boy and about mr potts and when it was learned that the latter was one of the jewelry manufacturers former college professors mr wadsworth insisted upon it that caspar potts come and live with him and bring dave along  that boy deserves a good education had been oliver wadsworths comment after several interviews with dave and as a consequence the youth had been sent off to a firstclass boardingschool as related in the first volume of this series entitled dave porter at oak hall  at the school dave had made a host of friends including roger morr the son of a united states senator and phil lawrence the son of a rich shipowner  ben basswood the son of a crumville real estate dealer and a lad who had been friendly with dave for several years also went to oak hall and thus he and dave became closer chums than ever  the great thing that troubled dave in those days was the question of his parentage some of the mean boys in the school occasionally referred to him as that poorhouse nobody and this brought on several severe quarrels and even a fist fight or two  im not going to be a nobody said the youth to himself and when he received certain information from an old sailor he eagerly went on a quest after his father as told of in dave porter in the south seas there he managed to locate his uncle dunston porter and learned much concerning his father david breslow porter and also his sister laura  coming back from the south seas dave returned to school and then took a trip to the far north whither his father had gone before him there he had many adventures as already related in another volume  glad to know that he had found not only so many kind friends but also several rich relatives dave went back again to oak hall his classmates were more than glad to see him but others were jealous of his success in life and several of his enemies including a certain link merwell did all they could to annoy him the annoyances went from bad to worse and in the end one boy named jasniff ran away from school and the other merwell was expelled  daves sister laura had a friend belle endicott who lived in the far west and through this young lady dave and his chums and also laura and jessie received an invitation to spend some time at the endicott place known as star ranch while in the west dave once more fell in with link merwell and this young man as before tried to make trouble but was exposed  i hope i have seen the last of merwell said dave to himself on returning once again to oak hall but this was not to be for merwell became a student at a rival academy and once more he and some others did all they could to make life miserable for our hero  when the christmas holidays came around dave went back to crumville where he and his folks resided with the wadsworths who had taken such a liking to the youth that they did not wish to have him live elsewhere directly after christmas came a thrilling robbery of the jewelry works and dave and his chums discovered that the crime had been committed by merwell and his crony jasniff after a long sea voyage to cave island one of the evildoers was captured but the other link merwell managed to make his escape  during daves next term at school there was much trouble with one of the teachers who was harsh and unsympathetic and as a result some of the boys ran away it was dave who went after them and who in spite of a fearful flood managed to bring them back and make them face the music then came the graduation exercises at oak hall dave receiving high honors  our hero had promised roger morr that he would pay the senators son a visit during this time dave heard of a gold mine belonging to mrs morr which had been lost because of a landslide all the boys went out west in an endeavor to relocate this claim their adventures were both numerous and hazardous and once more dave fell in with link merwell but all went well with our young friends and they had a glorious time visiting yellowstone park and other points of interest  now you fellows have got to come on a little trip with me phil lawrence had said after he dave and roger with the others had returned again to the east there was a small steamer belonging to mr lawrence that was tied up at philadelphia getting ready for a trip to portland maine the voyage up the atlantic coast had been productive of several unlookedfor results on the way those on the boat had discovered another vessel in flames this was a craft being used by a company of movingpicture actors and some of the latter in their panic had leaped overboard our young friends as well as some of the sailors on their ship had gone to the rescue and among others had picked up a young man ward porton by name much to the surprise of roger morr and phil lawrence ward porton had looked a good deal like dave not only that but many of his manners outwardly were similar to those of our hero  following the trip up the coast it had been decided by the wadsworths and the basswoods to spend part of the summer in the adirondacks at a spot known as mirror lake thither all of the young people and some of the older ones went to enjoy themselves greatly and to meet with a number of strange happenings all of which have been related in detail in the volume preceding this entitled dave porter at bear camp  the boys fell in with a wild sort of creature whom they at first supposed to be a crazy uncle of nat poole the son of a miserly money lender of crumville later however the man was found to be a missing uncle of phil lawrence for whom the lawrence family had been seeking for a long time  although dave porter did not know it at the time the movingpicture company to which ward porton belonged had also numbered among its members daves former school enemy link merwell from link ward porton who was the goodfornothing nephew of a burlington lumber dealer had learned the particulars concerning daves childhood and how he had been placed in the crumville poorhouse and listed as of unknown parentage  this had caused porton to concoct a clever scheme and to mr porter he announced himself as the real dave porter stating that our hero was really and truly the nobody that years before everybody had thought him  this announcement had come like a thunderbolt to poor dave and for the time being he knew not what to do or say the others too especially his sister laura and his dear friend jessie were almost equally affected but they clung to him refusing to believe the story that ward porton was circulating  you take it from methis is some scheme gotten up by link merwell and this other fellow declared one of daves chums and on the strength of this declaration the youth took it upon himself to do some clever investigating from one of the movingpicture actresses dave learned much concerning ward portons past and then in company with some of his chums he journeyed to burlington where he met mr obadiah jones the uncle of porton and asked the lumber dealer if ward were his real nephew or not  yes he is my real nephewthe son of my youngest sister who married a goodfornothing army man replied obadiah jones and then gave many particulars he stated that his sisters name had been clarice jones porton and that years before she had married a certain lieutenant porton of the united states army an officer who had been discharged because of irregularities in his accounts he further stated that the mother of the young man was dead and what had become of the worthless father he did not know further than that it had been stated he had joined some revolutionists in mexico  dave had gotten mr jones to sign a paper stating the exact truth concerning ward porton and with this duly witnessed had returned to bear camp all present were glad to know that the cloud hanging over his name had been cleared away his sister laura and her friend jessie hugged him over and over again in their delight  then came news that link merwell had been captured and later on this misguided young man was sent to prison for his share in the crime at the jewelry works a hunt was instituted for ward porton but he had taken time by the forelock and disappeared  i dont believe ward porton will ever bother you again dave said roger one day but the surmise of the senators son proved incorrect as we shall see ward porton was to show himself and make more trouble than he had ever made before     chapter iii  the team that ran away   oh dave the gully cried his sister laura if we go into that well all be killed  please keep quiet laura flung back her brother in a low tense voice these horses are scared enough as it is  dave was doing his best to bring the spirited grays out of their mad gallop but they had not been out of the stable for the best part of a week and this combined with the scare from the roar of the automobile had so gotten on their nerves that to calm them seemed next to impossible on and on they flew over the packed snow of the hard road the sleigh bouncing from side to side as it passed over the bumps in the highway  jessie was deadly pale and had all she could do to keep from shrieking with fright but when she heard dave address his sister in the above words she shut her teeth hard resolved to remain silent no matter what the cost ben was worried as well as scaredthe more so because he realized there was practically nothing he could do to aid dave in subduing the runaways the youth on the front seat had braced both feet on the dashboard of the sleigh and was pulling back on the reins with all the strength of his vigorous muscles  thus fully a quarter of a mile was covereda stretch of the hill road which fortunately was comparatively straight but then there loomed up ahead a sharp turn leading down to the straight road through the valley below  davethe turn gasped ben unable to keep himself from speaking  i see it ill do what i can cried the young driver and then pulled on the reins more strongly if possible than before  closer and closer to the dreaded turn in the road the sleigh approached and as it drew nearer the girls huddled in their seats almost too terrorstricken to move ben sprang up totally unconscious of doing so  can you make it dave do you think gasped the real estate mans son when the turn was less than a hundred feet away  i dont think ill try was the unexpected answer hold fast everybody were going through the fence  the turn in the road led to the left and as they approached it dave relaxed his hold on the left rein and pulled with might and main on the right this brought the team around just a trifle but it was enough to keep them from attempting to follow the roadsomething which would undoubtedly have caused the slewing around of the sleigh and probably its overturning as it was the team left the roadway and the next instant had crashed through a frail railfence and was floundering along in the deep snow of a ploughedup and sloping field beyond  whoa there cried dave soothingly whoa jerry whoa bill and thus he continued to talk to the team while the sleigh bumped along through the deep snow and over the uneven ground  running away on the smooth surface of the highway had been one thing keeping up such a gait over a ploughed field and in snow almost a foot deep was quite another soon the fiery grays broke from their mad gallop into a trot and a minute later dave had no trouble in bringing them to a halt there they stood in the snow and the furrows of the field snorting and emitting clouds of steam from their nostrils  hold em dave while i get out and go to their heads cried ben and an instant later was out in the snow and had hold of the steeds each of the horses was trembling a little but the run seemed to have done neither of them any harm  oh dave dave gasped jessie she tried to go on but could not  oh how thankful i am that you did not attempt to go around that corner came from laura if you had tried that we would have been upset and maybe all killed and she shuddered  it was just the right thing to do dave was bens comment but i dont know that i would have thought of it you are a quick thinker and i guess we have you to thank for saving our lives  well weve broken down somebodys fence returned dave not knowing what else to say well have to fix that i suppose  huh whats a broken fence to saving ones neck snorted ben besides we only busted a couple of rails and they are not worth a great deal  dave do you think it will be safe to ride behind that team any more questioned laura  im going to do it he answered promptly no team of horses is going to get the better of me  i think now that they have had this run theyll tame down a little said ben besides that the rest of the road to coburntown is almost straight and flat  yes and as soon as we get on a straight road ill give them all the running they want answered dave ill guarantee that by the time we reach town theyll be just as meek as any one would want them  with ben still at their heads the team was turned around and led to the roadway once more there the horses were tied to a tree near by and then dave and ben spent a little time in repairing the damage done to the fence  i wish we could find out who those fellows in the auto were said ben when they were once again on the way they ought to be fined for speeding  i doubt if well be able to locate them answered dave and he was rightthey never saw or heard of the reckless automobilists again  as has been mentioned beyond the hill the road to coburntown was almost straight and level and here for over two miles dave allowed the grays to go along at a good gait although keeping his eyes on them continually so that they might not get beyond control as a consequence of this additional burst of speed when they came in sight of the town for which they were bound the grays were quite docile and willing to behave themselves properly  now if you say so ill take you girls around to the french shop suggested dave and then ben and i can drive around to mr weckss shoestore  this was agreeable to laura and jessie and in a few minutes the girls were left at the door of the establishment where laura had said she wished to match some ribbon then the two boys started for the shoedealers shop dave had already acquainted ben with the particulars of his errand to the place  what are you going to do if wecks says you really had the shoes questioned the son of the real estate dealer when they were on the way to the shoe store  but how can he say that when i havent been near the place ben returned dave  i dont know but i do know that people have sometimes had things charged to them at the stores which other people got  humph well i shant pay for any shoes that i did not get answered our hero simply  mr weckss establishment was at the far end of the main street of coburntown so the lads had half a dozen blocks to cover before they reached the place  hello its closed exclaimed ben as they came in sight of the store and he nodded in the direction of the show window the curtain of which was drawn down the curtain on the door was also down and on the glass was pasted a sheet of note paper  some sort of notice ill see what it is answered dave and throwing the reins to ben he left the sleigh soon he was reading what was written on the sheet of paper    closed on account of death in the family                      william wecks  somebody dead thats too bad mused dave i wonder who it can be and then he passed into a barber shop next door to find out  its mr weckss fathera very old man who lived back in the country from here explained the barber mr wecks went up there last night and he doesnt expect to come back until after the funeral which will probably be day after tomorrow  i dont suppose his clerk is around questioned dave  no the funeral gave him a holiday and he was glad of it hes out of town too and having thus expressed himself the barber turned to wait upon a customer who had just come in and dave returned to the sleigh  if thats the case youll have to let the matter rest until the next time you come to coburntown or else youll have to write to mr wecks said ben  ill be coming over again before very long answered dave but just the same id like to have this matter settled  while dave was speaking to his chum a man passed him on the sidewalk looking at him rather fixedly this man was mr asa dickley the proprietor of the largest gentlemens furnishing establishment of which coburntown boasted our hero knew the man fairly well having purchased a number of things at his place from time to time and so he nodded pleasantly mr asa dickley nodded in return but with a rather sour expression on his face then he glanced at ben and at the handsome sleigh and still more stylish team of horses and passed on muttering something to himself  mr dickley didnt look very happy was daves comment as he and ben entered the sleigh  i dont think he likes my father very much answered the son of the real estate dealer he wanted to get a piece of property here very cheap and my father found another customer for the place at five hundred dollars more  i see ben just the same why should he give me such a hard look of course i havent been in his place of business for a good while but he cant expect me to buy all my furnishing goods from him  well you know how it is davewhen you buy some things from some storekeepers they think they are entitled to your whole trade however i shouldnt let the matter worry me  not much ive got other things to think about dont forget that i expect next month to take that examination in civil engineering thats what is on my mind just now  oh youll pass dont worry dave just think of what a brilliant showing you made at oak hall  true but my studies in civil engineering have been a good deal harder than anything i tackled at school if it wasnt for mr ramsdell the old civil engineer who is coaching roger and me i dont know how i would possibly have gotten along  if you pass the examination what will you do next  roger and i will go out on some constructive work and thus get a taste of real engineering mr ramsdell thinks he can get us positions with the mentor construction company of philadelphia who are now doing a good deal of work in texaslaying out railroads and building bridges  in texas say thats quite a distance from here  so it is ben but it is not as far as i expect to get some day if i ever make anything of civil engineering i hope some day to be able to do some great work in other parts of the worldmaybe in mexico or south america  say that will be great cried ben enthusiastically youll have a fine chance to see the world you must take after your uncle dave he was always a great fellow to travel think of how you located him years ago away down on that island in the south seas  it sure was a great trip and some day id like to take it over again but just now ive got to put in all my time on this civil engineering proposition i think ill be lucky if i pass and get that chance to go to texas     chapter iv  ward porton again   a quarter of an hour later the girls had finished their shopping and rejoined the boys then it was decided that the party should go on to clayton six miles farther they were told that the road was in excellent condition and this proved to be a fact so that the sleighing was thoroughly enjoyed  it was growing dark when they drove down the main street of clayton and although a bit early all agreed to daves suggestion that they get dinner at the leading restauranta place at which they had stopped a number of times and which they knew to be firstclass  what a pity roger couldnt come along said jessie to dave just before sitting down to the sumptuous meal which the boys had ordered i know he would have enjoyed this very much  no doubt of it jessie answered dave who well knew what a fondness for his sister the senators son possessed but as you know roger had to go home on a business matter for his father senator morr is very busy in washington these days so roger has to take care of quite a few matters at home  isnt it queer that he doesnt want to follow in the footsteps of his father and take up politics went on the girl  senator morr didnt want him to do it and besides roger has no taste that way he loves civil engineering just as much as i do  its a wonder you and he didnt persuade phil lawrence to take it up too dave  oh phil couldnt do that you know his fathers shipping interests are very large and mr lawrence wants phil to take hold with himand phil likes that sort of thing he is planning right now to take several trips on his fathers ships this summer  when does that examination of yours come off dave  about the middle of next month  and if you really pass are you going to work away down in texas continued the girl anxiously  if i can get the positionand if roger is willing to go along  i dont like to have you go so far away and jessie pouted a little  well it cant be helped if i want to be a civil engineer ive got to take an opening where i can get it besides mr ramsdell thinks it will be the best kind of training for roger and me he knows the men at the head of the mentor company and will get them to give us every opportunity to advance ourselves that you know will mean a great deal  oh but texas dave why that is thousands of miles away  not so very many thousands jessie he answered with a little smile the mails run regularly and i trust you will not forget how to write letters besides that i dont expect to stay in texas forever  yes but when you come back from texas youll be going off to some other faraway placesouth america or africa or the north pole or somewhere and jessie pouted again  oh say let up im not going to south africa or to the north pole either of course i may go to mexico or south america or to the far west but that wont be so very soon it will be after i have had considerable experience in civil engineering and when i am older than i am now and you know what sometimes happens to a fellow when he gets older  what  he gets married  oh indeed jessie blushed a little and then i suppose he goes off and leaves his wife behind and forgets all about her  does he not so as you can notice it he takes his wife with himthat is provided she will go  oh the idea and now as dave looked her steadily in the eyes jessie blushed more than ever  where this conversation would have ended it is impossible to say but at that moment laura interrupted the pair followed by ben and then the talk became general as the four sat down to dinner  the horses had been put up in a stable connected with the restaurant and after the meal it was dave who went out to get them and bring them around to the front of the place he was just driving to the street when his glance fell upon a person standing in the glare of an electric light the person had his face turned full toward our hero so that dave got a good look at him  ward porton cried the youth in astonishment how in the world did that fellow get here and what is he doing  like a flash the memory of the past came over davehow ward porton had tried to pass himself off as the real dave porter and thus relegate dave himself back to the ranks of the nobodies  dave was crossing the sidewalk at the time but as soon as he had the team and the sleigh in the street he jumped out and made his way towards the other youth  i think ill interview him and see what he has to say for himself murmured dave to himself maybe ill have him arrested  ward porton had been staring at our hero all the while he was turning into the street and getting out of the sleigh but now as he saw dave approaching he started to walk away  stop porton i want to talk to you called out our hero stop  i dont want to see you returned the other youth hastily you let me alone and then as dave came closer he suddenly broke into a run down the street dave was taken by surprise but only for a moment then he too commenced to run doing his best to catch the fellow ahead  but ward porton was evidently scared he looked back and seeing dave running increased his speed and then shot around a corner and into an alleyway when dave reached the corner he was nowhere in sight  he certainly was scared was daves mental comment as he looked up and down the side street and even glanced into the alleyway i wonder where he went and if it would do any good to look any further for him  dave spent fully five minutes in that vicinity but without being able to discover ward portons hidingplace then knowing that the others would be wondering what had become of him and being also afraid that the grays might run away again he returned to where he had left the sleigh standing  hello where did you go called out ben who had just emerged from the restaurant  what do you think i just saw that rascal ward porton burst out dave  porton you dont mean it where is he  he was standing under that light when i drove out from the stable i ran to speak to him and then he took to his legs and scooted around yonder corner i went after him but by the time i got on the side street he was out of sight  is that so its too bad you couldnt catch him dave i suppose you would have liked to talk to him  thats right ben and maybe i might have had him arrested although now that he has been exposed and now that link merwell is in jail i dont suppose it would have done much good  its queer he should show himself so close to crumville one would think that he would want to put all the distance possible between himself and your folks  thats true ben maybe he is up to some more of his tricks  the girls were on the lookout for the boys and now having bundled up well they came from the restaurant and all got into the sleigh once more then they turned back in the direction of crumville this time however taking a route which did not go near conovers hill  oh dave were you sure it was that ward porton questioned his sister when he had told her and jessie about the appearance of the former movingpicture actor  i was positive besides if it wasnt porton why would he run away  i sincerely hope he doesnt try to do you any harm dave said jessie and gave a little shiver i was hoping we had seen the last of that horrid young man  why jessie you wouldnt call him horrid would you when he looks so very much like dave asked ben mischievously  he doesnt look very much like dave returned the girl quickly and he doesnt act in the least like him she added loyally  its mighty queer to have a double that way was the comment of the real estate mans son i dont know that i should like to have somebody else looking like me  if you couldnt help it youd have to put up with it returned dave briefly and then he changed the subject which as the others could plainly see was distasteful to him  as they left clayton the moon came up over a patch of woods flooding the snowy roadway with subdued light in spite of what had happened all of the young folks were in good spirits and they were soon laughing and chatting gaily ben started to sing one of the old oak hall favorites and dave and the girls joined in the grays were now behaving themselves and trotted along as steadily as could be desired  when the sleighingparty reached crumville they left ben basswood at his door and then went on to the wadsworth mansion  did you have a fine ride inquired mrs wadsworth when the young folks bustled into the house  oh it was splendid mamma cried her daughter coming back in the moonlight was just the nicest ever  did those grays behave themselves questioned mr wadsworth who was present john said they acted rather frisky when he brought them out  oh they were pretty frisky at first returned dave but i finally managed to get them to calm down he added the matter had been discussed by the young folks and it had been decided not to say anything about the runaway unless it was necessary  on the following morning dave had to apply himself diligently to his studies since leaving oak hall he had been attending a civil engineering class in the city with roger and had in addition been taking private tutoring from a mr ramsdell a retired civil engineer of considerable reputation who in years gone by had been a college friend of daves father dave was exceedingly anxious to make as good a showing as possible at the coming examinations  here are several letters for you david said old mr potts to him late that afternoon as he entered the boys study with the mail you seem to be the lucky one the retired professor continued with a smile all ive got is a bill  maybe there is a bill here for me professor returned dave gaily as he took the missives handed out  dave glanced at the envelopes by the handwritings he knew that one letter was from phil lawrence and another from shadow hamilton one of his old oak hall chums and a fellow who loved to tell stories the third communication was postmarked coburntown and in a corner of the envelope had the imprint of asa dickley  hello i wonder what mr dickley wants of me dave mused as he turned the letter over then he remembered how sour the storekeeper had appeared when they had met the day before maybe he wants to know why i havent bought anything from him lately  dave tore open the communication which was written on one of asa dickleys letterheads the letter ran as follows    mr david porter    dear sir    i thought when i saw you in coburntown today that you would come   in and see me but you did not will you kindly let me know why   you do not settle up as promised when i let you have the goods   you said you would settle up by the end of the week without fail   unless you come in and settle up inside of the next week i shall   have to call the attention of your father to what you owe me                                     yours truly                                        asa dickley     chapter v  what asa dickley had to say   dave read the letter received from mr asa dickley with much interest he went over it twice and as he did so the second time his mind reverted to the communication received the morning before from mr wecks  what in the world does mr dickley mean by writing to me in this fashion he mused i havent had anything from him in a long while and i dont owe him a cent it certainly is a mighty strange proceeding to say the least  then like a flash another thought came into his mindwas ward porton connected in any way with this affair  somebody must have gotten some things in my name from mr dickley and he must have gotten those shoes from mr wecks too if the party went there in person and said he was dave porter i dont think it could have been any one but ward porton because so far as i know hes the only fellow that resembles me  our hero was so much worried that he gave scant attention to the letters received from phil lawrence and shadow hamilton even though those communications contained many matters of interest he was looking at the dickley communication for a third time when his sister entered  well dave no more bad news i hope said laura with a smile  it is bad news he returned just read that and he turned the letter over to her  if you owe mr dickley any money you ought to pay him said the sister after perusing the epistle i dont think father would like it if he knew you were running into debt and she gazed anxiously at dave  laura you ought to know me better than that he answered somewhat shortly i never run any bills unless i am able to pay them but this is something different it is in the same line with the one i got from mr wecks i didnt get his shoes and i havent gotten anything from mr dickley for a long time and nothing at all that i havent paid for  oh dave do you mean it and now lauras face took on a look of worry why somebody must be playing a trick on you  if he is its a mighty mean trick laura but i think it is more than a trick i think it is a swindle  swindle  exactly and what is more do you know who i think is guilty  why who could be guilty the sister paused for a moment to look at her brother oh dave could it be that awful ward porton  thats the fellow i fasten on didnt we meet him in clayton and thats only six miles from coburntown more than likely that rascal has been hanging around here and maybe getting a whole lot of things in my name dave began to pace the floor its a shame if i could get hold of him i think i would have him locked up  what are you going to do about this letter  im going to go to coburntown the first chance i get and tell mr dickley and also mr wecks the truth i want to find out whether the party who got those things procured them in person or on some written order if he got them on a written order somebody must have forged my name  hadnt you better tell father or uncle dunston about this  not just yet laura it will be time enough to worry them after i have seen mr wecks and mr dickley perhaps i can settle the matter myself  dave was so upset that it was hard for him to buckle down to his studies and he was glad that evening when an interruption came in the shape of the arrival of his old school chum and fellow engineering student roger morr  back again and right side up with care announced the senators son as he came in and shook hands my but ive had a busy time since ive been away he replied in answer to a question of daves i had to settle up one or two things for father and then i had to go on half a dozen different errands for mother and then see to it that i got those new text books that mr ramsdell spoke about i got two copies of each dave and here are those that are coming to you and he passed over three small volumes and that isnt all i just met ben basswood at the depot where he was sending a telegram to his father who is in chicago ben had some wonderful news to tell  what was that asked laura and jessie simultaneously  he didnt give me any of the particulars but it seems an old friend of theirs died out in chicago recently and mr basswood was sent for by some lawyers to help settle the estate  yes we know that much broke in dave but whats the new news  why it seems this man enos died quite wealthy and he left almost his entire estate to mr basswood  is that so cried dave that sure is fine i dont know of anybody who deserves money more than do the basswoods and his face lit up with genuine pleasure  it will be nice for ben said jessie and even nicer for mrs basswood mamma says there was a time when they were quite poor and mrs basswood had to do all her own work now theyll be able to take it easy  oh they are far from poor returned dave theyve been living on easy street as the saying goes for a number of years just the same it will be a fine thing for them to get this fortune  there was one thing about the news that ben didnt understand continued roger his father telegraphed that the estate was a decidedly curious one and that was why the lawyers wanted him to come to chicago immediately he added that mr enos had proved to be a very eccentric individual  maybe he was as eccentric as that man in rhode island i once read about said dave with a grin when he died he left an estate consisting of about twelve thousand ducks this estate went to two worthless nephews who knew nothing at all about their uncles business and as somebody said the two nephews very soon made ducks and drakes of the whole fortune  oh what a story cried jessie laughing twelve thousand ducks what ever would a person do with them  why some duck farms are very profitable returned roger  you dont suppose this mr enos left such a fortune as that to mr basswood queried laura  im sure i dont know what the fortune consists of and neither did ben he was tremendously curious to know and he said his mother could hardly wait until mr basswood sent additional information replied roger  ben told me that this mr enos was once a partner of his father in business the two running an art store together enos was very much interested in art so its possible the fortune he left may have something to do with that added dave  as my old readers know roger morr had always thought a great deal of laura and of late his liking for her had greatly increased on her part daves sister had always considered the senators son a very promising young man consequently it can well be imagined that the four young people spent a most enjoyable time that evening in the mansion the girls played on the piano and all sang and then some rugs were pushed aside a phonograph was brought into action and they danced a number of the latest steps with the older folks looking on  roger was to remain over for several days at crumville and early the next morning dave asked his chum if he would accompany him on a hasty trip to coburntown he had already acquainted roger with the trouble he was having with the shoedealer and the man who sold mens furnishings  we can take a horse and cutter and be back before lunch said dave  ill be glad to go answered the senators son i havent had a ride in a cutter this winter  they were soon on the way dave this time driving a black horse that could not only cover the ground well but was thoroughly reliable by ten oclock they found themselves in coburntown and made their way to the establishment run by asa dickley the proprietor of the store was busy with a customer at the time and a clerk came forward to wait on the new arrivals  i wish to speak to mr dickley said dave and he and roger waited until the man was at leisure mr dickley looked anything but pleasant as he walked up to our hero  i got a very strange letter from you mr dickley i cant understand it at all began dave  and i cant understand why you treat me the way you do blurted out the shopkeeper you promised to come in here and settle up over a week ago  mr dickley i think there is a big mistake somewhere said dave as calmly as he could i dont owe you any money and i cant understand why you should write me such a letter as this and he brought forth the communication he had received  you dont owe me any money ejaculated asa dickley i just guess you do you owe me twentysix dollars  twentysix dollars repeated dave what is that for  for you know as well as i do didnt you come in here and get a fedora hat some shirts and collars and neckties and a pair of furlined gloves and a lot of underwear the whole bill came to just twentysix dollars  and when was this stuff purchased went on dave  when was it purchased see here porter what sort of tomfoolery is this cried asa dickley you know as well as i do when you got the things i wouldnt be so harsh with you only you promised me faithfully that you would come in and settle up long before this  mr dickley i havent had any goods from you for a long long timeand what i have had i have paid for answered dave doing his best to keep his temper because he knew the storekeeper must be laboring under a mistake as a matter of fact i havent been in your store for several months  what ejaculated the storekeeper do you mean to deny that you bought those goods from me young man  i certainly do deny it as i said before i havent been in this store for several months  at this plain declaration made by dave mr asa dickley grew fairly purple he leaned over his counter and shook his clenched fist in daves face  so that is the way you are going to try to swindle me out of my money is it dave porter he cried well let me tell you it wont work you came here and got those goods from me and either youll pay for them or ill sue your father for the amount why its preposterous the storekeeper turned to his clerk who was gazing on the scene in openmouthed wonder here a customer comes in and buys a lot of goods and i am goodhearted enough to trust him to the amount twentysix dollars and then he comes here and declares to my face that he never had the things and he wont pay for them now what do you think of that hibbins  i think its pretty raw responded the clerk  werent you in the shop when i let porter have some of those goods  i certainly was answered hibbins of course i was in the rear sorting out those new goods that had come in so i didnt see just what you let him have but i certainly know he got some things  mr dickley now listen to me for a minute said dave in a tone of voice that arrested the mans attention in spite of his irascibility look at me closely didnt the fellow who got those things from you look somewhat different from me  dave faced the storekeeper with unflinching eyes and asa dickley was compelled to look the youth over carefully as he did this the positive expression on his face gradually changed to one of doubt  why ierof course he looked like you he stammered of course you can change your looks a little but that dont count with me besides didnt you give me your name as dave porter and ask me if i didnt remember you  the fellow who got those goods may have done all that mr dickley but that fellow was not i i may be mistaken but i think it was a young man who resembles me and who some time ago made a great deal of trouble for me  humph thats a fishy kind of story porter if there is such a person he must look very much like you  he does in fact some people declare they can hardly tell us apart  whats the name of that fellow  ward porton  does he live around here  i dont know where he is living just at present but i saw him day before yesterday in clayton i tried to stop him but he ran away from me  the storekeeper gazed at dave for a moment in silence and then pursed up his lips and shook his head decidedly  that is too much of a fish story for me to swallow he said harshly youll either have to bring that young man here and prove that he got the goods or else youll have to pay for them yourself     chapter vi  more trouble   dave and roger spent the best part of half an hour in asa dickleys store and during that time our hero and his chum gave the particulars of how they had become acquainted with ward porton and how the young movingpicture actor had tried to pass himself off as the real dave porter and how he had been exposed and had disappeared  well if what you say is true ive been swindled declared the storekeeper finally id like to get my hands on that young man  you wouldnt like it any better than i would returned dave grimly you see i dont know how far this thing extends mr wecks has been after me to pay for some shoes that i never got  say that movingpicture actor must be a lulu declared the storekeepers clerk slangily if you dont watch out porter hell get you into all kinds of hot water  i think the best you can do dave is to notify the storekeepers you do business with to be on the lookout for porton suggested roger then if he shows up again they can have him held until you arrive  ill certainly have to do something answered dave  then i suppose you dont want to settle that bill came from asa dickley wistfully  no sir and i dont think you ought to expect it  well i dont know the fellow who got those goods said he was dave porter vouchsafed the storekeeper doggedly  from asa dickleys establishment dave accompanied by his chum drove around to the store kept by mr wecks he found the curtains still down but the shoedealer had just come in and was at his desk writing letters  and you mean to say you didnt get those shoes questioned mr wecks with interest after dave had explained the situation thats mighty curious i never had a thing like that happen before he knew our hero well and trusted dave implicitly i shouldnt have sent that letter only i had a chance to sell a pair of shoes that size and i thought if you had made your selection i could sell the pair you didnt want to the other fellow  once again the two boys had to tell all about ward porton and what that young rascal was supposed to be doing as they proceeded mr weckss face took on a look of added intelligence  exactly exactly that fits in with what i thought when that fellow went off with the shoes he declared finally i said to myself somehow dave porter looks different today he must have had a spell of sickness or something that other chap was a bit thinner and paler than you are  hes a regular cigarette fiend and that is i think what makes him look pale put in roger and then he added quickly do you rememberwas he smoking  yes he was he threw a cigarette stub away while he was trying on the shoes and then lit another cigarette when he was going out i thought at the time that he was probably smoking more than was good for him  i dont smoke at all and never have done so said dave he turned to his chum i think the fact that the fellow who got the shoes was smoking is additional proof that it was porton  i havent the slightest idea that it was anybody else answered the senators son  mr wecks promised to keep on the lookout for ward porton in case that individual showed himself again and then dave and roger left  im going into all the stores where i do business and tell the folks to be on the watch for ward porton said our hero  a good idea dave but see here how are they going to tell him from you and the senators son chuckled you may come along some day and they may hold you thinking you are porton  i thought of that roger and ill leave each of them my signature on a card i know that ward porton doesnt write as i do  this idea was followed out the boys spending the best part of an hour in going around coburntown then they drove back to crumville and there dave visited some other establishments with which he was in the habit of doing business  all the storekeepers were much interested in what he had to tell and all readily agreed to have ward porton detained if he should show himself at each place dave left his signature so that there might be no further mistake regarding his identity  after that several days passed quietly both dave and roger were applying themselves to their studies and as a consequence saw little of ben except in the evenings when all the young folks would get together for more or less of a good time  any more news about that fortune in chicago asked dave one evening of the basswood lad  not very much answered ben father telegraphed that he was hunting for some things that belonged to mr enos he said that as soon as he found them he would tell us all about it  that certainly is a strange state of affairs  strange i should say it was cried the other mother and i are just dying to know what it all means one thing is certainmr enos did not leave his fortune in stocks or bonds or real estate or anything like that  on the following day came additional trouble for dave in the shape of a communication from a hotelkeeper in coburntown he stated that he had heard through asa dickley that dave was having trouble with a party who was impersonating him and added that a person calling himself dave porter was owing him a bill of fifteen dollars for five days board  isnt this the limit cried dave as he showed the letter to his father and his uncle dunston  no use in talking dave well have to get after that rascal announced the father if we dont there is no telling how far hell carry this thing i think ill put the authorities on his track  two days after that and while dave was continuing his studies as diligently as ever came word over the telephone from clayton  is this you dave porter came over the wire  yes answered our hero who are you  this is nat poole talking i am up here in claytonin the first national bank you know my father got me a job here last week  no i didnt know it nat but im glad to hear you have something to do and i hope youll make a success of it returned dave promptly  i called you up to find out if you were in clayton continued the son of the money lender i wanted to make sure of it  well im not im right here at home nat  then in that case i want to tell you that the fellow who looks like you is here  where do you meanin the bank  well he came in here to get a fivedollar bill changed i happened to see him as he was going out and i called to him thinking it was you when i called he seemed to get scared and he got out in a hurry then i happened to think about that fellow who looked like you and i made up my mind id call you up  how long ago since he was in the bank questioned dave eagerly  not more than ten minutes ago i tried to get you sooner but the wire was busy  you havent any idea where he went  no except that he started down the side street next to the bank which as maybe you know runs towards the river  all right nat thank you very much for what youve told me i want to locate that fellow if i possibly can he is a swindler and if you clap eyes on him again have him arrested added dave and this nat poole promised to do  the news over the wire excited dave not a little of the men of the household only old professor potts was in and he of course could not assist in the matter dave at once sought out mrs wadsworth and told her of what he had heard  i think ill drive to clayton and see if i can locate porton he added roger says he will go with me  do as you think best dave answered the lady of the house but do keep out of trouble this ward porton may prove to be a dangerous character if you attempt to corner him  i think roger and i can manage him if only we can find him returned the youth  once more the black horse and the cutter were brought into service and the two youths made the best possible time on the snowy highway that led through coburntown to clayton arriving there they called at the bank and interviewed nat poole  if what you say about porton is true he certainly must be a bad onealmost as bad as merwell and jasniff was the comment of the money lenders son i certainly hope you spot him and bring him to book thats the way he went the last i saw of him he added pointing down the side street  dave and roger drove down the street looking to the right and the left for a possible sight of ward porton but their search was doomed to disappointment for the movingpicture actor was nowhere to be seen  its a good deal like looking for a needle in a haystack was the comment of the senators son after a full hour had been spent in the hunt  they had left the sleigh and had walked around a number of mills and tenement houses which were situated in that locality  ive got an idea said dave as several children approached them im going to ask the youngsters if theyve seen a young man who looks like me  the first boys and girls to whom the subject was broached shook their heads and declared they had seen nobody that resembled dave then our hero and his chum passed on to other children and finally to some men working around a newlyconstructed tenement  why sure i saw a young feller wot looked like you said a youth who was piling up some lumber he ast me fer a match say he looked like he could have been your twin he added in wonder and then continued suddenly maybe youse is playin a trick on me and it was youse got the match  no i never met you before answered dave quickly when did you meet the other fellow and where i am very anxious to locate him  it was down on de bridge about an hour ago i was comin dis way and he was goin de udder way  was he smoking a cigarette asked roger  he had one o de coffinnails in his hand and he lit up after i given him de match  did he say anything questioned our hero  the carpenters helper scratched his head for a moment sure he did he ast me if it was putty good walkin to bixter i told him putty fair and den he went on and i came here  then he must have gone on to bixter cried roger how far is that from here  about two miles and a half answered dave he turned to the carpenters helper much obliged to you  dats all right say but dat guy certainly looks like you the carpenters helper added with a grin  come well follow him said dave to his chum and led the way on the run to where the horse was tied  soon they were in the cutter once more dave urged the black along at his best speed and over the bridge they flew and then along the road leading to the village of bixter     chapter vii  face to face   if you catch porton dave what will you doturn him over to the authorities  yes roger  is bixter much of a place  oh no there are but two stores and two churches and not over thirty or forty houses  then you may have some trouble in finding an officer probably the village doesnt boast of anything more than a constable and a justice of the peace  i am not worrying about that yet roger returned our hero grimly we have got to catch porton first  oh i know that but if he started for bixter on foot we ought to be able to locate him a stranger cant go through such a small place without somebodys noticing it  on and on trotted the horse past many wellkept farms and then through a small patch of timber land beyond the woods they crossed a frozen creek and then made a turn to the northward a short distance beyond they came in sight of the first houses that went to make up the village of bixter  well weve not seen anything of him yet remarked the senators son as they slowed up and looked ahead and to both sides of the village street  no and i dont understand it returned dave from what that carpenters helper said i thought we should overtake him before we got to bixter either he must have left this road or else he must be some walker  i dont see where he could have gone if he left the road dave all we passed were lanes leading to the farms and a path through that wood it isnt likely he would take to the woods in this cold weathernot unless he was going hunting and that chap back in clayton didnt say anything about his carrying a gun  with the horse in a walk they passed down the village street and back again as they did this they kept their eyes wide open peering into the various yards and lanes that presented themselves  im afraid its no use unless he is in one of these houses or in one of the stores was rogers comment  ill ask at the stores returned dave  the inquiries he and his chum made were productive of no results so far as locating ward porton was concerned no one had seen or heard of the former moving picture actor  all the strangers weve seen today was a cigar drummer said one of the shopkeepers and he was a fat man and about forty years old the other storekeeper had had no strangers in his place  hardly knowing what to do next dave and roger returned to the cutter  maybe he went farther than this suggested roger we might go on a mile or two and take a look  now that they had come so far dave thought this a good idea and so they passed on for a distance of nearly two miles beyond bixter here the sleighing became poor there being but few farmhouses in that vicinity  its no use said dave finally well go back to bixter take another look around and then return to clayton and home  when they arrived once more at the village dave suggested that he and his chum separate  there are a number of these lanes that lead to some back roads said dave perhaps if we tramp around on foot and ask some of the country folks living around here we may get on the track of the fellow we are after  the senators son was willing and he was soon walking down a lane leading to the right while dave went off to the left presently dave came to a barn where a farmer was mending some broken harness  hello back again are you cried the farmer as he looked at dave curiously what brought you why didnt you stop when i called to you before  i guess youre just the man i want to see cried dave quickly and then as the farmer looked at him in increasing wonder he added did a young man who looks very much like me go past here today  look like you queried the farmer why it was you wasnt it  no it must have been a fellow who resembles me very closely i am trying to catch him  well i swan murmured the farmer looking at dave critically that other feller looked as much like you as could be wot is heyour twin brother  i am thankful to say he is no relative of mine he is a swindler and that is why i would like to catch him he has been getting goods in my name if he went past here perhaps you can tell me where he has gone  he walked past here less than fifteen minutes ago he went down that lane which is a short cut to the road to barnett  barnett cried our hero thats the railroad station up this way isnt it  yes  then he must be heading for a railroad train exclaimed dave quickly how far is it from here  barnett is three miles by the road but its less than a mile and a quarter by that short cut through gerrys woods  then ill go after him by that short cut answered dave he thought for a moment to hunt up roger and get him to go along might take too long he looked at the farmer would you like to go with me ill make it worth your while he continued  sorry but i cant do it was the reply ive got to meet the man who buys my milk down town in about fifteen minutes hes a very particular customer and if i should fail him he might get mad so i cant go  all right ill go after him alone answered our hero and then continued if you are going down town and you chance to see a friend of mine with my black horse and cutter will you kindly tell him where i have gone  sure i will and with this promise from the farmer dave started on a swift walk along the short cut to barnett which the other had pointed out  fortunately for the youth to keep his feet warm while riding he had donned a heavy pair of rubbers so that walking through the rather deep snow of the path leading through the back farms and through gerrys woods was not as uncomfortable as it might otherwise have been to be sure he occasionally found himself floundering in snow that was over his shoetops but when this happened he simply smiled grimly and made the best of it when at oak hall he had often taken part in track athletics crosscountry running and occasionally in a game of hare and hounds and consequently his wind was good and he made rapid progress without becoming too much exhausted  he was in the depth of the woods when at a turn in the path he saw a figure ahead of him the individual wore a heavy overcoat and had a cap pulled well down over his ears and the back of his head  i may be mistaken but that looks as if it might be porton said dave to himself however ill soon know and he increased his speed so that he might catch up to the other walker  as the ground was covered with snow our hero made but slight noise while he advanced and as a consequence he drew quite close to the other individual before the latter was aware of his presence  hi there called out dave when he was but a few feet behind the fellow had stopped and turned around and a single glance showed our hero that it was the youth he was seeking  dave porter muttered ward porton as he recognized our hero his manner showed that he was much astonished as well as chagrined at this unexpected meeting  you didnt expect to meet me out here did you remarked dave sharply as he came up alongside the former movingpicture actor  whyiericantcant say that i did returned porton lamely  youve been acting in a fine way havent you porton went on dave angrily  huh what have i done portons gaze was shifty he did not dare to look our hero in the eyes  you know well enough what youve done portonbuying a whole lot of goods in my name  what are you talking about i didnt do any such thing was the blustering reply the former movingpicture actor was recovering from his surprise  i can prove that you did and im going to hold you responsible for it answered dave calmly  look here porter i dont want any such talk from you and now ward porton doubled up his fists and stuck out his chin ive stood all i am going to stand from you i want you to leave me alone  porton you can bluster all you please but it wont do you any good answered dave and his voice had a more positive ring to it than before you thought you could play this trick on me and get away with it but i am going to show you it cant be done i am going to hand you over to the authorities and see that you go to jail  if you think you can do that porter youve got another guess coming you clear out and let me alone or ill make it hot for you and ward porton shook his fist in daves face  the manner of the young man who had been obtaining goods in daves name was so aggressive that many a youth would have been intimidated and inclined to withdraw but that was not our heros way he was righteously indignant not only because of what the rascal before him had done but also because of his present threat without more ado he seized hold of portons upraised arm and backed the fellow against a tree  illustration he seized portons upraised arm and backed the fellow against a treepage 70  now you just listen to me he said sternly your bluff and bluster wont do you any good i am going to hand you over to the authorities and that is all there is to it youve got to behave yourself and stop threatening me or ill give you something that you wont want  you imp you let go of me roared porton and bringing around his disengaged hand he struck dave a glancing blow on the chin  if anything more was needed to arouse our heros just ire this blow proved more than sufficient as much anger as he had ever felt in his life surged up in daves heart he drew back letting go his holdand the next instant his fist shot out and landed straight on ward portons nose  ouch spluttered the former movingpicture actor and not without reason for the stinging blow our hero had delivered not only hurt exceedingly but also caused the blood to flow  now will you behave yourself and come with me or do you want some more demanded dave  ill fix you for that just wait bellowed porton and then he made a savage rush at our hero  the next instant they were locked in each others arms and swaying from side to side each doing his utmost to gain the mastery     chapter viii  the basswood fortune   over and over in the snow of the woods rolled dave and porton first one being on top and then the other each was encumbered by his heavy overcoat and his gloves so that to send in a decisive blow was practically impossible  the former movingpicture actor fought desperately for he had no desire to go to jail and he realized that dave meant to send him to such a place if he could possibly accomplish it  dave on his part was angered through and through not only because of what porton had done at the stores but also because of the way the former movingpicture actor had threatened him  the encounter had occurred at a spot where the trees were somewhat scattered and where rocks were numerous as the two continued their struggle they sent the loose snow flying in all directions and often struck on some of the rocks  at last dave managed to get his opponent by the throat and he forced portons head backward against a large stone in the meantime however the rascal managed to double up one of his legs and he gave dave a shove in the stomach which sent him rolling over on his side  now ill fix you panted porton and releasing his right hand he picked up a loose stone which their scuffle had exposed to view the next instant he brought the stone up hitting our hero on the side of the head it was a furious blow and for the moment dave was stunned he let go of the others throat and as he did this ward porton arose to his feet  now i guess youll let me alone he snarled and aimed a vicious kick at daves head but the youth even though somewhat bewildered had sense enough left to dodge and the blow landed on his shoulder  then porton turned and dashed wildly along the woods path leading in the direction of barnett  it took our hero several seconds to collect himself sufficiently to arise his ear was ringing from the contact with the stone which fortunately had been a smooth one and his shoulder also ached even though the kick had been delivered through the padding of his overcoat  he gazed along the path and was just in time to see porton disappearing around a bend  if dave had been thoroughly angry before he was now even more so and shaking his head to clear his brain he started on a run after the fugitive he reached the turn in the path to see porton emerging from the woods and taking to the highway leading to the railroad depot  he must be running to catch a train thought our hero and if that is so ill have to hustle or hell get away  by the time dave gained the highway leading to barnett ward porton had reached the vicinity of the first of the houses in the village here he paused to glance back and seeing his pursuer shook his fist at dave then he went on about fifty yards farther suddenly turning into a lane between two of the houses  hes afraid to go to the depot for fear ill get after him before a train comes in thought dave well ill catch him anyway unless he takes to the woods  what dave had surmised was correct ward porton had thought to get on a train that would stop at barnett inside of the next ten minutes now however he realized that to go to the depot and hang around until the cars took their departure would probably mean capture  confound the luck how did he manage to get on my trail so quickly muttered the former movingpicture actor to himself now ill have to lay low and do my best to sneak off to some other place i wish it wasnt so cold when i stop running ill be half frozen but anyway i had the satisfaction of giving him one in the ear with that rock and another in the shoulder with my foot and he smiled grimly as he placed his handkerchief to his bleeding nose  by the time dave reached the lane between the houses porton was nowhere in sight there were a number of footprints in the snow and following these dave passed a barn and some cowsheds from this point a single pair of footprints led over a short field into the very woods where the encounter had taken place  hes going to hide in the woods sure enough reasoned our hero or else maybe hell try to get back to clayton or bixter  hi whats going on here cried a voice from the cowshed and a man showed himself followed by two wellgrown boys  im after a fellow who just ran across that field into the woods explained dave quickly hes a thief i want to catch him and have him locked up  oh say i thought i saw somebody exclaimed one of the boys i thought it might be tom jones goin huntin  in as few words as possible dave explained the situation to the farmer and his two sons and they readily agreed to accompany him into the woods  but youll have a big job trying to locate that chap in those woods was the farmers comment the growth back here is very thick and my boys have been lost in it more than once  huh we always found our way out again grumbled the older of the sons who did not like this statement on his parents part  yes billy but the woods are mighty thick returned his brother if that feller dont look out he may get lost and get froze to death tonight unless he knows enough to make a fire  it was easy enough to follow the footprints to the edge of the woods but once there the brushwood and rocks were so thick that to follow the marks one would have had to have the eyes of an expert trailer dave and the farmer with the two boys searched around for the best part of a quarter of an hour but without success  hes slipped you i guess remarked the farmer shaking his head i thought he would  are there any trails running through the woods in this vicinity  the only trail i know of is the one running to bixter there is a woods road used by the lumbermen but that is on the other side of the railroad tracks  the struggle with ward porton followed by the run had put dave into quite a perspiration and in the depth of the woods he found it exceedingly cold  ill have to keep on the move or i may get a chill he told the others after another look around i guess we had better give it up  goin to offer any reward for capturin that feller questioned the older of the two boys when the four were on their way back to the cowshed  yes ill give a reward answered our hero promptly if any of you can catch him and have him held by the authorities ill give you ten dollars  wow me for the ten dollars cried the youth but say howll i know that feller if i do find him he questioned suddenly  thats right billy you wont want to hold the wrong man put in the father with a grin if you did that you might get into hot water and he chuckled  it will be easy to recognize him answered dave just take a good look at me well unfortunately that other fellow resembles me very closely in fact thats the reason i want to catch him thats how he got those goods i said he had stolen its virtually stealing to get goods in such an underhand manner  all right ill know the feller if he looks like you said billy he turned to his younger brother say paul what do you say if we go into the woods later on and lay low for that feller maybe hell come out this way after he thinks the way is clear  sure ill go with you declared paul if we look around very carefully we may be able to pick up his tracks somewhere  it must be admitted that dave felt much crestfallen when he bade goodbye to the farmer and his sons after having left them his name and address  the farmer had offered to drive him back to bixter but our hero had stated that he would rather walk and take the short cut through the woods when he arrived at the village he found roger wondering what had become of him  well did you catch porton queried the senators son  i did and i didnt answered dave with a grim sort of smile and he related the particulars of what had occurred  great hambones dave you certainly have had an experience was rogers comment let me look at that ear i declare its quite swollen i hope it didnt hurt anything inside he added anxiously  it rings and aches a little roger but i dont think it is seriously hurt  how about your shoulder  that feels a little sore but thats all ill soon get over it  and to think you got so close to capturing him and then he got away was the sad comment of the senators son it does beat all how slippery some of those rascals are  im living in hope that those farmer boys will locate porton said dave i promised them a reward of ten dollars if they did so thats a lot of money for lads living around here  now that he had rejoined roger and had gotten partly over the effects of his encounter with porton dave was rather loath to give up the hunt they managed to find a store where the proprietor occasionally furnished lunches and there procured some sandwiches and hot chocolate then they drove to barnett by the regular highway and there took another look around for the missing evildoer  the boys have gone down to the woods to look for him announced the farmer when dave called on him once more if they learn anything ill let you know  that evening found dave and roger back in crumville where of course they had to relate the details of what had happened  oh dave you must be more careful cried jessie after he had told of the encounter in the woods that wicked fellow might kill you and she shuddered  yes indeed you ought to be careful said laura why he seems to be almost as bad as merwell and jasniff were  so he is laura and if i ever get the chance ill put him where they arein prison answered the brother grimly  as was to be expected dave was quite worked up over what had occurred and that night he did not sleep very well both his father and his sister insisted that he go to a physician and have his ear examined  no damage done so far as i can see said the doctor but you had better bathe it with witchhazel and keep it warm for a day or two  the next day dave settled down to his studies as well as he was able he hoped that word might come in that ward porton had been captured but in this he was disappointed  i think hell steer clear of this neighborhood for a while at least was mr porters comment  thats just my idea added daves uncle dunston he must know that a great many swindled storekeepers and other people are on the watch for him  dave had not seen ben basswood for several days on the following evening the son of the real estate dealer came hurrying over to the wadsworth mansion  weve got news about that mr enoss estate cried ben as soon as he met dave and roger its the queerest thing you ever heard of mother doesnt know what to make of it and i dont know what to make of it either  well i hope its a valuable estate if it is coming to your father said the senators son  i dont know whether it is valuable or not and neither does father he says in his telegram it is certainly worth several thousand dollars and he doesnt know but that it may be worth a hundred thousand dollars or more  a hundred thousand dollars cried laura who had come in to hear what ben had to tell oh ben that certainly is a fortune  well what does it consist of queried dave if it may be worth all the way from two or three thousand dollars to a hundred thousand or more it must be mining stocks or something like that  no it isnt in stocks or bonds or anything like that  then what in the world does the estate consist of questioned our hero  miniatures answered ben basswood simply     chapter ix  something about miniatures   miniatures came from all of ben basswoods listeners in a chorus  do you mean those little paintings that are sometimes so valuable continued laura  thats it answered ben i dont know much about miniatures myself but as soon as mother and i heard about this queer fortune of ours she asked the minister you know he is quite interested in art and he told her that most of these little miniatures which are about the size of a silver dollar or a small saucer are usually painted on ivory of course some of them are not so valuable but others especially those painted by celebrated artists are worth thousands of dollars  and how many of these miniatures are there ben asked roger with increased curiosity  father didnt know exactly but said they would number at least fifty and maybe seventyfive  i suppose they are paintings of celebrated individualskings queens and like that was daves comment  no these miniatures so father stated are made up almost entirely of the great fighters of the worldarmy and navy men lieutenantgenerals admirals and officers like that  well where in the world did this mr enos get money enough to buy such things asked jessie who had followed laura into the room  thats the queer part of it answered the realestate dealers son it seems after mr enos and my father gave up business and separated enos went southfirst to texas and then into mexico there he joined some men who were opening up a gold mine these men struck it rich and almost before he knew it mr enos was worth quite a lot of money he had never been very much of a business manbeing wrapped up almost entirely in artand so he did not know how to handle his money he had always had a liking for miniatures so my father stated and he went in to gather this collection he didnt want any kings or queens or noted society women or anything like that but he did want every miniature ever painted of an army or a navy fighter of course my father doesnt know all the particulars yet but he has learned that mr enos put himself out a great deal to get hold of certain miniatures hunting for them all over europe and also in this country he even went down to south america to get miniatures of some of their heroes and also picked up several in mexico and one or two in texas  his hobby must certainly have had a strong hold on him was daves comment but still that sort of thing isnt unusual i heard once of a postagestamp collector who went all over the world collecting stamps and finally gave up his last dollar for a rare stamp when he actually hadnt enough to eat of course he was a monomaniac on the subject of stamp collecting  well my father has an idea that mr enos must have been a little queer over his miniature collecting returned ben but even so the fact remains that he left his collection of miniatures behind him and that they are now the property of my father  and what is your father going to do with them questioned roger  he doesnt know yet you see the settling of the estate is in a very mixedup condition he is going to stay in chicago for a week or so and then hell probably bring the miniatures east with him and have some art expert place a valuation on them after that i suppose hell offer the miniatures for sale to art galleries and rich collectors  this was about all ben could tell concerning the fortune left to his parent the young folks talked the matter over for quite a while and were presently joined by the older people including caspar potts  miniatures eh said the genial old professor beaming mildly on ben very curious very curious indeed but some of them are wonderful works of art and bring very good prices i remember when a young man attending a sale of art works and a miniature of one of the english nobility was knocked down for a very large sum several thousand dollars if i remember rightly  well its very fine to get hold of a fortune no matter in what shape it is observed mr wadsworth just the same ben i think your father would prefer to have it in good stocks and bonds and he smiled faintly  no doubt of that sir was the prompt answer but as you say miniatures are much better than nothing in fact id rather take a fortune in soft soap than not get it at all and at this remark there was a general laugh  oh my gracious ben what would you do with a hundred thousand dollars worth of soft soap queried laura slyly  oh id go around and smooth down all my friends and enemies with it the boy returned and this caused another laugh  several more days passed and during that time dave and roger continued to devote themselves to their studies mr ramsdell the old civil engineer was on hand to tutor the two youths and he declared that they were making satisfactory progress and that he thought they would pass the coming examinations without much trouble  i wish i felt as confident about it as mr ramsdell does observed our hero to his chum one day  the same here dave returned roger every time i think of that examination i fairly shake in my shoes passing at oak hall wasnt a patch to passing as a civil engineer  there had been another fall of snow and now sleighing was even better than before jessie and laura went out in company with their uncle and on their return both showed some excitement  oh daverogerwhat do you think cried laura ive got a letter from belle endicott and she is coming on from star ranch to spend several weeks with me and she is going to bring along one of her old school chums cora dartmore what do you think of that wont it be fine  it certainly will be laura answered her brother when do you expect them to arrive  they are coming on immediately so i suppose theyll be here in a day or two if they are following this letter laura looked inquiringly at dave what a pity phil lawrence isnt here she half whispered  both of them knew that during the visit of the young folks to the endicott ranch the shipowners son and belle endicott had become exceedingly friendly  well ive invited phil to come here answered dave i guess all ive got to do is to mention belle to him and hell be on the way without delay  then by all means send him word returned the sister then we can make up a fine little party for we can pair cora dartmore off with ben  a letter from dave to phil lawrence was dispatched that evening and the next day came a telegram from the shipowners son stating that he would come on that night  i knew the mention of belle would fetch phil remarked dave to roger when they were alone phil certainly has got an eye on that girl  well you cant blame him dave belle endicott is a splendid girl and comes from a splendid family ill never forget how royally they treated us when we were at star ranch  yes we certainly did have one grand time in spite of what link merwell did to annoy us  oh drop link merwell roger paused for a moment and then went on isnt it queer dave how just as soon as you get rid of one bad egg like merwell another bobs up like this ward porton  it is queer roger dave heaved a deep sigh i wish i could get on the track of that rascal  havent heard a thing have you  no  well you can be thankful that he hasnt been around buying more goods in your name  oh i think i scared him pretty well when i met him in the woods hell probably lay low for a whileat least until he thinks the field is clear again but id give a good deal if i never saw or heard of him again and dave heaved another sigh  the next day the local paper came out with a big article on the front page speaking about the basswood fortune mr basswood had returned to town and had been interviewed by a reporter and the sheet gave many of the particulars regarding the wonderful miniatures left by mr enos according to the paper they numbered sixtyeight all told and were worth from a hundred dollars to five thousand dollars apiece it was said that they had been placed in a safe deposit vault being packed in several plushlined cases  the paper went on to state that mr basswood thought something of bringing them to crumville where they might be judged by a committee of experts in order to ascertain their real value the realestate dealer was spoken of as a man wellknown in the community and the article concluded by stating that all the good people of crumville and vicinity would undoubtedly congratulate him on his good fortune  they certainly piled it on a little thick was daves comment after he and roger had read the article just the same i agree with the paperthe basswoods richly deserve the fortune that has come to them dave had not forgotten those days now long gone by when he had been a boy just out of the poorhouse living with caspar potts and how ben basswood had been his one young friend during those trying times  as luck would have it all the young visitors bound for the wadsworth mansion reached crumville on the same train of course the others went down to the depot to meet them and there was a grand jollification lasting several minutes  my belle how you have grown declared laura after the numerous kisses and handshakes had come to an end isnt she growing tall dave  she certainly is returned the brother and what they said was truebelle endicott was now tall and willowy and exceedingly pretty to look atso much so in fact that phil lawrence could hardly take his eyes from her  it was mighty good of your folks to invite me down said the shipowners son when the whole crowd was making its way over to where the wadsworth automobile and sleigh were standing i appreciate it i assure you  oh my you dont suppose we could leave you out phil with belle here returned dave as he gave his chum a nudge in the ribs  good for you dave phil blushed a little and then winked one eye how are matters going between you and jessie  very well  glad to hear it and i suppose roger has that same old eagle eye of his on your sister laura  well you dont find him talking very much to anybody else when laura is around was daves dry comment  oh we had a perfectly splendid journey cried belle endicott and wasnt it the strangest thing that we should run into phil at the junction where we had to change cars to get here  must be some sort of mutual attraction cried laura mischievously and then to hide any possible confusion she added quickly to cora dartmore i hope you enjoyed the trip also  yes i had a splendid time answered the newcomer a girl not quite so tall as belle but almost equally goodlooking you see this is my first trip to the east oh i know i am going to have a perfectly lovely time she added enthusiastically  the young folks piled into the sleigh and automobile and in a very short time arrived at the wadsworth mansion here mrs wadsworth was ready to receive the visitors and her gracious manner made them feel at home immediately  phil as was his custom insisted on rooming with roger and dave while belle endicott and her chum were made comfortable in a room next to those occupied by jessie and laura  i dont know what im going to do with you boys said mrs wadsworth laughingly you always bunk in as thick as fleas  we got used to that at oak hall returned dave besides that the room is a large one with two single beds in it and we can easily put in a cot and so it was settled  my but im mighty glad to be with you two fellows again declared the shipowners son when the youths were left to themselves it seems like a touch of old times  so it does returned roger smiling broadly  from now on i suppose we wont be able to get together as much as we used to said dave so while we are together let us make the most of it  so say we all of us cried phil and roger gaily     chapter x  the big sleighingparty   of course even with so many visitors to entertain dave and roger could not neglect their studies so it was arranged that every day the pair should apply themselves diligently to their books and to what their tutor had to say from eight oclock until twelve then lunch would be had and the young folks could start out to enjoy themselves in one way or another  on one occasion the three boys went hunting with dunston porter in the woods back of crumville they had a most delightful time and brought back quite a bagful of rabbits as well as several squirrels and also a plump partridge the bird being brought down by dave  and it was a fine shot davy remarked his uncle dunston in speaking about the partridge as fine a shot on the wing as i ever saw  crumville boasted of a goodsized pond and from this the snow had been cleared giving the young folks an opportunity for skating which every one of them enjoyed to the utmost they also attended a concert given in the church one evening and even went to a movingpicture show which had recently been opened in the town  the moving pictures interested the two girls from the far west more than anything else for so far they had had little opportunity to take in such a form of entertainment  during those days dave was continually on the watch for some information concerning ward porton but no word of any kind came in and he finally concluded that the rascal had left that vicinity  most likely he thought things were growing too hot for him was phils comment when the boys talked the matter over he probably realized that if he continued to go to the stores and get goods the way he did he would be caught sooner or later  ben basswood often went out with the others pairing off as had been expected by laura with cora dartmore this left belle endicott more or less in phils care for which the shipowners son was grateful  yes my father has brought the enos miniatures here answered ben one day in reply to a question from dave he had them in a safe deposit vault first but he concluded that they would probably be just as safe at our place you know he has a big safe of his own in which he keeps all his real estate documents mr basswoods office was in a wing of his house and all the boys had visited it and knew that it contained a massive steel affair about five feet square and probably four feet deep  they ought to be safe there ben returned dave i dont see what a thief could do with miniatures and i dont believe your fathers office is liable to catch fire  and that safe must be fireproof put in roger  i think it is fireproof returned the real estate dealers son and i guess you are right about thievesthey would rather steal money or jewelry or silverware or something like that every time  used to a life in the open air and to riding and driving the sleighing in and around crumville proved to be a constant delight to belle and cora as a consequence it was arranged by the boys that the whole crowd should go out in a large sleigh to be procured from the local livery stable and to be drawn by four reliable horses  well put a lot of straw in the bottom of the sleigh and make it a sort of strawride declared dave  and just to think it will be moonlight cried his sister wont that be the finest ever  it certainly will be came from jessie her eyes beaming but then she turned suddenly to dave her face clouding a little who is going to driveyou  no were going to have a regular man from the livery stable he answered and then as his sister turned away he added in a low tone i didnt want to spend my time on the horsesi wanted to spend it on you  oh dave murmured the girl and blushed then she gave him a look that meant a great deal  the sleighingparty was to start off about two oclock the next afternoon and did not expect to return to crumville until well towards midnight they were to go to the town of lamont about seventeen miles away a new restaurant had been opened in this town in connection with the hotel and mr and mrs wadsworth had stopped there for a meal and had pronounced it excellent the food being of firstclass quality and an orchestra being present to liven matters up ben had thought at first that he could not accompany the others his father having been taken sick but as mr basswoods illness was not of a serious nature mrs basswood knowing how disappointed the youth would be urged that he go along anyhow  your father is resting quite comfortably she told ben and the doctor says he will be around again inside of a week so you may as well take in this sleighride while you have the chance  but there are those miniatures mother returned ben wasnt father going to let mr wadsworth see them  mr wadsworth is going to have several art critics at his home in a day or two and then your father is to let all of them examine the miniatures carefully to see if he can get an idea of what they are worth but you need not bother your head about that if mr wadsworth sends word that the critics have arrived at his house ill take care of the matter and so this was arranged and ben went off to prepare for the sleighride  at the appointed hour the big sleigh came dashing up to the door of the wadsworth mansion all of the young folks including ben were on hand and ready for the trip each bundled up well for protection against the cold the sun had been shining in the morning but towards noon it had gone under a heavy bank of clouds  looks a little to me like more snow observed dunston porter who was present to see them depart i shouldnt be surprised to see you coming back in the midst of another fall  oh uncle dunston dont say that cried laura we want the moon to shine this evening  well it will shine laura returned the uncle with a wink of the eye it always does shine even when we dont see it and then he dodged when she laughingly picked up a chunk of snow and threw it at him  into the big sleigh piled the girls and the boys quickly followed all the back seats had been removed and they nestled down in the thick straw and covered themselves with numerous robes  look out that you dont jounce off when you go over a bump cried dunston porter to phil and belle who sat at the back of the turnout  oh well hold on dont worry cried phil  im used to hanging on came from the western girl quickly riding in this sleigh wont be half as bad as hanging on to the back of a halfbroken broncho  i guess thats right too answered daves uncle just the same you take care i dont want you young folks to have any accidents on this trip  i trust you all have a good time came benevolently from old caspar potts as he gazed at them and rubbed his hands my my how i used to enjoy sleighing when i was a young man and how many years ago that seems he added with a little sigh  dont stay any later than midnight warned mrs wadsworth  well be back by that time unless something unusual turns up returned dave he turned to the others in the sleigh everybody fixed and ready  all ready came back the answering cry  then were off dave turned to the driver a middleaged colored man let her go wash  yassir responded washington bones with a grin giddap he called to his horses and with a crack of the whip and a grand flourish the turnout left the front of the wadsworth mansion and whirled out on to the broad highway leading to lamont  the four horses were used to working together and they trotted along in fine style causing many a passerby to stop and gaze at the team and the gay load of young people in admiration the horses were well equipped with bells and each of the youths had provided himself with a goodsized horn so that noise was not lacking as they dashed along past the stores and houses of crumville then they came out on the lamont road where the sleighing was almost perfect  i hope we dont have any such adventure as we had at conovers hill remarked jessie to dave while they were spinning on their way  i dont think these livery stable horses will run away he returned they are used every day and that makes them less frisky than our horses which sometimes are in the stable for a week besides that wash bones is one of the most careful drivers around here if he does anything hell let the team hold back on him rather than urge them to do their best  on and on flew the sleigh the young folks chatting gaily and occasionally bursting out into a verse of song  lets give em our old oak hall song cried dave presently  thats it came eagerly from his two chums and a moment later they started up the old school song which was sung to the tune of auld lang syne the girls joining in                oak hall we never shall forget                 no matter where we roam               it is the very best of schools                 to us its just like home               then give three cheers and let them ring                 throughout this world so wide               to let the people know that we                 elect to here abide  say that takes me back to the old days at oak hall remarked roger when the singing had come to an end my but those were the great days  i dont believe well ever see any better roger answered dave  the sleighing party had still three miles to go when suddenly laura uttered a cry  its snowing  so it is burst out belle what a shame  maybe it wont amount to much said ben it often snows just a little you know  the first flakes to fall were large and dropped down lazily from the sky but soon it grew darker and in a short time the snow was coming down so thickly that it almost blotted out the landscape on all sides  some fall this exclaimed phil looks now as if it were going to be a regular storm  o dear and i wanted it to be moonlight tonight wailed laura  dave was peering around and looking anxiously at the heavy leaden sky  if this is going to be a heavy storm maybe it might be as well for us to turn back he announced  turn back came from several of the others  yes  what for dave questioned phil i dont think a little snow is going to hurt us maybe it will help to keep us warm he added with a grin  we dont want to get snowed in phil  oh lets go on interposed roger even if it does keep on snowing it wont get very heavy in the next couple of hours we can hurry up with our dinner at lamont and be home again before it gets very deep  all right im willing if the rest are returned dave who did not wish to throw cold water on their sport lamont it is go ahead wash we want to get there just as soon as possible  on they plunged the snow coming down thicker and thicker every minute then just as the outskirts of the town were gained they heard a curious humming sound  oh dave what is that queried jessie  its the wind coming up he answered listen  all did so and noted that the humming sound was increasing then the wind came tearing through the woods and down the highway with great force sending the snow in driving sheets into their faces  my gracious this looks as if it were going to be a blizzard gasped phil who had started up to see what the sound meant we had better get under some kind of cover just as soon as possible  well be up to dat hotel in anudder minute bawled washington bones to make himself heard above the sudden fury of the elements say dis suah is some snowstom he added  again he cracked his whip and once more the four horses ploughed along as well as they were able they had to face both the wind and the snow and these combined made progress slow by the time the party came into sight of the hotel with the restaurant attached the wind was blowing almost a gale and the snow seemed to be coming down in driving chunks  drive us around to the side porch ordered dave it will be a little more sheltered there  yassir came from the colored driver and soon they had come to a halt at the spot mentioned from under the snow and robes crawled the boys and the girls and lost no time in running into the hotel then the colored man drove the turnout down to the stables  illustration from under the snow and the robes crawled the boys and the girlspage 103  my did you ever see such a storm was rogers comment and how quickly it came up  if it isnt a blizzard it is next door to it returned dave and then he added quickly it looks to me as if we were going to be snowbound     chapter xi  held by the blizzard   snowbound the cry came from several of the party  yes snowbound if this heavy fall continues answered dave just see how the chunks of snow are coming down and how the wind is driving them along  it was certainly an interesting sight and all the young people watched it for some time before they took off their wraps and prepared to sit down to the meal which had been ordered over the telephone before leaving crumville  my just listen to the wind was phils comment youd think it was a regular norwester  if it keeps on it certainly will be a blizzard put in roger in one way we can be glad we are under shelter even though we are a good many miles from home  yes and snow or no snow i move that we sit down to dinner continued phil we cant go back while it is snowing and blowing like this so we might as well make the best of our stay here  after having ordered a meal for the colored man which was served in another part of the hotel dave joined his friends in the restaurant a special table had been placed in a cozy corner and that was decorated with a large bouquet of hothouse flowers with a smaller bouquet at each plate  oh how lovely burst out jessie when she saw the flowers  you folks in the east certainly know how to spread yourselves was cora dartmores comment just look at those beautiful flowers and then at the fierce snowstorm outside  oh let us forget the storm cried laura it will be time enough to think about that when we have to start for home  thats the truth answered her brother gaily everybody fall to and do as much damage to the billoffare as possible and this remark caused a general smile  then the first course was served and soon all of the party were eating and chatting with the greatest of satisfaction  in the meanwhile the blizzardfor such it really wascontinued to increase in violence the wind tore along through the woods and down the streets of the town bringing with it first the heavy chunks of snow and then some hard particles not unlike salt in appearance the fine snow seemed to creep in everywhere and driven by the wind formed drifts which kept increasing in size steadily  after the first course of raw oysters came some cream of celery soup with relishes and then some roast turkey with cranberry sauce and vegetables after that the young folks had various kinds of dessert with hot chocolate and then nuts with raisins  what a grand dinner remarked belle when they were finishing dave you certainly know how to order the good things  oh i had roger and phil to help me on that returned our hero trust them to order up the good things to eat  and trust dave to help us get away with them sang out the senators son gaily  there is only one time when those fellows cant eat retorted dave that is when they are asleep  at a small table not far away from where the young people were seated sat an elderly man and a lady  there is doctor renwick and his wife said laura when the meal was finished they must have been sleighing too i am going to speak to them for dr renwick came from crumville and had often attended the porter family as well as the wadsworths  we are staying here for a few days said mrs renwick to daves sister after they had shaken hands you see the proprietor of this hotel and restaurant is my cousin  oh i didnt know that said laura they certainly have a very nice place here and the dinner we had was just too lovely for anything  are you folks calculating to drive back to crumville now questioned dr renwick  that was our expectation replied dave who had followed his sister but it looks pretty fierce outside doesnt it  i should say so porter just listen to that wind and see how it is driving the snow i shouldnt like to face it for any great distance  the others came up and all the strangers were introduced to the doctor and his wife and then the entire party left the restaurant and entered the parlor of the hotel from the windows of which they could watch the storm  it certainly is fierce remarked phil as they gazed at the furious onslaught of the elements  the wind was blowing as hard as ever rattling the windows and sending the snow against the panes as if it were so much hail it was impossible to see across the street and although lamont boasted of a limited electric light service all the lights upon the street corners were out  this storm is going to break down a lot of the wires announced roger  what do you think about our trying to get back to crumville questioned dave  to tell the truth dave i dont see how we are going to make it you dont want to face that wind do you and going back wed have to head into it nearly all the way  i think ill go outside and have a talk with the driver answered our hero and went out accompanied by roger and ben  id like to get home on account of my fathers being sick announced the real estate dealers son otherwise i would just as lief stay here until tomorrow  thats all right enough for us boys put in roger but how about the girls  we can leave them in mrs renwicks care if we have to announced dave laura and jessie know her very well and i am sure shell be only too glad to play the chaperon shes a very nice lady and the doctor is a very fine man  they found that washington bones had had his supper and had returned to the stable to feed his horses when they questioned the colored man about getting back to crumville he shrugged his shoulders and shook his head  might try it if you say so he said but it aint gwine to be no easy job boss and we may git stuck somewheres so as you caint git to not even a house then we might all be froze to death  what do you think it is wash a blizzard questioned roger  dats jest what dis is boss and my opinion is its gwine to be a heap sight wose before it gits bettah added the driver  i guess youre right there answered dave and thats one reason i think we ought to try to get back to crumville but just the same id hate to get stuck somewhere along the road as he says we boys might be able to get out of it along with wash but we couldnt expect the girls to do any tramping in such deep snow and in such a wind  there was an oldfashioned covered walk from the hotel to the stables so that the boys in going from one place to the other had not had to expose themselves to the elements now to get an idea of how bad the storm was dave walked out as far as the street followed by his chums  great cæsars ghost puffed the senators son as they stood where they could get the full benefit of the storm this is frightful dave why it would be nothing short of suicide to try to go anywhere  iiguess we hhad better ggo in and telephone that we cccant come panted ben and then lost no time in returning to the stable followed by the others  they had been outside less than five minutes yet the fury of the blizzard had nearly taken their breath away  we wont attempt it wash so you can make arrangements to stay here tonight announced dave he turned to his chums come on back to the hotel and we will do what telephoning is necessary  they returned to the parlor and there the situation was explained to the girls and to dr renwick and his wife  oh you mustnt think of trying to get back tonight cried the doctors wife quickly there are plenty of vacant rooms here and ill see to it that my cousin gives you good accommodations  and will you look after the young ladies mrs renwick questioned dave  i certainly will dave she answered graciously dont let that worry you in the least ill be glad to take charge of such a nice family and she smiled sweetly at all the girls  we are going to telephone to crumville and let the folks know how matters stand announced ben and then he and dave hurried to where there was a telephone booth  here however they met with no success so far as getting into communication with their folks at crumville was concerned it took a long time to get central and then it was announced that the storm had taken down all the wires running to crumville and beyond one wire that was down was still connected but try their best neither of the boys was able to understand anything of what was said over it then this line snapped and that ended all efforts to send any messages  i wish they knew we were safe said dave now that they dont know it they may worry thinking we are snowed in somewhere along the road  well weve got to make the best of it answered ben i did hope to speak to mother to ask her how father was and to let her know that we were all right  it looks to me ben as if this blizzard might last for several days or a week  so it does but sometimes these storms clear away almost as rapidly as they come  the two youths returned to the others and announced the failure of their effort to get into communication with crumville this was disheartening to laura and jessie but as it could not be helped the girls said they would make the best of it then laura and dave went off with the doctor and his wife to obtain accommodations for the whole party  it was learned that dr renwick had a fine apartment on the second floor and that there were two rooms adjoining which were vacant these were turned over to the four girls the boys were accommodated with two rooms on the floor above  not quite as good as they might be observed dave when he and his chums inspected their rooms which were directly under the roof of the country hotel but they are much better than nothing and as the sailors say any port in a storm  oh this is plenty good enough returned phil but i am glad the girls are on the floor below those rooms are much better than these  as the boys had no baggage there was nothing for them to arrange in the rooms which had been assigned to them so after a hasty look around they started to go downstairs again to rejoin the girls in the parlor as the boys passed the room next to the one which dave and ben had elected to occupy the door of the apartment was opened on a crack then as the youths left the corridor to descend the stairs the door was opened a little wider and a young man peered out cautiously  well what do you know about that muttered the young man to himself after the four chums had disappeared right here at this hotel and going to occupy the room next to the one ive got could you beat it  the young man was ward porton     chapter xii  tim crapseys plot   who are you talking to port questioned a man who was resting on the bed in the room which ward porton occupied  didnt i tell you not to call me by that name crapsey returned the former movingpicture actor as he closed the door softly and locked it  whats the difference when were alone grumbled the man called crapsey as he shifted himself and rubbed his eyes  it may make a whole lot of difference answered porton ive just made a big discovery  a discovery the man sat up on the edge of the bed discovered how to git hold of some money i hope we need it  you remember my telling you about that fellow who looks like methe fellow named dave porter went on the former movingpicture actor well hes here in this hotel and he and three of his chums have the rooms next to this one  you dont mean it and now tim crapsey showed his interest did they see you  not much and i dont intend that they shall was the decided reply  did you know the other fellows  yes they are the regular bunch porter travels with ive got to keep out of sight of all of them from what they said they are evidently snowbound here on account of this blizzard so there is no telling how long they will stay added the former movingpicture actor in disgust confound the luck i suppose ill have to stay in this room a prisoner and let you get my meals for me  this fellows being here may not be such a bad thing for you remarked tim crapsey maybe you can impersonate him and touch the hotel clerk for a loan of ten or twenty dollars  i am not going to run too many risksnot with so many of those fellows on hand if i had only porter to deal with it might be different returned ward porton just the same im going to keep my eyes open and if i can get the best of him in any way you can bet your boots ill do it  in the meanwhile dave and his chums had rejoined the girls and dr renwick and his wife in the parlor of the hotel and there all made themselves as much at home as possible there was quite a gathering of snowbound people and a good deal of the talk was on the question of how long the blizzard might last  some of the people here are going to try to get over to pepsico said one man that is only a mile and a quarter from here and they are hoping to get the train that goes through that place about one oclock in the morning  the train may be snowbound too returned another and if it is those folks will have their hard tramp to pepsico for nothing  outside it was still snowing and blowing as furiously as ever all the street lights were out and so were the electric lights in the hotel so that the hostelry had to depend on its oldtime lamps for its illumination but the lamps had been discarded only the year before so it was an easy matter to bring them into use again  not to keep the good doctor and his wife up too long laura told mrs renwick that they would retire whenever she felt like it about half past ten goodnights were said and the girls went upstairs with the lady followed presently by the doctor the boys remained below to take another peep out at the storm  its a regular oldfashioned blizzard announced dave  and no telling how long well be stalled here added roger quite an adventure isnt it and he smiled faintly  well we can be thankful that we werent caught somewhere along the road broke in phil  thats it came from ben why if we had been caught in some outoftheway place we might be frozen to death trying to find some shelter  the two rooms which the chums occupied on the third floor of the hotel were connected and before they went to bed the youths all drifted into the one which was to be occupied by dave and ben for here it was slightly warmer than in the other room and the lamp gave a better light it seemed good to be together like this especially on a night when the elements were raging so furiously outside the former school chums talked of many thingsof days at oak hall of bitter rivalries on the diamond the gridiron and on the boating course and of the various friends and enemies they had made  the only one of our enemies who seems to have made a man of himself is gus plum remarked dave he has settled down to business and i understand he is doing very well  well nat poole is doing fairly well returned ben i understand his father owns stock in that bank so theyll probably boost nat along as rapidly as his capabilities will permit  nat was never the enemy that plum and jasniff and merwell were cried phil he was one of the weakminded kind who thought it was smart to follow the others in their doings  this storm is going to interfere with our studies dave announced roger not but what im willing enough to take a few days rest he added with a grin  well have to make up for it somehow roger returned our hero weve got to pass that examination with flying colors  im afraid this storm will interfere with the art critics who were to look at those miniatures put in ben oh dear i wish we knew just what those little paintings were worth  i hope they prove to be worth at least a hundred thousand dollars said phil that will be a nice sum of money for you folks ben  right you are answered the son of the real estate dealer  the youths were tremendously interested in the miniatures and a discussion of them ensued which lasted the best part of half an hour ben described some of the pictures as well as he was able and told of how they were packed and of how they had been placed in the basswood safe waiting for the critics that mr wadsworth had promised to bring from the city to his home to inspect them  well i suppose we might as well turn in said roger presently as he gave a yawn i must confess im tired  come ahead im willing announced phil and then he and the senators son retired to the next room  o pshaw what do you suppose i did exclaimed dave to ben while the pair were undressing i left my overcoat and my cap on the rack in the lower hallway i should have brought them up here  i did the same thing answered his chum i guess theyll be safe enough all the folks in this hotel seem to be pretty nice people  i dont suppose there are any blizzard pictures among those miniatures ben observed dave with a laugh just before turning in  there is a picture of one army officer in a big shaggy uniform which looks as if it might be worn because of cold weather answered ben and then as the miniatures were very close to his heart the youth began to talk about them again  this discussion lasted for another quarter of an hour after which the chums retired and were soon deep in the land of slumber  although none of our friends knew it every word of their conversation had been listened to eagerly by ward porton and the man with him they had noted carefully all that had been said about the basswood fortune and about the miniatures having been placed in the real estate dealers safe awaiting inspection by the critics who were to visit mr wadsworth at his mansion both had noted also what dave had said about leaving his overcoat and his cap on the rack on the lower floor of the hotel  a hundred thousand dollars worth of miniatures murmured tim crapsey after the sounds in the adjoining room had ceased say thats some fortune sure enough  but pictures humph what good are they returned ward porton in disgust id rather have my fortune in something a little more usable  oh pictures are not so bad and miniatures can be handled very easily answered tim crapsey his small eyes began to twinkle jest you let me git my hands on em and ill show you wot i kin do i know a fence in new york wholl take pictures jest as quick as anything else  and what would he do with them after he got them questioned ward porton curiously  oh hed ship em round to different places after he got em doctored up and git rid of em somehow to art dealers and collectors of course he might not be able to git full value for em but if theyre worth a hundred thousand dollars he might git ten or twenty thousand and that aint bad is it and tim crapsey looked at ward porton suggestively  easy enough to talk but how are you going to get your hands on those miniatures demanded the former movingpicture actor speaking however in a low tone so that none of those in the next room might hear him  i jest got an idee croaked tim crapsey he was a man who consumed a large amount of liquor and his voice showed it didnt you hear wot that chap said about leaving his coat and hat downstairs if you could fool them shopkeepers the way you did then if you had that fellers hat and coat and maybe fixed up a bit to look like that photograph you had of him you might be able to go to the basswood house and fool the folks there  i dont quite understand  i mean this way we could go to crumville and you could watch your chance and when the coast was clear you could git a rig and drive over to the basswood house and go in quite excited like and tell em that this mr wadsworth was awantin to see them miniatures right awaythat a very celebrated art critic had called on him but couldnt stay long wanted to ketch a train and all that you could tell em that mr wadsworth had sent you to git the miniatures and that he had said that he would return em jest as soon as the critic had looked em over do you ketch the idee and tim crapsey looked narrowly at his companion  it might work although id be running a big risk said ward porton slowly yet his eyes gleamed in satisfaction over the thought but you forgot one thing tim we are snowbound here and we cant get away any quicker than they can  thats where youre mistaken porti mean mr jones crapsey checked himself hastily i heard some folks downstairs talkin about going over to pepsico to ketch the one oclock train that goes through crumville and if we could ketch it wed be in that town long before mornin we could fix up some story about the others bein left behind here and dave porter comin home alone they cant send any telephone message for the wires are down and i dont know of any telegraph office here where they could send a message that way  if we were going to try it wed have to hustle announced ward porton and its a fierce risk let me tell you thatfirst trying to get to the railroad station and then trying to bluff mr and mrs basswood into thinking i am dave porter you must remember that since i got those things in porters name at those stores the whole crowd are on their guard  well you cant gain anything in this world without takin chances retorted tim crapsey if i looked like that feller id take the chance in a minute why jest see what we could make out of it if you can git your hands on those miniatures ill take care of the rest of it and we can split fiftyfifty on what we git out of the deal  ward porton mused for a moment while tim crapsey eyed him closely then the former movingpicture actor leaped softly to his feet  ill do it tim he cried in a low voice come aheadlet us get out of this hotel just as soon as possible and on the way downstairs ill see if i cant lift that cap and overcoat     chapter xiii  what washington bones had to tell   dave was the first of the four chums to awaken in the morning he glanced toward the window to find it covered with frost and snow thus leaving the room almost dark the wind was still blowing furiously and the room was quite cold without disturbing ben our hero looked at his watch and found that it was almost eight oclock he leaped up and commenced to dress  hello getting up already came sleepily from his roommate as ben stretched himself and rubbed his eyes it must be pretty early  thats where youre mistaken ben was daves answer in a few minutes more it will be eight oclock  you dont say so how dark it is but i suppose its the frost on the window makes that went on the real estate dealers son as he too got up phew but its some cold isnt it and he started to dress without delay  the noise the two boys made in moving around the room aroused the others and soon they too were getting up  wow talk about greenlands icy mountains commented phil with a shiver howd you like to go outside roger just as you are and have a snowball fight  nothing doing retorted the senators son who was getting into his clothing just as rapidly as possible say fellows but this surely is some snowstorm he continued as he walked to the window and scraped some frost from a pane of glass so that he could catch a glimpse of what was outside its still snowing to beat the band he announced  and listen to the wind broke in ben why sometimes it fairly rocks the building  doesnt look much as if we were going to get back today said dave i suppose the roads are practically impassable  they must be if it snowed all night answered ben let us go down and take a look around  i wonder if the girls are up yet questioned roger  it wont make much difference whether they are or not returned dave if we cant get away from here they may as well sleep as long as they please there certainly isnt much to do in this small hotel  the youths were soon washed and dressed and then all trooped below they passed the rooms occupied by the girls and by dr renwick and his wife but heard no sounds coming from within  they are taking advantage of the storm to have a good rest commented phil he gave a yawn i almost wish i had remained in bed myself we wont have a thing to do here  i noticed a bowling alley next door phil announced roger if we cant do anything else today we can bowl a few games that will be fine exercise  do the girls know about bowling questioned ben  not very much answered dave laura has bowled a few games i believe but it will be fun to teach them if we dont find anything better to do  the boys walked through the small lobby of the hotel and into the smoking room here several men were congregated all talking about the storm and the prospects of getting away  the snow is nearly two feet deep on the level said one man but the wind has carried it in all directions so that while the road is almost bare in some spots there are drifts six and eight feet high in others  looks as if we were snowed in good and proper returned another man i wanted to get to one of those stores across the way and i had about all i could do to make it in one place i got into snow up to my waist and it was all i could do to get out of it  doesnt look like much of a chance to get away from here observed roger  we are booked to stay right where we are declared phil so we might as well make the best of it  let us go out to the barn and see what wash bones has to say suggested dave he has probably been watching the storm and knows just how things are on the road  all right returned ben but i am going to put on my cap and overcoat before i go it must be pretty cold out there even though they do keep the doors shut  yes ill get my cap and overcoat too said dave phil and roger had taken their things up to the third floor the night before and now had their overcoats over their arms  the large rack in the hallway of the hotel was well filled with garments of various kinds so that ben had to make quite a search before he found his own things in the meantime dave was also hunting but without success  thats mighty queer remarked the latter i dont seem to see my cap or my overcoat anywhere  oh it must be there dave cried his chum just take another look maybe the overcoat has gotten folded under another  both youths made a thorough search which lasted so long that phil and roger came into the hallway to ascertain what was keeping them  dave cant find his overcoat or his cap explained ben weve hunted everywhere for them  didnt you take them upstairs last night questioned phil  no i left them on this rack and ben left his things here too replied dave i cant understand it at all and he looked worried  maybe laura saw them and took them upstairs thinking they wouldnt be safe here suggested roger  i hardly think that roger however as the coat and cap are not here maybe id better ask her  another search for the missing things followed dave looking through the parlor and the other rooms on the ground floor of the hotel and even peeping into the restaurant where a number of folks were at breakfast then he went upstairs and knocked softly on the door of the room which laura and jessie were occupying  who is it asked his sister in a somewhat sleepy tone of voice  its i laura answered her brother i want to know if you brought my cap and overcoat upstairs last night  why no dave i didnt touch them what is the mattercant you find them  no and ive hunted high and low he returned i dont suppose any of the other girls or the doctor touched them  i am quite sure they did not laura came to the door and peeped out at him are you boys all up already  yes we went downstairs a little while ago we were going out to the barn and thats why i wanted my overcoat and cap they seem to be gone and i dont know what to make of it and now daves face showed increased anxiety  whats the trouble came from jessie and then laura closed the door again dave heard some conversation between all of the girls and then between laura and mrs renwick then his sister came to the door once more  none of us touched your cap or overcoat dave she said isnt it queer do you suppose they have been stolen  i hope not laura im going down and see the hotel proprietor about it  the proprietor of the hostelry was not on hand but his son a young fellow of about daves age was behind the desk and he listened with interest to what our hero had to say then he too instituted a search for the missing things  i cant understand this any more than you can he announced after this additional search had proved a failure i didnt know we had any thieves around here are you sure you left the coat and cap on this rack  yes i am positive announced dave  i saw him do it when i placed my own things on the same rack declared ben  but you found your coat and cap all right  yes  its mighty queer declared the young clerk shaking his head i guess id better tell my father about this  the hotel proprietor was called and he at once instituted a number of inquiries concerning the missing things but all these proved of no avail no one had taken daves wearing apparel and none of the hired help had seen any one else take the things or wear them  you should have taken your things up to your room last night declared the hotel proprietor during the course of the search its a bad idea to leave things on a rack like this with so many strangers coming and going all the time  he agreed to lend dave a coat and a hat and donning these the youth walked through the little shelter leading to the stables accompanied by his chums  if those things are not recovered i think you can hold the hotel man responsible remarked roger  just what i think put in ben that overcoat was a pretty nice one dave and the cap was a peach  ill see what can be done in case the things dont turn up returned our hero  they found washington bones down among the stablemen taking care of his horses  well wash what are the prospects for getting away this morning questioned roger  aint no prospects so far as i kin see declared the colored driver this suah am one terrible stom i neber seen the like befo aroun heah  then you dont think were going to get back to crumville today questioned ben  nosir why if we was to try it wed suah git stuck befo we got out ob dis town some ob de drifts is right to de top of de fust story ob de houses washington bones looked questioningly at dave how did you like your trip outside las night he queried must ha been some walkin trough sech deep snow  my trip outside questioned dave with a puzzled look what do you mean wash i didnt go out last night  you didnt exclaimed the colored driver in wonder didnt i see you leavin de hotel las night bout half pas levin or a little later  you certainly did not i was in bed and sound asleep by half past eleven answered dave  well now dont dat beat all cried the colored man his eyes rolling in wonder i went outside jest to take a las look aroun befo turning in and i seen a young fellow and a man leavin de hotel dey come right pas where a lantern was hung up on the porch and when dat light struck on de young fellows face i thought suah as youre bon it was you why he looked like you and he had on de same kind of cap and overcoat dat you was awearin yesteday i see youve got on something different today  a fellow who looked like me and who had on my cap and my overcoat ejaculated dave he turned to his chums what do you make of that  maybe it was ward porton cried roger  if it was he must have run away and taken daves cap and overcoat with him added ben     chapter xiv  movements of the enemy   as my readers doubtless surmise it was ward porton who had made off with daves overcoat and cap  leaving the room which they occupied on the third floor locked the young movingpicture actor and his disreputable companion had stolen down the two flights of stairs leading to the lower hallway fortunately for them no one had been present and it had been comparatively easy for porton to find daves things and put them on tim crapsey already wore his own overcoat and hat  we might as well provide ourselves with rubbers while we are at it remarked crapsey as his gaze fell upon a number of such footwear resting near the rack and thereupon each donned a pair of rubbers that fitted him  thus equipped they had stolen out of the hotel through a side hallway without any one in the building being aware of their departure  were going to have a fight of it to get to the railroad station muttered ward porton as the fury of the storm struck both of them  its lucky i know the way croaked tim crapsey and then as they passed over the porch in the light of the lantern by which washington bones had seen porton the man went on say whats the matter with us stoppin at some drinkin place and gittin a little liquor  not now interposed his companion hastily we want to make our getaway without being seen if we possibly can  oh nobody will know us grumbled crapsey who had a great fondness for liquor and the stuff may prove a lifesaver if we git stuck some place in the snow  the realization that they might become snowbound on the way to pepsico made porton pause and in the end he agreed to visit a drinking place several blocks away which by the light shining dimly through the window they could see was still open  but now look here tim youre not going to overdo it said the former movingpicture actor warningly if we are going to pull this stunt off you are going to keep perfectly sober its one drink and no more  but im goin to git a flask to take along pleaded the man  you can do that but i give you fair warning that youve got to go slow in using the stuff otherwise we are going to part company in such a game as we are trying to put over a man has got to have his wits about him  having procured a drink and also a package of cigarettes and a flask of liquor the two set off through the storm for the railroad station a mile and a quarter away it was a hard and tiresome journey and more than once they had to stop to rest and figure out where they were twice tim crapsey insisted upon it that he must have a bracer from the flask  im froze through and through he declared  well im half frozen myself retorted ward porton and when he saw the man drinking he could not resist the temptation to take some of the liquor himself  well be in a fine pickle if we get to pepsico and then find that the train isnt coming through remarked the former movingpicture actor when about threequarters of the journey had been covered and they were resting in the shelter of a roadside barn  thats a chance weve got to take returned his companion but i dont think the train will be stormbound most of the tracks through here are on an embankment and the wind would keep them pretty clear  it was after one oclock when the pair finally gained the little railroad station at pepsico they found over a dozen men and several women present all resting in the tiny waitingroom trusting that the train would soon put in an appearance  the wires are down so they cant tell exactly where the train is said one of the men in reply to a question from porton they are hoping though that it isnt many miles away  from time to time one of the wouldbe passengers would go out on the tracks to look and listen and at last one of these announced that a train was on the way  but i cant tell whether its a passenger train or a freight he said  lets git on it even if its a freight said tim crapsey to ward porton shell take us to crumville jest as well  all right provided we can get aboard  slowly the train puffed in and proved to be a freight on the rear however was a passenger car hooked on at the last station  illustration slowly the train puffed in and proved to be a freight page 136  the regular passenger train is stalled in the cut beyond breckford announced the conductor of the freight and theres no telling when shell get out if you folks want to risk getting through get aboard and at this invitation all those waiting at the station lost no time in boarding the mixed train then with a great deal of puffing and blowing the locomotive moved slowly away from pepsico dragging the long line of cars some full and some empty behind it  long before crumville was reached it became a question as to whether the train would get through or not the snow was coming down as thickly as ever and the wind whistled with increased violence  i dont believe well get much farther than crumville announced the conductor when he came through to collect tickets we should have passed at least two trains coming the other way but nothing has come along and that would seem to show that the line is blocked ahead of us  as a matter of fact the mixed train did not get even as far as daves home town running was all right so long as the tracks were up on the embankment but as soon as they reached the level of the surrounding country the snow became so deep that several times the train had to be backed up so that a fresh start might be made then when they came to a cut not over three feet deep just on the outskirts of the town the engineer found it utterly impossible to get any farther  well have to have a snowplough to get us out he declared or otherwise well have to remain here until the storm clears away  by listening to the conversation of some of the people in the car porton and crapsey learned that it was only a short distance to the town and they followed several men and a woman when they left the train to finish the journey on foot  i know where we are now said porton presently as he and his companion struck a welldefined road leading past the wadsworth jewelry works well be right in crumville in a little while more  ward porton knew very well that he must not show himself in crumville any more than was necessary consequently as soon as they came within sight of the town proper he suggested that they look around for some place where they might remain until daybreak  right you are answered tim crapsey and a little later coming to a large barn they tried the door and finding it unlocked entered and proceeded to make themselves comfortable in some hay using several horse blankets for coverings  here both of them being thoroughly exhausted fell sound asleep and did not awaken until it was daylight  now weve got to lay our plans with great care announced ward porton we cant go at this in any haphazard way even though it may prove comparatively easy to get our hands on those miniatures it will be another story to get away with them in such a storm as this with the railroad and every other means of communication tied up  this storm is jest the thing thats goin to help us answered crapsey with all the telegraph and telephone wires down the authorities wont be able to send out any alarm and with the snow so deep if we git any kind of a start at all it will be next to impossible for em to follow us up  a discussion of ways and means followed that lasted the best part of an hour then with money provided by porton and with many an admonition that he must not for the present drink another drop tim crapsey was allowed to depart for crumville  and you be very careful of how you go at things warned porton  tim crapsey had a delicate mission to perform first of all he was to size up matters around the homes of the wadsworths and the basswoods and then he was to do what he could to hire a cutter and a fast horse at the local livery stable this done he was to procure something to eat both for himself and for his companion  as time went by ward porton on the alert for the possible appearance of the owner of the barn became more and more anxious and twice he went out in the roadway to see if his companion was anywhere in sight  it would be just like him to go off and get full of liquor muttered the young man with a scowl i really ought to part company with him but when he is perfectly sober he certainly is a slick one he continued meditatively  to pass the time the young man made a thorough search of the overcoat which he had stolen from dave he had already discovered a fine pair of gloves and had worn them now in an inner pocket he located a cardcase containing half a dozen addresses some postage stamps and some of daves visiting cards there were also two cards which had been blank and on each of these written in daves bold hand was the following                     signature of                    david porter                     crumville  hello whats this mused the former movingpicture actor as he gazed at the written cards then suddenly his face brightened oh i see its one of those cards that i heard aboutthe kind he has been distributing among the storekeepers in an effort to catch me say one of these may come in handy when i go for those miniatures he continued  at last he heard a noise outside and looking in that direction saw tim crapsey approaching in a somewhat dilapidated cutter drawn however by a powerfullooking bay horse  had a fierce time gittin this horse announced the man as he came to a halt beside the barn the livery stable man didnt want to let him go out and i had to tell him a long yarn about somebody bein sick and my havin to git a doctor and i had to offer him double price too and at his own ruse the man chuckled hoarsely  he had brought with him some sandwiches and doughnuts and also a bottle of hot coffee and on these both made a somewhat limited breakfast the man washing the meal down with another drink from his flask  i kept my wordi didnt drink a drop when i was in town he croaked but say this is mighty dry work  you keep a clear head on your shoulders tim warned porton some day drink is going to land you in jail or in the grave  not much snorted the man i know when to stop but porton knew that this was not true  another conference was held and crapsey told of having taken a look around both at the wadsworth place and the basswood home  there is no one at the basswood place but mr and mrs basswood and i understand the man is sick in bed he said all the telephone wires are out of commission but to make sure that the basswoods couldnt telephone i cut the wire that runs into his real estate officeand i also cut the wire up at the wadsworth house  good for you tim returned ward porton and then he told of having found the two cards each containing daves signature  thats fine cried the man that ought to help you a great deal when you ask for the miniatures  i hope it does answered ward porton thoughtfully now let us go the sooner we get at this affair the better and then both left the barn entered the cutter and drove rather slowly in the direction of the basswood home     chapter xv  the return to crumville   if ward porton got my cap and overcoat he must have been staying at this hotel said dave after the announcement made by ben let us interview the proprietor without delay  he and his chums hurried back into the hotel and there met not only the proprietor but also his son  see here have you anybody staying here who looks like me demanded our hero of both of them  sure weve got a fellow who looks like you declared the hotelkeepers son before his father could speak its a mr jones he has a room up on the third floor hes here with an older man named brown  i wish you would take me up to their room cried dave quickly  why whats the matter now  i want to find out whether that fellow is still here if he is i want him placed under arrest and then dave related a few of the particulars concerning ward porton and his doings  that certainly is a queer story remarked the hotel proprietor ill go upstairs with you  he led the way followed by dave and his chums the youths were much astonished to see him halt at the door next to their own  they dont seem to be there or otherwise they are sleeping pretty soundly remarked the hotel proprietor after he had knocked on the door several times  i guess you had better unlock the door suggested dave i rather think you will find the room empty  a key was secured from one of the maids and the door was opened the proprietor gave one look into the apartment  gone he exclaimed say do you think they have run away  thats just exactly what i do think answered dave and that fellow who looks like me most likely took my cap and overcoat  and you say his name is porton he signed our register as william jones  heres his hat and coat announced phil opening the door to a closet pretty poor clothing he left you in return for yours dave continued the shipowners son after an inspection  the hotel proprietor was very wrathy declaring that porton and his companion owed him for three days board  theyre swindlers thats what they are he cried just wait till i land on them ill put them in jail sure  id willingly give you that board money just to get my hands on ward porton announced dave he turned to his chums this sure is the limit first he goes to the stores and gets a lot of things in my name and then he steals my hat and overcoat right from under my nose  yes and that isnt the worst of it declared roger there is no telling where he has gone and even if you knew in this awful storm it would be next to impossible to follow him  all went below and there they continued to discuss the situation in the midst of the talk the girls came down accompanied by dr renwick and his wife  oh dave you dont mean to tell me that that horrid ward porton has been at more of his tricks cried laura  isnt it perfectly dreadful put in jessie and to think he was right in this hotel with us and we never knew it  thats what makes me so angry announced dave if only i had clapped my eyes on him he added regretfully  well theres no use of crying over spilt milk declared roger he is gone and so are daves overcoat and his cap and that is all there is to it  speaking of milk puts me in mind of breakfast put in phil now that the others are downstairs dont you think we had better have something to eat  all were agreeable and soon they were seated at a large table in the dining room in company with the doctor and mrs renwick here while eating their breakfast they discussed the situation from every possible standpoint but without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion  porton must have seen us when we came up to the rooms said dave to his chums he probably heard me speak about leaving my cap and overcoat downstairs and he just took a fiendish delight in walking off with them and leaving his old duds behind oh he certainly is a peach  had there been the slightest letup in the blizzard dave and his chums would have gone out on a hunt around the town for porton and his unknown companion but with the wind blowing almost a hurricane and the snow coming down as thickly as ever dr renwick told them that they had better remain indoors  it isnt likely that they stayed anywhere around here fearing detection said the physician they probably put a good distance between themselves and this hotel and to go out in such a storm as this might make some of you sick  oh well what of that we have a doctor handy answered dave whimsically just the same i guess we had better remain where we are he added with a deep sigh  it was not until the following morning that the wind died down and the snow ceased to fall in the meantime the young folks did what they could to entertain themselves the girls playing on the piano in the hotel parlor and the boys later on taking them to the bowling alleys next door and initiating them into the mysteries of the game dave was a good bowler and so was roger each being able occasionally to make a score of two hundred but ben and phil could not do much better than one hundred while none of the girls got over eighty  now that the snow has stopped falling i suppose we had better try to get back to crumville said laura to her brother  yes we ought to get back put in jessie i suppose our folks are dreadfully worried about us  it was too bad that you couldnt send some sort of word came from belle if you could only do that we could stay here until the roads were well broken  in the west we dont pretend to go out in such a storm remarked cora dartmore but of course our distances are greater and we have so few landmarks that it is an easy thing to get lost  i dont think we are going to get away from here in any great hurry replied dave it is true the snow has stopped coming down and the sun is breaking through the clouds but i am quite sure the drifts on the road between here and crumville are much higher than we can manage even with the powerful horses we have well have to wait until the roads are more or less broken  our hero was right about not getting away they went down to the stables and interviewed washington bones and several of the other drivers present and all agreed that it would not be possible to get very far beyond the town limits this news made the young folks chafe considerably but there was nothing to be done so for another day they had to content themselves as best they could during that time the boys did their best to send some message to crumville but without success for all of the telephone and telegraph wires were still down and nothing had been done to mend them  the next morning however things looked a little brighter the weather continued to improve and several horse teams as well as an ox team came through on the road from the direction of crumville  the road aint none too good so far as i could see announced one of the drivers to dave but if you take your time and watch where youre going maybe you can get through  oh let us try it anyway cried laura who was present if we find we cant make it we can come back here or else stop at some other place along the way  it was finally agreed that they should make the effort and they started about ten oclock the sun was shining with dazzling brilliancy on the snow and with no wind blowing it was considerably warmer than it had been on the journey to lamont all of the young folks were in good humor dave for the time being dismissing from his mind the trouble occasioned by the loss of his cap and overcoat  as they drove away from the town they could see the effects of the great wind in some spots the road was almost bare of snow while in others there were drifts ten and twelve feet in height to drive through such drifts was of course impossible so they had to make long detours through the surrounding fields at such places the horses of course had to be driven with extra care for no one wanted the sleigh to land in some hole or be overturned occasionally when the turnout was on a dangerous slant the girls would shriek and the boys would hold their breath but each time washington bones was equal to the occasion and brought them through safely  by noon they had covered five miles and then they stopped to rest at a village where all procured a good hot dinner then they went forward once again this time through a long patch of timber  if we gits through dat well be all right declared the colored driver  the snow lay deep in the woods but the horses proved equal to the occasion and at last the timber was left behind and they came out on a ridge road where the snow was only a few inches in depth here they were able to make fairly good time so that three oclock found them almost within sight of the outskirts of crumville  were going to make it easily declared ben but he proved to be mistaken for a little distance farther on they ran again into the deep snow and had to pass around one drift after another finally going clear across several fields to another highway as a result it was well after dark before they gained the road leading past the wadsworth jewelry works  well this looks like home anyway declared dave to jessie as he nodded in the direction of her fathers establishment  yes and im glad of it returned the girl gracious it seems to me that we have been on the road for a week  we can be thankful that we got through so easily jessie wash is certainly some driver  on account of another big drift they had to pass to still another road and this brought them finally to the street leading past the basswood home  if its all the same to you folks ill get off at my place announced ben i suppose my father and mother are worrying about me  go ahead ben returned dave and then he added quickly i trust you find your father is better  with a flourish washington bones drew up the panting horses in front of the basswood place just as ben leaped from the sleigh the front door of the house opened and mrs basswood appeared  ben ben is that you cried the youths parent quickly  yes mother he answered cheerily dont worry i am all right  forgetful that she had on only thin shoes and no covering over her head or shoulders mrs basswood ran directly down to the big sleigh she glanced over the occupants and her eyes fastened instantly on dave  dave have you been with ben since you went away she queried you havent been to our house  why certainly i havent been here mrs basswood he returned promptly  then its true its true she wailed wringing her hands  whats true mother demanded the son  the miniatures theyre gone they have been stolen that young man who looks like dave was here and took them away     chapter xvi  how the miniatures disappeared   the miniatures are gone came from ben basswood in astonishment  yes ben gone and the mother wrung her hands in despair  do you mean to say ward porton dared to come here and impersonate me and get them cried dave  it must have been that fellow dave he looked exactly like you that is why i just asked you if you had been to our house  i have been with ben and the others since we went on our sleighride said our hero this is terrible how did it happen  come into the house and ill tell you all about it answered mrs basswood her face was drawn with anxiety and all could see that she was suffering keenly  and how is father questioned ben as the party trooped up the piazza steps and into the house  he isnt so well ben as he was before you went away oh dear and to think how easily i was duped  dave had told washington bones to wait for them and entering the parlor of the basswood home the others listened to what the lady of the house had to tell  your father had just had another bad turn and the nurse and i were doing what we could for him when the doorbell rang she began i went downstairs and there stood somebody that i thought was dave i asked him into the house and he at once wanted to know how mr basswood was getting along  when was this questioned ben  this was two days ago and just about noon time  two days ago repeated roger then porton must have come here right after leaving the hotel in lamont how ever did he get here  maybe he took that train that got through from pepsico answered phil you remember we heard that quite a few people made that train  let us hear about the miniatures broke in ben impatiently  well he came in as i said and asked about mr basswoods health then he told me that he was in a great hurrythat a certain famous art critic had called on mr wadsworth and having heard about the enos miniatures was very anxious to see them he told me that the art critic had thought of coming over with him but mr wadsworth had said that it might disturb mr basswood too much to have the miniatures examined in our house the art critic did not want to become snowbound in crumville so he was only going to stay until the four oclock afternoon train the young man said mr wadsworth wanted to know if we would allow him to take the miniatures over to the wadsworth house and that he would bring them back safely either that evening or the next morning  oh mother didnt you suspect it might be a trick questioned ben anxiously you knew how this ward porton has been impersonating dave  yes yes ben i know answered mrs basswood again wringing her hands and i should have been more careful but you know i was very much upset on account of the bad turn your father had had then too the young man threw me off my guard by asking me if i had one of those cards which dave had distributed among the storekeepersthe one with his autograph on it  i said no but told him i was very well acquainted with his handwriting then he said he would write out a card for me adding with a laugh that he wanted me to be sure he was really dave he drew a blank card out of his pocket and turned to a table to write on it and then handed it to me here is the card now and going to the mantelpiece the lady of the house produced it  one of the cards that i left in the overcoat that was stolen exclaimed dave he didnt write this at all mrs basswood that rascal stole my overcoat and some of these cards were in it he simply pretended to write on it  well i was sure it was your handwriting and that made me feel easy about the fellow being you  but you knew i was with ben and the others on the sleighride broke in dave  oh i forgot to state that when he came in he explained that you were all stormbound at the hotel in lamont and that as the telephone and telegraph wires were all down he had managed to get to pepsico and reach crumville on a freight train doing this so that we and the wadsworths would not worry thinking the sleighingparty had been lost somewhere on the road in this awful blizzard  and then you gave him the miniatures questioned ben  i did oh ben i know now how very foolish it was but i was so upset at first i thought to ask your father about it but i was afraid that to disturb him would make him feel worse and i knew he was bad enough already then too i knew that mr wadsworth was expecting some art critics to look at the miniatures so i concluded it must be all right i have always known the combination of your fathers safe so it was an easy matter for me to open it and get the miniatures out i told the young man to be careful of them and he told me not to worrythat the miniatures would be perfectly safe and that mr wadsworth had promised to get the critic to set a fair value on each of them  was this ward porton alone asked laura the girls of course had listened with as much interest as the boys to what the lady of the house had to relate  no he came in a cutter driven by a man who was so bundled up because of the cold that i could not make out who he was as soon as i gave him the cases containing the miniatures the young man hurried off in the cutter stating that the sooner the critic had a chance to see the paintings the better  and what happened next questioned dave as mrs basswood paused in her recital  i went back to assist a nurse who had come in and all that night we had our hands full with my husband we had to call in the doctor and he was really not out of danger until noon of the next day i had wanted to tell him about sending the miniatures over to the wadsworth house but he was in no condition to be told anything so i kept silent  but didnt you get worried when noon came and the supposed dave didnt return with them questioned the son  yes as soon as the doctor said that your father was out of danger i began to worry over the miniatures i waited until the middle of the afternoon and then although it was snowing and blowing something awful i hailed a passing manold joe pattersonand asked him if he would go on an errand to the wadsworth house he said he would try to make it for a dollar and so i wrote a short note to mrs wadsworth knowing that she must be at home even though her husband and dave might be away  old patterson delivered this message and mrs wadsworth sent back word that she had not seen anything of dave since he had gone away on the sleighride nor had she seen anything of the miniatures she added that her husband had gone to the jewelry works but that she would send one of the hired men after him at once and acquaint him with the situation  what did you do then went on ben  i really didnt know what to do your father was so ill that the nurse and i had to give him every attention i was waiting for the doctor to come again but he could not get here on account of the snowdrifts mr wadsworth put in an appearance about two hours later and then i told him just what i have told you he declared at once that it must be a trick stating that dave had not been near the house since going away with all of you young folks mr wadsworth was quite put out and wanted to know how it was that i had not been able to detect the deception  well i must say commenced ben and then stopped short for he could see how his mother was suffering  oh yes ben i know what you were going to say she broke in quickly having known dave so many years i should have discovered the deception but as i said before i was terribly worked up over your fathers condition then too the young man came in bundled up in an overcoat and a cap that looked exactly like those dave wears  they were mine that fellow stole them from me interrupted our hero bitterly  not only that but he had a tippet placed over his head and around his neck and he spoke in a very hoarse voice stating that he had caught a terrible cold while on the sleighride and while coming back to crumville on the freight train he spoke about mr basswoods real estate business and about mr and mrs wadsworth and jessie and so many other things that we are familiar with that i was completely deceived then too his turning over that written card to me also threw me off my guard but i know i was very foolish very foolish indeed and mrs basswoods lips trembled and she wrung her hands once again  what did mr wadsworth do questioned dave in the midst of rather an awkward pause he agreed with ben that mrs basswood should have recognized ward porton as an imposter but he did not want to say anything that might add to the ladys misery  he said he would set the authorities at work and see if he could not find porton and his confederate i was so bewildered that iwell i might as well admit iti told him that i couldnt understand how i had been deceived and that maybe dave had gotten the miniatures after all  oh mrs basswood you didnt really mean that cried our hero  i was so bewildered i didnt know what i meant dave that young man did look so very much like you thats the reason when you folks drove up to the house i ran out to ask if you had really been here or not  have you heard anything of this ward porton since asked roger  i havent heard anything whether mr wadsworth has learned anything or not i do not know for he has not been here and the storm has been so awful with all the telephone wires down that i could not send for news  does father know about this now questioned ben  no ben i have not had the courage to tell him answered the mother i told the doctor and he advised that i say nothing for the present  i dont think id tell him said dave i think the best thing we can do is to try to follow porton and this fellow with him and get back the miniatures then it will be time enough to tell mr basswood about the affair  as soon as they had entered the parlor the lady of the house had shut the door so that none of the conversation might reach the sick chamber overhead in reply to numerous questions mrs basswood gave all the details as to how the rascally porton had been able to gain possession of the miniatures  i think ill hurry up and get home declared dave presently i want to hear what mr wadsworth has to say and also find out what he and my folks have done towards getting on the track of porton and his confederate  thats the talk exclaimed roger say but this is the worst yet isnt it he turned to the lady of the house i am awfully sorry for you mrs basswood  i guess we are all sorry broke in our hero quickly  oh i hope they catch that porton and put him in prison cried jessie  that is where he belongs answered dave soberly     chapter xvii  a vain search   to find out what mr wadsworth as well as daves father and his uncle had done ben accompanied the other young folks to the jewelry manufacturers mansion they found that mr wadsworth had gone to business but the other men were present and were much interested in what dave and his chums had to relate  weve done all we could to get the authorities on the trail of ward porton announced daves father but we have been much hindered on account of this awful blizzard the telegraph and telephone wires are down in all directions so it has been practically impossible to send word any great distance  with such a storm it may be possible that porton and his confederate are still in crumville suggested roger  i hardly think that said dunston porter more than likely they did everything they could to put distance between themselves and this town after they got their hands on the miniatures  i suppose you know we found out that portons confederate managed to get a horse and cutter from brysons livery stable said daves father  no we didnt know that cried ben  well its true the confederate who gave his name as frank carson said he wanted the turnout to go for a doctor he said he had been sent by mr jamison the minister of course it was all a trick and mr jamison knew absolutely nothing about it  did they return the horse and cutter  they did not and bryson is mourning the loss of a good horse the cutter he says did not amount to so much he would not have let the animal go out only the fellow begged so hard stating that it was practically a case of life or deathand he offered to pay double money for the horses use  were they seen at all questioned ben  oh yes a number of people who were stormbound saw them pass down the street and stop at your house then others saw the cutter turn in the direction of hacklebury  of course you tried to follow queried dave  i did that answered dunston porter it was tough work getting through as far as the mill town but i managed it and made all sorts of inquiries two people had seen the cutter pass the mills but no one could give me any definite information as to which way it headed after that you see it was growing dark by that time and the snow was coming down so thickly that it was next to impossible to see any great distance in any direction  well we know they went as far as hacklebury and thats something returned phil hopefully  yes but it isnt much came in a rather hopeless tone from ben im afraid theyve got away and well never see them again or the miniatures either  oh dont say that ben cried laura sympathetically pictures you know are not like money porton and that rascal with him will have no easy time disposing of the miniatures  ill tell you what they may do burst out jessie suddenly they may go to some big city and then send you word that they will return the miniatures provided you will pay them a certain amount of money for so doing  say i believe thats just what they will do cried dave jessie i think youve struck the nail right on the head and he looked at the girl admiringly  i hope they do thatif we dont catch them returned ben if those miniatures are worth anything like a hundred thousand dollars i guess my dad would be glad enough to give five or ten thousand dollars to get them back  i wouldnt give up the hunt yet ben urged roger just as soon as this awful storm is over id let the authorities in all the big cities as well as the little ones know about the theft and then they can be on the watch for porton and his confederate by the way i wonder who the confederate can be  im sure i havent the least idea answered the real estate dealers son  with the disappearance of the basswood fortune in their minds neither the young folks nor the grown folks could talk about much else laura and jessie told the latters mother how they had fallen in with dr renwick and his wife and how the pair had looked after the girls during their stay at the lamont hotel  it was nice of mrs renwick to do that said the lady of the mansion but it is no more than i would expect from her she is a very estimable woman  it was rather hard for dave and roger to settle down to their studies on the following morning but there was nothing they could do to help along the search for those who had taken the miniatures and as both youths were anxious to make up for lost time they applied themselves as diligently as possible  mr ramsdell had been away but the tutor came back that afternoon and the two students put in a full day over their books leaving laura jessie and phil to look after the visitors from the west  the blizzard had now ceased entirely and by the end of the week all the roads in the vicinity of crumville were fairly well broken and some of the telegraph and telephone lines had been repaired the newspapers came in from the larger cities and it was found that the blizzard had covered a wide area of the country extending practically from the mississippi river to the atlantic seaboard  its given ward porton and his confederate a dandy chance to get away was rogers comment  youre right roger answered dave and so far it would seem that they have left no trace behind them  from ben it was learned that mr basswood was slowly improving in health he had asked about the miniatures and the art critics who were to have visited crumville on the invitation of mr wadsworth  we couldnt keep the news from him any longer said ben when he asked about the pictures my mother broke down and had to confess that she had let porton take them thinking he was dave of course father was very much disturbed and the doctor had to pay an extra visit and give him something to keep him quiet i told him that all of us were doing everything we possibly could to get on the track of the thieves and now he is resting in the hope that sooner or later the miniatures will be recovered  the loss of the miniatures had taken a good deal of the fun out of ben and when the young folks stopping at the wadsworth mansion went out sleighing again and for some fun skating he begged to be excused  i wouldnt take the loss too hard ben said dave quietly remember if the worse comes to the worst you are just as well off as you were before you heard of this enos fortune  that is true dave but it makes me mad to think that we had such a fortune as that right in our hands and then let it get away from us  i suppose your mother feels dreadfully about it  she certainly does dave why she isnt herself at all sometimes i think that her worrying will bring on a regular fit of sickness she of course thinks that it is entirely her fault that the miniatures are gone  youll have to do all you can to cheer her up  oh im doing that and i do what i can to cheer up my father too just the same im mighty blue myself at times and the real estate dealers son heaved a deep sigh  at last came the day when belle and cora must return to their homes in the west on the evening before jessie and laura gave a little party in their honor which was attended by over a score of the boys and girls of crumville the young people played games sang and danced to their hearts content and mrs wadsworth saw to it that ample refreshments were served to all  illustration the young people played games sang and danced to their hearts contentpage 169  oh ive had a perfectly lovely time declared belle when she and the others were on their way to the depot  and so have i had a lovely time added cora dartmore but im so sorry your friend lost that fortune she added ben had said goodbye over the telephone the wire of which was once more in working order  if you ever do hear of those miniatures you must let us know went on belle  well be sure to do that answered laura and then the train came in and with a final handshake all around and with several kisses exchanged between the girls belle and cora climbed on board dave and phil assisting them with their suitcases  im sorry im not going with you cried the shipowners son but ive promised dave and roger to stay a few days longer  be sure to send us a letter as soon as you get back home cried jessie  and then the train rolled out of the station and the visitors from the west were gone  on the night before phil took his departure the three chums had what they called a talkfest in daves room they spoke about many thingsof how they had first gone to oak hall and of various adventures that had occurred since that time  the oak hall boys are becoming scattered said phil i dont suppose theyll ever all get together again  oh well have to meet at some future graduation exercises at the hall cried dave i cant think of letting such fellows as shadow hamilton buster beggs and sam day drop  right you are came from roger if i can get there at all you can count on my going back to oak hall whenever there are any commencement exercises  i half wish i was going into this civil engineering business with you two fellows continued phil but im afraid im not cut out for that sort of thing i love the sea and everything connected with ships  that shows youre a chip of the old block announced dave clapping his chum on the shoulder you take after your father phil and i dont think you could do better than to follow him in his shipping business  if i do follow him in that business i tell you what youve got to do announced the shipowners son some time youve both got to take a nice big cruise with me  that would suit me down to the shoetips returned roger  it would be fine phil answered dave but just at present roger and i have got to bone to beat the band if we want to pass that examination you must remember that being away from home on account of that blizzard put us behind quite a good deal  well you wont have me to worry you after tonight grinned the chum starting tomorrow morning you and roger can put in twentyfour hours a day over your studies as far as i am concerned  wow listen to that hes as considerate as old job haskers used to be exclaimed the senators son and then picking up a pillow he shied it at phils head  another pillow was sent at roger in return and in a moment a socalled oak hall pillow fight was in full progress in the room pillows blankets books and various other objects flying in all directions then phil got roger down on one of the beds and was promptly hauled off by dave and in a moment more the three youths were rolling over and over on the floor  suddenly there sounded a knock on the door  hello who is that cried dave and at once the three youths scrambled to their feet readjusting their clothing as they did so  oh dave such a noise came from his sister what in the world are you doing in there  we are only bidding phil goodbye answered the brother sweetly     chapter xviii  the civil engineering examination   as the days went by and dave and roger continued to prepare themselves for the examination which was rapidly approaching the authorities did all they could to locate ward porton and his confederate diligent inquiries were made concerning the identity of the man who had occupied the room at lamont with the former movingpicture actor and it was finally discovered that he was tim crapsey a fellow already wanted by the police for several crimes  its queer that a fellow like porton should throw in his fortunes with a man like crapsey was rogers comment from all accounts crapsey is a thoroughly goodfornothing fellow with a great liking for strong drink  that shows portons real disposition roger answered dave if he were any kind of a cleanminded or decent fellow he wouldnt want to put up with such a vile fellow as this tim crapsey is represented by the police to be  if crapsey is already known to the police they ought to be able to locate him sooner or later  those slick criminals have a way all their own for keeping out of sight of the police dave paused for a moment do you know ive been thinking of something maybe this fellow crapsey simply used porton as a tool  i dont quite understand dave  why in this way when they heard about the miniatures and crapsey heard how much porton looked like me and how intimate i and the wadsworths were with the basswoods it may have been crapsey who concocted the scheme for getting possession of the miniatures and if he did that it is more than likely that he will be the one to dispose of the pictures or send in an offer to return them for a certain amount  you mean and cut ward porton out of the deal questioned the senators son quickly  he may not cut porton out entirely but the chances are that hell let porton have as little of the returns as possible a professional criminal like this crapsey isnt going to let an amateur like porton in on the ground floor if he can help it  maybe hell do porton out of it entirely wouldnt that make the movingpicture actor mad and roger grinned over the thought  it is no more than porton would deserve answered our hero just the same i hope the authorities capture them both and return the miniatures to mr basswood  two days before the time when dave and roger were to undergo the much talkedof examination in civil engineering there came news from a country town fifteen miles beyond hacklebury a livery stableman there sent in word that he was boarding a horse which he thought might be the one stolen from mr bryson the crumville liveryman at once notified ben and the local police and the boy and an officer accompanied him to centertown mr bryson at once recognized the horse as his own and wanted to know how the centertown liveryman had become possessed of the animal  he was left here by a man i think was this tim crapsey the paper spoke about announced the livery stable keeper he said he was on the road to the next town but that the storm was too much for him and that he wanted to leave the animal with me for a few days or a week he said he was rather short of cash and asked me to lend him ten dollars which of course i did as i thought the horse was ample security went on the livery stableman bitterly  was the fellow alone was the question which ben put  he came in alone but i think after he left the stable he was joined by another fellow down on the corner  the centertown liverystable keeper had not noticed where crapsey and his companion had gone but thought they had made their way to the railroad station it was learned that a train bound for new york city had left centertown about an hour later all came to the conclusion that ward porton and tim crapsey had taken this the train had been stalled some hours along the road but had finally reached the grand central terminal of the metropolis  well this proves one thingthat porton and crapsey got as far as new york city with the miniatures said dave when he heard the news  yes and new york is such a large place with so many people in it that it will be almost impossible for the authorities to trace them there  thats it rogerespecially when you remember that this happened some time ago so that by now the thieves may be in chicago san francisco or in london paris or some other faraway place  at last came the time when dave and roger were to go in for the examination which meant so much to them they had worked hard and mr ramsdell had assisted them in every way possible yet both were rather doubtful over the outcome of the affair  it isnt going to be like the examinations at oak hall said our hero mr ramsdell admitted that it would be stiff from the word go  i know that answered the senators son it seems that several years ago they were a little lax and as a consequence some fellows slipped through that had no right to pass now they have jacked the examiners up so that the test is likely to be fierce  oh dave what are you going to do if you dont pass cried jessie when he was ready to leave home  if i dont pass now jessie ill simply go at my studies again and keep at them until i do pass he answered  the examination which was held in the city was divided into two parts one taking place from ten to twelve in the morning and the other from two to five in the afternoon there were about thirty students present and as far as possible each was separated from any friends he might have on hand so that dave sat on one side of the hall in which the examination occurred and the senators son sat on the other  well how did you make out questioned roger of dave when the two went out for their midday lunch  i dont know exactly roger was the reply i think however that i answered at least seventy per cent of the questions correctly how about yourself  well im hoping that i got seventy per cent of them right returned the senators son but maybe i didnt get above fifty or sixty per cent  the afternoon questions seemed to be much harder than those of the morning the students were given until five oclock to pass in their afternoon papers and never did dave and roger work harder than they did during the final hour one question in particular bothered our hero a great deal but at almost the last minute the answer to it came like an inspiration and he dashed it down this question proved a poser for the senators son and he passed in his paper without attempting to put down a solution  following that examination dave returned to crumville roger journeyed to washington where his folks were staying at a leading hotel congress being in session and senator morr occupying his place in the senate  there was a week of anxious waiting and then one day dave received an officiallooking envelope which made his heart beat rapidly  what is it dave cried his sister when she saw him with the letter in his hand is it your civil engineering report  i think it is laura he answered  oh dave how i hope youve passed  so do i put in jessie  dave could not give an answer to this because for the moment his heart seemed to be in his throat passing to the desk in the library he slit open the envelope and took out the sheet which it contained a single glance at it and he gave a shout of triumph  ive passed he cried hurrah  oh good came simultaneously from his sister and jessie and then they crowded closer to look at the sheet of paper  does it say what percentage you got continued his sister  why as near as i can make out ive got a standing of ninetytwo per cent he announced with pardonable pride isnt that fine  its the finest ever dave said his sister fondly as she threw her arms around his neck  oh dave its just glorious exclaimed jessie her eyes beaming and when he caught her and held her tight for a moment she offered no resistance oh wont your father and your uncle be proud when they hear of this  im going to tell them right now he cried and ran off to spread the good news  my boy im proud of you said his father proud of you and he clapped dave affectionately on the shoulder  i didnt expect anything different from our davy put in uncle dunston i knew hed pass well now youve passed i wish you every success in the profession you have chosen  oh im not a fullfledged civil engineer yet uncle dunston broke in dave quickly ive got a whole lot to learn yet remember this is only my first examination ive got to study a whole lot more and have a whole lot of practice too before i can graduate as a real civil engineer  dave lost no time in sending a telegram to roger in return a few hours later came word from the senators son that he too had passed  hurrah cried dave once more and then could not resist the temptation to grab jessie about the waist and start on a mad dance through the library the hallway the diningroom and the living room of the mansion mrs wadsworth looked on and smiled indulgently  i suppose your heart is as light as a feather now dave she said when the impromptu whirl came to an end  indeed it is mrs wadsworth he answered passing that examination has lifted a tremendous weight from my shoulders  of course mr ramsdell was greatly pleased to think that both of his pupils had passed  now i can write to my friends of the mentor construction company and see if they can give dave and roger an opening he said they promised it to me some time ago in case the boys passed and he set about sending off a letter without delay     chapter xix  off for texas   glorious news  oh dave have you heard from mr ramsdell cried his sister laura  yes here is a letter and it enclosed another from the mentor construction company they are going to give me an opening with that portion of the concern that is now operating in texas building railroad bridges  oh dave then you will really have to go away down there burst out jessie her face falling a trifle its a dreadfully long way off  well its what i expected he answered a fellow cant expect to become a civil engineer and work in his own backyard and he grinned a trifle this letter from mr ramsdell states that roger will be given an opening also  with you of course queried laura  he doesnt state that but he knew we wanted to stick together so i suppose its all right  when do you have to start questioned jessie  just as soon as we can get readyaccording to mr ramsdells letter he says he is also sending word to roger  as was to be expected the tidings quite excited our hero now that he had passed the preliminary examination and was to go out for actual field practice he felt that he was really and truly on his way to becoming a civil engineer it was the first step towards the realization of a dream that had been his for some time  daves father and his uncle as well as mr and mrs wadsworth were greatly interested in the news  there is one thing about it dave said his parent i have made a number of inquiries and have learned that the mentor construction company is one of the largest and finest in this country they employ a number of firstclass engineers so it is likely that you will receive the very best of instruction and i sincerely hope that you will make the best of your opportunities  i am going to do my level best dad he returned earnestly i think im a mighty lucky boy he added with a smile  i think you owe mr ramsdell a good deal said his uncle dunston of course we have paid him for his services but that isnt everything  i know it dave returned and im either going to thank him in person or else send him the nicest letter that i can write  now that he was really going to leave home mrs wadsworth as well as laura and jessie took it upon their shoulders to see that dave should be properly taken care of so far as wearing apparel went  but oh dave its awful to think of your going so far away said jessie one day when the two were alone in the library the house will be dreadfully lonely after you are gone  it wont be much different from when i was at oak hall jessie he answered  oh yes it will be dave texas is a long way off and my father says the construction work that the mentor company is doing is close to the mexican border what if you should have trouble with some of those awful mexican bandits and the girl shuddered  i dont expect any trouble of that kind practically all the fighting that has been going on has been on mexican soil on the other side of the rio grande as i understand it the nearest point that the mentor construction company reaches to mexico is some miles from the border  well thats close enough with so much fighting going on jessie pouted i dont want any of those awful mexican revolutionists to fire at you  dont worry jessie dave answered and then caught her by both hands and drew her closer youre going to write to me regularly arent you he continued earnestly  of course dave and dont you forget to answer every letter she replied quickly  oh ill do that never fear  and do you really think you are going to enjoy becoming a civil engineer  im positive of it jessie the more i see of the profession the more i am in love with it its a wonderful thing just think of being able to plan out a great big bridge across a broad river or some wonderful dam or a tall skyscraper or an elevated railroad or a tunnel under a gigantic mountain or a tube under some river or  oh my gracious me dave are you going to do all those wonderful things gasped the girl her eyes opening widely  i dont expect ill ever have the chance to do all those things jessie but im going to try my best to do some of them of course you must remember that at the present time civil engineering is divided into a great many branches now for instance i didnt mention anything about mining engineering and thats a wonderful profession in itself  oh dave its wonderfulsimply wonderful cried the girl and you are going to be a wonderful mani know it and she looked earnestly into his eyes  if i ever do get to be a wonderful man its going to be on your account jessie he returned in a low voice you have been my inspiration dont forget that and he drew her closer than before  oh dave  its true jessie and i only hope that ill make goodand that too before i am very much older then i think you already know what i am going to do  what she whispered and dropped her eyes  i am going to ask your folks for your hand in marriage he continued firmly reading his answer in her face  word had come in from roger that he too was getting ready to go to texas and that both of the youths were to work together as had been anticipated as the senators son was in washington it was arranged that dave was to join him in the capitol city and then the two were to journey to texas  ben had heard about daves proposed departure for the south and he came over several times to see his former oak hall chum before the latter left home  any news regarding the miniatures questioned dave during the last of these visits  not much answered the real estate dealers son the police thought they had one or two clues but they have all turned out to be false they arrested one fellow in pittsburgh thinking he was tim crapsey but he turned out to be somebody else  then they havent any word at all about ward porton  no that rascal seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth  how is your father getting along ben  he isnt doing so well dave this loss of the miniatures was a terrible blow to him you see the real estate business lately has not been quite as good as it might be my father went into several pretty heavy investments and he needed a little more money to help him through so when he got word about this fortune in pictures he at once thought that he could sell some of the miniatures and use the proceeds in his real estate deals now that end of the business is at a standstill  is your father actually suffering for the want of some cash asked our hero quickly if he is i think my father or my uncle dunston can help him out  your father has already promised to assist him and so has mr wadsworth dave but that isnt the thing you know my father is an independent sort of man and it worries him to think that he cant stand entirely on his own feet in his real estate transactions of course if he were well enough to be around i suppose he could adjust matters without any special assistance but its hard lines when things go wrong and you are flat on your back in bed  yes i can understand that and it must worry your mother too  oh it does ma isnt the same woman she is awfully pale and quite thin the doctor told her not to worry so or shed be down on her back too  well youll have to do what you can to cheer up both of them dave drew a long breath i do wish somebody would catch those two rascals not only on your account but on my account also id like to settle matters with porton for having impersonated me at those stores and for taking my cap and overcoat  weve offered a reward of five thousand dollars for the return of the miniatures and another thousand each for the capture of the thieves announced ben that ought to be a strong inducement for the detectives to do all they possibly can  we thought you might possibly get an offer from porton or crapsey or both of them to return the miniatures for a certain amount went on dave but you say no such offer has come in  no  would your father consider it if it did come in  i dont know what he would do dave of course hed hate to give up money to a thief but just the same hed hate it worse if he never got the miniatures back  at last came the time for dave to leave home his trunk had been packed and shipped on ahead there was still considerable snow on the ground so he was taken to the depot in the big wadsworth sleigh the girls and his father accompanying him  goodbye davy my boy cried his uncle dunston when he was ready to leave the house now i expect you to give a good account of yourself while with that construction company  ill do what i can he answered  and do keep away from the mexicans added mrs wadsworth with a sigh  you trust david to do the right thing came from old caspar potts his mellow eyes beaming brightly david is all right hes my boy and im proud of him and he nodded his head over and over again  for the girls the drive to the depot was all too short laura had so many things to say to her brother that she hardly knew what to speak of first as for poor jessie she felt so bad she could scarcely speak and when she looked at dave there were unbidden tears in her eyes  now dont look at it that way david whispered when he caught sight of the tears ill be back again before a great while  oh dave iicacant help it she murmured iithink sosomuch ofofyou and then for the moment she hid her face on his shoulder  mr porter had a few words of advice to give and he had hardly finished when the train rolled into the station then dave shook hands with his father and kissed each of the girls and climbed on board  goodbye my son called mr porter  goodbye dad take care of yourself while im gone he shouted back goodbye laura goodbye jessie  goodbye dave returned the sister waving her hand  jessie tried to speak but could not and so she too waved a farewell  then the train rolled from the crumville station slowly gathering speed and finally disappearing in the distance  at last our hero was off to become a fullfledged civil engineer     chapter xx  in new york city   dave porter  buster beggs cried our hero his face lighting up where in the world did you come from  just got off the accommodation coming the other way announced joseph beggs otherwise known as buster a fat youth who had long been one of daves oak hall classmates  are you alone questioned our hero he had just stepped from the local train to change to the express for new york city and he had fairly run into buster who was standing on the platform flanked by several suitcases  no im not alone answered the fat youth shadow hamilton and luke watson are with me  you dont say so and our heros face showed his pleasure are you bound for new york he questioned quickly  yes we are going to take the express  fine i am going there myself  got a seat in the parlor car  yes number twelve car two  isnt that wonderful we have eleven thirteen and fourteen answered buster beggs  hello there dave porter shouted another youth as he stepped out of the waitingroom of the depot how are you anyway and he came up swinging a banjocase from his right hand to his left so that he might shake hands luke watson had always been one of the favorite musicians at oak hall playing the banjo and the guitar very nicely and singing well  mighty glad to see you luke cried dave and wrung the extended hand with such vigor that the former musician of oak hall winced then dave looked over the others shoulder and saw a third lad approachinga youth who was as thin as he was tall how is our little boy shadow today he continued as maurice hamilton came closer  great scott am i blind or is it really dave porter burst out shadow hamilton  no youre not blind shadow and its really yours truly laughed dave and then as another handshake followed he continued what are you going down to new york city for to pick up some new stories  pick up stories queried the former story teller of oak hall in perplexity i dont have to pick them up i have  about fourteen million stories in pickle broke in buster beggs  fourteen million snorted luke watson you had better say about fourteen shadow tells the same stories over and over again  say that puts me in mind of a story cried the youth mentioned his face lighting up once on a time there was a  oh my shadow are you going to start right away demanded dave with a broad grin on his face cant you give a fellow a chance to catch his breath this is a great surprisemeeting you three on my way to the city and to think we are going to be together in one of the parlor cars too  oh you cant lose the oak hall boys cried buster say let me tell you something he went on luke has written a song about oak hall that is about the finest thing i ever heard  it ought to be if it mentions us answered dave with a boldness that took away much of the conceit  say you havent let me tell that story interrupted shadow with a disconcerted look on his thin face now as i was saying there was once a  not now shadow  you can tell it on the way to new york  provided the conductor will give you written permission  not much returned the wouldbe storyteller if i cant tell that story now im going to be mum forever he suddenly looked at dave what is taking you to new york he inquired  im on my way to texas answered dave and then told his former classmates of how he and roger had passed the preliminary examination as civil engineers and of how they were now going to take up field work in the lone star state  say thats great exclaimed buster in admiration i wish i was going to do something like that  so do i added luke while shadow nodded in assent  the other lads had many questions to ask and in return told dave much about themselves in the midst of the conversation the express train for the metropolis rolled in and the four youths lost no time in clambering aboard they found their seats with ease and quickly settled themselves  thats a fierce loss that the basswoods sustained remarked luke i read all about it in the newspapers that fellow ward porton must be a peach  i should say he was a lemon so far as dave was concerned said buster with a slow wink of his eye  speaking of peaches puts me in mind of another story cried shadow a man had a tree in his garden and  oh shadow why this infliction  have we really got to listen  how much will you pay us if we keep still until you have finished  yes youve got to listen and i wont pay you a cent for it either retorted the wouldbe storyteller this is a short one a man had a fruittree in his garden and he told a friend of his that he got three kinds of fruit from it his friend didnt believe it so he told his friend why it was dead easy i went out in the garden to pick an apple i picked one and then i picked a pair one was no good but another was a peach  wow listen to that  shadow must have had a peach of a time getting up that story commented luke evidently feeling himself justified  good thing there are not a pair of them came from dave  such stories are the fruits of idleness was added by buster solemnly  oh dont you poke fun at that joke retorted shadow its a good deal better than any you could get up  dave learned that luke watsons folks were now living in new york city and that luke had invited buster and shadow to spend a week with him  its too bad you cant stop off at least for a day or two said luke to dave it would suit me down to the ground to have you join us  and id like firstrate to do it luke answered our hero but i promised to be in washington by tomorrow and that means that ive got to take the midnight train from new york city  well well get down to new york by three oclock this afternoon that will give us nine hours in which to have a good time youve got to come up to our house for dinner continued luke and so it was arranged  i was wondering what i would do with myself this evening said our hero i dont mind going around the city in the daylight but after it is dark it is rather hard for a stranger to put in his time unless he wants to go to some kind of show  we might all go to a movingpicture show after dinner suggested buster ill blow you to front seats he added generously  youll have to make it a seat farther back than that for me put in shadow a front seat at a movingpicture show is no good and at this there was a general snicker  well see about the show after we have had dinner said luke  the time on the train was spent in talk about oak hall and their numerous classmates many of them now well scattered throughout the states  polly vane has gone into business so i hear announced luke hes in real estate and in spite of the fact that hes a regular dude they tell me he is doing very well  well polly ought to do well answered dave who had not forgotten that the student who acted so very girlishly had at graduation stood as high in his percentage as our hero himself had done  and they say chip macklin is doing pretty well too put in buster referring to a small lad who had once been a toady to gus plum the hall bully  well plum is doing well returned dave im glad he reformed evidently there was much better stuff in him than there was in jasniff and merwell  oh jasniff and merwell were thoroughly bad eggs announced luke ill never forget dave how jasniff once tried to brain you with an indian club  say speaking about bad eggs puts me in mind of another story cried shadow a lady went into a store and asked the storekeepers clerk how much the eggs were the clerknow dont interrupt me because this isnt a very long story pleaded the wouldbe story teller the clerk was only a small boy and he hadnt been in the business very long so he told the lady the really fresh eggs are fifty cents and the almost fresh eggs are forty cents and those that aint so fresh are thirtyfive cents and the rotten eggs are thirty cents  oh shadow what a story  havent you got any fresher than that  you cant make anybody believe any such yarn as that  that story is absolutely true returned the story teller soberly if you dont believe it you come down to the town of necopopec maine and on the principal street of the town ill show you the town pump where that boy used to get a drink three times a day and at this sally there was a general laugh  at last the train rolled into the grand central terminal at fortysecond street new york city and alighting the lads made their way through the spacious depot to the crowded thoroughfare beyond here taxicabs were numerous and the youths piled into one leaving the driver to look after their suitcases daves trunk had been checked through to washington  lukes family lived in the vicinity of central park and it did not take the chums long to reach the home here they were greeted by mrs watson lukes father being away on business then luke took the lads up to his own room where all proceeded to make themselves at home  at a little after five mr watson came in to greet them and about an hour later all sat down to a sumptuous dinner to which it is needless to say each of the boys applied himself diligently  i see by the papers that they are showing a very fine war spectacle at one of the photoplay houses announced luke how would you fellows like to go and see it  this was agreeable to all and a little later the chums left the watson house to go to the theater which was about ten blocks farther downtown  if we get there by halfpast seven we can take in the first show of the evening announced luke that will give us a chance to do some other things before it is time for dave to catch his train  the war spectacle proved very entertaining to all the youths and they were rather sorry when it came to an end then buster proposed that they walk down the great white way as a certain portion of broadway has been designated  the boys had been walking for the best part of half an hour taking in various sights including the wonderfully illuminated signs when suddenly as they passed through a rather dense crowd shadow plucked dave by the arm  what is it questioned our hero quickly for he saw that the former storyteller of oak hall was much excited  that fellow we just passed dave cried shadow  what of him  why he looked just like you  you dont mean it gasped dave and came to a sudden halt if he looked like me it must have been ward porton     chapter xxi  dave in washington   ward porton exclaimed the other youths in a chorus  let us go after him went on dave shadow which way did he go  come on ill show you answered the storyteller and led the way through the crowd as well as he could  as already mentioned the crowd at this particular spot on the great white way was dense and the chums had all they could do to force their way along often elbowing people in a way that was far from polite presently they gained a street corner where the pedestrians were being held up by the traffic flowing the other way  there he is exclaimed shadow suddenly pointing with his hand  looking in the direction indicated dave saw a wellknown form it was indeed ward porton still wearing the cap and overcoat he had stolen from our hero  hi there porton stop cried dave and made a dash for the rascal  as his hand fell on portons arm the other swung around in a startled way then as he caught sight of dave and his friends he gave a sudden duck and crowded in between several ladies standing in front of him the next instant he was dashing out into the street in the midst of a perfect maze of automobiles and wagons  illustration the next instant he was dashing out into the streetpage 202  im going after him cried dave to his chums and did his best to follow but an automobile got in his way and then a large express wagon and before our hero could get around these porton had gained the opposite sidewalk and was darting through the crowd with great rapidity paying scant attention to those he met and hurling one little girl off her feet and into the gutter  stop whats the matter here cried a voice to dave and the next moment a policeman came up beside him  that fellow ahead i want to catch him burst out our hero hes a thief  where  there he goes straight into the crowd answered dave and then hurried on once more with his chums trailing behind him  the chase so suddenly taken up did not however prove long by the time dave and his friends reached the next corner of the crowded thoroughfare ward porton had disappeared once more and none of the youths could tell what direction he had taken  i dont know what youre going to do dave said luke sympathetically he may have gone ahead and then again he may have turned to the right or to the left  i dont believe youll be able to locate him in such a crowd as this put in buster what a shame that you werent able to get your hands on him  i did have one hand on him but he slipped away like a greased pig announced dave dolefully  say speaking about greased pigs puts me in mind of a story put in shadow once there were two boys and then as his chums gave him a sudden cold look he continued oh pshaw whats the use of trying to tell a story just now i know dave would rather find this fellow porton  youre right there shadow answered our hero quickly id rather get my hands on him than listen to a thousand stories  dave was unwilling to let the chase end there so he and his friends spent the remainder of the evening walking up and down broadway and traversing several blocks of the side streets in the vicinity where ward porton had disappeared but it was all of no avail the rascal had made good his escape then all walked around to the nearest police station and told the authorities of the affair so that the detectives of the city might be on the watch for the criminal  his chums insisted upon seeing dave off on his journey to washington and before going to the pennsylvania railroad station on seventh avenue the youths treated themselves to a lunch during the meal shadow was allowed to tell several of his best stories and luke was called on to hum over the song he had composed in honor of their days at oak hall  thats a fine song luke and you ought to have it published declared dave heartily i believe every lad who ever went to oak hall would want a copy of it  it may be mentioned here that later on luke watson did have the composition brought out by a metropolitan music publisher he dedicated it to the senior class of which he had been a member and the song sold very well  dave had already secured his berth on the train so that when his friends left him he lost no time in retiring but the novelty of the journey and his thoughts concerning ward porton kept him awake for some time finally however he went sound asleep and did not awaken until some time after the capitol city was reached  senator morr and his family were staying at the new willard hotel in washington and dave soon found a street car that passed the door of that place when he entered the hotel he found roger in the lobby waiting for him  i thought youd come right up cried the senators son i told the folks id meet you of course you havent had any breakfast the folks will be down in a little while and then well all go to breakfast together  roger was much interested to learn that dave had met three of their old chums and wanted to know all that had been said and done the fact that our hero had also seen ward porton was a surprise  what a shame you didnt capture him dave maybe you might have got on the track of that basswood fortune  just what i was thinking roger i did my best but you know what a new york crowd is porton slipped through it and disappeared almost like magic  senator morr and his wife greeted dave warmly the four had breakfast in a private diningroom and during the course of the meal the senator had much to say regarding the departure of his son and dave for texas  i know one or two of the men connected with the mentor construction company said the senator they are very fine fellows and i think they will see to it that you are treated rightly  dad of course has some influence with them broke in roger being a senator you know  i dont use my influence that way roger answered the father shortly you must not expect special favors because i happen to be a united states senator i expect you to make your way on your own merit  and thats what im going to do answered the son promptly  i do hope both of you boys keep out of trouble said mrs morr you are going close to the border of mexico and there has been fighting going on along that border for many months  we are not going down there to get into any fights answered dave we are going down there to attend strictly to business if the mexicans will only leave us alone well leave them alone  dave and roger had at first thought to go to texas by the way of new orleans and houston but after some thought they decided to take the journey by the way of st louis kansas city and san antonio their train was to leave on the following morning so that the two youths had a whole day practically to themselves  now i am in washington id like to take a look around said dave  i knew youd like to do that so i got everything ready beforehand announced his chum well spend today in sightseeing  they visited the capitol and the white house and numerous other buildings and almost before they were aware it was evening then mrs morr insisted upon it that her son retire early knowing what a hard journey was before him  the senators son had received word that the mentor construction company had opened a temporary office at san antonio and the two youths were to report there before proceeding farther the engineering corps to which they had been assigned was on the point of moving from one place to another and they were to get definite instructions at san antonio regarding their further movements  well goodbye and good luck to you said the senator who came down to the depot with them to see them off  goodbye dad answered roger shaking hands warmly dave too shook hands with his chums father  then in a moment more the two youths were off on their long journey to texas  this kind of traveling is rather different from what the pioneers put up with remarked roger as the two settled themselves in their comfortable seats they having a whole section of the sleeper to themselves think of what it must have been to travel thousands of miles in a boomer wagon behind a team of mules or oxen  yes roger and think of being on the lookout constantly for unfriendly indians and wild beasts added dave ill tell you when you come to consider the luxuries we enjoy these days we have much to be thankful for  the days run was a pleasant one and the youths enjoyed it greatly they spent the time in chatting about the prospects and in gazing at the swiftlymoving panorama to be seen from the car window  its a pity we have to sleep when there is so much to see was daves comment as after having passed through cincinnati it grew time to retire id like very much to see what this section of the country looks like  the following morning found them crossing the mississippi river they passed through st louis and then the train headed for kansas city where they were to change for fort worth and san antonio  the train for san antonio proved to be much less crowded than the other had been as before the youths had a section to themselves and none of the sections near them was occupied but when on the following day the train stopped at a way station several passengers got aboard including a man who took the section opposite to that occupied by our friends  this man was a tall heavyset and redfaced individual having reddish hair and a heavy reddish mustache he looked the youths over rather coldly and then throwing himself down in his seat proceeded to read a newspaper  doesnt look like a very friendly fellow whispered roger to dave i was hoping we might meet somebody who would warm up a little and tell us something about this part of the country  youve got to go slow in making friends out in a strange place like this answered dave  oh i dont know about that dave was the quick reply my father tells me that folks in the west and southwest are usually very friendly we found them so on our way to star ranch  the boys continued to talk of the prospects ahead and during the conversation the mentor construction company was mentioned several times then dave noticed that the burly man opposite had dropped his newspaper and was looking at them curiously finally the man arose and stepped across the aisle  did i hear you young fellows speaking about the mentor construction company he asked not unpleasantly  you did answered dave  are you connected with that concern went on the man  we are going to work for them answered roger we have just been appointed to the engineering department  you dont say cried the man in surprise im with that company myself my name is william jarvey what is yours  the boys told him and all shook hands then as roger crossed over to sit down beside dave the man sank down in the seat opposite     chapter xxii  in texas at last   so you are going to join our engineering department eh queried william jarvey do you know anybody in that department  we dont know any one down here answered dave we are utter strangers we obtained our positions through a mr ramsdell who was our tutor  oh i see the man had been looking rather sharply at dave may i ask where you come from  we come from new england i live in a town called crumville my friend here is the son of united states senator morr  oh indeed william jarvey showed increased interest the son of a united states senator eh well that ought to help you a great deal the mentor construction company often has to ask the government for favors you know and he laughed lightly  im not going to trade on the fact that my father is a united states senator remarked roger somewhat shortly i am going to make my own way  and i guess you will you look like a pretty bright young man returned william jarvey hastily  are you a civil engineer questioned dave  oh no no such luck for me i am connected with the bookkeeping and the blueprint department i wish i were a firstclass civil engineer i might be earning a much larger salary and the man drew down his mouth as he spoke evidently he was a fellow who was not at all satisfied with his position in life  we are to report to a mr perry watson at san antonio explained roger he is to tell us where to go and what to do  perry watson eh and the man scowled and showed his teeth in an unpleasant manner  whats the matterdont you like mr watson asked dave  not much very few of the men do hes terribly sharp on watching everything a man does  i sincerely hope we dont have any trouble with him was rogers comment wed like to start right you know  well youll have to watch yourselves pretty closely announced william jarvey  the talk then became general and the burly man told the youths much about the work being done by the mentor construction company it seemed that there were four gangs in the field two operating south of san antonio and the others to the westward  its more than likely youll be sent to the west he said i think the gangs in the south have all the helpers they need i am going west myself so if you are sent that way perhaps well see more of each other  perhaps answered dave he was not particularly elated over the thought for there was something about william jarvey which did not appeal to him the man was evidently very overbearing and had an exceedingly good opinion of himself  im going back to have a smoke said the man presently will you come and join me  thank you but neither of us smokes answered roger  what not even cigarettes  no returned dave  humph i dont see how you can resist i would feel utterly lost without a cigar well ill see you later and thus speaking william jarvey took himself off  i sincerely trust the rest of the men we meet will be of a better sort than that fellow remarked roger i dont like his makeup at all  i agree with you roger answered dave he looks like a chap who would be very dictatorial if he had the chanceone of the kind who loves to ride over those under him  i cant get over the way he kept looking at you dave he acted as if he had met you before and was trying to place you  i noticed he did look at me pretty closely a number of times answered our hero but i took it that he was only trying to size me up you know some strangers have that habit  well he didnt look at me that way continued the senators son i believe he was doing his best to try to place you  i wish i had asked him where he was from maybe that might have given us some sort of clue to his identity  lets ask him if we get the chance  on the journey to san antonio they had an opportunity to speak to william jarvey a number of times and once they sat at the same table with him in the diningcar when asked where he came from he replied rather evasively that he had lived for a great number of years in the northwest but that he had left that section of the country to try his fortunes in mexico  i was interested in the mines down there and then i got mixed up in one of their revolutions and got shot in the leg he added that was enough for me so i crossed the rio grande into texas and by luck got the position i am now holding with the mentor company  are the mexican revolutionists interfering at all with the work of the construction company near the border questioned dave  not very much one gang that was working on one of the railroad bridges not many miles from the rio grande had a little runin with some raiders who came across the river to steal cattle they helped the ranchmen drive the raiders away and in the fight one fellow was shot through the shoulder  well that was trouble enough cried roger its more than id like to see  thats right returned dave we didnt come down to fight the mexicans we came down to become civil engineers  oh i dont think youll run into any fighting answered william jarvey but of course a good many of those greasers are very treacherous and there is no telling what they will do they shoot down and rob anybody they meet in their own country and then when there is nothing in sight on that side of the river they watch their chance and come over on this side of course united states soldiers are on the lookout for them so they dont dare to make their raids very public  it developed that william jarvey had been sent up to denison on business for the construction company he carried with him a heavy valise and also a large roll of blueprints  i should have been back to san antonio yesterday he exclaimed but i was delayed in denison i suppose perry watson will be as mad as a hornet when i get back because i didnt make it as quick as he expected he expects an awful lot from those working under him  to this neither of the youths replied they had noticed that william jarvey smoked a great deal and that his breath smelled strongly of liquor and they concluded that he was not a man who would be likely to kill himself with overwork  from what jarvey has told us of mr watson i am inclined to think the superintendent is a hustling sort of fellow remarked dave when he and roger were left alone and being that kind of man he probably cant stand for a fellow who wants to loaf around and drink and smoke  i guess youve sized it up about right dave answered the senators son in these days the watchword seems to be keep moving and a fellow has got to get there if he wants to hold down his job  at last the train rolled into the city of san antonio before this place was reached william jarvey had met a number of other men who had boarded the train at a station some miles away and he was so interested in what the newcomers had to tell him that he seemed to forget completely the presence of dave and roger  and id just as lief he would forget us said our hero to his chum id rather go to mr watson alone than have that man introduce us  exactly the way i feel about it returned the senators son come on lets see if we cant slip away from him through the crowd this they did easily and soon found themselves walking along one of the quaint streets of san antonio bound for the building in which the mentor construction company had its temporary offices  contrary to what william jarvey had told them they found mr perry watson a very pleasant man with whom to deal there was little of nonsense about him and he lost no time in finding out who the youths were and for what they had come but his manner was courteous and he made both dave and roger feel thoroughly at home  i know mr ramsdell very well hes a fine fellow said the superintendent of the construction company i had a personal letter from him in regard to you and im going to put you out under one of the best men we have down here in texas mr ralph obray who is now working on the construction of the new catalco bridge to the west of this place he is expecting some new helpers and he asked me to send him the two best fellows i could find so i am going to send you and mr watson smiled slightly  thank you very much mr watson answered dave  oh you dont have to thank me porter returned the superintendent quickly you just go out and make good that is all this company asks of any one it employs  when do you want us to start mr watson questioned roger  you can suit yourselves about that although the sooner you report to mr obray the better i think hell be pleased  the superintendent walked to a back door of his office and called to some one without  ill turn you over to one of our clerks and he will give you all the details regarding your positions he explained  the clerk proved to be a young man only a few years older than dave and roger and the youths took to him at once he explained in detail where they were to go and what the construction camp located near the new catalco bridge consisted of and also told them what their work would probably be for the first few months  of course youve got to start at the bottom of the ladder he explained but youll find mr obray a splendid man to be under and youll probably learn more under him than you would under any of our other head engineers  in that case im mighty glad mr watson assigned us to mr obrays gang answered dave  it was arranged that dave and his chum should start westward early the following morning this would give them a part of an afternoon and an evening in san antonio in which to look around and take in the sights of that quaint town  during the conversation with mr watson and the clerk dave had been rather surprised because william jarvey had not shown himself because on the train he had said he was behindhand and they had naturally supposed he would come to the offices without delay just as they were preparing to leave they heard an angry discussion going on in mr watsons private office and they heard the voices of the superintendent and the man they had met on the train  i gave you strict orders to come right back jarvey they heard mr watson say you knew we were waiting for those blueprints  i was delayed growled william jarvey in return you see there were some things about the prints  i dont want any excuses broke in mr watson the blueprints were all right and were waiting for you you took a day off simply to go and have a good time now i want to warn you for the last time if such a thing happens again ill discharge you     chapter xxiii  at the engineering camp   i can understand now why that man jarvey spoke against mr watson remarked dave as he and his chum walked along the main street of san antonio mr watson evidently has no use for a fellow who doesnt attend to business  i think hes all right dave returned roger of course hes business clean through but that is what youve got to expect from a man who holds such a position  exactly roger the fellow who takes his own time and does things about as he pleases has no place in the modern business world  the two youths had received full instructions regarding what they were to do they were to take a train westward early in the morning for a small place known as molona situated but a short distance from the rio grande there they were to report to mr ralph obray mr watson had asked them regarding what they had brought along in the way of baggage and on being questioned had advised them to purchase several other things before starting for the engineering camp  this is certainly an odd sort of placequite different from a new england town was daves comment as he and his chum went from one shop to another in san antonio in quest of the things they wished to buy  seems to me that it has quite a mexican flavor to it remarked roger just see all the big hats and the fringed trousers  now that they had come so far the chums were eager to get to the camp and they could scarcely wait until the following morning they found a comfortable hotel had an early breakfast and by seven oclock were on their way westward  now we are almost on the border remarked roger as they stopped at a place called del rio he was studying a railroad map at the next place called viaduct we will be on the rio grande with mexico just across from us  it isnt such a very grand river after all remarked dave when they came in sight of the stream it looks more like a great big overgrown creek to me  you cant compare these rivers with the hudson or the st lawrence dave but i suppose at certain seasons of the year this river gets to be pretty big  soon their train rolled into molona and the youths alighted the station was a primitive affair consisting of a small platform and a building not over ten feet square  word had been sent ahead that they were coming and among the several texans and mexicans who had gathered to watch the train come in they found a middleaged man on a burro with two other burros standing behind  are you the young fellows for the mentor camp he questioned as dave and roger approached him  we are returned our hero quickly did you come for us  i did mr watson sent a wire that you were coming so the boss sent me here to get you thinking you wouldnt know the way porter and morr i believebut which is which  i am dave porter answered dave and this is my chum roger morr  glad to know you my name is frank andrews i am from scranton pennsylvania i suppose you can ride  oh yes answered roger we did more or less riding when we were out on star ranch  good enough some of the young fellows who come out here cant ride at all and they have some trouble getting around believe me this you know is the country of magnificent distances and frank andrews laughed  how many have you in the camp here questioned dave after he and roger had mounted the two waiting burros and were riding off beside the man from the engineering camp  there are twenty of us in the engineering gang and i think they have about seventy to eighty men in the construction camp with forty or fifty more on the way you see they have been bothered a great deal for hired help lately on account of the trouble with the mexican bandits and revolutionists lots of men are afraid to come down here to work for fear some bandits will make a raid across the border and shoot them down  have you had any trouble lately questioned roger quickly  we had trouble about two weeks ago a couple of dirty mexicans came into camp and were caught trying to steal away that night with some of our belongings one of the fellows got a crack on the head with a club and the other we think was shot in the side but both of them got away in the darkness  thats interesting to say the least remarked dave drily i guess weve got to sleep with our eyes open as the saying is  youve certainly got to watch yourself while youre down here answered frank andrews there is more talk about trouble than anything else but the talk gets on some of the mens nerves and we have had one civil engineer and two helpers leave us just on that account they said they would prefer to work somewhere in the united states where they wouldnt be worried thinking the greasers might attack them  as the party rode along they had to cross a bridge which was comparatively new and their guide explained that this structure was one erected by the mentor company then they went over a slight rise and finally came into view of a long row of onestory buildings with several rows of adobe houses behind them  here we are at the camp announced the guide the engineering gang lives and does business in these houses here and those huts at the back are used by the construction gangs  illustration here we are at the camp announced the guidepage 225  it was all so new and novel to dave and roger that they were intensely interested with their guide they rode up to the main building and dismounted in a moment more they found themselves inside and confronted by mr ralph obray the head of the camp  glad to see you he said shaking hands after they had introduced themselves we are rather short of helpers just now so youll find plenty to do i understand mr ramsdell has given you a firstclass recommendation i hope that youll be able to live up to it and he smiled faintly  im going to do what i can mr obray answered dave  and so am i added roger  frank andrews had already told them that a man with a wagon would be sent down to the station for their trunks and suitcases all of which had been left in charge of the stationmaster the youths were taken to one of the buildings not far from the office and there assigned to a room containing two cots  of course this isnt the biltmore hotel or the waldorf astoria remarked frank andrews with a grin if you stay out here youll have to learn to rough it  we know something about roughing it already answered dave if the other fellows can stand it i guess we can  you wont find it so bad when you get used to it answered the man of course its pretty hot during the day but the nights are quite comfortable weve got a firstclass colored cook so you wont find yourselves cut short on meals  thats good news answered the senators son i always thought that a good meal covered a multitude of sins and at this misquotation frank andrews laughed heartily  the man had already been despatched to get the baggage and after it arrived dave and roger proceeded to make themselves at home each donning such clothing as they saw the others of the engineering corps wearing  its goodbye to boiled shirts and stiff collars said roger and im not sorry for it  nor am i returned dave ill feel much more like working in this comfortable outfit  almost before they knew it it was noon and presently they saw a number of men some of them quite young coming in to dinner through frank andrews they were introduced to all the others and then placed at one of the tables in the mess hall where a helper of jeff the cook served them with a meal which if not exactly elegant was certainly wellcooked and substantial  i want you two young men to stay around the offices for the rest of this week announced mr obray to them after the meal that will give you a chance to familiarize yourselves with what we are doing in the way of constructions in this vicinity then next week you can go out with the gang and begin your regular field practice  the youths soon found that practical work in the office was quite different from the theoretical work done under mr ramsdell still their tutor had instructed them faithfully so that they soon caught on as roger remarked  when they did not understand a thing they did not hesitate to ask questions and they found the other persons present very willing to explain and to help them there was a spirit of comradeship throughout the whole camp that was as comforting as it was beneficial  it isnt everybody for himself here explained frank andrews it is one for all you are expected to do all you can for the other fellow and in return its understood that he will do all he can for you  its a fine method answered dave and i dont wonder that the mentor construction company is making such a success of its undertakings  one day our hero asked frank andrews if he knew william jarvey at the question the man drew down the corners of his mouth and shook his head in disgust  yes i know bill he answered hes over in the offices at san antonio mostly but he occasionally comes out here on business for mr watson i must say i dont like him very much and i dont think the other men do either hes a fellow who likes to drink now and then and i understand he often gambles that is when he has the money hes usually strapped long before payday comes around  i thought he might be that sort of fellow answered dave  he got into a row with mr watson while we were at san antonio put in roger and related a few of the particulars  if bill doesnt look out hell lose his job and it will be too bad answered frank andrews because he wont be likely to get another such easy berth in a hurry he gets good money for what little he does he hired with the company as a firstclass bookkeeper but i understand he is only ordinary when it comes to handling big masses of figures  well i didnt like him when i met him and id be just as well satisfied if we didnt meet again said dave  but daves wish was not to be gratified he was to meet william jarvey in the future and that meeting was to bring with it a great surprise     chapter xxiv  a midnight alarm   well dave we have been in this camp just a month today how do you think you like it  i like it firstrate rogerin fact better than i first thought i would all the engineers and assistants are so kind and helpful  thats what they are returned the senators son and i think we are getting along famously do you know i am actually in love with the construction of this new catalco bridge i think its going to be a dandy when its completed  not only a dandy roger but unless i miss my guess it will be a monument to the skill and ingenuity of the mentor construction company ive been reading up on all kinds of bridges and i think the construction of this particular bridge goes ahead of most of them  one thing is suremr obray is very proud of the way things are going i heard from andrews that some of the other construction companies thought we would never be able to build this bridge the way it is going up  the talk between the two chums was held in the evening after work for the day had come to an end dave and roger stood on an elevation of ground surveying the unfinished bridgeor rather chain of bridgeswhich spanned a river and the marshland beyond it had been a great engineering feat to obtain the proper foundations for the bridge where it spanned the marshland and make them impervious to the floods which came with great force during certain seasons of the year  the first week at the camp had been spent in the offices but all the other time had been put in with the engineering gang that was superintending the construction of the far end of the bridge and also the laying out of the railroad route through the hills and cuts beyond the work had proved fascinating to the chums and they were surprised to see how quickly the time passed  dave and roger had made a number of friends but none more agreeable than frank andrews andrews occupied a room close to their own and often spent an evening with them  about the end of the second week they had received word concerning william jarvey the bookkeeper in the offices at san antonio had had a violent quarrel with mr watson and had been discharged he had gone off declaring that his being treated thus was unjustifiable and that he was going to bring the mentor construction company to account for it  i guess hes nothing but a bag of wind was rogers comment on hearing this the company is probably much better off to have such a chap among the missing  i dont see what he can do to hurt the company had been daves answer he was probably discharged for good cause  although so far away from home it must not be supposed that dave and roger had forgotten the folks left behind they had sent numerous letters telling of their various experiences and of what they hoped to do in the future in return roger had received one letter from his father and another from his mother and dave had gotten communications from his sister laura and from jessie and also a long letter from ben  of these the letter received from jessie was to our hero the most important and it must be confessed that he read it a number of times the girl was greatly interested in all that he had told her about his work and she said she hoped he would become a great civil engineer and that she certainly trusted he would not have any trouble with the mexicans  the letter from ben basswood had been rather a disheartening communication ben wrote that his father did not seem to regain his health as rapidly as the doctor had anticipated and that nothing new concerning ward porton or tim crapsey had been uncovered ben added that he had written to the authorities in new york city concerning porton and had received word back that they had been unable to locate the former movingpicture actor  i believe the loss of those miniatures has had its full effect on mr basswood remarked dave when speaking of the matter to his chum i suppose it makes him feel blue and that retards his recovery  more than likely answered roger a person cant very well throw off a heavy spell of sickness when he is so depressed in spirits its too bad and i suppose mrs basswood feels dreadful to think she was the one to let the fortune slip out of their hands  no doubt of it roger of course its easy enough to blame her and i suppose a great many of their neighbors do but just the same place yourself in her positionworried half to death over the sickness of her husbandand you might have done the same thing  it was a warm evening and the chums took their time in returning to the camp knowing supper would not be served until a little later during the day several shots had been heard at a great distance to the southward and some of the civil engineers had wondered if some sort of a scrimmage was taking place on the other side of the rio grande  if a fight is in progress i hope it doesnt extend to this neighborhood remarked one of the engineers in speaking of the matter weve got troubles enough of our owngetting this bridge rightwithout having the greasers interfering with our work and he gave a grim laugh  when the chums arrived in camp they found that the days mail had come in there was a washington newspaper for roger containing an address delivered in the senate by senator morr and also a long letter for our hero from ben  well here is news at last cried dave as he scanned the communication come on out here away from the crowd roger and ill read it to you and then he led the way to a corner and acquainted his chum with the contents of the letter which was as follows    i know you will be interested to learn that we have at last heard   from that rascal tim crapsey who with ward porton got the   miniatures from my mother crapsey sent a very badly written   letter to my father stating that he and porton had parted   company but that he had the most of the miniaturesin fact all   but six of them    crapsey wrote that he was in the city of new york and had the   miniatures in a safe place and that he would return them to us   for fifteen thousand dollars we were to insert a personal   advertisement in one of the new york newspapers if we were willing   to accept his offer and then he would send us word how the   exchange of money for the miniatures could be made    of course as you know my father is still sick he didnt have   anything like fifteen thousand dollars in cash to offer crapsey   and besides that mr wadsworth and your uncle dunston thought it   was altogether too much money to offer a thief like that in fact   your uncle was of the opinion that they should only try to lead   crapsey on so that they could capture him but my father backed   up by mr wadsworth at length agreed to put up five thousand   dollars in order to get the miniatures back and an advertisement   was inserted in the newspapers to that effect    we waited two days for a reply and then came a scrawl on a bit   of paper signed by crapsey stating that he was having trouble of   another kind and could not for the present keep on with his   negotiations after that my father inserted another advertisement   asking for more information but up to the present time no   additional word has come in    my father does not know what to make of it your folks and mr   wadsworth are of the opinion that either crapsey was trying to   fool them and got scared or else that the rascal has been caught   by the police for some other crime and is trying to conceal his   identity they are divided on the question as to whether to   believe crapsey when he wrote that he and porton had parted   companythey are half inclined to believe that porton is still   with him and that the whole scheme was framed up by porton  that is certainly interesting news remarked roger after both had perused the letter a second time and it settles one thingand that is that tim crapsey must have been in new york with ward porton at the time we saw the latter  exactly roger and it also proves beyond a doubt that that pair were really the thieves previous to this we only supposed such to be the factwe really couldnt prove it  oh i was sure of it all along dave  so was i roger but you know in a court of law it is one thing to know a thing and another to be able to prove it  the two young civil engineers discussed the letter all through the evening meal and even for some time later then however roger turned to his newspaper to read with care the address that his father had delivered dave was also interested in this  id like to be in the senate some time when your father was speaking he remarked to his chum it must be a great sight to see such a body as that when it is in session  it is dave answered his chum and people come thousands of miles to see it  before retiring for the night dave penned a letter to ben and also sent a letter to jessie and another to his uncle dunston which was meant for the entire household roger spent the time in a communication to his mother and also in a long letter to luke watson  the night proved to be unusually warm for the breeze which was usually stirring had died down completely dave fell into a fitful doze from which he awoke about midnight to find his mouth and throat quite parched  i guess id better get up and get a drink he told himself and then i may be able to sleep better phew but the thermometer has certainly been going up the last few days  he arose to his feet and walked out of the room into the hallway of the building where in one corner there was a watercooler he had just finished drinking a glass of water when a sound from outside reached his ears there was a shout from a distance followed almost instantly by a rifle shot  hello what can that mean he cried  a moment later came more shouts this time a little closer to the camp then two more rifle shots rang out sharply through the midnight air  something is wrong thats sure exclaimed the youth rushing back into the bedroom he shook roger vigorously at the same time he heard others getting up and calling to each other wanting to know what the shouts and shots meant  what do you want dave asked the senators son sleepily  get up roger answered our hero quickly hurry up there is something going on outside i just heard a number of yells and several rifle shots  you dont mean it dave and now roger was on his feet with a bound maybe its the greasers  i dont know what it is roger but i guess we had better slip into our clothing maybe somebody is listen  dave broke off short and both strained their ears to hear what was taking place outside they heard a confused shouting followed by several yells and then came a volley of shotsfive or six in number  its an attack thats what it is cried the senators son ill bet some of those mexican bandits are coming over here oh dave what do you suppose we had better do  i dont know except that we had better slip on our clothing and get our pistols answered dave this looks as if it might be serious  up boys up came the cry from somebody outside get your guns and your pistols the mexican raiders are coming this way     chapter xxv  the mexican raiders   by the time the two chums had hastily donned their clothing and possessed themselves of the pistols they had purchased in san antonio on the advice of mr watson the camp was in confusion from end to end with the various bosses shouting orders and the men themselves wanting to know what the trouble was and what they had better do  its some of those confounded greasers cried frank andrews as he too arose and armed himself he had a repeating rifle and it was known to dave and roger that he was an exceptionally good shot  andrews led the way from the building followed by our hero and roger and several others in the meantime the distant shouting and shooting seemed to have moved farther westward in the direction where the new catalco bridge was being constructed  it cant be their intention to blow up the bridge queried roger there had been talk of this several times  no telling what those rascals are up to answered frank andrews this may be only a rumpus kicked up to cover a cattle raid or something like that  in the midst of the excitement the telephone in the main office began to ring and was answered by one of the clerks a few minutes later he came rushing out to where mr obray stood talking to his assistant and the boss of the construction camp  just got a telephone from the tolman ranch announced the clerk old man tolman said they had been raided and that half of the raiders were coming this way i tried to get some details from him but in the midst of the talk i was shut off i suppose somebody cut the wire  i thought that might be it answered the head of the engineering corps  we ought to help tolman all we can announced the boss of the construction camp he promised to assist us in case we had any trouble and turn about is fair play  right you are peterson and any man who wants to go out can do it and word was passed around to this effect  dave and roger listened to this talk and what followed with much interest in less than five minutes over thirty men from the construction camp had signified their willingness to go after the raiders and these men were joined by frank andrews and three other civil engineers all well armed and mounted  id like to join that crowd and go after those mexicans exclaimed dave his eyes sparkling  so would i returned the senators son quickly those fellows cant be anything but plain bandits and cattle thieves  sure no regular revolutionists would come over the border and act in this fashion  what do you say daveshall we go  im willing  no no you young fellows had better stay in the camp announced ralph obray who overheard the talk just remember that in a certain sense i am responsible for your safety while you are under me  but those others are going returned dave somewhat reproachfully  so they are porter but they are all older than you and most of them have had experience in this sort of thing i would rather that you stayed here maybe if those raiders come this way well have our hands full defending the camp  dave and roger realized that for the head of the camp to express his desire in this instance was equal practically to a command so they at once gave up the idea of following frank andrews and the others the men rode off quickly and were soon lost to sight in the darkness of the night  an hour of intense anxiety passed during that time those left in the camp heard an occasional shot in the distance then several shots seemed much closer there followed some yelling and then about five minutes later came a dull explosion  thats at the bridge exclaimed dave they must be trying to blow it up  the dull explosion was followed by a sudden rattle of rifle and pistol shots and more yelling once or twice some men seemed to come quite near to the construction camp the hoof strokes of the horses being distinctly heard  all who remained in the camp were on the lookout and each man stood ready with his weapon to do what he could to defend the place should the occasion arise but with the explosion and the rattle of rifle and pistol shots that followed the conflict seemed to die down and presently all became utter silence and thus two more hours passed  whoever they were they seem to have left this vicinity entirely said roger  i wish it was morning put in another of the young men present the watching was beginning to get on his nerves  at last just as the first streaks of dawn were beginning to show in the eastern sky a number of horsemen were descried approaching from the southward all in the camp were instantly on their guard but it was soon seen that it was their friends who were coming back they came in somewhat of a horseshoe formation driving in their midst four prisoners one of them with his arm done up in a sling and another with his head bandaged  theyve got somebody exclaimed roger as the crowd came closer four greasers  three of them look like mexicans but the other fellow looks like an american returned dave as the party came to a halt in front of the camp buildings  those who had come in were at once surrounded by the others who wanted to know the particulars of what had taken place  it was a band of about thirty greasers and with them were two or three americans announced frank andrews they went down to old man tolmans corral and tried to drive off about two hundred head of cattle they got away from the ranch and then part of the gang came over this way in the vicinity of the new bridge we had two running fights with them and then they let the cattle go and started for the rio grande but before they went one of the rascals set off a bomb near the end of the bridge and blew up a corner of the foundation  why in the world did they want to blow up the bridge demanded mr obray  they werent all mexicans mr obray several of them were americans weve got one of the americans right here and do you know who it is jack pankhurst  whats that exclaimed the head of the camp and then he turned to the prisoners one man had his sombrero pulled well down over his forehead as if somewhat ashamed of himself  there he is went on frank andrews pointing to this individual thats jack pankhurst who was discharged for drinking and gambling about two months ago  mr obray strode up to the prisoner and gave him a tap under the chin thus elevating his face  youre a fine specimen of humanity pankhurst he cried sternly a fine business for you to be injoining mexican outlaws and becoming a cattle rustler what have you to say for yourself  i havent anything to say grumbled the prisoner whats the use i was caught with the goods wasnt i he sneered  im ashamed to think an american would go in with a bunch of mexican bandits said mr obray and then gave directions that the prisoners should be well bound so that there would be no possibility of their escaping  all listened with interest to the details of the cattle raid so far as the men who had gone out from the construction camp could relate they said that some of the fighting had been exceedingly hot and they were satisfied that a number of the mexicans and also one of the americans with them had been wounded  they themselves had not escaped unscathed one man being hit in the shoulder and another in the leg fortunately however neither of these wounds proved serious the camp doctor was called in to attend them after which he attended the wounded prisoners in the meantime a message was sent to the railroad station and to san antonio to acquaint the authorities with what had occurred  i was questioning pankhurst on the way here said frank andrews to the head of the camp he wouldnt admit it outright but i am strongly of the opinion that one of the other americans who was with him was bill jarvey  jarvey muttered mr obray well it would be just like him to join a fellow like pankhurst they were quite chummy when they both worked for the company  ive got another idea about this affair went on andrews do you remember how they said jarvey vowed he would get square with the company for discharging him ive got an idea that it was his scheme to attempt to blow up the bridge and that he was the one who set off that bomb their idea was to get the cattle to some safe place first and then ruin the bridge more than likely jarvey and pankhurst made a deal with the greasers to that effectthe americans to help with the cattle and the mexicans to help destroy our work  you may be right andrews answered ralph obray and if you are its a pity that you didnt catch jarvey  dave and roger listened to this talk with interest and also joined in the general discussion of those in the camp regarding the raid and what would be done with the prisoners  i suppose they will turn the prisoners over to the united states authorities was daves opinion and in this he was right some government officers appeared by noon of the next day and after a lengthy talk with the head of the camp and a number of others the prisoners including jack pankhurst were taken away  i wonder if old man tolman got his cattle back remarked roger  all but three of the animals answered one of the men present those were trampled to death during the raid but three are nothing alongside of two hundred  the raid had caused so much excitement in the camp that there was but little work done that day the boys went down with the others to inspect the bridge and look curiously at the hole which had been torn in the corner of one of the foundations by the bomb  that was certainly a mean piece of business was our heros comment it didnt do anybody a bit of good and its going to make a good deal of work to repair the damage  several days passed and the camp at last settled back into its usual routine dave and roger worked as hard as ever and both were much pleased when mr obray told them that they were doing very well  i am going to write a letter to mr ramsdell said the head of the camp and tell him that i am well satisfied with his pupils and he smiled faintly  a day or two later word came to the camp which interested the chums as much as it did anybody it seemed that jack pankhurst had been subjected to a third degree of questioning he had broken down completely and confessed that the two other americans in the raid with him had been former employees of the mentor construction companyone a fellow named packard brown and the other william jarvey pankhurst had also let fall the information that jarvey had once been an officer in the united states army and that he was traveling under an assumed name  a former officer of our army and acting in that way exclaimed dave when he heard this report i certainly do hope theyll catch him and punish him as he deserves  my sentiments exactly added roger     chapter xxvi  the chase on the bridge   my dave but its hot  i agree with you roger this is the hottest day weve struck yet and such a hard day as its been too and our hero paused to wipe the perspiration from his brow  what do you say if we take a swim this evening went on the senators son a plunge into the river would feel good to me  im with you roger let us eat a light supper and get down to the river before it grows too dark  four weeks had passed since the events narrated in the last chapter and matters in and around the construction camp had once more quieted down work was being pushed forward rapidly and dave and roger were making excellent progress in their chosen profession they had made a warm personal friend of frank andrews as well as a friend of mr obray and both of these individuals gave them many instructions during off hours which proved highly beneficial  no more had been heard from the mexican raiders and it was hoped that those bandits had departed for some other locality along the rio grande the prisoners taken during the raid were still in jail awaiting trial  down along the stream over which the new catalco bridge was being constructed there was a favorite swimming place used by the civil engineers and their assistants the men and boys of the construction gang using another spot farther down the stream  ill beat you getting in dave cried roger as the pair neared the bathing place that evening and he started to take off some of his clothes  dont jump in too quickly roger warned our hero remember you have just been eating and you are rather warm better take it easy on the bank for a little while  i guess youre right was the reply i dont want to get a cramp or a chill or anything like that  to reach the swimming spot the chums had to pass one end of the new bridge as they drew closer they saw somebody high up on the skeleton structure gazing at them curiously  hello whos that up there remarked dave  im sure i dont know answered roger i thought all our men were back in camp  as they came still closer the individual on the bridge turned to walk toward them suddenly however he stopped short and tried his best to hide himself behind some of the steel work  say that looks rather queer to me remarked dave he acts just as if he didnt want us to see him  just what i thought dave the senators son gave a sudden start you dont suppose its one of those mexican raiders do you  i cant say anything about that im going up there to find out who he is it seems to me he is acting very suspiciously maybe hes trying to plant some more bombs  dave turned back to a point where he could get up on the bridge and his chum followed from this point they could not see the person above them nor could he see them when they reached the flooring of the big bridge they were less than two hundred feet from where the unknown person stood he was leaning over the side of the structure evidently trying to find out what had become of them  why dave hehelooks like you burst out the senators son as both hurried in the direction of the unknown person  i do believe its ward porton ejaculated our hero he began to quicken his pace yes im almost sure its porton he added a few seconds later  if its porton what in the world tempted him to follow you to this place queried roger  i dont know but i do know that im going to capture him if it is possible to do so answered dave with determination  the two chums were still almost a hundred feet from the other person when the latter glanced up suddenly and discovered them he looked them full in the face for just an instant and then turned and began to run away towards the opposite end of the long bridge  its porton sure enough burst out roger  hi there porton stop cried dave stop i tell you  you go on back yelled ward porton in an ugly voice go on back i tell you if you dont it will be the worse for you and he shook his fist at the chums  you might as well stop continued dave undaunted by the threat you cant get away from us if you try to jump off the unfinished end of the bridge youll break your neck  if you fellows dont go back ill shoot returned the fellow who resembled dave stop right where you are dont dare to come a step closer  oh dave do you suppose he is armed questioned roger hastily and in a low tone  maybe he is but i am going to keep on after him until he shows his pistol was the rapid reply you need not come if you dont want to im going to capture him and make him give up the basswood fortune  if you are going after him so am i returned the senators son sturdily maybe it was only a bluff about shooting after all  while running along the bridge daves eyes fell on a short steel bar left there by one of the workmen he stopped just long enough to pick the bar up and then went after porton with all the speed at his command  it was a perilous chase for in many places the flooring of the big bridge was still missing and they had to leap from girder to girder of the steel structure  stop i tell you yelled ward porton once more when dave was within ten yards of him and then he turned squarely around and our hero and roger saw the glint of a pistol as the rascal pointed it toward them  he is armed cried roger and now there was a note of fear in his voice and not without reason  get behind the steel work ordered dave and lost no time in dodging partly out of sight as he moved however he launched forth the steel bar he had picked up  more by good luck than anything else the bar sped true to its mark it struck ward porton in the forearm the hand of which was holding the pistol in another instant the weapon was clattering down through the steel work of the bridge to the river far below  hurrah dave youve disarmed him cried roger  for the instant ward porton seemed dazed by the sudden turn of affairs evidently however the blow from the steel bar had not hurt him much for turning quickly he continued his flight along the bridge dave and roger lost no time in following him  it was not long before the fugitive and those behind him reached a section of the long bridge which was far from completed here there was practically no flooring and ward porton had to jump from one piece of steel work to another while dave and roger of course had to do the same once those in the rear saw the rascal ahead make a misstep and plunge downward but he saved himself and scrambling to his feet dashed forward as madly as before  take care dave its dangerous here gasped roger and scarcely had he spoken when he himself made a misstep and shot down below the level of the bridge flooring  dave was several feet in advance but turned instantly when his chum let out a cry of alarm he saw roger four or five feet below him clinging frantically to one of the stays of the bridge  helhelp mme panted the unfortunate youth  hold tight roger ill help you returned dave quickly  illustration hold tight roger ill help you returned dave quicklypage 255  the stay below was so small in diameter that all roger could do was to cling to it with both hands and one leg in this position he hung until dave let himself down several feet and managed to give him a hand then with extreme caution both worked their way back to the unfinished flooring of the bridge  oh my i thought sure i was a goner panted the senators son when he found himself safe once more he had turned white and he was trembling from head to foot  i guess you had better not go any farther roger remarked dave this certainly is dangerous work  its a wonder porton doesnt fall was the others comment as they both watched the fleeing rascal who was leaping from girder to girder with a recklessness that was truly amazing  hes scared stiff at the idea of being captured was daves comment if it wasnt for that i dont believe he would take any such chance and in this surmise our hero was probably correct  dave hated to give up the chase so he continued his way along the bridge making sure however of every step and jump he took roger remained where he was too shaken up to proceed farther when he knew that each step would prove more hazardous than the last  at last ward porton gained a point where one of the foundations of the bridge rested on comparatively solid ground with the river behind and a wide stretch of marshland ahead here there was a long ladder used by the workmen and down this the rascal went as fast as his feet could carry him by the time dave reached the top of the ladder porton was well on his way over the solid ground soon the gathering darkness hid him from view  knowing that it would be next to useless to attempt to follow the rascal now that he had left the vicinity of the bridge dave returned to where he had left roger then the pair started slowly back to the end of the bridge from which they had come  i cant understand what brought ward porton here remarked roger when the chums had once more gained the swimmingplace do you suppose he knew you were in this vicinity dave  possibly roger but at the same time i dont think that would explain his presence here he wouldnt dare to impersonate me around this camp hed be sure to be caught at it sooner or later  well i dont understand it at all  neither do i i am sorry that we didnt catch the rascal returned dave soberly  when they went back into camp they informed frank andrews and also mr obray of what had occurred these men had already heard some of the particulars regarding daves double and the disappearance of the basswood fortune  too bad you didnt get him said frank andrews but you be careful how you run over that unfinished bridge unless you want to have a nasty fall and either get killed or else crippled for life  several days went by including sunday and nothing more was seen or heard of ward porton although the lads made a thorough search for him dave sent letters home and to ben basswood telling the folks in crumville of what had happened  a little greaser to see you dave remarked one of the civil engineers as dave was coming from an unusually difficult afternoons work  he walked to where his fellow worker had pointed and there saw a dirty unkempt mexican lad standing with a letter in his hand the communication was addressed to dave and opening it he read the following    i have broken with tim crapsey and have the basswood miniatures   here with me safely in mexico if the basswoods will pay me ten   thousand dollars in cash they can have the pictures back   otherwise i am going to destroy them i will give them two weeks   in which to make good    as you are so close at hand maybe you can transact the business   for mr basswood when you are ready to open negotiations send a   letter to the bilassa camp across the border and i will get it    ward porton     chapter xxvii  across the rio grande   dave read the note from ward porton with intense interest and then passed it over to roger  what do you know about that exclaimed the senators son after he had perused the communication do you think porton tells the truth  i dont know what to think roger if he does tell the truth then it is quite likely that tim crapsey was trying to play a double game so far as the basswoods were concerned  its pretty clever on portons part said roger speculatively he knows it would be very difficult for us to get hold of him while he is in mexico with this revolution going on and at the same time he is close enough to keep in touch with you knowing that you can easily transact this business for the basswoodsproviding of course that mr basswood is willing  dave did not answer to this for he was looking around for the mexican youth who had delivered the note but the boy had slipped away and a search of the camp failed to reveal what had become of him  i guess he was instructed to sneak away without being seen was our heros comment porton knew that i wouldnt be in a position to answer him at once and he didnt want me to follow that boy  dave read the note again and then went off to consult with frank andrews and mr obray  its too bad you didnt capture that little greaser observed the head of the civil engineers we might have been able to get some information from him however if hes gone thats the end of it i think the best thing you can do porter is to send a night message to this mr basswood telling him how the note was received and repeating it word for word then the responsibility for what may follow will not rest on your shoulders  our hero thought this good advice and aided by his chum he concocted what is familiarly known as a night letter to be sent by telegraph to crumville  on the following day came a surprise for our hero in the shape of a short message from ben basswood which ran as follows    yours regarding porton received crapsey makes another offer   pair probably enemies now will write or wire instructions   later  this is certainly getting interesting remarked dave after having read the message he turned it over to roger i guess ben is rightcrapsey and porton have fallen out and each is claiming to have the miniatures  well one or the other must have them dave  perhaps they divided them roger thieves often do that sort of thing you know  do you suppose ward porton is really around that bilassa camp in mexico went on the senators son  probably he is hanging out somewhere in that vicinity i dont think he has joined general bilassa he thinks too much of his own neck to become a soldier in any revolution  having sent his message to the basswoods and received bens reply there seemed nothing further for our hero to do but to wait he and roger were very busy helping to survey the route beyond the new catalco bridge and in the fascination of this occupation ward porton was for the next few days almost forgotten  if the basswoods expect you to do anything regarding that note you got from porton they had better get busy before long remarked roger one evening otherwise porton may do as he threateneddestroy the pictures  oh i dont believe hed do anything of that sort roger answered dave what would be the use i think he would prefer to hide them somewhere thinking that some day he would be able to make money out of them  four days after this came a bulky letter from ben basswood which dave and his chum read eagerly it was as follows    i write to let you know that tim crapsey has been caught at last   he was traced to new york and then to newark n j where the   police found him in a secondrate hotel he had been drinking and   confessed that he had had a row with ward porton and that one   night when he was under the influence of liquor porton had   decamped taking all but two of the miniatures with him the two   miniatures had been sold to a fence in new york city for one   hundred dollars and the police think they can easily get them   back with the hundred dollars crapsey had evidently gone on a   spree and it was during this that porton sneaked away with the   other miniatures crapsey had an idea that porton was bound for   boston where he would take a steamer for europe but we know he   was mistaken    the case being as it is my father as well as your folks and mr   wadsworth thinks that porton must have the pictures with him in   mexico that being the case your uncle dunston says he will come   down to texas at once to see you and i am to come with him what   will be done in the matter i dont know although my father would   much rather give up ten thousand dollars than have the miniatures   destroyed if you receive any further word from ward porton tell   him that i am coming down to negotiate with him you had better   not mention your uncles name  looks as if porton told the truth after all announced roger probably he watched his opportunity and the first chance he got he decamped and left crapsey to take care of himself  most likely roger i dont believe there is any honor among thieves  ben had not said how soon he and dunston porter would arrive but as they would probably follow the letter the two chums looked for the pair on almost every train but two days passed and neither put in an appearance  they must have been delayed by something was daves comment  maybe they are trying to get that ten thousand dollars together suggested roger  i dont believe my uncle dunston will offer porton any such money right away returned our hero hell see first if he cant work it so as to capture the rascal  on the following morning roger was sent southward on an errand for mr obray when he returned he was very much excited  dave i think i saw ward porton again he exclaimed as he rushed up to our hero  where was that questioned dave quickly  down on that road which leads to the rio grande there was a fellow talking to a ranchman ive met several times a texan named lawson as soon as he saw me he took to his heels i questioned lawson about him and he said the fellow had come across the river at a point about a quarter of a mile below here  dave listened to this explanation with interest and immediately sought out mr obray the upshot of the talk was that our hero was given permission to leave the camp for the day taking roger with him  the two chums went off armed with their pistols not knowing what might happen they first walked to where roger had met the ranchman and there the senators son pointed out the direction that the young man who had run away had taken they followed this trail and presently reached the roadway which ran in sight of the river there were comparatively few craft on the stream and none of these looked as if it might be occupied by the young man they were after but presently they reached a small creek flowing into the rio grande and on this saw two flatbottomed rowboats  there he is now exclaimed dave suddenly and pointed to the first of the rowboats which was being sent down the creek in the direction of the river  the sole occupant of the craft was the fellow at the oars and the two chums readily made out that it was the former movingpicture actor as soon as he made certain of portons identity dave pulled roger down in the tall grass which bordered the creek  there is no use in letting him see us explained our hero  do you suppose he is bound for the mexican shore questioned the senators son  more than likely roger dave looked questioningly at his chum are you game to follow him he added  what do you mean  we might take that other rowboat and go after him i see it contains a pair of oars either of us ought to be able to row as well as porton and if we can catch him before he lands maybe well be able to drive him back to the united states side of the river  all right ill go with you responded roger quickly come ahead and he started on a run for the rowboat  the craft was tied fast to two stakes but it was an easy matter for them to loosen the ropes this done dave took up the oars shoved off and started to row with all the strength at his command  evidently ward porton had not expected to be followed for he was rowing leisurely allowing his flatbottomed boat to drift with the current he was much surprised when he saw the other boat come on at a good rate of speed  get back there he yelled when he recognized the occupants of the second craft get back i tell you or ill shoot  if you do well do some shooting on our own account porton called back roger and showed his pistol  the sight of the weapon evidently frightened porton greatly yet he did not cease rowing and now he headed directly for the mexican shore  the river at this point was broad and shallow and contained numerous sandbars almost before they knew it the craft containing our friends ran up on one of the bars and stuck there in the meantime ward porton continued his efforts to gain the shore  whats the matter dave cried roger when he saw our hero stop rowing  we are aground was the answer here roger get to the stern of the boat with me and well see if we cant shove her off again  with the two chums in the stern of the craft the bow came up out of the sandbar and in a few seconds more dave aided by the current of the stream managed to get the rowboat clear but all this had taken time and now the two chums saw that ward porton had beached his boat and was running across the marshland beyond  im afraid he is going to get away remarked roger dolefully  not much answered dave anyway im not going to give up yet and he resumed his rowing  here let me take a turn at that you must be getting a little tired said roger and he insisted that dave allow him to do the rowing  soon they reached the mexican shore at a point where there was a wide stretch of marshland with not a building in sight they had gotten several glimpses of ward porton making his way through the tall grass the trail was an easy one to follow  come on well get him yet muttered dave and started off on the run with roger behind him  they had just reached an illkept highway when they heard shouting in the distance they saw ward porton running wildly in the direction of a set of low buildings evidently belonging to some sort of ranch as the former movingpicture actor disappeared a band of mexican cavalry swept into view  quick roger down in the grass cried dave we dont want those soldiers to see us they may be government troops but they look more like guerrillaslike the rascals who raided the tolman ranch  right you are answered the senators son and then both lay low in the tall grass while the mexican guerrillas for they were nothing else swept past them     chapter xxviii  a strange discovery   as nearly as dave and roger could calculate there were about two hundred of the mexican guerrillasdirty and fiercelooking individuals led by an officer wearing an enormous hat and a long drooping mustache  the entire crowd looked disreputable in the extreme and the youths could not help but shudder as they gazed at the cavalcade  my gracious dave do you call those revolutionists remarked roger after the last of the horsemen had disappeared down the roadway  they may be revolutionists roger but to my mind they look more like bandits than anything else under the pretense of aiding mexico they probably steal whenever they get the chance  id hate awfully to fall into their clutches i think theyd rob a fellow of every dollar he had  well never mind those mexicans roger pursued dave come on let us see if we cant locate ward porton  he went over into one of yonder buildings  i know it and ive got an idea answered our hero let us see if we cant sneak across the roadway without being seen and then come up to those buildings through the thick grass and behind that chaparral if we expose ourselves porton will of course keep out of our sight or run away  with extreme caution the two chums worked their way through the tall grass to the edge of the roadway then watching their chance when nobody seemed to be looking they dashed to the other side and into the grass again then they began to work their way cautiously in the direction of the group of buildings into which the former movingpicture actor had disappeared  the buildings belonged to a mexican ranch but the place had evidently been the scene of a fight at some time in the past for one of the buildings was completely wrecked and several of the others much battered there were no horses cattle pigs or chickens anywhere in sight and the youths came to the conclusion that the ranch had been abandoned by its owner  probably some of those guerrillas came along and cleaned him out observed dave and after that he didnt think it would be worth while to stay so long as the country was in a state of war  in a few minutes more dave and his chum gained the first of the buildings here they paused to listen and to look around  you want to be on your guard roger whispered our hero porton may be watching us and he may have some of his friends here for all we know this may be his hangout  ill be on guard dont fear answered the senators son and brought forth his pistol  dont use that gun unless you have to warned dave who did not favor any shooting even in an extreme case like this  ill not give a rascal like porton the chance to shoot me first retorted roger that fellow ought to be in jail and you know it  to this our hero did not answer he felt in his pocket to make sure that his own weapon was ready for use  not a sound from the other buildings had reached them nor did any one appear to be in sight  looks to me as if we were in sole possession now that those guerrillas have gone announced roger wow i hope they dont come backat least not until we are safe on our side of the rio grande he added grimly  come on well take a look through the buildings answered dave dont make any noise if you can possibly help it  leaving the building which they had first enteredan abandoned stablethey moved through a brokendown cowshed to a long low structure which had evidently been used by the helpers on the ranch this building was also deserted and all that remained in it was some filthy bedding alive with vermin  come on let us get out of here remarked roger as he looked with disfavor at the squalor presented how can human beings live like this dave  i dont know roger this place ought to be burned downits the only way to get it clean dave added shaking his head in disgust over the sight  less than fifty feet away was the corner of the main building of the ranch peering out cautiously to make sure that no one was watching them the two chums hurried across the open space and crouched down beneath a wideopen window then dave pistol in hand looked in through the opening  the room beyond was deserted and a glance around showed him that it contained little besides some heavy pieces of furniture which the looters had evidently been unable to remove on a table rested several empty liquor bottles and also a number of cigar and cigarette stubs on the floor were scattered newspapers and some playing cards  the fellows who were here evidently got out in a hurry remarked dave  are you going to go in questioned roger  i guess so what do you think about it  im with you dave now we have gone so far we might as well finish the job  it was an easy matter for the two chums to climb through the low window once in the room they advanced toward a doorway leading to an apartment that opened on the patio of the ranch homean open courtyard which had once boasted of a wellkept flower garden but which was now neglected and overrun with weeds  as dave gazed out across the patio he saw a movement in a room on the opposite side of the ranch home the face of a man had appeared for a few seconds behind him was some one elsewho however dave could not make out  my gracious roger gasped our hero in a low voice did you see that fellow  i saw some one  it was william jarvey  jarvey are you sure  i am certain of it now what do you think of that  im sure i dont know what to think dave maybe he is making his headquarters here the same as ward porton  i am going to try to find out come on  our hero made a quick mental calculation as to the ground plan of the ranch homeland then he and roger began to work their way from one room to another and then through a long narrow hallway until they reached the other side of the building here they paused at the end of the hallway to listen  from a room close at hand came a murmur of voices by straining his ears dave made out the tones of william jarvey the former bookkeeper for the mentor construction company was evidently talking to another man but what was being said was not distinguishable  its jarvey all right enough whispered dave  yes but that isnt ward porton with him returned roger  i know it its some man  both continued to listen and presently heard william jarvey give a sarcastic laugh  youve got another guess coming packard brown if you think you are going to get that much out of the deal he cried remember you havent done a thing to help us  thats all right bill jarvey retorted the man called packard brown when we left the u s a and came over here it was understood that we were to share and share alike in everything  yes but i didnt think this new thing was coming up growled jarvey we were to share equal on what we happened to get out of the greasers this is another thing entirely  i admit that just the same i think im entitled to my share  well you help us all you can and youll get a nice little wad out of it brown  what more was said on this subject did not reach the ears of dave and roger for just then the latter pulled our hero by the sleeve  somebodys coming he whispered maybe its porton  dave did not answer at the end of the semidark hallway there was a closet which in years gone by had been used for the storage of guns and clothing into this closet the two youths went closing the door carefully after them  its porton all right enough whispered dave who a moment later was crouching low and looking through a large keyhole devoid of a key there he goes into the room where the two men are  then those two men must be in with him returned the senators son say dave this is certainly getting interesting  its going to make our job a pretty hard one answered our hero if ward porton was alone we might be able to capture him but i dont see how we are going to do it with jarvey and that man named brown present  maybe if we offer jarvey and brown a large reward they will help us make porton a prisoner suggested roger more than likely jarvey is on his uppers and will do anything to get a little cash  the two youths came out into the semidark hallway once more and on tiptoes crept toward the door of the room occupied by ward porton and the two men  i went all around the buildings and looked up and down the roadway but i couldnt see anything of them the former movingpicture actor was saying i guess they got cold feet when they saw those soldiers say those greasers certainly were a fiercelooking bunch  i dont believe they were any of general bilassas army returned william jarvey they were probably some detachment out for whatever they could lay their hands on and he chuckled coarsely evidently he considered that such guerrilla warfare under certain circumstances was perfectly justifiable  following this there was some talk which neither of those outside the door could catch then came a rather loud exclamation from ward porton which startled our friends more than anything else that could have been said  well now look here dad cried the former movingpicture actor you let me run this affair i started it and i know i can put it through successfully  thats right jarvey broke in packard brown let your son go ahead and work this deal out to suit himself he seems to have made a success of it so fargetting the best of that fellow crapsey and the speaker chuckled  dave and roger looked at each other knowingly here indeed was a revelation evidently ward porton was the son of the man they knew as william jarvey  my gracious i remember now burst out our hero in a low tone when we went to burlington to see that old man obadiah jones about ward dont you remember that he told us that ward was the son of a goodfornothing lieutenant in the army named jarvey porton that man pankhurst who was captured declared that jarvey was living under an assumed name and had been an officer in the army it must be true roger this fellow is really jarvey porton and he is ward portons father     chapter xxix  the capture   what dave said concerning the man he had known as william jarvey was true he was in reality ward portons father his full name being william jarvey porton years before however on entering the united states army he had dropped the name william and been known only as jarvey porton later on being dismissed from the army for irregularities in his accounts he had assumed the name of william jarvey  a lively discussion lasting several minutes and which our hero and roger failed to catch followed the discovery of jarvey portons identity then the listeners heard the former lieutenant say  brown i think you had better go outside and watch to make sure that no one is coming to this place  all right just as you say was the other mans answer evidently he understood that this was a hint that jarvey porton wished to speak to his son in private  as packard brown placed his hand on the door leading to the semidark hallway dave and roger lost no time in tiptoeing their way back to the closet in which they had before hidden from this place they saw brown leave the room and walk outside then they returned to their position at the door  are you sure the cases are in a safe place ward they heard jarvey porton ask anxiously  sure of it dad i hid them with great care  are you sure nobody saw you do it  not a soul  where was the place  on a high knoll not far from where we have been tying up the boats answered ward porton there are a number of big rocks there and i found a fine cache between them  its rather dangerous to leave them around that way grumbled the man maybe you would have done better if you had brought them over here  i thought there would be no use in carting them back and forth returned the son i wanted to have them handy in case the basswoods met my demands  well well see what comes of it ward i hope we do get that money i certainly need some and jarvey porton heaved something of a sigh evidently father and son were equally unscrupulous and took no pains to disguise that fact from each other  more talk followed ward telling something of the way in which the miniatures had been obtained and his father relating the particulars of his troubles with the mentor construction company in the midst of the latter recital dave and roger heard packard brown returning on the run  hi there called out the man in evident alarm and then as the two chums hid in the closet once more he burst into the room occupied by the portons those greasers are coming back and they are heading for this place he explained  in that case we had better get out answered jarvey porton quickly  but you and brown helped them in that raid dad interposed the son why should you get out  we had a big quarrel after that raid ward explained the parent and now those greasers have no use for us well have to get out and in a hurry too  shouting could now be heard at a distance and this was followed by a volley of shots which surprised all the listeners  ill tell you what it must be said jarvey porton as he led the way from the deserted ranch a detachment from the regular army must be after general bilassas crowd maybe theyll have a fight right here along the border  i dont want to get mixed up in any fight exclaimed ward porton maybe we had better get back to the united states side of the river  thats the talk put in packard brown come on  all left the ranch and headed directly for the river at the point where ward had left his flatbottomed rowboat dave and roger followed them but did their best to keep out of sight in the tall grass  oh dave i hope they do go over to the other shore exclaimed the senators son it will be so much easier to capture them  exactly roger and dont you remember what ward told his fatherthat he had left the miniature cases hidden on the other side he said they were on a high knoll not far from where the boats had been tied up we ought to be able to find that cache  by the time the two chums gained the shore of the rio grande those ahead of them had already entered ward portons boat ward and brown each had an oar and rowed as rapidly as possible to the other side of the stream jarvey porton sat in the stern of the craft and looked back from time to time trying to catch sight of the guerrillas and the other mexicans who were still shouting and firing at a distance  hadnt you better hold back a bit dave so they dont see you questioned roger as he and our hero managed to gain the rowboat they had used which fortunately had been placed some distance away from the other craft  good advice roger if it wasnt for one thing i dont want to give them a chance to get out of our sight let us tie our handkerchiefs over the lower parts of our faces then they wont be able to recognize usat least unless we get pretty close  with daves suggestion carried out the chums leaped into the rowboat and this done each took an oar they pulled hard and as a consequence reached the mouth of the little creek on the united states side in time to see those ahead just disembarking  where do you suppose they are going queried the senators son  that remains to be found out answered dave duck now so they wont see us and with a quick motion of the oar he possessed he sent the flatbottomed boat in among some tall grass which bordered the creek at this point  ward porton and those with him had tied up their boat and were walking to the higher ground away from the creek jarvey porton paused to look back along the creek and the bosom of the river beyond  i dont see anything on the river just now he announced  look some one is coming from the other way exclaimed his son suddenly  is that lawson the ranchman questioned packard brown anxiously  no i dont think it is answered ward porton they seem to be strangers he added a minute later  two men and a wellgrown boy were approaching they came on slowly as if looking for some one  id like to know what those fellows want around here came from jarvey porton as he gave up looking along the river to inspect the newcomers  from their position in the tall grass bordering the creek dave and roger looked from the porton party to those who were approaching then of a sudden our hero uttered a low exclamation of surprise  look whos here roger ben basswood and my uncle dunston and mr andrews is with them  oh dave are you sure  of course i am i would know my uncle dunston as far as i could see him and you ought to know ben  my gracious dave youre right this sure is luck  i know what im going to do decided our hero quickly im going to send both of the boats adrift then no matter what happens those rascals wont have any easy time of it getting back to mexico  in feverish haste dave sent the flatbottomed boat out into the creek once more roger assisted him and a few strokes of the oars brought the craft alongside of that which had been used by the porton party then the chums leaped ashore threw all the oars into the water and set both of the rowboats adrift  hi there what are you fellows up to came suddenly from packard brown who had happened to look behind him see jarvey those two fellows have cast our boat adrift  who are they demanded jarvey porton and looked in some bewilderment at the two figures approaching each with a handkerchief tied over the lower portion of the face  uncle dunston ben cried dave at the top of his lungs and at the same time whipped the handkerchief from his face here are ward porton and his father we must capture them  hurry up dont let them get away put in roger as he too uncovered his face  as he uttered the words roger drew his pistol an action which was quickly followed by our hero for both understood that the criminals before them might prove desperate  of course dunston porton and ben basswood as well as frank andrews were greatly astonished by the calls from dave and roger but our heros uncle while out hunting in various parts of the world had been in many a tight corner and thus learned the value of acting quickly he had with him his pistol and almost instantly he drew this weapon and came forward on the run with ben and frank andrews at his heels  stop stop dont shoot yelled ward porton in alarm as he found himself and his companions surrounded by five others three with drawn pistols  we wont shoot porton if youll surrender answered dave  oh dave has he got those miniatures burst out ben  he sure has ben  good  i havent got any miniatures growled the former movingpicture actor  his father and brown looked decidedly uncomfortable once the former army officer made a motion as if to draw his own weapon but dunston porter detected the movement and instantly ordered all of the party to throw up their hands  oh dave are you sure he has those pictures queried ben and his face showed his anxiety  i think so ben however well find out as soon as we have made them prisoners  thats the talk put in roger he turned to daves uncle cant you bind them or something so that they cant get away  well disarm them announced frank andrews jarvey and brown are wanted for that raid on old man tolmans ranch and for using that bomb on the bridge we can prove through pankhurst that they were with the party  that man is ward portons father explained dave to his uncle and ben while the evildoers were being searched and disarmed one after another  ward portons father eh well they seem to be two of a kind answered ben  with their weapons taken from them the prisoners could do nothing but submit they were questioned but all refused to tell anything about what they had done or intended to do  youll never get anything out of me and youll never get those miniatures back growled ward porton as he gazed sourly at ben and at dave  well see about that porton answered our hero and then he requested his uncle and frank andrews to keep an eye on the prisoners while he roger and ben set out for the knoll some distance away from the creek  ward porton said he had hidden some cases in a cache between some rocks on that knoll explained our hero by cases i think he meant those containing the miniatures  oh i hope he did returned ben wistfully to get those miniatures back means so much to my folks     chapter xxx  the fortune recoveredconclusion   as dave roger and ben tramped through the tall grass to where was located a knoll of considerable size the son of the crumville real estate dealer related how he and dunston porter had arrived in the construction camp and how they had gotten frank andrews to show them in what direction our hero and the senators son had gone  we knew you were after porton and we hoped to catch sight of that rascal went on ben but we didnt dream that we were going to capture ward and also those two men who are wanted for that raid on the tolman ranch and to think that one of the men is wards father he certainly must be a bad egg  he is ben answered dave and ward is a chip of the old block  the chums were soon ascending the knoll containing many rocks between which were dense clumps of chaparral here they had to advance with care so as not to turn an ankle or get their clothing torn  dave had hoped that the search for the missing cases would be an easy one but in that he was disappointed the three chums walked all around the knoll several times without getting anything in the way of a clue as to where portons cache was located  its a shame burst out roger at length if we could only he looked quickly at dave what do you see  our hero did not reply instead he hurried forward several feet and then gave a low cry  porton has been here he exclaimed and held up a halfburned cigarette  it was not much of a clue but it was something and working on this all three of the youths searched the vicinity diligently they soon came upon a somewhat flat rock and all seized hold of this to cast it to one side  hurrah came simultaneously from dave and roger as they saw a large opening under where the stone had been placed  ben said nothing but plunged his hand into the opening to draw from it an instant later one of the cases that had contained the enos miniatures the other cases quickly followed  are the miniatures in them questioned the senators son  thats what im going to find out answered ben  the cases were fastened by several catches but these were quickly unfastened and the lids thrown open  good good exclaimed ben and his face showed his intense satisfaction  there before the eyes of the youths were nearly all of the wonderful collection of miniatures which mr basswood had inherited only two were missingthose which the thieves had sold in new york  oh this is simply grand cried roger enthusiastically  thats what it is added dave and then went on quickly well have to get these to some safe place and then make sure that theyll never be stolen again  dont you worry about that dave i wont let them out of my sight until they are safe and sound declared the real estate dealers son  locking up the cases once more the three youths carried them off the knoll and through the chaparral to where they had left dunston porter and the others of course daves uncle was much gratified to learn that the miniatures had been recovered and frank andrews was also pleased jarvey porton looked downcast and his son showed his deep disgust  i was a fool not to take them over into mexico remarked the former movingpicture actor  well i told you that was what you should have done retorted his father and then he added in a low tone we might have purchased our freedom with those miniatures  while dunston porter and frank andrews looked after the prisoners to see that they did not get away dave and his chums took care of the cases containing the precious miniatures and thus the whole party made its way to the engineering and construction camp there the portons and packard brown were handcuffed and word was sent to the authorities to take charge of them  and now ive got to send word home about this good news cried ben and lost no time in getting off a long telegram to his folks and asking them to inform daves father and the wadsworths by telephone of the success of the trip to texas  that message ought to do your father more good than a dose of medicine remarked dave  it will dave answered ben his face beaming i know father will recover now that he has nothing more to worry about ben was right the recovery of the fortune in miniatures did much toward restoring the real estate dealer to his former good health  in the camp it was remarked by a number of men how much ward porton resembled dave but no one at that time dreamed that this resemblance was shortly to come to an end yet such was a fact when being transferred from texas to the state in which his crimes had been committed ward porton attempted to make his escape by leaping from a rapidly moving railroad train as a consequence he broke not only both of his legs but also his nose and cut his right cheek most frightfully as a result when he was retaken he had to remain in the hospital for a long time and when he came out his face was much disfigured and he walked with a decided limp  its too bad but he brought it on himself was daves comment when he heard of this  its a good thing in one respect was rogers reply with his nose broken and his cheek disfigured and with such a limp no one will ever take ward porton for you again  it may be mentioned here that when the proper time came ward porton and tim crapsey were brought to trial and each was given a long term of imprisonment wards father and the other men who had participated in the attack on the tolman ranch and on the bridge and had been captured were also severely punished  the storekeepers and the hotelkeeper who suffered through ward portons misrepresentations could get nothing from the young culprit but they had the satisfaction of knowing that he had now been put where it would be impossible for him to dupe others  ben basswood remained at the camp but a few days and then he and dunston porter started northward the miniatures had been boxed up and shipped by express insured for their full value it may be stated here that they arrived safely at their destination those which had been disposed of in new york city were recovered and in the end mr basswood disposed of the entire collection to the museums in four of our large cities for the sum of seventyfive thousand dollars with part of this money he went into several heavy real estate deals taking ben in with him and father and son did very well  i think the getting back of those miniatures was entirely your work dave declared roger one day  i dont know about that answered our hero modestly i think you had a hand in it  i had a hand in catching ward porton but you were the one to spot that cache and locate the basswood fortune                                                  and now let me add a few words more and then bring to an end this story of dave porter and his double  a number of years have passed since dave graduated from oak hall and took up the profession of a civil engineer both he and roger learned rapidly and at the end of the required time both passed their final examinations with flying colors they remained with the mentor construction company journeying all over the united states and also going down into mexico and into central and south americas they of course met with numerous adventures some of which i may relate to you at a future time they returned to crumville a number of times and during those visits dave was more attentive to jessie than ever while roger spent nearly all his time at lauras side  theyll make a fine pair of married couples declared daves uncle dunston  well i hope theyll be happy answered daves father they certainly deserve to be  you are right but i guess they had better wait awhile yet  of course they are young and dave and roger want to get a good foothold in their profession  those boys have had some strenuous doings continued the uncle i wonder what will happen next  something thats certain answered daves father and he was right as will be related in my next volume to be entitled dave porters great search or the perils of a young civil engineer in that book we will meet all our young friends again and learn the particulars of jessie wadsworths strange disappearance  great days thoseon the rio grande dave remarked roger one day when the two had been discussing what had taken place in the past  yes roger they certainly were great days answered our hero no matter what exciting times may come in the future ill never forget how i helped to capture my double  and how we managed to become fullfledged civil engineers dave  yes that was just as good as getting back the basswood miniatures if not better answered dave  here at the height of his success in his chosen profession we will wish dave porter well and say goodbye  the end
