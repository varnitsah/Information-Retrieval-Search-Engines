74481856	a little whimsy now and then makes for good balance     theoretically you could find this type of humor anywhere but     only a topflight sciencefictionist we thought could have     written this story in just this way     the eyes have it  by philip k dick   it was quite by accident i discovered this incredible invasion of earth by lifeforms from another planet as yet i havent done anything about it i cant think of anything to do i wrote to the government and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and maintenance of frame houses anyhow the whole thing is known im not the first to discover it maybe its even under control  i was sitting in my easychair idly turning the pages of a paperbacked book someone had left on the bus when i came across the reference that first put me on the trail for a moment i didnt respond it took some time for the full import to sink in after id comprehended it seemed odd i hadnt noticed it right away  the reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible properties not indigenous to earth a species i hasten to point out customarily masquerading as ordinary human beings their disguise however became transparent in the face of the following observations by the author it was at once obvious the author knew everything knew everythingand was taking it in his stride the line and i tremble remembering it even now read       his eyes slowly roved about the room  vague chills assailed me i tried to picture the eyes did they roll like dimes the passage indicated not they seemed to move through the air not over the surface rather rapidly apparently no one in the story was surprised thats what tipped me off no sign of amazement at such an outrageous thing later the matter was amplified       his eyes moved from person to person  there it was in a nutshell the eyes had clearly come apart from the rest of him and were on their own my heart pounded and my breath choked in my windpipe i had stumbled on an accidental mention of a totally unfamiliar race obviously nonterrestrial yet to the characters in the book it was perfectly naturalwhich suggested they belonged to the same species  and the author a slow suspicion burned in my mind the author was taking it rather too easily in his stride evidently he felt this was quite a usual thing he made absolutely no attempt to conceal this knowledge the story continued       presently his eyes fastened on julia  julia being a lady had at least the breeding to feel indignant she is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily at this i sighed with relief they werent all nonterrestrials the narrative continues       slowly calmly his eyes examined every inch of her  great scott but here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter ended i lay back in my chair gasping with horror my wife and family regarded me in wonder  whats wrong dear my wife asked  i couldnt tell her knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary runofthemill person i had to keep it to myself nothing i gasped i leaped up snatched the book and hurried out of the room                                       in the garage i continued reading there was more trembling i read the next revealing passage       he put his arm around julia presently she asked him if     he would remove his arm he immediately did so with a smile  its not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed it maybe it was left standing upright in the corner maybe it was thrown away i dont care in any case the full meaning was there staring me right in the face  here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their anatomy at will eyes armsand maybe more without batting an eyelash my knowledge of biology came in handy at this point obviously they were simple beings unicellular some sort of primitive singlecelled things beings no more developed than starfish starfish can do the same thing you know  i read on and came to this incredible revelation tossed off coolly by the author without the faintest tremor       outside the movie theater we split up part of us went     inside part over to the cafe for dinner  binary fission obviously splitting in half and forming two entities probably each lower half went to the cafe it being farther and the upper halves to the movies i read on hands shaking i had really stumbled onto something here my mind reeled as i made out this passage       im afraid theres no doubt about it poor bibney has     lost his head again  which was followed by       and bob says he has utterly no guts  yet bibney got around as well as the next person the next person however was just as strange he was soon described as       totally lacking in brains                                       there was no doubt of the thing in the next passage julia whom i had thought to be the one normal person reveals herself as also being an alien life form similar to the rest       quite deliberately julia had given her heart to the     young man  it didnt relate what the final disposition of the organ was but i didnt really care it was evident julia had gone right on living in her usual manner like all the others in the book without heart arms eyes brains viscera dividing up in two when the occasion demanded without a qualm       thereupon she gave him her hand  i sickened the rascal now had her hand as well as her heart i shudder to think what hes done with them by this time       he took her arm  not content to wait he had to start dismantling her on his own flushing crimson i slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet but not in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of anatomy whose travels had originally thrown me on the track       her eyes followed him all the way down the road and     across the meadow  i rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house as if the accursed things were following me my wife and children were playing monopoly in the kitchen i joined them and played with frantic fervor brow feverish teeth chattering  i had had enough of the thing i want to hear no more about it let them come on let them invade earth i dont want to get mixed up in it  i have absolutely no stomach for it
