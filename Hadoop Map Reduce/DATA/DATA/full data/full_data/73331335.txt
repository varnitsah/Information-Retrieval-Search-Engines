73331335	fanshawe  by  nathaniel hawthorne   illustration    introductory note  fanshawe  in 1828 three years after graduating from bowdoin college hawthorne published his first romance fanshawe it was issued at boston by marsh  capen but made little or no impression on the public the motto on the titlepage of the original was from southey wilt thou go on with me  afterwards when he had struck into the vein of fiction that came to be known as distinctively his own he attempted to suppress this youthful work and was so successful that he obtained and destroyed all but a few of the copies then extant  some twelve years after his death it was resolved in view of the interest manifested in tracing the growth of his genius from the beginning of his activity as an author to revive this youthful romance and the reissue of fanshawe was then made  little biographical interest attaches to it beyond the fact that mr longfellow found in the descriptions and general atmosphere of the book a decided suggestion of the situation of bowdoin college at brunswick maine and the life there at the time when he and hawthorne were both undergraduates of that institution  professor packard of bowdoin college who was then in charge of the study of english literature and has survived both of his illustrious pupils recalls hawthornes exceptional excellence in the composition of english even at that date 18211825 and it is not impossible that hawthorne intended through the character of fanshawe to present some faint projection of what he then thought might be his own obscure history even while he was in college however and meditating perhaps the slender elements of this first romance his fellowstudent horatio bridge whose journal of an african cruiser he afterwards edited recognized in him the possibilities of a writer of fictiona fact to which hawthorne alludes in the dedicatory preface to the snowimage  g p l    fanshawe                                         chapter i    our court shall be a little academeshakespeare   in an ancient though not very populous settlement in a retired corner of one of the new england states arise the walls of a seminary of learning which for the convenience of a name shall be entitled harley college this institution though the number of its years is inconsiderable compared with the hoar antiquity of its european sisters is not without some claims to reverence on the score of age for an almost countless multitude of rivals by many of which its reputation has been eclipsed have sprung up since its foundation at no time indeed during an existence of nearly a century has it acquired a very extensive fame and circumstances which need not be particularized have of late years involved it in a deeper obscurity there are now few candidates for the degrees that the college is authorized to bestow on two of its annual commencement days there has been a total deficiency of baccalaureates and the lawyers and divines on whom doctorates in their respective professions are gratuitously inflicted are not accustomed to consider the distinction as an honor yet the sons of this seminary have always maintained their full share of reputation in whatever paths of life they trod few of them perhaps have been deep and finished scholars but the college has suppliedwhat the emergencies of the country demandeda set of men more useful in its present state and whose deficiency in theoretical knowledge has not been found to imply a want of practical ability  the local situation of the college so far secluded from the sight and sound of the busy world is peculiarly favorable to the moral if not to the literary habits of its students and this advantage probably caused the founders to overlook the inconveniences that were inseparably connected with it the humble edifices rear themselves almost at the farthest extremity of a narrow vale which winding through a long extent of hillcountry is wellnigh as inaccessible except at one point as the happy valley of abyssinia a stream that farther on becomes a considerable river takes its rise at a short distance above the college and affords along its woodfringed banks many shady retreats where even study is pleasant and idleness delicious the neighborhood of the institution is not quite a solitude though the few habitations scarcely constitute a village these consist principally of farmhouses of rather an ancient date for the settlement is much older than the college and of a little inn which even in that secluded spot does not fail of a moderate support other dwellings are scattered up and down the valley but the difficulties of the soil will long avert the evils of a too dense population the character of the inhabitants does not seemas there was perhaps room to anticipateto be in any degree influenced by the atmosphere of harley college they are a set of rough and hardy yeomen much inferior as respects refinement to the corresponding classes in most other parts of our country this is the more remarkable as there is scarcely a family in the vicinity that has not provided for at least one of its sons the advantages of a liberal education  having thus described the present state of harley college we must proceed to speak of it as it existed about eighty years since when its foundation was recent and its prospects flattering at the head of the institution at this period was a learned and orthodox divine whose fame was in all the churches he was the author of several works which evinced much erudition and depth of research and the public perhaps thought the more highly of his abilities from a singularity in the purposes to which he applied them that added much to the curiosity of his labors though little to their usefulness but however fanciful might be his private pursuits dr melmoth it was universally allowed was diligent and successful in the arts of instruction the young men of his charge prospered beneath his eye and regarded him with an affection that was strengthened by the little foibles which occasionally excited their ridicule the president was assisted in the discharge of his duties by two inferior officers chosen from the alumni of the college who while they imparted to others the knowledge they had already imbibed pursued the study of divinity under the direction of their principal under such auspices the institution grew and flourished having at that time but two rivals in the country neither of them within a considerable distance it became the general resort of the youth of the province in which it was situated for several years in succession its students amounted to nearly fiftya number which relatively to the circumstances of the country was very considerable  from the exterior of the collegians an accurate observer might pretty safely judge how long they had been inmates of those classic walls the brown cheeks and the rustic dress of some would inform him that they had but recently left the plough to labor in a not less toilsome field the grave look and the intermingling of garments of a more classic cut would distinguish those who had begun to acquire the polish of their new residence and the air of superiority the paler cheek the less robust form the spectacles of green and the dress in general of threadbare black would designate the highest class who were understood to have acquired nearly all the science their alma mater could bestow and to be on the point of assuming their stations in the world there were it is true exceptions to this general description a few young men had found their way hither from the distant seaports and these were the models of fashion to their rustic companions over whom they asserted a superiority in exterior accomplishments which the fresh though unpolished intellect of the sons of the forest denied them in their literary competitions a third class differing widely from both the former consisted of a few young descendants of the aborigines to whom an impracticable philanthropy was endeavoring to impart the benefits of civilization  if this institution did not offer all the advantages of elder and prouder seminaries its deficiencies were compensated to its students by the inculcation of regular habits and of a deep and awful sense of religion which seldom deserted them in their course through life the mild and gentle rule of dr melmoth like that of a father over his children was more destructive to vice than a sterner sway and though youth is never without its follies they have seldom been more harmless than they were here the students indeed ignorant of their own bliss sometimes wished to hasten the time of their entrance on the business of life but they found in afteryears that many of their happiest remembrances many of the scenes which they would with least reluctance live over again referred to the seat of their early studies the exceptions to this remark were chiefly those whose vices had drawn down even from that paternal government a weighty retribution  dr melmoth at the time when he is to be introduced to the reader had borne the matrimonial yoke and in his case it was no light burden nearly twenty years the blessing of children however had been denied hima circumstance which he was accustomed to consider as one of the sorest trials that checkered his pathway for he was a man of a kind and affectionate heart that was continually seeking objects to rest itself upon he was inclined to believe also that a common offspring would have exerted a meliorating influence on the temper of mrs melmoth the character of whose domestic government often compelled him to call to mind such portions of the wisdom of antiquity as relate to the proper endurance of the shrewishness of woman but domestic comforts as well as comforts of every other kind have their drawbacks and so long as the balance is on the side of happiness a wise man will not murmur such was the opinion of dr melmoth and with a little aid from philosophy and more from religion he journeyed on contentedly through life when the storm was loud by the parlor hearth he had always a sure and quiet retreat in his study and there in his deep though not always useful labors he soon forgot whatever of disagreeable nature pertained to his situation this small and dark apartment was the only portion of the house to which since one firmly repelled invasion mrs melmoths omnipotence did not extend here to reverse the words of queen elizabeth there was but one master and no mistress and that man has little right to complain who possesses so much as one corner in the world where he may be happy or miserable as best suits him in his study then the doctor was accustomed to spend most of the hours that were unoccupied by the duties of his station the flight of time was here as swift as the wind and noiseless as the snow flake and it was a sure proof of real happiness that night often came upon the student before he knew it was midday  dr melmoth was wearing towards age having lived nearly sixty years when he was called upon to assume a character to which he had as yet been a stranger he had possessed in his youth a very dear friend with whom his education had associated him and who in his early manhood had been his chief intimate circumstances however had separated them for nearly thirty years half of which had been spent by his friend who was engaged in mercantile pursuits in a foreign country the doctor had nevertheless retained a warm interest in the welfare of his old associate though the different nature of their thoughts and occupations had prevented them from corresponding after a silence of so long continuance therefore he was surprised by the receipt of a letter from his friend containing a request of a most unexpected nature  mr langton had married rather late in life and his wedded bliss had been but of short continuance certain misfortunes in trade when he was a benedict of three years standing had deprived him of a large portion of his property and compelled him in order to save the remainder to leave his own country for what he hoped would be but a brief residence in another but though he was successful in the immediate objects of his voyage circumstances occurred to lengthen his stay far beyond the period which he had assigned to it it was difficult so to arrange his extensive concerns that they could be safely trusted to the management of others and when this was effected there was another not less powerful obstacle to his return his affairs under his own inspection were so prosperous and his gains so considerable that in the words of the old ballad he set his heart to gather gold and to this absorbing passion he sacrificed his domestic happiness the death of his wife about four years after his departure undoubtedly contributed to give him a sort of dread of returning which it required a strong effort to overcome the welfare of his only child he knew would be little affected by this event for she was under the protection of his sister of whose tenderness he was well assured but after a few more years this sister also was taken away by death and then the father felt that duty imperatively called upon him to return he realized on a sudden how much of life he had thrown away in the acquisition of what is only valuable as it contributes to the happiness of life and how short a tune was left him for lifes true enjoyments still however his mercantile habits were too deeply seated to allow him to hazard his present prosperity by any hasty measures nor was mr langton though capable of strong affections naturally liable to manifest them violently it was probable therefore that many months might yet elapse before he would again tread the shores of his native country  but the distant relative in whose family since the death of her aunt ellen langton had remained had been long at variance with her father and had unwillingly assumed the office of her protector mr langtons request therefore to dr melmoth was that his ancient friend one of the few friends that time had left him would be as a father to his daughter till he could himself relieve him of the charge  the doctor after perusing the epistle of his friend lost no time in laying it before mrs melmoth though this was in truth one of the very few occasions on which he had determined that his will should be absolute law the lady was quick to perceive the firmness of his purpose and would not even had she been particularly averse to the proposed measure hazard her usual authority by a fruitless opposition but by long disuse she had lost the power of consenting graciously to any wish of her husbands  i see your heart is set upon this matter she observed and in truth i fear we cannot decently refuse mr langtons request i see little good of such a friend doctor who never lets one know he is alive till he has a favor to ask  nay but i have received much good at his hand replied dr melmoth and if he asked more of me it should be done with a willing heart i remember in my youth when my worldly goods were few and ill managed i was a bachelor then dearest sarah with none to look after my household how many times i have been beholden to him and seein his letter he speaks of presents of the produce of the country which he has sent both to you and me  if the girl were countrybred continued the lady we might give her houseroom and no harm done nay she might even be a help to me for esther our maidservant leaves us at the mouths end but i warrant she knows as little of household matters as you do yourself doctor  my friends sister was well grounded in the re familiari answered her husband and doubtless she hath imparted somewhat of her skill to this damsel besides the child is of tender years and will profit much by your instruction and mine  the child is eighteen years of age doctor observed mrs melmoth and she has cause to be thankful that she will have better instruction than yours  this was a proposition that dr melmoth did not choose to dispute though he perhaps thought that his long and successful experience in the education of the other sex might make him an able coadjutor to his wife in the care of ellen langton he determined to journey in person to the seaport where his young charge resided leaving the concerns of harley college to the direction of the two tutors mrs melmoth who indeed anticipated with pleasure the arrival of a new subject to her authority threw no difficulties in the way of his intention to do her justice her preparations for his journey and the minute instructions with which she favored him were such as only a womans true affection could have suggested the traveller met with no incidents important to this tale and after an absence of about a fortnight he and ellen alighted from their steeds for on horseback had the journey been performed in safety at his own door  if pen could give an adequate idea of ellen langtons loveliness it would achieve what pencil the pencils at least of the colonial artists who attempted it never could for though the dark eyes might be painted the pure and pleasant thoughts that peeped through them could only be seen and felt but descriptions of beauty are never satisfactory it must therefore be left to the imagination of the reader to conceive of something not more than mortal nor indeed quite the perfection of mortality but charming men the more because they felt that lovely as she was she was of like nature to themselves  from the time that ellen entered dr melmoths habitation the sunny days seemed brighter and the cloudy ones less gloomy than he had ever before known them he naturally delighted in children and ellen though her years approached to womanhood had yet much of the gayety and simple happiness because the innocence of a child she consequently became the very blessing of his lifethe rich recreation that he promised himself for hours of literary toil on one occasion indeed he even made her his companion in the sacred retreat of his study with the purpose of entering upon a course of instruction in the learned languages this measure however he found inexpedient to repeat for ellen having discovered an old romance among his heavy folios contrived by the charm of her sweet voice to engage his attention therein till all more important concerns were forgotten  with mrs melmoth ellen was not of course so great a favorite as with her husband for women cannot so readily as men bestow upon the offspring of others those affections that nature intended for their own and the doctors extraordinary partiality was anything rather than a pledge of his wifes but ellen differed so far from the idea she had previously formed of her as a daughter of one of the principal merchants who were then as now like nobles in the land that the stock of dislike which mrs melmoth had provided was found to be totally inapplicable the young stranger strove so hard too and undoubtedly it was a pleasant labor to win her love that she was successful to a degree of which the lady herself was not perhaps aware it was soon seen that her education had not been neglected in those points which mrs melmoth deemed most important the nicer departments of cookery after sufficient proof of her skill were committed to her care and the doctors table was now covered with delicacies simple indeed but as tempting on account of their intrinsic excellence as of the small white hands that made them by such arts as thesewhich in her were no arts but the dictates of an affectionate dispositionby making herself useful where it was possible and agreeable on all occasions ellen gained the love of everyone within the sphere of her influence  but the maidens conquests were not confined to the members of dr melmoths family she had numerous admirers among those whose situation compelled them to stand afar off and gaze upon her loveliness as if she were a star whose brightness they saw but whose warmth they could not feel these were the young men of harley college whose chief opportunities of beholding ellen were upon the sabbaths when she worshipped with them in the little chapel which served the purposes of a church to all the families of the vicinity there was about this period and the fact was undoubtedly attributable to ellens influence a general and very evident decline in the scholarship of the college especially in regard to the severer studies the intellectual powers of the young men seemed to be directed chiefly to the construction of latin and greek verse many copies of which with a characteristic and classic gallantry were strewn in the path where ellen langton was accustomed to walk they however produced no perceptible effect nor were the aspirations of another ambitious youth who celebrated her perfections in hebrew attended with their merited success  but there was one young man to whom circumstances independent of his personal advantages afforded a superior opportunity of gaining ellens favor he was nearly related to dr melmoth on which account he received his education at harley college rather than at one of the english universities to the expenses of which his fortune would have been adequate this connection entitled him to a frequent and familiar access to the domestic hearth of the dignitaryan advantage of which since ellen langton became a member of the family he very constantly availed himself  edward walcott was certainly much superior in most of the particulars of which a lady takes cognizance to those of his fellowstudents who had come under ellens notice he was tall and the natural grace of his manners had been improved an advantage which few of his associates could boast by early intercourse with polished society his features also were handsome and promised to be manly and dignified when they should cease to be youthful his character as a scholar was more than respectable though many youthful follies sometimes perhaps approaching near to vices were laid to his charge but his occasional derelictions from discipline were not such as to create any very serious apprehensions respecting his future welfare nor were they greater than perhaps might be expected from a young man who possessed a considerable command of money and who was besides the fine gentleman of the little community of which he was a membera character which generally leads its possessor into follies that he would otherwise have avoided  with this youth ellen langton became familiar and even intimate for he was her only companion of an age suited to her own and the difference of sex did not occur to her as an objection he was her constant companion on all necessary and allowable occasions and drew upon himself in consequence the envy of the college    chapter ii    why all delights are vain but that most vain   which with pain purchased doth inherit pain     as painfully to pore upon a book       to seek the light of truth while truth the while     doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look        shakespeare   on one of the afternoons which afforded to the students a relaxation from their usual labors ellen was attended by her cavalier in a little excursion over the rough bridleroads that led from her new residence she was an experienced equestriana necessary accomplishment at that period when vehicles of every kind were rare it was now the latter end of spring but the season had hitherto been backward with only a few warm and pleasant days the present afternoon however was a delicious mingling of spring and summer forming in their union an atmosphere so mild and pure that to breathe was almost a positive happiness there was a little alternation of cloud across the brow of heaven but only so much as to render the sunshine more delightful  the path of the young travellers lay sometimes among tall and thick standing trees and sometimes over naked and desolate hills whence man had taken the natural vegetation and then left the soil to its barrenness indeed there is little inducement to a cultivator to labor among the huge stones which there peep forth from the earth seeming to form a continued ledge for several miles a singular contrast to this unfavored tract of country is seen in the narrow but luxuriant though sometimes swampy strip of interval on both sides of the stream that as has been noticed flows down the valley the light and buoyant spirits of edward walcott and ellen rose higher as they rode on and their way was enlivened wherever its roughness did not forbid by their conversation and pleasant laughter but at length ellen drew her bridle as they emerged from a thick portion of the forest just at the foot of a steep hill  we must have ridden far she observedfarther than i thought it will be near sunset before we can reach home  there are still several hours of daylight replied edward walcott and we will not turn back without ascending this hill the prospect from the summit is beautiful and will be particularly so now in this rich sunlight come ellenone light touch of the whipyour pony is as fresh as when we started  on reaching the summit of the hill and looking back in the direction in which they had come they could see the little stream peeping forth many times to the daylight and then shrinking back into the shade farther on it became broad and deep though rendered incapable of navigation in this part of its course by the occasional interruption of rapids  there are hidden wonders of rock and precipice and cave in that dark forest said edward pointing to the space between them and the river if it were earlier in the day i should love to lead you there shall we try the adventure now ellen  oh no she replied let us delay no longer i fear i must even now abide a rebuke from mrs melmoth which i have surely deserved but who is this who rides on so slowly before us  she pointed to a horseman whom they had not before observed he was descending the hill but as his steed seemed to have chosen his own pace he made a very inconsiderable progress  oh do you not know him but it is scarcely possible you should exclaimed her companion we must do him the good office ellen of stopping his progress or he will find himself at the village a dozen miles farther on before he resumes his consciousness  has he then lost his senses inquired miss langton  not so ellenif much learning has not made him mad replied edward walcott he is a deep scholar and a noble fellow but i fear we shall follow him to his grave erelong dr melmoth has sent him to ride in pursuit of his health he will never overtake it however at this pace  as he spoke they had approached close to the subject of their conversation and ellen had a moments space for observation before he started from the abstraction in which he was plunged the result of her scrutiny was favorable yet very painful  the stranger could scarcely have attained his twentieth year and was possessed of a face and form such as nature bestows on none but her favorites there was a nobleness on his high forehead which time would have deepened into majesty and all his features were formed with a strength and boldness of which the paleness produced by study and confinement could not deprive them the expression of his countenance was not a melancholy one on the contrary it was proud and high perhaps triumphant like one who was a ruler in a world of his own and independent of the beings that surrounded him but a blight of which his thin pale cheek and the brightness of his eye were alike proofs seemed to have come over him ere his maturity  the scholars attention was now aroused by the hooftramps at his side and starting he fixed his eyes on ellen whose young and lovely countenance was full of the interest he had excited a deep blush immediately suffused his cheek proving how well the glow of health would have become it there was nothing awkward however in his manner and soon recovering his selfpossession he bowed to her and would have rode on  your ride is unusually long today fanshawe observed edward walcott when may we look for your return  the young man again blushed but answered with a smile that had a beautiful effect upon his countenance i was not at the moment aware in which direction my horses head was turned i have to thank you for arresting me in a journey which was likely to prove much longer than i intended  the party had now turned their horses and were about to resume their ride in a homeward direction but edward perceived that fanshawe having lost the excitement of intense thought now looked weary and dispirited  here is a cottage close at hand he observed we have ridden far and stand in need of refreshment ellen shall we alight  she saw the benevolent motive of his proposal and did not hesitate to comply with it but as they paused at the cottage door she could not but observe that its exterior promised few of the comforts which they required time and neglect seemed to have conspired for its ruin and but for a thin curl of smoke from its clay chimney they could not have believed it to be inhabited a considerable tract of land in the vicinity of the cottage had evidently been at some former period under cultivation but was now overrun by bushes and dwarf pines among which many huge gray rocks ineradicable by human art endeavored to conceal themselves about half an acre of ground was occupied by the young blades of indiancorn at which a halfstarved cow gazed wistfully over the mouldering logfence these were the only agricultural tokens edward walcott nevertheless drew the latch of the cottage door after knocking loudly but in vain  the apartment which was thus opened to their view was quite as wretched as its exterior had given them reason to anticipate poverty was there with all its necessary and unnecessary concomitants the intruders would have retired had not the hope of affording relief detained them  the occupants of the small and squalid apartment were two women both of them elderly and from the resemblance of their features appearing to be sisters the expression of their countenances however was very different one evidently the younger was seated on the farther side of the large hearth opposite to the door at which the party stood she had the sallow look of long and wasting illness and there was an unsteadiness of expression about her eyes that immediately struck the observer yet her face was mild and gentle therein contrasting widely with that of her companion  the other woman was bending over a small fire of decayed branches the flame of which was very disproportionate to the smoke scarcely producing heat sufficient for the preparation of a scanty portion of food her profile only was visible to the strangers though from a slight motion of her eye they perceived that she was aware of their presence her features were pinched and spare and wore a look of sullen discontent for which the evident wretchedness of her situation afforded a sufficient reason this female notwithstanding her years and the habitual fretfulness that is more wearing than time was apparently healthy and robust with a dry leathery complexion a short space elapsed before she thought proper to turn her face towards her visitors and she then regarded them with a lowering eye without speaking or rising from her chair  we entered edward walcott began to say in the hopebut he paused on perceiving that the sick woman had risen from her seat and with slow and tottering footsteps was drawing near to him she took his hand in both her own and though he shuddered at the touch of age and disease he did not attempt to withdraw it she then perused all his features with an expression at first of eager and hopeful anxiety which faded by degrees into disappointment then turning from him she gazed into fanshawes countenance with the like eagerness but with the same result lastly tottering back to her chair she hid her face and wept bitterly the strangers though they knew not the cause of her grief were deeply affected and ellen approached the mourner with words of comfort which more from their tone than their meaning produced a transient effect  do you bring news of him she inquired raising her head will he return to me shall i see him before i die ellen knew not what to answer and ere she could attempt it the other female prevented her  sister butler is wandering in her mind she said and speaks of one she will never behold again the sight of strangers disturbs her and you see we have nothing here to offer you  the manner of the woman was ungracious but her words were true they saw that their presence could do nothing towards the alleviation of the misery they witnessed and they felt that mere curiosity would not authorize a longer intrusion so soon therefore as they had relieved according to their power the poverty that seemed to be the least evil of this cottage they emerged into the open air  the breath of heaven felt sweet to them and removed a part of the weight from their young hearts which were saddened by the sight of so much wretchedness perceiving a pure and bright little fountain at a short distance from the cottage they approached it and using the bark of a birchtree as a cup partook of its cool waters they then pursued their homeward ride with such diligence that just as the sun was setting they came in sight of the humble wooden edifice which was dignified with the name of harley college a golden ray rested upon the spire of the little chapel the bell of which sent its tinkling murmur down the valley to summon the wanderers to evening prayers  fanshawe returned to his chamber that night and lighted his lamp as he had been wont to do the books were around him which had hitherto been to him like those fabled volumes of magic from which the reader could not turn away his eye till death were the consequence of his studies but there were unaccustomed thoughts in his bosom now and to these leaning his head on one of the unopened volumes he resigned himself  he called up in review the years that even at his early age he had spent in solitary study in conversation with the dead while he had scorned to mingle with the living world or to be actuated by any of its motives he asked himself to what purpose was all this destructive labor and where was the happiness of superior knowledge he had climbed but a few steps of a ladder that reached to infinity he had thrown away his life in discovering that after a thousand such lives he should still know comparatively nothing he even looked forward with dreadthough once the thought had been dear to himto the eternity of improvement that lay before him it seemed now a weary way without a restingplace and without a termination and at that moment he would have preferred the dreamless sleep of the brutes that perish to mans proudest attributeof immortality  fanshawe had hitherto deemed himself unconnected with the world unconcerned in its feelings and uninfluenced by it in any of his pursuits in this respect he probably deceived himself if his inmost heart could have been laid open there would have been discovered that dream of undying fame which dream as it is is more powerful than a thousand realities but at any rate he had seemed to others and to himself a solitary being upon whom the hopes and fears of ordinary men were ineffectual  but now he felt the first thrilling of one of the many ties that so long as we breathe the common air and who shall say how much longer unite us to our kind the sound of a soft sweet voice the glance of a gentle eye had wrought a change upon him and in his ardent mind a few hours had done the work of many almost in spite of himself the new sensation was inexpressibly delightful the recollection of his ruined health of his habits so much at variance with those of the worldall the difficulties that reason suggested were inadequate to check the exulting tide of hope and joy    chapter iii    and let the aspiring youth beware of love   of the smooth glance beware for tis too late   when on his heart the torrent softness pours   then wisdom prostrate lies and fading fame   dissolves in air away      thomson   a few months passed over the heads of ellen langton and her admirers unproductive of events that separately were of sufficient importance to be related the summer was now drawing to a close and dr melmoth had received information that his friends arrangements were nearly completed and that by the next homebound ship he hoped to return to his native country the arrival of that ship was daily expected  during the time that had elapsed since his first meeting with ellen there had been a change yet not a very remarkable one in fanshawes habits he was still the same solitary being so far as regarded his own sex and he still confined himself as sedulously to his chamber except for one hour the sunset hourof every day at that period unless prevented by the inclemency of the weather he was accustomed to tread a path that wound along the banks of the stream he had discovered that this was the most frequent scene of ellens walks and this it was that drew him thither  their intercourse was at first extremely slighta bow on the one side a smile on the other and a passing word from both and then the student hurried back to his solitude but in course of time opportunities occurred for more extended conversation so that at the period with which this chapter is concerned fanshawe was almost as constantly as edward walcott himself the companion of ellens walks  his passion had strengthened more than proportionably to the time that had elapsed since it was conceived but the first glow and excitement which attended it had now vanished he had reasoned calmly with himself and rendered evident to his own mind the almost utter hopelessness of success he had also made his resolution strong that he would not even endeavor to win ellens love the result of which for a thousand reasons could not be happiness firm in this determination and confident of his power to adhere to it feeling also that time and absence could not cure his own passion and having no desire for such a curehe saw no reason for breaking off the intercourse that was established between ellen and himself it was remarkable that notwithstanding the desperate nature of his love that or something connected with it seemed to have a beneficial effect upon his health there was now a slight tinge of color in his cheek and a less consuming brightness in his eye could it be that hope unknown to himself was yet alive in his breast that a sense of the possibility of earthly happiness was redeeming him from the grave  had the character of ellen langtons mind been different there might perhaps have been danger to her from an intercourse of this nature with such a being as fanshawe for he was distinguished by many of those asperities around which a womans affection will often cling but she was formed to walk in the calm and quiet paths of life and to pluck the flowers of happiness from the wayside where they grow singularity of character therefore was not calculated to win her love she undoubtedly felt an interest in the solitary student and perceiving with no great exercise of vanity that her society drew him from the destructive intensity of his studies she perhaps felt it a duty to exert her influence but it did not occur to her that her influence had been sufficiently strong to change the whole current of his thoughts and feelings  ellen and her two lovers for both though perhaps not equally deserved that epithet had met as usual at the close of a sweet summer day and were standing by the side of the stream just where it swept into a deep pool the current undermining the bank had formed a recess which according to edward walcott afforded at that moment a hidingplace to a trout of noble size  now would i give the world he exclaimed with great interest for a hook and line a fishspear or any piscatorial instrument of death look ellen you can see the waving of his tail from beneath the bank  if you had the means of taking him i should save him from your cruelty thus said ellen dropping a pebble into the water just over the fish there he has darted down the stream how many pleasant caves and recesses there must be under these banks where he may be happy may there not be happiness in the life of a fish she added turning with a smile to fanshawe  there may he replied so long as he lives quietly in the caves and recesses of which you speak yes there may be happiness though such as few would envy but then the hook and line  which there is reason to apprehend will shortly destroy the happiness of our friend the trout interrupted edward pointing down the stream there is an angler on his way toward us who will intercept him  he seems to care little for the sport to judge by the pace at which he walks said ellen  but he sees now that we are observing him and is willing to prove that he knows something of the art replied edward walcott i should think him well acquainted with the stream for hastily as he walks he has tried every pool and ripple where a fish usually hides but that point will be decided when he reaches yonder old bare oaktree  and how is the old tree to decide the question inquired fanshawe it is a species of evidence of which i have never before heard  the stream has worn a hollow under its roots answered edwarda most delicate retreat for a trout now a stranger would not discover the spot or if he did the probable result of a cast would be the loss of hook and linean accident that has occurred to me more than once if therefore this angler takes a fish from thence it follows that he knows the stream  they observed the fisher accordingly as he kept his way up the bank he did not pause when he reached the old leafless oak that formed with its roots an obstruction very common in american streams but throwing his line with involuntary skill as he passed he not only escaped the various entanglements but drew forth a fine large fish  there ellen he has captivated your protégé the trout or at least one very like him in size observed edward it is singular he added gazing earnestly at the man  why is it singular inquired ellen langton this person perhaps resides in the neighborhood and may have fished often in the stream  do but look at him ellen and judge whether his life can have been spent in this lonely valley he replied the glow of many a hotter sun than ours has darkened his brow and his step and air have something foreign in them like what we see in sailors who have lived more in other countries than in their own is it not so ellen for your education in a seaport must have given you skill in these matters but come let us approach nearer  they walked towards the angler accordingly who still remained under the oak apparently engaged in arranging his fishingtackle as the party drew nigh he raised his head and threw one quick scrutinizing glance towards them disclosing on his part a set of bold and rather coarse features weatherbeaten but indicating the age of the owner to be not above thirty in person he surpassed the middle size was well set and evidently strong and active  do you meet with much success sir inquired edward walcott when within a convenient distance for conversation  i have taken but one fish replied the angler in an accent which his hearers could scarcely determine to be foreign or the contrary i am a stranger to the stream and have doubtless passed over many a likely place for sport  you have an anglers eye sir rejoined edward  i observed that you made your casts as if you had often trod these banks and i could scarcely have guided you better myself  yes i have learned the art and i love to practise it replied the man but will not the young lady try her skill he continued casting a bold eye on ellen the fish will love to be drawn out by such white hands as those  ellen shrank back though almost imperceptibly from the free bearing of the man it seemed meant for courtesy but its effect was excessively disagreeable edward walcott who perceived and coincided in ellens feelings replied to the strangers proposal  the young lady will not put the gallantry of the fish to the proof sir he said and she will therefore have no occasion for your own  i shall take leave to hear my answer from the young ladys own mouth answered the stranger haughtily if you will step this way miss langton here he interrupted himselfif you will cast the line by yonder sunken log i think you will meet with success  thus saying the angler offered his rod and line to ellen she at first drew back then hesitated but finally held out her hand to receive them in thus complying with the strangers request she was actuated by a desire to keep the peace which as her notice of edward walcotts crimsoned cheek and flashing eye assured her was considerably endangered the angler led the way to the spot which he had pointed out which though not at such a distance from ellens companions but that words in a common tone could be distinguished was out of the range of a lowered voice  edward walcott and the student remained by the oak the former biting his lip with vexation the latter whose abstraction always vanished where ellen was concerned regarding her and the stranger with fixed and silent attention the young men could at first hear the words that the angler addressed to ellen they related to the mode of managing the rod and she made one or two casts under his direction at length however as if to offer his assistance the man advanced close to her side and seemed to speak but in so low a tone that the sense of what he uttered was lost before it reached the oak but its effect upon ellen was immediate and very obvious her eyes flashed and an indignant blush rose high on her cheek giving to her beauty a haughty brightness of which the gentleness of her disposition in general deprived it the next moment however she seemed to recollect herself and restoring the anglingrod to its owner she turned away calmly and approached her companions  the evening breeze grows chill and mine is a dress for a summer day she observed let us walk homeward  miss langton is it the evening breeze alone that sends you homeward inquired edward  at this moment the angler who had resumed and seemed to be intent upon his occupation drew a fish from the pool which he had pointed out to ellen  i told the young lady he exclaimed that if she would listen to me a moment longer she would be repaid for her trouble and here is the proof of my words  come let us hasten towards home cried ellen eagerly and she took edward walcotts arm with a freedom that at another time would have enchanted him he at first seemed inclined to resist her wishes but complied after exchanging unperceived by ellen a glance with the stranger the meaning of which the latter appeared perfectly to understand fanshawe also attended her their walk towards dr melmoths dwelling was almost a silent one and the few words that passed between them did not relate to the adventure which occupied the thoughts of each on arriving at the house ellens attendants took leave of her and retired  edward walcott eluding fanshawes observation with little difficulty hastened back to the old oaktree from the intelligence with which the stranger had received his meaning glance the young man had supposed that he would here await his return but the banks of the stream upward and downward so far as his eye could reach were solitary he could see only his own image in the water where it swept into a silent depth and could hear only its ripple where stones and sunken trees impeded its course the object of his search might indeed have found concealment among the tufts of alders or in the forest that was near at hand but thither it was in vain to pursue him the angler had apparently set little store by the fruits of his assumed occupation for the last fish that he had taken lay yet alive on the bank gasping for the element to which edward was sufficiently compassionate to restore him after watching him as he glided down the stream making feeble efforts to resist its current the youth turned away and sauntered slowly towards the college  ellen langton on her return from her walk found dr melmoths little parlor unoccupied that gentleman being deeply engaged in his study and his lady busied in her domestic affairs the evening notwithstanding ellens remark concerning the chillness of the breeze was almost sultry and the windows of the apartment were thrown open at one of these which looked into the garden she seated herself listening almost unconsciously to the monotonous music of a thousand insects varied occasionally by the voice of a whippoorwill who as the day departed was just commencing his song a dusky tint as yet almost imperceptible was beginning to settle on the surrounding objects except where they were opposed to the purple and golden clouds which the vanished sun had made the brief inheritors of a portion of his brightness in these gorgeous vapors ellens fancy in the interval of other thoughts pictured a fairyland and longed for wings to visit it  but as the clouds lost their brilliancy and assumed first a dull purple and then a sullen gray tint ellens thoughts recurred to the adventure of the angler which her imagination was inclined to invest with an undue singularity it was however sufficiently unaccountable that an entire stranger should venture to demand of her a private audience and she assigned in turn a thousand motives for such a request none of which were in any degree satisfactory her most prevailing thought though she could not justify it to her reason inclined her to believe that the angler was a messenger from her father but wherefore he should deem it necessary to communicate any intelligence that he might possess only by means of a private interview and without the knowledge of her friends was a mystery she could not solve in this view of the matter however she half regretted that her instinctive delicacy had impelled her so suddenly to break off their conference admitting in the secrecy of her own mind that if an opportunity were again to occur it might not again be shunned as if that unuttered thought had power to conjure up its object she now became aware of a form standing in the garden at a short distance from the window where she sat the dusk had deepened during ellens abstraction to such a degree that the mans features were not perfectly distinguishable but the maiden was not long in doubt of his identity for he approached and spoke in the same low tone in which he had addressed her when they stood by the stream  do you still refuse my request when its object is but your own good and that of one who should be most dear to you he asked  ellens first impulse had been to cry out for assistance her second was to fly but rejecting both these measures she determined to remain endeavoring to persuade herself that she was safe the quivering of her voice however when she attempted to reply betrayed her apprehensions  i cannot listen to such a request from a stranger she said if you bring news fromfrom my father why is it not told to dr melmoth  because what i have to say is for your ear alone was the reply and if you would avoid misfortune now and sorrow hereafter you will not refuse to hear me  and does it concern my father asked ellen eagerly  it doesmost deeply answered the stranger  she meditated a moment and then replied i will not refuse i will hear but speak quickly  we are in danger of interruption in this place and that would be fatal to my errand said the stranger i will await you in the garden  with these words and giving her no opportunity for reply he drew back and his form faded from her eyes this precipitate retreat from argument was the most probable method that he could have adopted of gaining his end he had awakened the strongest interest in ellens mind and he calculated justly in supposing that she would consent to an interview upon his own terms  dr melmoth had followed his own fancies in the mode of laying out his garden and in consequence the plan that had undoubtedly existed in his mind was utterly incomprehensible to every one but himself it was an intermixture of kitchen and flower garden a labyrinth of winding paths bordered by hedges and impeded by shrubbery many of the original trees of the forest were still flourishing among the exotics which the doctor had transplanted thither it was not without a sensation of fear stronger than she had ever before experienced that ellen langton found herself in this artificial wilderness and in the presence of the mysterious stranger the dusky light deepened the lines of his dark strong features and ellen fancied that his countenance wore a wilder and a fiercer look than when she had met him by the stream he perceived her agitation and addressed her in the softest tones of which his voice was capable  compose yourself he said you have nothing to fear from me but we are in open view from the house where we now stand and discovery would not be without danger to both of us  no eye can see us here said ellen trembling at the truth of her own observation when they stood beneath a gnarled lowbranched pine which dr melmoths ideas of beauty had caused him to retain in his garden speak quickly for i dare follow you no farther  the spot was indeed sufficiently solitary and the stranger delayed no longer to explain his errand  your father he begando you not love him would you do aught for his welfare  everything that a father could ask i would do exclaimed ellen eagerly where is my father and when shall i meet him  it must depend upon yourself whether you shall meet him in a few days or never  never repeated ellen is he ill is he in danger  he is in danger replied the man but not from illness your father is a ruined man of all his friends but one remains to him that friend has travelled far to prove if his daughter has a daughters affection  and what is to be the proof asked ellen with more calmness than the stranger had anticipated for she possessed a large fund of plain sense which revolted against the mystery of these proceedings such a course too seemed discordant with her fathers character whose strong mind and almost cold heart were little likely to demand or even to pardon the romance of affection  this letter will explain was the reply to ellens question you will see that it is in your fathers hand and that may gain your confidence though i am doubted  she received the letter and many of her suspicions of the strangers truth were vanquished by the apparent openness of his manner he was preparing to speak further but paused for a footstep was now heard approaching from the lower part of the garden from their situationat some distance from the path and in the shade of the treethey had a fair chance of eluding discovery from any unsuspecting passenger and when ellen saw that the intruder was fanshawe she hoped that his usual abstraction would assist their concealment  but as the student advanced along the path his air was not that of one whose deep inward thoughts withdrew his attention from all outward objects he rather resembled the hunter on the watch for his game and while he was yet at a distance from ellen a wandering gust of wind waved her white garment and betrayed her  it is as i feared said fanshawe to himself he then drew nigh and addressed ellen with a calm authority that became him well notwithstanding that his years scarcely exceeded her own miss langton he inquired what do you here at such an hour and with such a companion  ellen was sufficiently displeased at what she deemed the unauthorized intrusion of fanshawe in her affairs but his imposing manner and her own confusion prevented her from replying  permit me to lead you to the house he continued in the words of a request but in the tone of a command the dew hangs dank and heavy on these branches and a longer stay would be more dangerous than you are aware  ellen would fain have resisted but though the tears hung as heavy on her eyelashes between shame and anger as the dew upon the leaves she felt compelled to accept the arm that he offered her but the stranger who since fanshawes approach had remained a little apart now advanced  you speak as one in authority young man he said have you the means of compelling obedience does your power extend to men or do you rule only over simple girls miss langton is under my protection and till you can bend me to your will she shall remain so  fanshawe turned calmly and fixed his eyes on the stranger retire sir was all he said  ellen almost shuddered as if there were a mysterious and unearthly power in fanshawes voice for she saw that the stranger endeavored in vain borne down by the influence of a superior mind to maintain the boldness of look and bearing that seemed natural to him he at first made a step forward then muttered a few halfaudible words but quailing at length beneath the young mans bright and steady eye he turned and slowly withdrew  fanshawe remained silent a moment after his opponent had departed and when he next spoke it was in a tone of depression ellen observed also that his countenance had lost its look of pride and authority and he seemed faint and exhausted the occasion that called forth his energies had passed and they had left him  forgive me miss langton he said almost humbly if my eagerness to serve you has led me too far there is evil in this stranger more than your pure mind can conceive i know not what has been his errand but let me entreat you to put confidence in those to whose care your father has intrusted you or if ioror edward walcottbut i have no right to advise you and your own calm thoughts will guide you best  he said no more and as ellen did not reply they reached the house and parted in silence    chapter iv    the seeds by nature planted   take a deep root in the soil and though for a time   the trenchant share and tearing harrow may   sweep all appearance of them from the surface   yet with the first warm rains of spring theyll shoot   and with their rankness smother the good grain   heaven grant it maynt be so with him     riches   the scene of this tale must now be changed to the little inn which at that period as at the present was situated in the vicinity of harley college the site of the modern establishment is the same with that of the ancient but everything of the latter that had been built by hands has gone to decay and been removed and only the earth beneath and around it remains the same the modern building a house of two stories after a lapse of twenty years is yet unfinished on this account it has retained the appellation of the new inn though like many who have frequented it it has grown old ere its maturity its dingy whiteness and its apparent superfluity of windows many of them being closed with rough boards give it somewhat of a dreary look especially in a wet day  the ancient inn was a house of which the eaves approached within about seven feet of the ground while the roof sloping gradually upward formed an angle at several times that height it was a comfortable and pleasant abode to the weary traveller both in summer and winter for the frost never ventured within the sphere of its huge hearths and it was protected from the heat of the sultry season by three large elms that swept the roof with their long branches and seemed to create a breeze where there was not one the device upon the sign suspended from one of these trees was a hand holding a longnecked bottle and was much more appropriate than the present unmeaning representation of a black eagle but it is necessary to speak rather more at length of the landlord than of the house over which he presided  hugh crombie was one for whom most of the wise men who considered the course of his early years had predicted the gallows as an end before he should arrive at middle age that these prophets of ill had been deceived was evident from the fact that the doomed man had now passed the fortieth year and was in more prosperous circumstances than most of those who had wagged their tongues against him yet the failure of their forebodings was more remarkable than their fulfilment would have been  he had been distinguished almost from his earliest infancy by those precocious accomplishments which because they consist in an imitation of the vices and follies of maturity render a boy the favorite plaything of men he seemed to have received from nature the convivial talents which whether natural or acquired are a most dangerous possession and before his twelfth year he was the welcome associate of all the idle and dissipated of his neighborhood and especially of those who haunted the tavern of which he had now become the landlord under this course of education hugh crombie grew to youth and manhood and the lovers of good words could only say in his favor that he was a greater enemy to himself than to any one else and that if he should reform few would have a better chance of prosperity than he  the former clause of this modicum of praise if praise it may be termed was indisputable but it may be doubted whether under any circumstances where his success depended on his own exertions hugh would have made his way well through the world he was one of those unfortunate persons who instead of being perfect in any single art or occupation are superficial in many and who are supposed to possess a larger share of talent than other men because it consists of numerous scraps instead of a single mass he was partially acquainted with most of the manual arts that gave bread to others but not one of them nor all of them would give bread to him by some fatality the only two of his multifarious accomplishments in which his excellence was generally conceded were both calculated to keep him poor rather than to make him rich he was a musician and a poet there are yet remaining in that portion of the country many ballads and songsset to their own peculiar tunesthe authorship of which is attributed to him in general his productions were upon subjects of local and temporary interest and would consequently require a bulk of explanatory notes to render them interesting or intelligible to the world at large a considerable proportion of the remainder are anacreontics though in their construction hugh crombie imitated neither the teian nor any other bard these latter have generally a coarseness and sensuality intolerable to minds even of no very fastidious delicacy but there are two or three simple little songs into which a feeling and a natural pathos have found their way that still retain their influence over the heart these after two or three centuries may perhaps be precious to the collectors of our early poetry at any rate hugh crombies effusions tavernhaunter and vagrant though he was have gained a continuance of fame confined indeed to a narrow section of the country which many who called themselves poets then and would have scorned such a brother have failed to equal  during the long winter evenings when the farmers were idle round their hearths hugh was a courted guest for none could while away the hours more skilfully than he the winter therefore was his season of prosperity in which respect he differed from the butterflies and useless insects to which he otherwise bore a resemblance during the cold months a very desirable alteration for the better appeared in his outward man his cheeks were plump and sanguine his eyes bright and cheerful and the tip of his nose glowed with a bardolphian firea flame indeed which hugh was so far a vestal as to supply with its necessary fuel at all seasons of the year but as the spring advanced he assumed a lean and sallow look wilting and fading in the sunshine that brought life and joy to every animal and vegetable except himself his winter patrons eyed him with an austere regard and some even practised upon him the modern and fashionable courtesy of the cut direct  yet after all there was good or something that nature intended to be so in the poor outcastsome lovely flowers the sweeter even for the weeds that choked them an instance of this was his affection for an aged father whose whole support was the broken reedhis son notwithstanding his own necessities hugh contrived to provide food and raiment for the old man how it would be difficult to say and perhaps as well not to inquire he also exhibited traits of sensitiveness to neglect and insult and of gratitude for favors both of which feelings a course of life like his is usually quick to eradicate  at length the restraintfor such his father had ever beenupon hugh crombies conduct was removed by death and then the wise men and the old began to shake their heads and they who took pleasure in the follies vices and misfortunes of their fellowcreatures looked for a speedy gratification they were disappointed however for hugh had apparently determined that whatever might be his catastrophe he would meet it among strangers rather than at home shortly after his fathers death he disappeared altogether from the vicinity and his name became in the course of years an unusual sound where once the lack of other topics of interest had given it a considerable degree of notoriety sometimes however when the winter blast was loud round the lonely farmhouse its inmates remembered him who had so often chased away the gloom of such an hour and though with little expectation of its fulfilment expressed a wish to behold him again  yet that wish formed perhaps because it appeared so desperate was finally destined to be gratified one summer evening about two years previous to the period of this tale a man of sober and staid deportment mounted upon a white horse arrived at the hand and bottle to which some civil or military meeting had chanced that day to draw most of the inhabitants of the vicinity the stranger was well though plainly dressed and anywhere but in a retired country town would have attracted no particular attention but here where a traveller was not of everyday occurrence he was soon surrounded by a little crowd who when his eye was averted seized the opportunity diligently to peruse his person he was rather a thickset man but with no superfluous flesh his hair was of irongray he had a few wrinkles his face was so deeply sunburnt that excepting a halfsmothered glow on the tip of his nose a dusky yellow was the only apparent hue as the people gazed it was observed that the elderly men and the men of substance gat themselves silently to their steeds and hied homeward with an unusual degree of haste till at length the inn was deserted except by a few wretched objects to whom it was a constant resort these instead of retreating drew closer to the traveller peeping anxiously into his face and asking ever and anon a question in order to discover the tone of his voice at length with one consent and as if the recognition had at once burst upon them they hailed their old booncompanion hugh crombie and leading him into the inn did him the honor to partake of a cup of welcome at his expense  but though hugh readily acknowledged the not very reputable acquaintances who alone acknowledged him they speedily discovered that he was an altered man he partook with great moderation of the liquor for which he was to pay he declined all their flattering entreaties for one of his old songs and finally being urged to engage in a game at allfours he calmly observed almost in the words of an old clergyman on a like occasion that his principles forbade a profane appeal to the decision by lot  on the next sabbath hugh crombie made his appearance at public worship in the chapel of harley college and here his outward demeanor was unexceptionably serious and devouta praise which on that particular occasion could be bestowed on few besides from these favorable symptoms the old established prejudices against him began to waver and as he seemed not to need and to have no intention to ask the assistance of any one he was soon generally acknowledged by the rich as well as by the poor his account of his past life and of his intentions for the future was brief but not unsatisfactory he said that since his departure he had been a seafaring man and that having acquired sufficient property to render him easy in the decline of his days he had returned to live and die in the town of his nativity  there was one person and the one whom hugh was most interested to please who seemed perfectly satisfied of the verity of his reformation this was the landlady of the inn whom at his departure he had left a gay and even at thirtyfive a rather pretty wife and whom on his return he found a widow of fifty fat yellow wrinkled and a zealous member of the church she like others had at first cast a cold eye on the wanderer but it shortly became evident to close observers that a change was at work in the pious matrons sentiments respecting her old acquaintance she was now careful to give him his morning dram from her own peculiar bottle to fill his pipe from her private box of virginia and to mix for him the sleepingcup in which her late husband had delighted of all these courtesies hugh crombie did partake with a wise and cautious moderation that while it proved them to be welcome expressed his fear of trespassing on her kindness for the sake of brevity it shall suffice to say that about six weeks after hughs return a writing appeared on one of the elmtrees in front of the tavern where as the place of greatest resort such notices were usually displayed setting forth that marriage was intended between hugh crombie and the widow sarah hutchins and the ceremony which made hugh a landholder a householder and a substantial man in due time took place  as a landlord his general conduct was very praiseworthy he was moderate in his charges and attentive to his guests he allowed no gross and evident disorders in his house and practised none himself he was kind and charitable to such as needed food and lodging and had not wherewithal to payfor with these his experience had doubtless given him a fellow feeling he was also sufficiently attentive to his wife though it must be acknowledged that the religious zeal which had had a considerable influence in gaining her affections grew by no moderate degrees less fervent it was whispered too that the new landlord could when time place and company were to his mind upraise a song as merrily and drink a glass as jollily as in the days of yore these were the weightiest charges that could now be brought against him and wise men thought that whatever might have been the evil of his past life he had returned with a desire which years of vice if they do not sometimes produce do not always destroy of being honest if opportunity should offer and hugh had certainly a fair one  on the afternoon previous to the events related in the last chapter the personage whose introduction to the reader has occupied so large a space was seated under one of the elms in front of his dwelling the bench which now sustained him and on which were carved the names of many former occupants was hugh crombies favorite loungingplace unless when his attentions were required by his guests no demand had that day been made upon the hospitality of the hand and bottle and the landlord was just then murmuring at the unfrequency of employment the slenderness of his profits indeed were no part of his concern for the widow hutchinss chief income was drawn from her farm nor was hugh ever miserly inclined but his education and habits had made him delight in the atmosphere of the inn and in the society of those who frequented it and of this species of enjoyment his present situation certainly did not afford an overplus  yet had hugh crombie an enviable appearance of indolence and ease as he sat under the old tree polluting the sweet air with his pipe and taking occasional draughts from a brown jug that stood near at hand the basis of the potation contained in this vessel was harsh old cider from the widows own orchard but its coldness and acidity were rendered innocuous by a due proportion of yet older brandy the result of this mixture was extremely felicitous pleasant to the taste and producing a tingling sensation on the coats of the stomach uncommonly delectable to so old a toper as hugh  the landlord cast his eye ever and anon along the road that led down the valley in the direction of the village and at last when the sun was wearing westward he discovered the approach of a horseman he immediately replenished his pipe took a long draught from the brown jug summoned the ragged youth who officiated in most of the subordinate departments of the inn and who was now to act as hostler and then prepared himself for confabulation with his guest  he comes from the seacoast said hugh to himself as the traveller emerged into open view on the level road he is two days in advance of the post with its news of a fortnight old pray heaven he prove communicative then as the stranger drew nigher one would judge that his dark face had seen as hot a sun as mine he has felt the burning breeze of the indies east and west i warrant him ah i see we shall send away the evening merrily not a penny shall come out of his purse that is if his tongue runs glibly just the man i was praying fornow may the devil take me if he is interrupted hugh in accents of alarm and starting from his seat he composed his countenance however with the power that long habit and necessity had given him over his emotions and again settled himself quietly on the bench  the traveller coming on at a moderate pace alighted and gave his horse to the ragged hostler he then advanced towards the door near which hugh was seated whose agitation was manifested by no perceptible sign except by the shorter and more frequent puffs with which he plied his pipe their eyes did not meet till just as the stranger was about to enter when he started apparently with a surprise and alarm similar to those of hugh crombie he recovered himself however sufficiently to return the nod of recognition with which he was favored and immediately entered the house the landlord following  this way if you please sir said hugh you will find this apartment cool and retired  he ushered his guest into a small room the windows of which were darkened by the creeping plants that clustered round them entering and closing the door the two gazed at each other a little space without speaking the traveller first broke silence  then this is your living self hugh crombie he said the landlord extended his hand as a practical reply to the question the stranger took it though with no especial appearance of cordiality  ay this seems to be flesh and blood he said in the tone of one who would willingly have found it otherwise and how happens this friend hugh i little thought to meet you again in this life when i last heard from you your prayers were said and you were bound for a better world  there would have been small danger of your meeting me there observed the landlord dryly  it is an unquestionable truth hugh replied the traveller for which reason i regret that your voyage was delayed  nay that is a hard word to bestow on your old comrade said hugh crombie the world is wide enough for both of us and why should you wish me out of it  wide as it is rejoined the stranger we have stumbled against each otherto the pleasure of neither of us if i may judge from your countenance methinks i am not a welcome guest at hugh crombies inn  your welcome must depend on the cause of your coming and the length of your stay replied the landlord  and what if i come to settle down among these quiet hills where i was born inquired the other what if i too am weary of the life we have ledor afraid perhaps that it will come to too speedy an end shall i have your good word hugh to set me up in an honest way of life or will you make me a partner in your trade since you know my qualifications a pretty pair of publicans should we be and the quart pot would have little rest between us  it may be as well to replenish it now observed hugh stepping to the door of the room and giving orders accordingly a meeting between old friends should never be dry but for the partnership it is a matter in which you must excuse me heaven knows i find it hard enough to be honest with no tempter but the devil and my own thoughts and if i have you also to contend with there is little hope of me  nay that is true your good resolutions were always like cobwebs and your evil habits like fiveinch cables replied the traveller i am to understand then that you refuse my offer  not only that but if you have chosen this valley as your place of rest dame crombie and i must look through the world for another but hush here comes the wine  the hostler in the performance of another part of his duty now appeared bearing a measure of the liquor that hugh had ordered the wine of that period owing to the comparative lowness of the duties was of more moderate price than in the mothercountry and of purer and better quality than at the present day  the stuff is well chosen hugh observed the guest after a draught large enough to authorize an opinion you have most of the requisites for your present station and i should be sorry to draw you from it i trust there will be no need  yet you have a purpose in your journey hither observed his comrade  yes and you would fain be informed of it replied the traveller he arose and walked once or twice across the room then seeming to have taken his resolution he paused and fixed his eye steadfastly on hugh crombie i could wish my old acquaintance he said that your lot had been cast anywhere rather than here yet if you choose it you may do me a good office and one that shall meet with a good reward can i trust you  my secrecy you can answered the host but nothing further i know the nature of your plans and whither they would lead me too well to engage in them to say the truth since it concerns not me i have little desire to hear your secret  and i as little to tell it i do assure you rejoined the guest i have always loved to manage my affairs myself and to keep them to myself it is a good rule but it must sometimes be broken and now hugh how is it that you have become possessed of this comfortable dwelling and of these pleasant fields  by my marriage with the widow sarah hutchins replied hugh crombie staring at a question which seemed to have little reference to the present topic of conversation  it is a most excellent method of becoming a man of substance continued the traveller attended with little trouble and honest withal  why as to the trouble said the landlord it follows such a bargain instead of going before it and for honestyi do not recollect that i have gained a penny more honestly these twenty years  i can swear to that observed his comrade well mine host i entirely approve of your doings and moreover have resolved to prosper after the same fashion myself  if that be the commodity you seek replied hugh crombie you will find none here to your mind we have widows in plenty it is true but most of them have children and few have houses and lands but now to be serious and there has been something serious in your eye all this whilewhat is your purpose in coming hither you are not safe here your name has had a wider spread than mine and if discovered it will go hard with you  but who would know me now asked the guest  few few indeed replied the landlord gazing at the dark features of his companion where hardship peril and dissipation had each left their traces no you are not like the slender boy of fifteen who stood on the hill by moonlight to take a last look at his fathers cottage there were tears in your eyes then and as often as i remember them i repent that i did not turn you back instead of leading you on  tears were there well there have been few enough since said his comrade pressing his eyelids firmly together as if even then tempted to give way to the weakness that he scorned and for turning me back hugh it was beyond your power i had taken my resolution and you did but show me the way to execute it  you have not inquired after those you left behind observed hugh crombie  nono nor will i have aught of them exclaimed the traveller starting from his seat and pacing rapidly across the room my father i know is dead and i have forgiven him my motherwhat could i hear of her but misery i will hear nothing  you must have passed the cottage as you rode hitherward said hugh how could you forbear to enter  i did not see it he replied i closed my eyes and turned away my head  oh if i had had a mother a loving mother if there had been one being in the world that loved me or cared for me i should not have become an utter castaway exclaimed hugh crombie  the landlords pathos like all pathos that flows from the winecup was sufficiently ridiculous and his companion who had already overcome his own brief feelings of sorrow and remorse now laughed aloud  come come mine host of the hand and bottle he cried in his usual hard sarcastic tone be a man as much as in you lies you had always a foolish trick of repentance but as i remember it was commonly of a morning before you had swallowed your first dram and now hugh fill the quart pot again and we will to business  when the landlord had complied with the wishes of his guest the latter resumed in a lower tone than that of his ordinary conversationthere is a young lady lately become a resident hereabouts perhaps you can guess her name for you have a quick apprehension in these matters  a young lady repeated hugh crombie and what is your concern with her do you mean ellen langton daughter of the old merchant langton whom you have some cause to remember  i do remember him but he is where he will speedily be forgotten answered the traveller and this girli know your eye has been upon her hughdescribe her to me  describe her exclaimed hugh with much animation it is impossible in prose but you shall have her very picture in a verse of one of my own songs  nay mine host i beseech you to spare me this is no time for quavering said the guest however i am proud of your approbation my old friend for this young lady do i intend to take to wife what think you of the plan  hugh crombie gazed into his companions face for the space of a moment in silence there was nothing in its expression that looked like a jest it still retained the same hard cold look that except when hugh had alluded to his home and family it had worn through their whole conversation  on my word comrade he at length replied my advice is that you give over your application to the quart pot and refresh your brain by a short nap and yet your eye is cool and steady what is the meaning of this  listen and you shall know said the guest the old man her father is in his grave  not a bloody grave i trust interrupted the landlord starting and looking fearfully into his comrades face  no a watery one he replied calmly you see hugh i am a better man than you took me for the old mans blood is not on my head though my wrongs are on his now listen he had no heir but this only daughter and to her and to the man she marries all his wealth will belong she shall marry me think you her father will rest easy in the ocean hugh crombie when i am his soninlaw  no he will rise up to prevent it if need be answered the landlord but the dead need not interpose to frustrate so wild a scheme  i understand you said his comrade you are of opinion that the young ladys consent may not be so soon won as asked fear not for that mine host i have a winning way with me when opportunity serves and it shall serve with ellen langton i will have no rivals in my wooing  your intention if i take it rightly is to get this poor girl into your power and then to force her into a marriage said hugh crombie  it is and i think i possess the means of doing it replied his comrade but methinks friend hugh my enterprise has not your good wishes  no and i pray you to give it over said hugh crombie very earnestly the girl is young lovely and as good as she is fair i cannot aid in her ruin nay more i must prevent it  prevent it exclaimed the traveller with a darkening countenance think twice before you stir in this matter i advise you ruin do you say does a girl call it ruin to be made an honest wedded wife no no mine host nor does a widow either else have you much to answer for  i gave the widow hutchins fair play at least which is more than poor ellen is like to get observed the landlord my old comrade will you not give up this scheme  my old comrade i will not give up this scheme returned the other composedly why hugh what has come over you since we last met have we not done twenty worse deeds of a morning and laughed over them at night  he is right there said hugh crombie in a meditative tone of a certainty my conscience has grown unreasonably tender within the last two years this one small sin if i were to aid in it would add but a trifle to the sum of mine but then the poor girl  his companion overheard him thus communing with himself and having had much former experience of his infirmity of purpose doubted not that he should bend him to his will in fact his arguments were so effectual that hugh at length though reluctantly promised his cooperation it was necessary that their motions should be speedy for on the second day thereafter the arrival of the post would bring intelligence of the shipwreck by which mr langton had perished  and after the deed is done said the landlord i beseech you never to cross my path again there have been more wicked thoughts in my head within the last hour than for the whole two years that i have been an honest man  what a saint art thou become hugh said his comrade but fear not that we shall meet again when i leave this valley it will be to enter it no more  and there is little danger that any other who has known me will chance upon me here observed hugh crombie our trade was unfavorable to length of days and i suppose most of our old comrades have arrived at the end of theirs  one whom you knew well is nearer to you than you think answered the traveller for i did not travel hitherward entirely alone    chapter v    a naughty night to swim inshakespeare   the evening of the day succeeding the adventure of the angler was dark and tempestuous the rain descended almost in a continuous sheet and occasional powerful gusts of wind drove it hard against the northeastern windows of hugh crombies inn but at least one apartment of the interior presented a scene of comfort and of apparent enjoyment the more delightful from its contrast with the elemental fury that raged without a fire which the dullness of the evening though a summer one made necessary was burning brightly on the hearth and in front was placed a small round table sustaining wine and glasses one of the guests for whom these preparations had been made was edward walcott the other was a shy awkward young man distinguished by the union of classic and rural dress as having but lately become a student of harley college he seemed little at his ease probably from a consciousness that he was on forbidden ground and that the wine of which he nevertheless swallowed a larger share than his companion was an unlawful draught  in the catalogue of crimes provided against by the laws of harley college that of tavernhaunting was one of the principal the secluded situation of the seminary indeed gave its scholars but a very limited choice of vices and this was therefore the usual channel by which the wildness of youth discharged itself edward walcott though naturally temperate had been not an unfrequent offender in this respect for which a superfluity both of time and money might plead some excuse but since his acquaintance with ellen langton he had rarely entered hugh crombies doors and an interruption in that acquaintance was the cause of his present appearance there  edwards jealous pride had been considerably touched on ellens compliance with the request of the angler he had by degrees imperceptible perhaps to himself assumed the right of feeling displeased with her conduct and she had as imperceptibly accustomed herself to consider what would be his wishes and to act accordingly he would indeed in no contingency have ventured an open remonstrance and such a proceeding would have been attended by a result the reverse of what he desired but there existed between them a silent compact acknowledged perhaps by neither but felt by both according to which they had regulated the latter part of their intercourse their lips had yet spoken no word of love but some of loves rights and privileges had been assumed on the one side and at least not disallowed on the other  edwards penetration had been sufficiently quick to discover that there was a mystery about the angler that there must have been a cause for the blush that rose so proudly on ellens cheek and his quixotism had been not a little mortified because she did not immediately appeal to his protection he had however paid his usual visit the next day at dr melmoths expecting that by a smile of more than common brightness she would make amends to his wounded feelings such having been her usual mode of reparation in the few instances of disagreement that had occurred between them but he was disappointed he found her cold silent and abstracted inattentive when he spoke and indisposed to speak herself her eye was sedulously averted from his and the casual meeting of their glances only proved that there were feelings in her bosom which he did not share he was unable to account for this change in her deportment and added to his previous conceptions of his wrongs it produced an effect upon his rather hasty temper that might have manifested itself violently but for the presence of mrs melmoth he took his leave in very evident displeasure but just as he closed the door he noticed an expression in ellens countenance that had they been alone and had not he been quite so proud would have drawn him down to her feet their eyes met when suddenly there was a gush of tears into those of ellen and a deep sadness almost despair spread itself over her features he paused a moment and then went his way equally unable to account for her coldness or for her grief he was well aware however that his situation in respect to her was unaccountably changeda conviction so disagreeable that but for a hope that is latent even in the despair of youthful hearts he would have been sorely tempted to shoot himself  the gloom of his thoughtsa mood of mind the more intolerable to him because so unusualhad driven him to hugh crombies inn in search of artificial excitement but even the wine had no attractions and his first glass stood now almost untouched before him while he gazed in heavy thought into the glowing embers of the fire his companion perceived his melancholy and essayed to dispel it by a choice of such topics of conversation as he conceived would be most agreeable  there is a lady in the house he observed i caught a glimpse of her in the passage as we came in did you see her edward  a lady repeated edward carelessly what know you of ladies no i did not see her but i will venture to say that it was dame crombies self and no other  well perhaps it might said the other doubtingly her head was turned from me and she was gone like a shadow  dame crombie is no shadow and never vanishes like one resumed edward you have mistaken the slipshod servantgirl for a lady  ay but she had a white hand a small white hand said the student piqued at edwards contemptuous opinion of his powers of observation as white as ellen langtons he paused for the lover was offended by the profanity of the comparison as was made evident by the blood that rushed to his brow  we will appeal to the landlord said edward recovering his equanimity and turning to hugh who just then entered the room who is this angel mine host that has taken up her abode in the hand and bottle  hugh cast a quick glance from one to another before he answered i keep no angels here gentlemen dame crombie would make the house anything but heaven for them and me  and yet glover has seen a vision in the passagewaya lady with a small white hand  ah i understand a slight mistake of the young gentlemans said hugh with the air of one who could perfectly account for the mystery our passageway is dark or perhaps the light had dazzled his eyes it was the widow fowlers daughter that came to borrow a pipe of tobacco for her mother by the same token she put it into her own sweet mouth and puffed as she went along  but the white hand said glover only half convinced  nay i know not answered hugh but her hand was at least as white as her face that i can swear well gentlemen i trust you find everything in my house to your satisfaction when the fire needs renewing or the wine runs low be pleased to tap on the table i shall appear with the speed of a sunbeam  after the departure of the landlord the conversation of the young men amounted to little more than monosyllables edward walcott was wrapped in his own contemplations and his companion was in a halfslumberous state from which he started every quarter of an hour at the chiming of the clock that stood in a corner the fire died gradually away the lamps began to burn dim and glover rousing himself from one of his periodical slumbers was about to propose a return to their chambers he was prevented however by the approach of footsteps along the passageway and hugh crombie opening the door ushered a person into the room and retired  the newcomer was fanshawe the water that poured plentifully from his cloak evinced that he had but just arrived at the inn but whatever was his object he seemed not to have attained it in meeting with the young men he paused near the door as if meditating whether to retire  my intrusion is altogether owing to a mistake either of the landlords or mine he said i came hither to seek another person but as i could not mention his name my inquiries were rather vague  i thank heaven for the chance that sent you to us replied edward rousing himself glover is wretched company and a duller evening have i never spent we will renew our fire and our wine and you must sit down with us and for the man you seek he continued in a whisper he left the inn within a halfhour after we encountered him i inquired of hugh crombie last night  fanshawe did not express his doubts of the correctness of the information on which edward seemed to rely laying aside his cloak he accepted his invitation to make one of the party and sat down by the fireside  the aspect of the evening now gradually changed a strange wild glee spread from one to another of the party which much to the surprise of his companions began with and was communicated from fanshawe he seemed to overflow with conceptions inimitably ludicrous but so singular that till his hearers had imbibed a portion of his own spirit they could only wonder at instead of enjoying them his applications to the wine were very unfrequent yet his conversation was such as one might expect from a bottle of champagne endowed by a fairy with the gift of speech the secret of this strange mirth lay in the troubled state of his spirits which like the vexed ocean at midnight if the simile be not too magnificent tossed forth a mysterious brightness the undefined apprehensions that had drawn him to the inn still distracted his mind but mixed with them there was a sort of joy not easily to be described by degrees and by the assistance of the wine the inspiration spread each one contributing such a quantity and such quality of wit and whim as was proportioned to his genius but each one and all displaying a greater share of both than they had ever been suspected of possessing  at length however there was a pausethe deep pause of flagging spirits that always follows mirth and wine no one would have believed on beholding the pensive faces and hearing the involuntary sighs of the party that from these but a moment before had arisen so loud and wild a laugh during this interval edward walcott who was the poet of his class volunteered the following song which from its want of polish and from its application to his present feelings might charitably be taken for an extemporaneous production    the wine is bright the wine is bright     and gay the drinkers be   of all that drain the bowl tonight     most jollily drain we   oh could one search the weary earth     the earth from sea to sea   hed turn and mingle in our mirth     for were the merriest three    yet there are cares oh heavy cares     we know that they are nigh   when forth each lonely drinker fares     mark then his altered eye   care comes upon us when the jest     and frantic laughter die   and care will watch the parting guest     oh late then let us fly  hugh crombie whose early love of song and minstrelsy was still alive had entered the room at the sound of edwards voice in sufficient time to accompany the second stanza on the violin he now with the air of one who was entitled to judge in these matters expressed his opinion of the performance  really master walcott i was not prepared for this he said in the tone of condescending praise that a great man uses to his inferior when he chooses to overwhelm him with excess of joy very well indeed young gentleman some of the lines it is true seem to have been dragged in by the head and shoulders but i could scarcely have done much better myself at your age with practice and with such instruction as i might afford you i should have little doubt of your becoming a distinguished poet a great defect in your seminary gentlementhe want of due cultivation in this heavenly art  perhaps sir said edward with much gravity you might yourself be prevailed upon to accept the professorship of poetry  why such an offer would require consideration replied the landlord professor hugh crombie of harley college it has a good sound assuredly but i am a public man master walcott and the public would be loath to spare me from my present office  will professor crombie favor us with a specimen of his productions inquired edward  ahem i shall be happy to gratify you young gentleman answered hugh it is seldom in this rude country master walcott that we meet with kindred genius and the opportunity should never be thrown away  thus saying he took a heavy draught of the liquor by which he was usually inspired and the praises of which were the prevailing subject of his song then after much hemming thrumming and prelusion and with many queer gestures and gesticulations he began to effuse a lyric in the following fashion    ive been a jolly drinker this fiveandtwenty year   and still a jolly drinker my friends you see me here   i sing the joys of drinking bear a chorus every man   with pint pot and quart pot and clattering of can  the sense of the professors first stanza was not in exact proportion to the sound but being executed with great spirit it attracted universal applause this hugh appropriated with a condescending bow and smile and making a signal for silence he went on    king solomon of old boys a jolly king was he  but here he was interrupted by a clapping of hands that seemed a continuance of the applause bestowed on his former stanza hugh crombie who as is the custom of many great performers usually sang with his eyes shut now opened them intending gently to rebuke his auditors for their unseasonable expression of delight he immediately perceived however that the fault was to be attributed to neither of the three young men and following the direction of their eyes he saw near the door in the dim background of the apartment a figure in a cloak the hat was flapped forward the cloak muffled round the lower part of the face and only the eyes were visible  the party gazed a moment in silence and then rushed en masse upon the intruder the landlord bringing up the rear and sounding a charge upon his fiddle but as they drew nigh the black cloak began to assume a familiar look the hat also was an old acquaintance and these being removed from beneath them shone forth the reverend face and form of dr melmoth  the president in his quality of clergyman had late in the preceding afternoon been called to visit an aged female who was supposed to be at the point of death her habitation was at the distance of several miles from harley college so that it was nightfall before dr melmoth stood at her bedside his stay had been lengthened beyond his anticipation on account of the frame of mind in which he found the dying woman and after essaying to impart the comforts of religion to her disturbed intellect he had waited for the abatement of the storm that had arisen while he was thus engaged as the evening advanced however the rain poured down in undiminished cataracts and the doctor trusting to the prudence and sure footedness of his steed had at length set forth on his return the darkness of the night and the roughness of the road might have appalled him even had his horsemanship and his courage been more considerable than they were but by the special protection of providence as he reasonably supposed for he was a good man and on a good errand he arrived safely as far as hugh crombies inn dr melmoth had no intention of making a stay there but as the road passed within a very short distance he saw lights in the windows and heard the sound of song and revelry it immediately occurred to him that these midnight rioters were probably some of the young men of his charge and he was impelled by a sense of duty to enter and disperse them directed by the voices he found his way with some difficulty to the apartment just as hugh concluded his first stanza and amidst the subsequent applause his entrance had been unperceived  there was a silence of a moments continuance after the discovery of dr melmoth during which he attempted to clothe his round goodnatured face in a look of awful dignity but in spite of himself there was a little twisting of the corners of his mouth and a smothered gleam in his eye  this has apparently been a very merry meeting young gentlemen he at length said but i fear my presence has cast a damp upon it  oh yes your reverences cloak is wet enough to cast a damp upon anything exclaimed hugh crombie assuming a look of tender anxiety the young gentlemen are affrighted for your valuable life fear deprives them of utterance permit me to relieve you of these dangerous garments  trouble not yourself honest man replied the doctor who was one of the most gullible of mortals i trust i am in no danger my dwelling being near at hand but for these young men  would your reverence but honor my sunday suitthe gray broadcloth coat and the black velvet smallclothes that have covered my unworthy legs but once dame crombie shall have them ready in a moment continued hugh beginning to divest the doctor of his garments  i pray you to appease your anxiety cried dr melmoth retaining a firm hold on such parts of his dress as yet remained to him fear not for my health i will but speak a word to those misguided youth and be gone  misguided youth did your reverence say echoed hugh in a tone of utter astonishment never were they better guided than when they entered my poor house oh had your reverence but seen them when i heard their cries and rushed forth to their assistance dripping with wet were they like three drowned men at the resurrecahem interrupted hugh recollecting that the comparison he meditated might not suit the doctors ideas of propriety  but why were they abroad on such a night inquired the president  ah doctor you little know the love these good young gentlemen bear for you replied the landlord your absence your long absence had alarmed them and they rushed forth through the rain and darkness to seek you  and was this indeed so asked the doctor in a softened tone and casting a tender and grateful look upon the three students they it is but justice to mention had simultaneously made a step forward in order to contradict the egregious falsehoods of which hughs fancy was so fertile but he assumed an expression of such ludicrous entreaty that it was irresistible  but methinks their anxiety was not of long continuance observed dr melmoth looking at the wine and remembering the song that his entrance had interrupted  ah your reverence disapproves of the wine i see answered hugh crombie i did but offer them a drop to keep the life in their poor young hearts my dame advised strong waters but dame crombie says i would ye corrupt their youth and in my zeal for their good doctor i was delighting them just at your entrance with a pious little melody of my own against the sin of drunkenness  truly i remember something of the kind observed dr melmoth and as i think it seemed to meet with good acceptance  ay that it did said the landlord will it please your reverence to hear it    king solomon of old boys a wise man im thinking   has warned you to beware of the horrid vice of drinking  but why talk i of drinking foolish man that i am and all this time doctor you have not sipped a drop of my wine now i entreat your reverence as you value your health and the peace and quiet of these youth  dr melmoth drank a glass of wine with the benevolent intention of allaying the anxiety of hugh crombie and the students he then prepared to depart for a strong wind had partially dispersed the clouds and occasioned an interval in the cataract of rain there was perhaps a little suspicion yet remaining in the good mans mind respecting the truth of the landlords story at least it was his evident intention to see the students fairly out of the inn before he quitted it himself they therefore proceeded along the passageway in a body the lamp that hugh crombie held but dimly enlightened them and the number and contiguity of the doors caused dr melmoth to lay his hand upon the wrong one  not there not there doctor it is dame crombies bedchamber shouted hugh most energetically now beelzebub defend me he muttered to himself perceiving that his exclamation had been a moment too late  heavens what do i see ejaculated dr melmoth lifting his hands and starting back from the entrance of the room the three students pressed forward mrs crombie and the servantgirl had been drawn to the spot by the sound of hughs voice and all their wondering eyes were fixed on poor ellen langton  the apartment in the midst of which she stood was dimly lighted by a solitary candle at the farther extremity but ellen was exposed to the glare of the three lamps held by hugh his wife and the servantgirl their combined rays seemed to form a focus exactly at the point where they reached her and the beholders had any been sufficiently calm might have watched her features in their agitated workings and frequent change of expression as perfectly as by the broad light of day terror had at first blanched her as white as a lily or as a marble statue which for a moment she resembled as she stood motionless in the centre of the room shame next bore sway and her blushing countenance covered by her slender white fingers might fantastically be compared to a variegated rose with its alternate stripes of white and red the next instant a sense of her pure and innocent intentions gave her strength and courage and her attitude and look had now something of pride and dignity these however in their turn gave way for edward walcott pressed forward and attempted to address her  ellen ellen he said in an agitated and quivering whisper but what was to follow cannot be known for his emotion checked his utterance his tone and look however again overcame ellen langton and she burst into tears fanshawe advanced and took edwards arm she has been deceived he whispered she is innocent you are unworthy of her if you doubt it  why do you interfere sir demanded edward whose passions thoroughly excited would willingly have wreaked themselves on any one what right have you to speak of her innocence perhaps he continued an undefined and ridiculous suspicion arising in his mindperhaps you are acquainted with her intentions perhaps you are the deceiver  fanshawes temper was not naturally of the meekest character and having had a thousand bitter feelings of his own to overcome before he could attempt to console edward this rude repulse had almost aroused him to fierceness but his pride of which a more moderate degree would have had a less peaceable effect came to his assistance and he turned calmly and contemptuously away  ellen in the mean time had been restored to some degree of composure to this effect a feeling of pique against edward walcott had contributed she had distinguished his voice in the neighboring apartment had heard his mirth and wild laughter without being aware of the state of feeling that produced them she had supposed that the terms on which they parted in the morning which had been very grievous to herself would have produced a corresponding sadness in him but while she sat in loneliness and in tears her bosom distracted by a thousand anxieties and sorrows of many of which edward was the object his reckless gayety had seemed to prove the slight regard in which he held her after the first outbreak of emotion therefore she called up her pride of which on proper occasions she had a reasonable share and sustained his upbraiding glance with a passive composure which women have more readily at command than men  dr melmoths surprise had during this time kept him silent and inactive he gazed alternately from one to another of those who stood around him as if to seek some explanation of so strange an event but the faces of all were as perplexed as his own even hugh crombie had assumed a look of speechless wonderspeechless because his imagination prolific as it was could not supply a plausible falsehood  ellen dearest child at length said the doctor what is the meaning of this  ellen endeavored to reply but as her composure was merely external she was unable to render her words audible fanshawe spoke in a low voice to dr melmoth who appeared grateful for his advice  true it will be the better way he replied my wits are utterly confounded or i should not have remained thus long come my dear child he continued advancing to ellen and taking her hand let us return home and defer the explanation till the morrow there there only dry your eyes and we will say no more about it  and that will be your wisest way old gentleman muttered hugh crombie  ellen at first exhibited but little desire or rather an evident reluctance to accompany her guardian she hung back while her glance passed almost imperceptibly over the faces that gazed so eagerly at her but the one she sought was not visible among them she had no alternative and suffered herself to be led from the inn  edward walcott alone remained behind the most wretched being at least such was his own opinion that breathed the vital air he felt a sinking and sickness of the heart and alternately a feverish frenzy neither of which his short and cloudless existence had heretofore occasioned him to experience he was jealous of he knew not whom and he knew not what he was ungenerous enough to believe that ellenhis pure and lovely ellen had degraded herself though from what motive or by whose agency he could not conjecture when dr melmoth had taken her in charge edward returned to the apartment where he had spent the evening the wine was still upon the table and in the desperate hope of stupefying his faculties he unwisely swallowed huge successive draughts the effect of his imprudence was not long in manifesting itself though insensibility which at another time would have been the result did not now follow acting upon his previous agitation the wine seemed to set his blood in a flame and for the time being he was a perfect madman  a phrenologist would probably have found the organ of destructiveness in strong development just then upon edwards cranium for he certainly manifested an impulse to break and destroy whatever chanced to be within his reach he commenced his operations by upsetting the table and breaking the bottles and glasses then seizing a tall heavy chair in each hand he hurled them with prodigious forceone through the window and the other against a large lookingglass the most valuable article of furniture in hugh crombies inn the crash and clatter of these outrageous proceedings soon brought the master mistress and maidservant to the scene of action but the two latter at the first sight of edwards wild demeanor and gleaming eyes retreated with all imaginable expedition hugh chose a position behind the door from whence protruding his head he endeavored to mollify his inebriated guest his interference however had nearly been productive of most unfortunate consequences for a massive andiron with round brazen head whizzed past him within a hairsbreadth of his ear  i might as safely take my chance in a battle exclaimed hugh withdrawing his head and speaking to a man who stood in the passageway a little twist of his hand to the left would have served my turn as well as if i stood in the path of a fortytwo pound ball and here comes another broadside he added as some other article of furniture rattled against the door  let us return his fire hugh said the person whom he addressed composedly lifting the andiron he is in want of ammunition let us send him back his own  the sound of this mans voice produced a most singular effect upon edward the moment before his actions had been those of a raving maniac but when the words struck his ear he paused put his hand to his forehead seemed to recollect himself and finally advanced with a firm and steady step his countenance was dark and angry but no longer wild  i have found you villain he said to the angler it is you who have done this  and having done it the wrath of a boyhis drunken wrathwill not induce me to deny it replied the other scornfully  the boy will require a mans satisfaction returned edward and that speedily  will you take it now inquired the angler with a cool derisive smile and almost in a whisper at the same time he produced a brace of pistols and held them towards the young man  willingly answered edward taking one of the weapons choose your distance  the angler stepped back a pace but before their deadly intentions so suddenly conceived could be executed hugh crombie interposed himself between them  do you take my best parlor for the cabin of the black andrew where a pistolshot was a nightly pastime he inquired of his comrade and you master edward with what sort of a face will you walk into the chapel to morning prayers after putting a ball through this mans head or receiving one through your own though in this last case you will be past praying for or praying either  stand aside i will take the risk make way or i will put the ball through your own head exclaimed edward fiercely for the interval of rationality that circumstances had produced was again giving way to intoxication  you see how it is said hugh to his companion unheard by edward you shall take a shot at me sooner than at the poor lad in his present state you have done him harm enough already and intend him more i propose he continued aloud and with a peculiar glance towards the angler that this affair be decided tomorrow at nine oclock under the old oak on the bank of the stream in the mean time i will take charge of these popguns for fear of accidents  well mine host be it as you wish said his comrade a shot more or less is of little consequence to me he accordingly delivered his weapon to hugh crombie and walked carelessly away  come master walcott the enemy has retreated victoria and now i see the sooner i get you to your chamber the better added he aside for the wine was at last beginning to produce its legitimate effect in stupefying the young mans mental and bodily faculties  hugh crombies assistance though not perhaps quite indispensable was certainly very convenient to our unfortunate hero in the course of the short walk that brought him to his chamber when arrived there and in bed he was soon locked in a sleep scarcely less deep than that of death  the weather during the last hour had appeared to be on the point of changing indeed there were every few minutes most rapid changes a strong breeze sometimes drove the clouds from the brow of heaven so as to disclose a few of the stars but immediately after the darkness would again become egyptian and the rain rush like a torrent from the sky    chapter vi    about her neck a packetmail    fraught with advice some fresh some stale    of men that walked when they were dead       hudibras  scarcely a word had passed between dr melmoth and ellen langton on their way home for though the former was aware that his duty towards his ward would compel him to inquire into the motives of her conduct the tenderness of his heart prompted him to defer the scrutiny to the latest moment the same tenderness induced him to connive at ellens stealing secretly up to her chamber unseen by mrs melmoth to render which measure practicable he opened the housedoor very softly and stood before his halfsleeping spouse who waited his arrival in the parlor without any previous notice this act of the doctors benevolence was not destitute of heroism for he was well assured that should the affair come to the ladys knowledge through any other channel her vengeance would descend not less heavily on him for concealing than on ellen for perpetrating the elopement that she had thus far no suspicion of the fact was evident from her composure as well as from the reply to a question which with more than his usual art her husband put to her respecting the nonappearance of his ward mrs melmoth answered that ellen had complained of indisposition and after drinking by her prescription a large cup of herbtea had retired to her chamber early in the evening thankful that all was yet safe the doctor laid his head upon his pillow but late as was the hour his many anxious thoughts long drove sleep from his eyelids  the diminution in the quantity of his natural rest did not however prevent dr melmoth from rising at his usual hour which at all seasons of the year was an early one he found on descending to the parlor that breakfast was nearly in readiness for the lady of the house and as a corollary her servantgirl was not accustomed to await the rising of the sun in order to commence her domestic labors ellen langton however who had heretofore assimilated her habits to those of the family was this morning invisiblea circumstance imputed by mrs melmoth to her indisposition of the preceding evening and by the doctor to mortification on account of her elopement and its discovery  i think i will step into ellens bedchamber said mrs melmoth and inquire how she feels herself the morning is delightful after the storm and the air will do her good  had we not better proceed with our breakfast if the poor child is sleeping it were a pity to disturb her observed the doctor for besides his sympathy with ellens feelings he was reluctant as if he were the guilty one to meet her face  well be it so and now sit down doctor for the hot cakes are cooling fast i suppose you will say they are not so good as those ellen made yesterday morning i know not how you will bear to part with her though the thing must soon be  it will be a sore trial doubtless replied dr melmothlike tearing away a branch that is grafted on an old tree and yet there will be a satisfaction in delivering her safe into her fathers hands  a satisfaction for which you may thank me doctor observed the lady if there had been none but you to look after the poor things doings she would have been enticed away long ere this for the sake of her money  dr melmoths prudence could scarcely restrain a smile at the thought that an elopement as he had reason to believe had been plotted and partly carried into execution while ellen was under the sole care of his lady and had been frustrated only by his own despised agency he was not accustomed howevernor was this an eligible occasionto dispute any of mrs melmoths claims to superior wisdom  the breakfast proceeded in silence or at least without any conversation material to the tale at its conclusion mrs melmoth was again meditating on the propriety of entering ellens chamber but she was now prevented by an incident that always excited much interest both in herself and her husband  this was the entrance of the servant bearing the letters and newspaper with which once a fortnight the mailcarrier journeyed up the valley dr melmoths situation at the head of a respectable seminary and his character as a scholar had procured him an extensive correspondence among the learned men of his own country and he had even exchanged epistles with one or two of the most distinguished dissenting clergymen of great britain but unless when some fond mother enclosed a onepound note to defray the private expenses of her son at college it was frequently the case that the packets addressed to the doctor were the sole contents of the mailbag in the present instance his letters were very numerous and to judge from the one he chanced first to open of an unconscionable length while he was engaged in their perusal mrs melmoth amused herself with the newspapera little sheet of about twelve inches square which had but one rival in the country commencing with the title she labored on through advertisements old and new through poetry lamentably deficient in rhythm and rhymes through essays the ideas of which had been trite since the first week of the creation till she finally arrived at the department that a fortnight before had contained the latest news from all quarters making such remarks upon these items as to her seemed good the dames notice was at length attracted by an article which her sudden exclamation proved to possess uncommon interest casting her eye hastily over it she immediately began to read aloud to her husband but he deeply engaged in a long and learned letter instead of listening to what she wished to communicate exerted his own lungs in opposition to hers as is the custom of abstracted men when disturbed the result was as follows  a brig just arrived in the outer harbor began mrs melmoth reports that on the morning of the 25th ulthere the doctor broke in wherefore i am compelled to differ from your exposition of the said passage for those reasons of the which i have given you a taste providedthe ladys voice was now almost audible ship bottom upward discovered by the name on her stern to be the ellen ofand in the same opinion are hooker cotton and divers learned divines of a later date  the doctors lungs were deep and strong and victory seemed to incline toward him but mrs melmoth now made use of a tone whose peculiar shrillness as long experience had taught her husband augured a mood of mind not to be trifled with  on my word doctor she exclaimed this is most unfeeling and unchristian conduct here am i endeavoring to inform you of the death of an old friend and you continue as deaf as a post  dr melmoth who had heard the sound without receiving the sense of these words now laid aside the letter in despair and submissively requested to be informed of her pleasure  there read for yourself she replied handing him the paper and pointing to the passage containing the important intelligenceread and then finish your letter if you have a mind  he took the paper unable to conjecture how the dame could be so much interested in any part of its contents but before he had read many words he grew pale as death good heavens what is this he exclaimed he then read on being the vessel wherein that eminent son of new england john langton esq had taken passage for his native country after an absence of many years  our poor ellen his orphan child said dr melmoth dropping the paper how shall we break the intelligence to her alas her share of the affliction causes me to forget my own  it is a heavy misfortune doubtless and ellen will grieve as a daughter should replied mrs melmoth speaking with the good sense of which she had a competent share but she has never known her father and her sorrow must arise from a sense of duty more than from strong affection i will go and inform her of her loss it is late and i wonder if she be still asleep  be cautious dearest wife said the doctor ellen has strong feelings and a sudden shock might be dangerous  i think i may be trusted dr melmoth replied the lady who had a high opinion of her own abilities as a comforter and was not averse to exercise them  her husband after her departure sat listlessly turning over the letters that yet remained unopened feeling little curiosity after such melancholy intelligence respecting their contents but by the handwriting of the direction on one of them his attention was gradually arrested till he found himself gazing earnestly on those strong firm regular characters they were perfectly familiar to his eye but from what hand they came he could not conjecture suddenly however the truth burst upon him and after noticing the date and reading a few lines he rushed hastily in pursuit of his wife  he had arrived at the top of his speed and at the middle of the staircase when his course was arrested by the lady whom he sought who came with a velocity equal to his own in an opposite direction the consequence was a concussion between the two meeting masses by which mrs melmoth was seated securely on the stairs while the doctor was only preserved from precipitation to the bottom by clinging desperately to the balustrade as soon as the pair discovered that they had sustained no material injury by their contact they began eagerly to explain the cause of their mutual haste without those reproaches which on the ladys part would at another time have followed such an accident  you have not told her the bad news i trust cried dr melmoth after each had communicated his and her intelligence without obtaining audience of the other  would you have me tell it to the bare walls inquired the lady in her shrillest tone have i not just informed you that she has gone fled eloped her chamber is empty and her bed has not been occupied  gone repeated the doctor and when her father comes to demand his daughter of me what answer shall i make  now heaven defend us from the visits of the dead and drowned cried mrs melmoth this is a serious affair doctor but not i trust sufficient to raise a ghost  mr langton is yet no ghost answered he though this event will go near to make him one he was fortunately prevented after he had made every preparation from taking passage in the vessel that was lost  and where is he now she inquired  he is in new england perhaps he is at this moment on his way to us replied her husband his letter is dated nearly a fortnight back and he expresses an intention of being with us in a few days  well i thank heaven for his safety said mrs melmoth but truly the poor gentleman could not have chosen a better time to be drowned nor a worse one to come to life than this what we shall do doctor i know not but had you locked the doors and fastened the windows as i advised the misfortune could not have happened  why the whole country would have flouted us answered the doctor is there a door in all the province that is barred or bolted night or day nevertheless it might have been advisable last night had it occurred to me  and why at that time more than at all times she inquired we had surely no reason to fear this event  dr melmoth was silent for his worldly wisdom was sufficient to deter him from giving his lady the opportunity which she would not fail to use to the utmost of laying the blame of the elopement at his door he now proceeded with a heavy heart to ellens chamber to satisfy himself with his own eyes of the state of affairs it was deserted too truly and the wildflowers with which it was the maidens custom daily to decorate her premises were drooping as if in sorrow for her who had placed them there mrs melmoth on this second visit discovered on the table a note addressed to her husband and containing a few words of gratitude from ellen but no explanation of her mysterious flight the doctor gazed long on the tiny letters which had evidently been traced with a trembling hand and blotted with many tears  there is a mystery in thisa mystery that i cannot fathom he said and now i would i knew what measures it would be proper to take  get you on horseback dr melmoth and proceed as speedily as may be down the valley to the town said the dame the influence of whose firmer mind was sometimes as in the present case most beneficially exerted over his own you must not spare for trouble no nor for danger nowoh if i were a man  oh that you were murmured the doctor in a perfectly inaudible voice welland when i reach the town what then  as i am a christian woman my patience cannot endure you exclaimed mrs melmoth oh i love to see a man with the spirit of a man but youand she turned away in utter scorn  but dearest wife remonstrated the husband who was really at a loss how to proceed and anxious for her advice your worldly experience is greater than mine and i desire to profit by it what should be my next measure after arriving at the town  mrs melmoth was appeased by the submission with which the doctor asked her counsel though if the truth must be told she heartily despised him for needing it she condescended however to instruct him in the proper method of pursuing the runaway maiden and directed him before his departure to put strict inquiries to hugh crombie respecting any stranger who might lately have visited his inn that there would be wisdom in this dr melmoth had his own reasons for believing and still without imparting them to his lady he proceeded to do as he had been bid  the veracious landlord acknowledged that a stranger had spent a night and day at his inn and was missing that morning but he utterly denied all acquaintance with his character or privity to his purposes had mrs melmoth instead of her husband conducted the examination the result might have been different as the case was the doctor returned to his dwelling but little wiser than he went forth and ordering his steed to be saddled he began a journey of which he knew not what would be the end  in the mean time the intelligence of ellens disappearance circulated rapidly and soon sent forth hunters more fit to follow the chase than dr melmoth    chapter vii    there was racing and chasing oer cannobie lee     walter scott   when edward walcott awoke the next morning from his deep slumber his first consciousness was of a heavy weight upon his mind the cause of which he was unable immediately to recollect one by one however by means of the association of ideas the events of the preceding night came back to his memory though those of latest occurrence were dim as dreams but one circumstance was only too well rememberedthe discovery of ellen langton by a strong effort he next attained to an uncertain recollection of a scene of madness and violence followed as he at first thought by a duel a little further reflection however informed him that this event was yet among the things of futurity but he could by no means recall the appointed time or place as he had not the slightest intention praiseworthy and prudent as it would unquestionably have been to give up the chance of avenging ellens wrongs and his own he immediately arose and began to dress meaning to learn from hugh crombie those particulars which his own memory had not retained his chief apprehension was that the appointed time had already elapsed for the early sunbeams of a glorious morning were now peeping into his chamber  more than once during the progress of dressing he was inclined to believe that the duel had actually taken place and been fatal to him and that he was now in those regions to which his conscience told him such an event would be likely to send him this idea resulted from his bodily sensations which were in the highest degree uncomfortable he was tormented by a raging thirst that seemed to have absorbed all the moisture of his throat and stomach and in his present agitation a cup of icy water would have been his first wish had all the treasures of earth and sea been at his command his head too throbbed almost to bursting and the whirl of his brain at every movement promised little accuracy in the aim of his pistol when he should meet the angler these feelings together with the deep degradation of his mind made him resolve that no circumstances should again draw him into an excess of wine in the mean time his head was perhaps still too much confused to allow him fully to realize his unpleasant situation  before edward was prepared to leave his chamber the door was opened by one of the college bedmakers who perceiving that he was nearly dressed entered and began to set the apartment in order there were two of these officials pertaining to harley college each of them being and for obvious reasons this was an indispensable qualification a model of perfect ugliness in her own way one was a tall rawboned hugejointed doublefisted giantess admirably fitted to sustain the part of glumdalia in the tragedy of tom thumb her features were as excellent as her form appearing to have been roughhewn with a broadaxe and left unpolished the other was a short squat figure about two thirds the height and three times the circumference of ordinary females her hair was gray her complexion of a deep yellow and her most remarkable feature was a short snub nose just discernible amid the broad immensity of her face this latter lady was she who now entered edwards chamber notwithstanding her deficiency in personal attractions she was rather a favorite of the students being goodnatured anxious for their comfort and when duly encouraged very communicative edward perceived as soon as she appeared that she only waited his assistance in order to disburden herself of some extraordinary information and more from compassion than curiosity he began to question her  well dolly what news this morning  why let me seeoh yes it had almost slipped my memory replied the bedmaker poor widow butler died last night after her long sickness poor woman i remember her forty years ago or soas rosy a lass as you could set eyes on  ah has she gone said edward recollecting the sick woman of the cottage which he had entered with ellen and fanshawe was she not out of her right mind dolly  yes this seven years she answered they say she came to her senses a bit when dr melmoth visited her yesterday but was raving mad when she died ah that son of hersif he is yet alive well well  she had a son then inquired edward  yes such as he was the lord preserve me from such a one said dolly it was thought he went off with hugh crombie that keeps the tavern now that was fifteen years ago  and have they heard nothing of him since asked edward  nothing goodnothing good said the bedmaker  stories did travel up the valley now and then but for five years there has been no word of him they say merchant langton ellens father met him in foreign parts and would have made a man of him but there was too much of the wicked one in him for that well poor woman i wonder wholl preach her funeral sermon  dr melmoth probably observed the student  no no the doctor will never finish his journey in time and who knows but his own funeral will be the end of it said dolly with a sagacious shake of her head  dr melmoth gone a journey repeated edward what do you mean for what purpose  for a good purpose enough i may say replied she to search out miss ellen that was run away with last night  in the devils name woman of what are you speaking shouted edward seizing the affrighted bedmaker forcibly by the arm  poor dolly had chosen this circuitous method of communicating her intelligence because she was well aware that if she first told of ellens flight she should find no ear for her account of the widow butlers death she had not calculated however that the news would produce so violent an effect upon her auditor and her voice faltered as she recounted what she knew of the affair she had hardly concluded before edwardwho as she proceeded had been making hasty preparations rushed from his chamber and took the way towards hugh crombies inn he had no difficulty in finding the landlord who had already occupied his accustomed seat and was smoking his accustomed pipe under the elmtree  well master walcott you have come to take a stomachreliever this morning i suppose said hugh taking the pipe from his mouth what shall it bea bumper of wine with an egg or a glass of smooth old oily brandy such as dame crombie and i keep for our own drinking come that will do it i know  no no neither replied edward shuddering involuntarily at the bare mention of wine and strong drink you know well hugh crombie the errand on which i come  well perhaps i do said the landlord you come to order me to saddle my best horse you are for a ride this fine morning  true and i must learn of you in what direction to turn my horses head replied edward walcott  i understand you said hugh nodding and smiling and now master edward i really have taken a strong liking to you and if you please to hearken to it you shall have some of my best advice  speak said the young man expecting to be told in what direction to pursue the chase  i advise you then continued hugh crombie in a tone in which some real feeling mingled with assumed carelessnessi advise you to forget that you have ever known this girl that she has ever existed for she is as much lost to you as if she never had been born or as if the grave had covered her come come man toss off a quart of my old wine and kept up a merry heart this has been my way in many a heavier sorrow than ever you have felt and you see i am alive and merry yet but hughs merriment had failed him just as he was making his boast of it for edward saw a tear in the corner of his eye  forget her never never said the student while his heart sank within him at the hopelessness of pursuit which hughs words implied i will follow her to the ends of the earth  then so much the worse for you and for my poor nag on whose back you shall be in three minutes rejoined the landlord i have spoken to you as i would to my own son if i had such an incumbrancehere you ragamuffin saddle the gray and lead him round to the door  the gray i will ride the black said edward i know your best horse as well as you do yourself hugh  there is no black horse in my stable i have parted with him to an old comrade of mine answered the landlord with a wink of acknowledgment to what he saw were edwards suspicions the gray is a stout nag and will carry you a round pace though not so fast as to bring you up with them you seek i reserved him for you and put mr fanshawe off with the old white on which i travelled hitherward a year or two since  fanshawe has he then the start of me asked edward  he rode off about twenty minutes ago replied hugh but you will overtake him within ten miles at farthest but if mortal man could recover the girl that fellow would do it even if he had no better nag than a broomstick like the witches of old times  did he obtain any information from you as to the course inquired the student  i could give him only this much said hugh pointing down the road in the direction of the town my old comrade trusts no man further than is needful and i ask no unnecessary questions  the hostler now led up to the door the horse which edward was to ride the young man mounted with all expedition but as he was about to apply the spurs his thirst which the bedmakers intelligence had caused him to forget returned most powerfully upon him  for heavens sake hugh a mug of your sharpest cider and let it be a large one he exclaimed my tongue rattles in my mouth like  like the bones in a dicebox said the landlord finishing the comparison and hastening to obey edwards directions indeed he rather exceeded them by mingling with the juice of the apple a gill of his old brandy which his own experience told him would at that time have a most desirable effect upon the young mans internal system  it is powerful stuff mine host and i feel like a new man already observed edward after draining the mug to the bottom  he is a fine lad and sits his horse most gallantly said hugh crombie to himself as the student rode off i heartily wish him success i wish to heaven my conscience had suffered me to betray the plot before it was too late well well a man must keep his mite of honesty  the morning was now one of the most bright and glorious that ever shone for mortals and under other circumstances edwards bosom would have been as light and his spirit would have sung as cheerfully as one of the many birds that warbled around him the raindrops of the preceding night hung like glittering diamonds on every leaf of every tree shaken and rendered more brilliant by occasional sighs of wind that removed from the traveller the superfluous heat of an unclouded sun in spite of the adventure so mysterious and vexatious in which he was engaged edwards elastic spirit assisted perhaps by the brandy he had unwittingly swallowed rose higher as he rode on and he soon found himself endeavoring to accommodate the tune of one of hugh crombies ballads to the motion of the horse nor did this reviving cheerfulness argue anything against his unwavering faith and pure and fervent love for ellen langton a sorrowful and repining disposition is not the necessary accompaniment of a leal and loving heart and edwards spirits were cheered not by forgetfulness but by hope which would not permit him to doubt of the ultimate success of his pursuit the uncertainty itself and the probable danger of the expedition were not without their charm to a youthful and adventurous spirit in fact edward would not have been altogether satisfied to recover the errant damsel without first doing battle in her behalf  he had proceeded but a few miles before he came in sight of fanshawe who had been accommodated by the landlord with a horse much inferior to his own the speed to which he had been put had almost exhausted the poor animal whose best pace was now but little beyond a walk edward drew his bridle as he came up with fanshawe  i have been anxious to apologize he said to him for the hasty and unjust expressions of which i made use last evening may i hope that in consideration of my mental distraction and the causes of it you will forget what has passed  i had already forgotten it replied fanshawe freely offering his hand i saw your disturbed state of feeling and it would have been unjust both to you and to myself to remember the errors it occasioned  a wild expedition this observed edward after shaking warmly the offered hand unless we obtain some further information at the town we shall hardly know which way to continue the pursuit  we can scarcely fail i think of lighting upon some trace of them said fanshawe their flight must have commenced after the storm subsided which would give them but a few hours the start of us may i beg he continued nothing the superior condition of his rivals horse that you will not attempt to accommodate your pace to mine  edward bowed and rode on wondering at the change which a few months had wrought in fanshawes character on this occasion especially the energy of his mind had communicated itself to his frame the color was strong and high in his cheek and his whole appearance was that of a gallant and manly youth whom a lady might love or a foe might fear edward had not been so slow as his mistress in discovering the students affection and he could not but acknowledge in his heart that he was a rival not to be despised and might yet be a successful one if by his means ellen langton were restored to her friends this consideration caused him to spur forward with increased ardor but all his speed could not divest him of the idea that fanshawe would finally overtake him and attain the object of their mutual pursuit there was certainly no apparent ground for this imagination for every step of his horse increased the advantage which edward had gained and he soon lost sight of his rival  shortly after overtaking fanshawe the young man passed the lonely cottage formerly the residence of the widow butler who now lay dead within he was at first inclined to alight and make inquiries respecting the fugitives for he observed through the windows the faces of several persons whom curiosity or some better feeling had led to the house of mourning recollecting however that this portion of the road must have been passed by the angler and ellen at too early an hour to attract notice he forbore to waste time by a fruitless delay  edward proceeded on his journey meeting with no other noticeable event till arriving at the summit of a hill he beheld a few hundred yards before him the rev dr melmoth the worthy president was toiling onward at a rate unexampled in the history either of himself or his steed the excellence of the latter consisting in surefootedness rather than rapidity the rider looked round seemingly in some apprehension at the sound of hooftramps behind him but was unable to conceal his satisfaction on recognizing edward walcott  in the whole course of his life dr melmoth had never been placed in circumstances so embarrassing as the present he was altogether a child in the ways of the world having spent his youth and early manhood in abstracted study and his maturity in the solitude of these hills the expedition therefore on which fate had now thrust him was an entire deviation from the quiet pathway of all his former years and he felt like one who sets forth over the broad ocean without chart or compass the affair would undoubtedly have been perplexing to a man of far more experience than he but the doctor pictured to himself a thousand difficulties and dangers which except in his imagination had no existence the perturbation of his spirit had compelled him more than once since his departure to regret that he had not invited mrs melmoth to a share in the adventure this being an occasion where her firmness decision and confident sagacitywhich made her a sort of domestic hedgehogwould have been peculiarly appropriate in the absence of such a counsellor even edward walcottyoung as he was and indiscreet as the doctor thought himwas a substitute not to be despised and it was singular and rather ludicrous to observe how the grayhaired man unconsciously became as a child to the beardless youth he addressed edward with an assumption of dignity through which his pleasure at the meeting was very obvious  young gentleman this is not well he said by what authority have you absented yourself from the walls of alma mater during termtime  i conceived that it was unnecessary to ask leave at such a conjuncture and when the head of the institution was himself in the saddle replied edward  it was a fault it was a fault said dr melmoth shaking his head but in consideration of the motive i may pass it over and now my dear edward i advise that we continue our journey together as your youth and inexperience will stand in need of the wisdom of my gray head nay i pray you lay not the lash to your steed you have ridden fast and far and a slower pace is requisite for a season  and in order to keep up with his young companion the doctor smote his own gray nag which unhappy beast wondering what strange concatenation of events had procured him such treatment endeavored to obey his masters wishes edward had sufficient compassion for dr melmoth especially as his own horse now exhibited signs of weariness to moderate his pace to one attainable by the former  alas youth these are strange times observed the president when a doctor of divinity and an undergraduate set forth like a knighterrant and his squire in search of a stray damsel methinks i am an epitome of the church militant or a new species of polemical divinity pray heaven however there be no encounter in store for us for i utterly forgot to provide myself with weapons  i took some thought for that matter reverend knight replied edward whose imagination was highly tickled by dr melmoths chivalrous comparison  ay i see that you have girded on a sword said the divine but wherewith shall i defend myself my hand being empty except of this golden headed staff the gift of mr langton  one of these if you will accept it answered edward exhibiting a brace of pistols will serve to begin the conflict before you join the battle hand to hand  nay i shall find little safety in meddling with that deadly instrument since i know not accurately from which end proceeds the bullet said dr melmoth but were it not better seeing we are so well provided with artillery to betake ourselves in the event of an encounter to some stonewall or other place of strength  if i may presume to advise said the squire you as being most valiant and experienced should ride forward lance in hand your long staff serving for a lance while i annoy the enemy from afar  like teucer behind the shield of ajax interrupted dr melmoth or david with his stone and sling no no young man i have left unfinished in my study a learned treatise important not only to the present age but to posterity for whose sakes i must take heed to my safetybut lo who ride yonder he exclaimed in manifest alarm pointing to some horsemen upon the brow of a hill at a short distance before them  fear not gallant leader said edward walcott who had already discovered the objects of the doctors terror they are men of peace as we shall shortly see the foremost is somewhere near your own years and rides like a grave substantial citizenthough what he does here i know not behind come two servants men likewise of sober age and pacific appearance  truly your eyes are better than mine own of a verity you are in the right acquiesced dr melmoth recovering his usual quantum of intrepidity we will ride forward courageously as those who in a just cause fear neither death nor bonds  the reverend knighterrant and his squire at the time of discovering the three horsemen were within a very short distance of the town which was however concealed from their view by the hill that the strangers were descending the road from harley college through almost its whole extent had been rough and wild and the country thin of population but now standing frequent amid fertile fields on each side of the way were neat little cottages from which groups of whiteheaded children rushed forth to gaze upon the travellers the three strangers as well as the doctor and edward were surrounded as they approached each other by a crowd of this kind plying their little bare legs most pertinaciously in order to keep pace with the horses  as edward gained a nearer view of the foremost rider his grave aspect and stately demeanor struck him with involuntary respect there were deep lines of thought across his brow and his calm yet bright gray eye betokened a steadfast soul there was also an air of conscious importance even in the manner in which the stranger sat his horse which a mans good opinion of himself unassisted by the concurrence of the world in general seldom bestows the two servants rode at a respectable distance in the rear and the heavy portmanteaus at their backs intimated that the party had journeyed from afar dr melmoth endeavored to assume the dignity that became him as the head of harley college and with a gentle stroke of his staff upon his wearied steed and a grave nod to the principal stranger was about to commence the ascent of the hill at the foot of which they were the gentleman however made a halt  dr melmoth am i so fortunate as to meet you he exclaimed in accents expressive of as much surprise and pleasure as were consistent with his staid demeanor have you then forgotten your old friend  mr langton can it be said the doctor after looking him in the face a moment yes it is my old friend indeed welcome welcome though you come at an unfortunate time  what say you how is my child ellen i trust is well cried mr langton a fathers anxiety overcoming the coldness and reserve that were natural to him or that long habit had made a second nature  she is well in health she was so at least last night replied dr melmoth unable to meet the eye of his friend butbut i have been a careless shepherd and the lamb has strayed from the fold while i slept  edward walcott who was a deeply interested observer of this scene had anticipated that a burst of passionate grief would follow the disclosure he was however altogether mistaken there was a momentary convulsion of mr langtons strong features as quick to come and go as a flash of lightning and then his countenance was as composedthough perhaps a little sterneras before he seemed about to inquire into the particulars of what so nearly concerned him but changed his purpose on observing the crowd of children who with one or two of their parents were endeavoring to catch the words that passed between the doctor and himself  i will turn back with you to the village he said in a steady voice and at your leisure i shall desire to hear the particulars of this unfortunate affair  he wheeled his horse accordingly and side by side with dr melmoth began to ascend the hill on reaching the summit the little country town lay before them presenting a cheerful and busy spectacle it consisted of one long regular street extending parallel to and at a short distance from the river which here enlarged by a junction with another stream became navigable not indeed for vessels of burden but for rafts of lumber and boats of considerable size the houses with peaked roofs and jutting stories stood at wide intervals along the street and the commercial character of the place was manifested by the shop door and windows that occupied the front of almost every dwelling one or two mansions however surrounded by trees and standing back at a haughty distance from the road were evidently the abodes of the aristocracy of the village it was not difficult to distinguish the owners of these selfimportant personages with canes and wellpowdered periwigsamong the crowd of meaner men who bestowed their attention upon dr melmoth and his friend as they rode by the town being the nearest mart of a large extent of back country there are many rough farmers and woodsmen to whom the cavalcade was an object of curiosity and admiration the former feeling indeed was general throughout the village the shopkeepers left their customers and looked forth from the doors the female portion of the community thrust their heads from the windows and the people in the street formed a lane through which with all eyes concentrated upon them the party rode onward to the tavern the general aptitude that pervades the populace of a small country town to meddle with affairs not legitimately concerning them was increased on this occasion by the sudden return of mr langton after passing through the village many conjectures were afloat respecting the cause of this retrograde movement and by degrees something like the truth though much distorted spread generally among the crowd communicated probably from mr langtons servants edward walcott incensed at the uncourteous curiosity of which he as well as his companions was the object felt a frequent impulse though fortunately for himself resisted to make use of his riding switch in clearing a passage  on arriving at the tavern dr melmoth recounted to his friend the little he knew beyond the bare fact of ellens disappearance had edward walcott been called to their conference he might by disclosing the adventure of the angler have thrown a portion of light upon the affair but since his first introduction the cold and stately merchant had honored him with no sort of notice  edward on his part was not well pleased at the sudden appearance of ellens father and was little inclined to cooperate in any measures that he might adopt for her recovery it was his wish to pursue the chase on his own responsibility and as his own wisdom dictated he chose to be an independent ally rather than a subordinate assistant but as a step preliminary to his proceedings of every other kind he found it absolutely necessary having journeyed far and fasting to call upon the landlord for a supply of food the viands that were set before him were homely but abundant nor were edwards griefs and perplexities so absorbing as to overcome the appetite of youth and health  dr melmoth and mr langton after a short private conversation had summoned the landlord in the hope of obtaining some clew to the development of the mystery but no young lady nor any stranger answering to the description the doctor had received from hugh crombie which was indeed a false one had been seen to pass through the village since daybreak here therefore the friends were entirely at a loss in what direction to continue the pursuit the village was the focus of several roads diverging to widely distant portions of the country and which of these the fugitives had taken it was impossible to determine one point however might be considered certainthat the village was the first stage of their flight for it commanded the only outlet from the valley except a rugged path among the hills utterly impassable by horse in this dilemma expresses were sent by each of the different roads and poor ellens imprudencethe tale nowise decreasing as it rolled alongbecame known to a wide extent of country having thus done everything in his power to recover his daughter the merchant exhibited a composure which dr melmoth admired but could not equal his own mind however was in a far more comfortable state than when the responsibility of the pursuit had rested upon himself  edward walcott in the mean time had employed but a very few moments in satisfying his hunger after which his active intellect alternately formed and relinquished a thousand plans for the recovery of ellen fanshawes observation that her flight must have commenced after the subsiding of the storm recurred to him on inquiry he was informed that the violence of the rain had continued with a few momentary intermissions till near daylight the fugitives must therefore have passed through the village long after its inhabitants were abroad and how without the gift of invisibility they had contrived to elude notice edward could not conceive  fifty years ago thought edward my sweet ellen would have been deemed a witch for this trackless journey truly i could wish i were a wizard that i might bestride a broomstick and follow her  while the young man involved in these perplexing thoughts looked forth from the open window of the apartment his attention was drawn to an individual evidently of a different though not of a higher class than the countrymen among whom he stood edward now recollected that he had noticed his rough dark face among the most earnest of those who had watched the arrival of the party he had then taken him for one of the boatmen of whom there were many in the village and who had much of a sailorlike dress and appearance a second and more attentive observation however convinced edward that this mans life had not been spent upon fresh water and had any stronger evidence than the nameless marks which the ocean impresses upon its sons been necessary it would have been found in his mode of locomotion while edward was observing him he beat slowly up to one of mr langtons servants who was standing near the door of the inn he seemed to question the man with affected carelessness but his countenance was dark and perplexed when he turned to mingle again with the crowd edward lost no time in ascertaining from the servant the nature of his inquiries they had related to the elopement of mr langtons daughter which was indeed the prevailing if not the sole subject of conversation in the village  the grounds for supposing that this man was in any way connected with the angler were perhaps very slight yet in the perplexity of the whole affair they induced edward to resolve to get at the heart of his mystery to attain this end he took the most direct methodby applying to the man himself  he had now retired apart from the throng and bustle of the village and was seated upon a condemned boat that was drawn up to rot upon the banks of the river his arms were folded and his hat drawn over his brows the lower part of his face which alone was visible evinced gloom and depression as did also the deep sighs which because he thought no one was near him he did not attempt to restrain  friend i must speak with you said edward walcott laying his hand upon his shoulder after contemplating the man a moment himself unseen  he started at once from his abstraction and his seat apparently expecting violence and prepared to resist it but perceiving the youthful and solitary intruder upon his privacy he composed his features with much quickness  what would you with me he asked  they tarry longor you have kept a careless watch said edward speaking at a venture  for a moment there seemed a probability of obtaining such a reply to this observation as the youth had intended to elicit if any trust could be put in the language of the strangers countenance a set of words different from those to which he subsequently gave utterance had risen to his lips but he seemed naturally slow of speech and this defect was now as is frequently the case advantageous in giving him space for reflection  look you youngster crack no jokes on me he at length said contemptuously away back whence you came orand he slightly waved a small rattan that he held in his right hand  edwards eyes sparkled and his color rose you must change this tone fellow and that speedily he observed i order you to lower your hand and answer the questions that i shall put to you  the man gazed dubiously at him but finally adopted a more conciliatory mode of speech  well master and what is your business with me he inquired i am a boatman out of employ any commands in my line  pshaw i know you my good friend and you cannot deceive me replied edward walcott we are private here he continued looking around i have no desire or intention to do you harm and if you act according to my directions you shall have no cause to repent it  and what if i refuse to put myself under your orders inquired the man you are but a young captain for such an old hulk as mine  the ill consequences of a refusal would all be on your own side replied edward i shall in that case deliver you up to justice if i have not the means of capturing you myself he continued observing the seamans eye to wander rather scornfully over his youthful and slender figure there are hundreds within call whom it will be in vain to resist besides it requires little strength to use this he added laying his hand on a pistol  if that were all i could suit you there my lad muttered the stranger he continued aloud well what is your will with me dd ungenteel treatment this but put your questions and to oblige you i may answer themif so be that i know anything of the matter  you will do wisely observed the young man and now to business what reason have you to suppose that the persons for whom you watch are not already beyond the village the seaman paused long before he answered and gazed earnestly at edward apparently endeavoring to ascertain from his countenance the amount of his knowledge this he probably overrated but nevertheless hazarded a falsehood  i doubt not they passed before midnight he said i warrant you they are many a league towards the seacoast ere this  you have kept watch then since midnight asked edward  ay that have i and a dark and rough one it was answered the stranger  and you are certain that if they passed at all it must have been before that hour  i kept my walk across the road till the village was all astir said the seaman they could not have missed me so you see your best way is to give chase for they have a long start of you and you have no time to lose  your information is sufficient my good friend said edward with a smile i have reason to know that they did not commence their flight before midnight you have made it evident that they have not passed since ergo they have not passed at allan indisputable syllogism and now will i retrace my footsteps  stay young man said the stranger placing himself full in edwards way as he was about to hasten to the inn you have drawn me in to betray my comrade but before you leave this place you must answer a question or two of mine do you mean to take the law with you or will you right your wrongs if you have any with your own right hand  it is my intention to take the latter method but if i choose the former what then demanded edward nay nothing only you or i might not have gone hence alive replied the stranger but as you say he shall have fair play  on my word friend interrupted the young man i fear your intelligence has come too late to do either good or harm look towards the inn my companions are getting to horse and my life on it they know whither to ride  so saying he hastened away followed by the stranger it was indeed evident that news of some kind or other had reached the village the people were gathered in groups conversing eagerly and the pale cheeks uplifted eyebrows and outspread hands of some of the female sex filled edwards mind with undefined but intolerable apprehensions he forced his way to dr melmoth who had just mounted and seizing his bridle peremptorily demanded if he knew aught of ellen langton    chapter viii    full many a miserable year hath passed   she knows him as one dead or worse than dead   and many a change her varied life hath known   but her heart none     maturin   since her interview with the angler which was interrupted by the appearance of fanshawe ellen langtons hitherto calm and peaceful mind had been in a state of insufferable doubt and dismay she was imperatively called uponat least she so conceivedto break through the rules which nature and education impose upon her sex to quit the protection of those whose desire for her welfare was true and strong and to trust herself for what purpose she scarcely knew to a stranger from whom the instinctive purity of her mind would involuntarily have shrunk under whatever circumstances she had met him the letter which she had received from the hands of the angler had seemed to her inexperience to prove beyond a doubt that the bearer was the friend of her father and authorized by him if her duty and affection were stronger than her fears to guide her to his retreat the letter spoke vaguely of losses and misfortunes and of a necessity for concealment on her fathers part and secrecy on hers and to the credit of ellens not very romantic understanding it must be acknowledged that the mystery of the plot had nearly prevented its success she did not indeed doubt that the letter was from her fathers hand for every line and stroke and even many of its phrases were familiar to her her apprehension was that his misfortunes of what nature soever they were had affected his intellect and that under such an influence he had commanded her to take a step which nothing less than such a command could justify ellen did not however remain long in this opinion for when she reperused the letter and considered the firm regular characters and the stylecalm and cold even in requesting such a sacrificeshe felt that there was nothing like insanity here in fine she came gradually to the belief that there were strong reasons though incomprehensible by her for the secrecy that her father had enjoined  having arrived at this conviction her decision lay plain before her her affection for mr langton was not indeednor was it possibleso strong as that she would have felt for a parent who had watched over her from her infancy neither was the conception she had unavoidably formed of his character such as to promise that in him she would find an equivalent for all she must sacrifice on the contrary her gentle nature and loving heart which otherwise would have rejoiced in a new object of affection now shrank with something like dread from the idea of meeting her father stately cold and stern as she could not but imagine him a sense of duty was therefore ellens only support in resolving to tread the dark path that lay before her  had there been any person of her own sex in whom ellen felt confidence there is little doubt that she would so far have disobeyed her fathers letter as to communicate its contents and take counsel as to her proceedings but mrs melmoth was the only femaleexcepting indeed the maidservantto whom it was possible to make the communication and though ellen at first thought of such a step her timidity and her knowledge of the ladys character did not permit her to venture upon it she next reviewed her acquaintances of the other sex and dr melmoth first presented himself as in every respect but one an unexceptionable confidant but the single exception was equivalent to many the maiden with the highest opinion of the doctors learning and talents had sufficient penetration to know that in the ways of the world she was herself the better skilled of the two for a moment she thought of edward walcott but he was light and wild and which her delicacy made an insurmountable objection there was an untold love between them her thoughts finally centred on fanshawe in his judgment young and inexperienced though he was she would have placed a firm trust and his zeal from whatever cause it arose she could not doubt  if in the short time allowed her for reflection an opportunity had occurred for consulting him she would in all probability have taken advantage of it but the terms on which they had parted the preceding evening had afforded him no reason to hope for her confidence and he felt that there were others who had a better right to it than himself he did not therefore throw himself in her way and poor ellen was consequently left without an adviser  the determination that resulted from her own unassisted wisdom has been seen when discovered by dr melmoth at hugh crombies inn she was wholly prepared for flight and but for the intervention of the storm would ere then have been far away  the firmness of resolve that had impelled a timid maiden upon such a step was not likely to be broken by one defeat and ellen accordingly confident that the stranger would make a second attempt determined that no effort on her part should be wanting to its success on reaching her chamber therefore instead of retiring to rest of which from her sleepless thoughts of the preceding night she stood greatly in need she sat watching for the abatement of the storm her meditations were now calmer than at any time since her first meeting with the angler she felt as if her fate was decided the stain had fallen upon her reputation she was no longer the same pure being in the opinion of those whose approbation she most valued  one obstacle to her flightand to a womans mind a most powerful one had thus been removed dark and intricate as was the way it was easier now to proceed than to pause and her desperate and forlorn situation gave her a strength which hitherto she had not felt  at every cessation in the torrent of rain that beat against the house ellen flew to the window expecting to see the stranger form beneath it but the clouds would again thicken and the storm recommence with its former violence and she began to fear that the approach of morning would compel her to meet the now dreaded face of dr melmoth at length however a strong and steady wind supplying the place of the fitful gusts of the preceding part of the night broke and scattered the clouds from the broad expanse of the sky the moon commencing her late voyage not long before the sun was now visible setting forth like a lonely ship from the dark line of the horizon and touching at many a little silver cloud the islands of that aerial deep ellen felt that now the time was come and with a calmness wonderful to herself she prepared for her final departure  she had not long to wait ere she saw between the vacancies of the trees the angler advancing along the shady avenue that led to the principal entrance of dr melmoths dwelling he had no need to summon her either by word or signal for she had descended emerged from the door and stood before him while he was yet at some distance from the house  you have watched well he observed in a low strange tone as saith the scripture many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all  he took her arm and they hastened down the avenue then leaving hugh crombies inn on their right they found its master in a spot so shaded that the moonbeams could not enlighten it he held by the bridle two horses one of which the angler assisted ellen to mount then turning to the landlord he pressed a purse into his hand but hugh drew back and it fell to the ground  no this would not have tempted me nor will it reward me he said if you have gold to spare there are some that need it more than i  i understand you mine host i shall take thought for them and enough will remain for you and me replied his comrade i have seen the day when such a purse would not have slipped between your fingers well be it so and now hugh my old friend a shake of your hand for we are seeing our last of each other  pray heaven it be so though i wish you no ill said the landlord giving his hand  he then seemed about to approach ellen who had been unable to distinguish the words of this brief conversation but his comrade prevented him there is no time to lose he observed the moon is growing pale already and we should have been many a mile beyond the valley ere this he mounted as he spoke and guiding ellens rein till they reached the road they dashed away  it was now that she felt herself completely in his power and with that consciousness there came a sudden change of feeling and an altered view of her conduct a thousand reasons forced themselves upon her mind seeming to prove that she had been deceived while the motives so powerful with her but a moment before had either vanished from her memory or lost all their efficacy her companion who gazed searchingly into her face where the moonlight coming down between the pines allowed him to read its expression probably discerned somewhat of the state of her thoughts  do you repent so soon he inquired we have a weary way before us faint not ere we have well entered upon it  i have left dear friends behind me and am going i know not whither replied ellen tremblingly  you have a faithful guide he observed turning away his head and speaking in the tone of one who endeavors to smother a laugh  ellen had no heart to continue the conversation and they rode on in silence and through a wild and gloomy scene the wind roared heavily through the forest and the trees shed their raindrops upon the travellers the road at all times rough was now broken into deep gullies through which streams went murmuring down to mingle with the river the pale moonlight combined with the gray of the morning to give a ghastly and unsubstantial appearance to every object  the difficulties of the road had been so much increased by the storm that the purple eastern clouds gave notice of the near approach of the sun just as the travellers reached the little lonesome cottage which ellen remembered to have visited several months before on arriving opposite to it her companion checked his horse and gazed with a wild earnestness at the wretched habitation then stifling a groan that would not altogether be repressed he was about to pass on but at that moment the cottagedoor opened and a woman whose sour unpleasant countenance ellen recognized came hastily forth she seemed not to heed the travellers but the angler his voice thrilling and quivering with indescribable emotion addressed her  woman whither do you go he inquired  she started but after a momentary pause replied there is one within at the point of death she struggles fearfully and i cannot endure to watch alone by her bedside if you are christians come in with me  ellens companion leaped hastily from his horse assisted her also to dismount and followed the woman into the cottage having first thrown the bridles of the horses carelessly over the branch of a tree ellen trembled at the awful scene she would be compelled to witness but when death was so near at hand it was more terrible to stand alone in the dim morning light than even to watch the parting of soul and body she therefore entered the cottage  her guide his face muffled in his cloak had taken his stand at a distance from the deathbed in a part of the room which neither the increasing daylight nor the dim rays of a solitary lamp had yet enlightened at ellens entrance the dying woman lay still and apparently calm except that a plaintive halfarticulate sound occasionally wandered through her lips  hush for mercys sake silence whispered the other woman to the strangers there is good hope now that she will die a peaceable death but if she is disturbed the boldest of us will not dare to stand by her bedside  the whisper by which her sister endeavored to preserve quiet perhaps reached the ears of the dying female for she now raised herself in bed slowly but with a strength superior to what her situation promised her face was ghastly and wild from long illness approaching death and disturbed intellect and a disembodied spirit could scarcely be a more fearful object than one whose soul was just struggling forth her sister approaching with the soft and stealing step appropriate to the chamber of sickness and death attempted to replace the covering around her and to compose her again upon the pillow lie down and sleep sister she said and when the day breaks i will waken you methinks your breath comes freer already a little more slumber and tomorrow you will be well  my illness is gone i am well said the dyingwoman gasping for breath i wander where the fresh breeze comes sweetly over my face but a close and stifled air has choked my lungs  yet a little while and you will no longer draw your breath in pain observed her sister again replacing the bedclothes which she continued to throw off  my husband is with me murmured the widow he walks by my side and speaks to me as in old times but his words come faintly on my ear cheer me and comfort me my husband for there is a terror in those dim motionless eyes and in that shadowy voice  as she spoke thus she seemed to gaze upon some object that stood by her bedside and the eyes of those who witnessed this scene could not but follow the direction of hers they observed that the dying womans own shadow was marked upon the wall receiving a tremulous motion from the fitful rays of the lamp and from her own convulsive efforts my husband stands gazing on me she said again but my sonwhere is he and as i ask the father turns away his face where is our son for his sake i have longed to come to this land of rest for him i have sorrowed many years will he not comfort me now  at these words the stranger made a few hasty steps towards the bed but ere he reached it he conquered the impulse that drew him thither and shrouding his face more deeply in his cloak returned to his former position the dying woman in the mean time had thrown herself back upon the bed and her sobbing and wailing imaginary as was their cause were inexpressibly affecting  take me back to earth she said for its griefs have followed me hither  the stranger advanced and seizing the lamp knelt down by the bedside throwing the light full upon his pale and convulsed features  mother here is your son he exclaimed  at that unforgotten voice the darkness burst away at once from her soul she arose in bed her eyes and her whole countenance beaming with joy and threw her arms about his neck a multitude of words seemed struggling for utterance but they gave place to a low moaning sound and then to the silence of death the one moment of happiness that recompensed years of sorrow had been her last her son laid the lifeless form upon the pillow and gazed with fixed eyes on his mothers face  as he looked the expression of enthusiastic joy that parting life had left upon the features faded gradually away and the countenance though no longer wild assumed the sadness which it had worn through a long course of grief and pain on beholding this natural consequence of death the thought perhaps occurred to him that her soul no longer dependent on the imperfect means of intercourse possessed by mortals had communed with his own and become acquainted with all its guilt and misery he started from the bedside and covered his face with his hands as if to hide it from those dead eyes  such a scene as has been described could not but have a powerful effect upon any one who retained aught of humanity and the grief of the son whose natural feelings had been blunted but not destroyed by an evil life was much more violent than his outward demeanor would have expressed but his deep repentance for the misery he had brought upon his parent did not produce in him a resolution to do wrong no more the sudden consciousness of accumulated guilt made him desperate he felt as if no one had thenceforth a claim to justice or compassion at his hands when his neglect and cruelty had poisoned his mothers life and hastened her death  thus it was that the devil wrought with him to his own destruction reversing the salutary effect which his mother would have died exultingly to produce upon his mind he now turned to ellen langton with a demeanor singularly calm and composed  we must resume our journey he said in his usual tone of voice the sun is on the point of rising though but little light finds its way into this hovel  ellens previous suspicions as to the character of her companion had now become certainty so far as to convince her that she was in the power of a lawless and guilty man though what fate he intended for her she was unable to conjecture an open opposition to his will however could not be ventured upon especially as she discovered on looking round the apartment that with the exception of the corpse they were alone  will you not attend your mothers funeral she asked trembling and conscious that he would discover her fears  the dead must bury their dead he replied i have brought my mother to her graveand what can a son do more this purse however will serve to lay her in the earth and leave something for the old hag whither is she gone interrupted he casting a glance round the room in search of the old woman nay then we must speedily to horse i know her of old  thus saying he threw the purse upon the table and without trusting himself to look again towards the dead conducted ellen out of the cottage the first rays of the sun at that moment gilded the tallest trees of the forest  on looking towards the spot were the horses had stood ellen thought that providence in answer to her prayers had taken care for her deliverance they were no longer therea circumstance easily accounted for by the haste with which the bridles had been thrown over the branch of the tree her companion however imputed it to another cause  the hag she would sell her own flesh and blood by weight and measure he muttered to himself this is some plot of hers i know well  he put his hand to his forehead for a moments space seeming to reflect on the course most advisable to be pursued ellen perhaps unwisely interposed  would it not be well to return she asked timidly there is now no hope of escaping but i might yet reach home undiscovered  return repeated her guide with a look and smile from which she turned away her face have you forgotten your father and his misfortunes no no sweet ellen it is too late for such thoughts as these  he took her hand and led her towards the forest in the rear of the cottage she would fain have resisted but they were all alone and the attempt must have been both fruitless and dangerous she therefore trod with him a path so devious so faintly traced and so overgrown with bushes and young trees that only a most accurate acquaintance in his early days could have enabled her guide to retain it to him however it seemed so perfectly familiar that he was not once compelled to pause though the numerous windings soon deprived ellen of all knowledge of the situation of the cottage they descended a steep hill and proceeding parallel to the riveras ellen judged by its rushing soundat length found themselves at what proved to be the termination of their walk  ellen now recollected a remark of edward walcotts respecting the wild and rude scenery through which the river here kept its way and in less agitating circumstances her pleasure and admiration would have been great they stood beneath a precipice so high that the loftiest pinetops and many of them seemed to soar to heaven scarcely surmounted it this line of rock has a considerable extent at unequal heights and with many interruptions along the course of the river and it seems probable that at some former period it was the boundary of the waters though they are now confined within far less ambitious limits the inferior portion of the crag beneath which ellen and her guide were standing varies so far from the perpendicular as not to be inaccessible by a careful footstep but only one person has been known to attempt the ascent of the superior half and only one the descent yet steep as is the height trees and bushes of various kinds have clung to the rock wherever their roots could gain the slightest hold thus seeming to prefer the scanty and difficult nourishment of the cliff to a more luxurious life in the rich interval that extends from its base to the river but whether or no these hardy vegetables have voluntarily chosen their rude restingplace the cliff is indebted to them for much of the beauty that tempers its sublimity when the eye is pained and wearied by the bold nakedness of the rock it rests with pleasure on the cheerful foliage of the birch or upon the darker green of the funereal pine just at the termination of the accessible portion of the crag these trees are so numerous and their foliage so dense that they completely shroud from view a considerable excavation formed probably hundreds of years since by the fall of a portion of the rock the detached fragment still lies at a little distance from the base gray and mossgrown but corresponding in its general outline to the cavity from which it was rent  but the most singular and beautiful object in all this scene is a tiny fount of crystal water that gushes forth from the high smooth forehead of the cliff its perpendicular descent is of many feet after which it finds its way with a sweet diminutive murmur to the level ground  it is not easy to conceive whence the barren rock procures even the small supply of water that is necessary to the existence of this stream it is as unaccountable as the gush of gentle feeling which sometimes proceeds from the hardest heart but there it continues to flow and fall undiminished and unincreased the stream is so slender that the gentlest breeze suffices to disturb its descent and to scatter its pure sweet waters over the face of the cliff but in that deep forest there is seldom a breath of wind so that plashing continually upon one spot the fount has worn its own little channel of white sand by which it finds its way to the river alas that the naiades have lost their old authority for what a deity of tiny loveliness must once have presided here  ellens companion paused not to gaze either upon the loveliness or the sublimity of this scene but assisting her where it was requisite began the steep and difficult ascent of the lower part of the cliff the maidens ingenuity in vain endeavored to assign reasons for this movement but when they reached the tuft of trees which as has been noticed grew at the ultimate point where mortal footstep might safely tread she perceived through their thick branches the recess in the rock here they entered and her guide pointed to a mossy seat in the formation of which to judge from its regularity art had probably a share  here you may remain in safety he observed till i obtain the means of proceeding in this spot you need fear no intruder but it will be dangerous to venture beyond its bounds  the meaning glance that accompanied these words intimated to poor ellen that in warning her against danger he alluded to the vengeance with which he would visit any attempt to escape to leave her thus alone trusting to the influence of such a threat was a bold yet a necessary and by no means a hopeless measure on ellen it produced the desired effect and she sat in the cave as motionless for a time as if she had herself been a part of the rock in other circumstances this shady recess would have been a delightful retreat during the sultry warmth of a summers day the dewy coolness of the rock kept the air always fresh and the sunbeams never thrust themselves so as to dissipate the mellow twilight through the green trees with which the chamber was curtained ellens sleeplessness and agitation for many preceding hours had perhaps deadened her feelings for she now felt a sort of indifference creeping upon her an inability to realize the evils of her situation at the same time that she was perfectly aware of them all this torpor of mind increased till her eyelids began to grow heavy and the cave and trees to swim before her sight in a few moments more she would probably have been in dreamless slumber but rousing herself by a strong effort she looked round the narrow limits of the cave in search of objects to excite her wornout mind  she now perceived wherever the smooth rock afforded place for them the initials or the fulllength names of former visitants of the cave what wanderer on mountaintops or in deep solitudes has not felt the influence of these records of humanity telling him when such a conviction is soothing to his heart that he is not alone in the world it was singular that when her own mysterious situation had almost lost its power to engage her thoughts ellen perused these barren memorials with a certain degree of interest she went on repeating them aloud and starting at the sound of her own voice till at length as one name passed through her lips she paused and then leaning her forehead against the letters burst into tears it was the name of edward walcott and it struck upon her heart arousing her to a full sense of her present misfortunes and dangers and more painful still of her past happiness her tears had however a soothing and at the same time a strengthening effect upon her mind for when their gush was over she raised her head and began to meditate on the means of escape she wondered at the species of fascination that had kept her as if chained to the rock so long when there was in reality nothing to bar her pathway she determined late as it was to attempt her own deliverance and for that purpose began slowly and cautiously to emerge from the cave  peeping out from among the trees she looked and listened with most painful anxiety to discover if any living thing were in that seeming solitude or if any sound disturbed the heavy stillness but she saw only nature in her wildest forms and heard only the plash and murmur almost inaudible because continual of the little waterfall and the quick short throbbing of her own heart against which she pressed her hand as if to hush it gathering courage therefore she began to descend and starting often at the loose stones that even her light footstep displaced and sent rattling down she at length reached the base of the crag in safety she then made a few steps in the direction as nearly as she could judge by which she arrived at the spot but paused with a sudden revulsion of the blood to her heart as her guide emerged from behind a projecting part of the rock he approached her deliberately an ironical smile writhing his features into a most disagreeable expression while in his eyes there was something that seemed a wild fierce joy by a species of sophistry of which oppressors often make use he had brought himself to believe that he was now the injured one and that ellen by her distrust of him had fairly subjected herself to whatever evil it consisted with his will and power to inflict upon her her only restraining influence over him the consciousness in his own mind that he possessed her confidence was now done away ellen as well as her enemy felt that this was the case she knew not what to dread but she was well aware that danger was at hand and that in the deep wilderness there was none to help her except that being with whose inscrutable purposes it might consist to allow the wicked to triumph for a season and the innocent to be brought low  are you so soon weary of this quiet retreat demanded her guide continuing to wear the same sneering smile or has your anxiety for your father induced you to set forth alone in quest of the afflicted old man  oh if i were but with him exclaimed ellen but this place is lonely and fearful and i cannot endure to remain here  lonely is it sweet ellen he rejoined am i not with you yes it is lonelylonely as guilt could wish cry aloud ellen and spare not shriek and see if there be any among these rocks and woods to hearken to you  there is there is one exclaimed ellen shuddering and affrighted at the fearful meaning of his countenance he is here he is there and she pointed to heaven  it may be so dearest he replied but if there be an ear that hears and an eye that sees all the evil of the earth yet the arm is slow to avenge else why do i stand before you a living man  his vengeance may be delayed for a time but not forever she answered gathering a desperate courage from the extremity of her fear  you say true lovely ellen and i have done enough erenow to insure its heaviest weight there is a pass when evil deeds can add nothing to guilt nor good ones take anything from it  think of your motherof her sorrow through life and perhaps even after death ellen began to say but as she spoke these words the expression of his face was changed becoming suddenly so dark and fiendlike that she clasped her hands and fell on her knees before him  i have thought of my mother he replied speaking very low and putting his face close to hers i remember the neglect the wrong the lingering and miserable death that she received at my hands by what claim can either man or woman henceforth expect mercy from me if god will help you be it so but by those words you have turned my heart to stone  at this period of their conversation when ellens peril seemed most imminent the attention of both was attracted by a fragment of rock which falling from the summit of the crag struck very near them ellen started from her knees and with her false guide gazed eagerly upward he in the fear of interruption she in the hope of deliverance    chapter ix    at length he cries behold the fated spring   yon rugged cliff conceals the fountain blest   dark rocks its crystal source oershadowing     psyche   the tale now returns to fanshawe who as will be recollected after being overtaken by edward walcott was left with little apparent prospect of aiding in the deliverance of ellen langton  it would be difficult to analyze the feelings with which the student pursued the chase or to decide whether he was influenced and animated by the same hopes of successful love that cheered his rival that he was conscious of such hopes there is little reason to suppose for the most powerful minds are not always the best acquainted with their own feelings had fanshawe moreover acknowledged to himself the possibility of gaining ellens affections his generosity would have induced him to refrain from her society before it was too late he had read her character with accuracy and had seen how fit she was to love and to be loved by a man who could find his happiness in the common occupations of the world and fanshawe never deceived himself so far as to suppose that this would be the case with him indeed he often wondered at the passion with which ellens simple loveliness of mind and person had inspired him and which seemed to be founded on the principle of contrariety rather than of sympathy it was the yearning of a soul formed by nature in a peculiar mould for communion with those to whom it bore a resemblance yet of whom it was not but there was no reason to suppose that ellen who differed from the multitude only as being purer and better would cast away her affections on the one of all who surrounded her least fitted to make her happy thus fanshawe reasoned with himself and of this he believed that he was convinced yet ever and anon he found himself involved in a dream of bliss of which ellen was to be the giver and the sharer then would he rouse himself and press upon his mind the chilling consciousness that it was and could be but a dream there was also another feeling apparently discordant with those which have been enumerated it was a longing for rest for his old retirement that came at intervals so powerfully upon him as he rode on that his heart sickened of the active exertion on which fate had thrust him  after being overtaken by edward walcott fanshawe continued his journey with as much speed as was attainable by his wearied horse but at a pace infinitely too slow for his earnest thoughts these had carried him far away leaving him only such a consciousness of his present situation as to make diligent use of the spur when a horses tread at no great distance struck upon his ear he looked forward and behind but though a considerable extent of the narrow rocky and grassgrown road was visible he was the only traveller there yet again he heard the sound which he now discovered proceeded from among the trees that lined the roadside alighting he entered the forest with the intention if the steed proved to be disengaged and superior to his own of appropriating him to his own use he soon gained a view of the object he sought but the animal rendered a closer acquaintance unattainable by immediately taking to his heels fanshawe had however made a most interesting discovery for the horse was accoutred with a sidesaddle and who but ellen langton could have been his rider at this conclusion though his perplexity was thereby in no degree diminished the student immediately arrived returning to the road and perceiving on the summit of the hill a cottage which he recognized as the one he had entered with ellen and edward walcott he determined there to make inquiry respecting the objects of his pursuit  on reaching the door of the povertystricken dwelling he saw that it was not now so desolate of inmates as on his previous visit in the single inhabitable apartment were several elderly women clad evidently in their wellworn and wellsaved sunday clothes and all wearing a deep grievous expression of countenance fanshawe was not long in deciding that death was within the cottage and that these aged females were of the class who love the house of mourning because to them it is a house of feasting it is a fact disgusting and lamentable that the disposition which heaven for the best of purposes has implanted in the female breastto watch by the sick and comfort the afflictedfrequently becomes depraved into an odious love of scenes of pain and death and sorrow such women are like the ghouls of the arabian tales whose feasting was among tombstones and upon dead carcasses  it is sometimes though less frequently the case that this disposition to make a joy of grief extends to individuals of the other sex but in us it is even less excusable and more disgusting because it is our nature to shun the sick and afflicted and unless restrained by principles other than we bring into the world with us men might follow the example of many animals in destroying the infirm of their own species indeed instances of this nature might be adduced among savage nations sometimes however from an original lusus naturae or from the influence of circumstances a man becomes a haunter of deathbeds a tormentor of afflicted hearts and a follower of funerals such an abomination now appeared before fanshawe and beckoned him into the cottage he was considerably beyond the middle age rather corpulent with a broad fat tallowcomplexioned countenance the student obeyed his silent call and entered the room through the open door of which he had been gazing  he now beheld stretched out upon the bed where she had so lately lain in life though dying the yet uncoffined corpse of the aged woman whose death has been described how frightful it seemedthat fixed countenance of ashy paleness amid its decorations of muslin and fine linen as if a bride were decked for the marriagechamber as if death were a bridegroom and the coffin a bridal bed alas that the vanity of dress should extend even to the grave  the female who as being the near and only relative of the deceased was supposed to stand in need of comfort was surrounded by five or six of her own sex these continually poured into her ear the stale trite maxims which where consolation is actually required add torture insupportable to the wounded heart their present object however conducted herself with all due decorum holding her handkerchief to her tearless eyes and answering with very grievous groans to the words of her comforters who could have imagined that there was joy in her heart because since her sisters death there was but one remaining obstacle between herself and the sole property of that wretched cottage  while fanshawe stood silently observing this scene a low monotonous voice was uttering some words in his ear of the meaning of which his mind did not immediately take note he turned and saw that the speaker was the person who had invited him to enter  what is your pleasure with me sir demanded the student  i make bold to ask replied the man whether you would choose to partake of some creature comfort before joining in prayer with the family and friends of our deceased sister as he spoke he pointed to a table on which was a moderatesized stone jug and two or three broken glasses for then as now there were few occasions of joy or grief on which ardent spirits were not considered indispensable to heighten the one or to alleviate the other  i stand in no need of refreshment answered fanshawe and it is not my intention to pray at present  i pray your pardon reverend sir rejoined the other but your face is pale and you look wearied a drop from yonder vessel is needful to recruit the outward man and for the prayer the sisters will expect it and their souls are longing for the outpouring of the spirit i was intending to open my own mouth with such words as are given to my poor ignorance but  fanshawe was here about to interrupt this address which proceeded on the supposition arising from his black dress and thoughtful countenance that he was a clergyman but one of the females now approached him and intimated that the sister of the deceased was desirous of the benefit of his conversation he would have returned a negative to this request but looking towards the afflicted woman he saw her withdraw her handkerchief from her eyes and cast a brief but penetrating and most intelligent glance upon him he immediately expressed his readiness to offer such consolation as might be in his power  and in the mean time observed the laypreacher i will give the sisters to expect a word of prayer and exhortation either from you or from myself  these words were lost upon the supposed clergyman who was already at the side of the mourner the females withdrew out of earshot to give place to a more legitimate comforter than themselves  what know you respecting my purpose inquired fanshawe bending towards her  the woman gave a groanthe usual result of all efforts at consolation for the edification of the company and then replied in a whisper which reached only the ear for which it was intended i know whom you come to seek i can direct you to them speak low for gods sake she continued observing that fanshawe was about to utter an exclamation she then resumed her groans with greater zeal than before  wherewhere are they asked the student in a whisper which all his efforts could scarcely keep below his breath i adjure you to tell me  and if i should how am i like to be bettered by it inquired the old woman her speech still preceded and followed by a groan  o god the auri sacra fames thought fanshawe with a sickening heart looking at the motionless corpse upon the bed and then at the wretched being whom the course of nature in comparatively a moment of time would reduce to the same condition  he whispered again however putting his purse into the hags hand take this make your own terms when they are discovered only tell me where i must seek themand speedily or it may be too late  i am a poor woman and am afflicted said she taking the purse unseen by any who were in the room it is little that worldly goods can do for me and not long can i enjoy them and here she was delivered of a louder and a more heartfelt groan than ever she then continued follow the path behind the cottage that leads to the riverside walk along the foot of the rock and search for them near the waterspout keep a slow pace till you are out of sight she added as the student started to his feet the guests of the cottage did not attempt to oppose fanshawes progress when they saw him take the path towards the forest imagining probably that he was retiring for the purpose of secret prayer but the old woman laughed behind the handkerchief with which she veiled her face  take heed to your steps boy she muttered for they are leading you whence you will not return death too for the slayer be it so  fanshawe in the mean while contrived to discover and for a while to retain the narrow and winding path that led to the riverside but it was originally no more than a track by which the cattle belonging to the cottage went down to their wateringplace and by these fourfooted passengers it had long been deserted  the fernbushes therefore had grown over it and in several places trees of considerable size had shot up in the midst these difficulties could scarcely have been surmounted by the utmost caution and as fanshawes thoughts were too deeply fixed upon the end to pay a due regard to the means he soon became desperately bewildered both as to the locality of the river and of the cottage had he known however in which direction to seek the latter he would not probably have turned back not that he was infected by any chivalrous desire to finish the adventure alone but because he would expect little assistance from those he had left there yet he could not but wonderthough he had not in his first eagerness taken notice of itat the anxiety of the old woman that he should proceed singly and without the knowledge of her guests on the search he nevertheless continued to wander onpausing often to listen for the rush of the river and then starting forward with fresh rapidity to rid himself of the sting of his own thoughts which became painfully intense when undisturbed by bodily motion his way was now frequently interrupted by rocks that thrust their huge gray heads from the ground compelling him to turn aside and thus depriving him fortunately perhaps of all remaining idea of the direction he had intended to pursue  thus he went on his head turned back and taking little heed to his footsteps when perceiving that he trod upon a smooth level rock he looked forward and found himself almost on the utmost verge of a precipice  after the throbbing of the heart that followed this narrow escape had subsided he stood gazing down where the sunbeams slept so pleasantly at the roots of the tall old trees with whose highest tops he was upon a level suddenly he seemed to hear voicesone wellremembered voice ascending from beneath and approaching to the edge of the cliff he saw at its base the two whom he sought  he saw and interpreted ellens look and attitude of entreaty though the words with which she sought to soften the ruthless heart of her guide became inaudible ere they reached the height where fanshawe stood he felt that heaven had sent him thither at the moment of her utmost need to be the preserver of all that was dear to him and he paused only to consider the mode in which her deliverance was to be effected life he would have laid down willingly exultingly his only care was that the sacrifice should not be in vain  at length when ellen fell upon her knees he lifted a small fragment of rock and threw it down the cliff it struck so near the pair that it immediately drew the attention of both  when the betrayer at the instant in which he had almost defied the power of the omnipotent to bring help to ellen became aware of fanshawes presence his hardihood failed him for a time and his knees actually tottered beneath him there was something awful to his apprehension in the slight form that stood so far above him like a being from another sphere looking down upon his wickedness but his halfsuperstitious dread endured only a moments space and then mustering the courage that in a thousand dangers had not deserted him he prepared to revenge the intrusion by which fanshawe had a second time interrupted his designs  by heaven i will cast him down at her feet he muttered through his closed teeth there shall be no form nor likeness of man left in him then let him rise up if he is able and defend her  thus resolving and overlooking all hazard in his eager hatred and desire for vengeance he began a desperate attempt to ascend the cliff the space which only had hitherto been deemed accessible was quickly passed and in a moment more he was halfway up the precipice clinging to trees shrubs and projecting portions of the rock and escaping through hazards which seemed to menace inevitable destruction  fanshawe as he watched his upward progress deemed that every step would be his last but when he perceived that more than half and apparently the most difficult part of the ascent was surmounted his opinion changed his courage however did not fail him as the moment of need drew nigh his spirits rose buoyantly his limbs seemed to grow firm and strong and he stood on the edge of the precipice prepared for the deathstruggle which would follow the success of his enemys attempt  but that attempt was not successful when within a few feet of the summit the adventurer grasped at a twig too slenderly rooted to sustain his weight it gave way in his hand and he fell backward down the precipice his head struck against the less perpendicular part of the rock whence the body rolled heavily down to the detached fragment of which mention has heretofore been made there was no life left in him with all the passions of hell alive in his heart he had met the fate that he intended for fanshawe  the student paused not then to shudder at the sudden and awful overthrow of his enemy for he saw that ellen lay motionless at the foot of the cliff she had indeed fainted at the moment she became aware of her deliverers presence and no stronger proof could she have given of her firm reliance upon his protection  fanshawe was not deterred by the danger of which he had just received so fearful an evidence from attempting to descend to her assistance and whether owing to his advantage in lightness of frame or to superior caution he arrived safely at the base of the precipice  he lifted the motionless form of ellen in his arms and resting her head against his shoulder gazed on her cheek of lily paleness with a joy a triumph that rose almost to madness it contained no mixture of hope it had no reference to the future it was the perfect bliss of a momentan insulated point of happiness he bent over her and pressed a kissthe first and he knew it would be the laston her pale lips then bearing her to the fountain he sprinkled its waters profusely over her face neck and bosom she at length opened her eyes slowly and heavily but her mind was evidently wandering till fanshawe spoke  fear not ellen you are safe he said  at the sound of his voice her arm which was thrown over his shoulder involuntarily tightened its embrace telling him by that mute motion with how firm a trust she confided in him but as a fuller sense of her situation returned she raised herself to her feet though still retaining the support of his arm it was singular that although her insensibility had commenced before the fall of her guide she turned away her eyes as if instinctively from the spot where the mangled body lay nor did she inquire of fanshawe the manner of her deliverance  let us begone from this place she said in faint low accents and with an inward shudder  they walked along the precipice seeking some passage by which they might gain its summit and at length arrived at that by which ellen and her guide had descended chancefor neither ellen nor fanshawe could have discovered the pathled them after but little wandering to the cottage a messenger was sent forward to the town to inform dr melmoth of the recovery of his ward and the intelligence thus received had interrupted edward walcotts conversation with the seaman  it would have been impossible in the mangled remains of ellens guide to discover the son of the widow butler except from the evidence of her sister who became by his death the sole inheritrix of the cottage the history of this evil and unfortunate man must be comprised within very narrow limits a harsh father and his own untamable disposition had driven him from home in his boyhood and chance had made him the temporary companion of hugh crombie after two years of wandering when in a foreign country and in circumstances of utmost need he attracted the notice of mr langton the merchant took his young countryman under his protection afforded him advantages of education and as his capacity was above mediocrity gradually trusted him in many affairs of importance during this period there was no evidence of dishonesty on his part on the contrary he manifested a zeal for mr langtons interest and a respect for his person that proved his strong sense of the benefits he had received but he unfortunately fell into certain youthful indiscretions which if not entirely pardonable might have been palliated by many considerations that would have occurred to a merciful man mr langtons justice however was seldom tempered by mercy and on this occasion he shut the door of repentance against his erring protégé and left him in a situation not less desperate than that from which he had relieved him the goodness and the nobleness of which his heart was not destitute turned from that time wholly to evil and he became irrecoverably ruined and irreclaimably depraved his wandering life had led him shortly before the period of this tale to his native country here the erroneous intelligence of mr langtons death had reached him and suggested the scheme which circumstances seemed to render practicable but the fatal termination of which has been related  the body was buried where it had fallen close by the huge gray moss grown fragment of rocka monument on which centuries can work little change the eighty years that have elapsed since the death of the widows son have however been sufficient to obliterate an inscription which some one was at the pains to cut in the smooth surface of the stone traces of letters are still discernible but the writers many efforts could never discover a connected meaning the grave also is overgrown with fernbushes and sunk to a level with the surrounding soil but the legend though my version of it may be forgotten will long be traditionary in that lonely spot and give to the rock and the precipice and the fountain an interest thrilling to the bosom of the romantic wanderer    chapter x    sitting then in shelter shady   to observe and mark his mone   suddenly i saw a lady   hasting to him all alone   clad in maidenwhite and green   whom i judged the forest queen     the woodmans bear   during several weeks succeeding her danger and deliverance ellen langton was confined to her chamber by illness resulting from the agitation she had endured her father embraced the earliest opportunity to express his deep gratitude to fanshawe for the inestimable service he had rendered and to intimate a desire to requite it to the utmost of his power he had understood that the students circumstances were not prosperous and with the feeling of one who was habituated to give and receive a quid pro quo he would have rejoiced to share his abundance with the deliverer of his daughter but fanshawes flushed brow and haughty eye when he perceived the thought that was stirring in mr langtons mind sufficiently proved to the discerning merchant that money was not in the present instance a circulating medium his penetration in fact very soon informed him of the motives by which the young man had been actuated in risking his life for ellen langton but he made no allusion to the subject concealing his intentions if any he had in his own bosom  during ellens illness edward walcott had manifested the deepest anxiety respecting her he had wandered around and within the house like a restless ghost informing himself of the slightest fluctuation in her health and thereby graduating his happiness or misery he was at length informed that her convalescence had so far progressed that on the succeeding day she would venture below from that time edwards visits to dr melmoths mansion were relinquished his cheek grew pale and his eye lost its merry light but he resolutely kept himself a banished man multifarious were the conjectures to which this course of conduct gave rise but ellen understood and approved his motives the maiden must have been far more blind than ever woman was in such a matter if the late events had not convinced her of fanshawes devoted attachment and she saw that edward walcott feeling the superior the irresistible strength of his rivals claim had retired from the field fanshawe however discovered no intention to pursue his advantage he paid her no voluntary visit and even declined an invitation to tea with which mrs melmoth after extensive preparations had favored him he seemed to have resumed all the habits of seclusion by which he was distinguished previous to his acquaintance with ellen except that he still took his sunset walk on the banks of the stream  on one of these occasions he stayed his footsteps by the old leafless oak which had witnessed ellens first meeting with the angler here he mused upon the circumstances that had resulted from that event and upon the rights and privileges for he was well aware of them all which those circumstances had given him perhaps the loveliness of the scene and the recollections connected with it perhaps the warm and mellow sunset perhaps a temporary weakness in himself had softened his feelings and shaken the firmness of his resolution to leave ellen to be happy with his rival his strong affections rose up against his reason whispering that blisson earth and in heaven through time and eternitymight yet be his lot with her it is impossible to conceive of the flood of momentary joy which the bare admission of such a possibility sent through his frame and just when the tide was highest in his heart a soft little hand was laid upon his own and starting he beheld ellen at his side  her illness since the commencement of which fanshawe had not seen her had wrought a considerable but not a disadvantageous change in her appearance she was paler and thinner her countenance was more intellectual more spiritual and a spirit did the student almost deem her appearing so suddenly in that solitude there was a quick vibration of the delicate blood in her cheek yet never brightening to the glow of perfect health a tear was glittering on each of her long dark eyelashes and there was a gentle tremor through all her frame which compelled her for a little space to support herself against the oak fanshawes first impulse was to address her in words of rapturous delight but he checked himself and attemptedvainly indeedto clothe his voice in tones of calm courtesy his remark merely expressed pleasure at her restoration to health and ellens low and indistinct reply had as little relation to the feelings that agitated her  yet i fear continued fanshawe recovering a degree of composure and desirous of assigning a motive which he felt was not the true one for ellens agitationi fear that your walk has extended too far for your strength  it would have borne me farther with such a motive she replied still tremblingto express my gratitude to my preserver  it was needless ellen it was needless for the deed brought with it its own reward exclaimed fanshawe with a vehemence that he could not repress it was dangerous for  here he interrupted himself and turned his face away  and wherefore was it dangerous inquired ellen laying her hand gently on his arm for he seemed about to leave her  because you have a tender and generous heart and i a weak one he replied  not so answered she with animation yours is a heart full of strength and nobleness and if it have a weakness  you know well that it has ellenone that has swallowed up all its strength said fanshawe was it wise then to tempt it thus when if it yield the result must be your own misery  ellen did not affect to misunderstand his meaning on the contrary with a noble frankness she answered to what was implied rather than expressed  do me not this wrong she said blushing yet earnestly can it be misery will it not be happiness to form the tie that shall connect you to the world to be your guidea humble one it is true but the one of your choiceto the quiet paths from which your proud and lonely thoughts have estranged you oh i know that there will be happiness in such a lot from these and a thousand other sources  the animation with which ellen spoke and at the same time a sense of the singular course to which her gratitude had impelled her caused her beauty to grow brighter and more enchanting with every word and when as she concluded she extended her hand to fanshawe to refuse it was like turning from an angel who would have guided him to heaven but had he been capable of making the woman he loved a sacrifice to her own generosity that act would have rendered him unworthy of her yet the struggle was a severe one ere he could reply  yon have spoken generously and nobly ellen he said i have no way to prove that i deserve your generosity but by refusing to take advantage of it even if your heart were yet untouched if no being more happily constituted than myself had made an impression there even then i trust a selfish passion would not be stronger than my integrity but nowhe would have proceeded but the firmness which had hitherto sustained him gave way he turned aside to hide the tears which all the pride of his nature could not restrain and which instead of relieving added to his anguish at length he resumed no ellen we must part now and forever your life will be long and happy mine will be short but not altogether wretched nor shorter than if we had never met when you hear that i am in my grave do not imagine that you have hastened me thither think that you scattered bright dreams around my pathwayan ideal happiness that you would have sacrificed your own to realize  he ceased and ellen felt that his determination was unalterable she could not speak but taking his hand she pressed it to her lips and they saw each other no more mr langton and his daughter shortly after returned to the seaport which for several succeeding years was their residence after ellens departure fanshawe returned to his studies with the same absorbing ardor that had formerly characterized him his face was as seldom seen among the young and gay the pure breeze and the blessed sunshine as seldom refreshed his pale and weary brow and his lamp burned as constantly from the first shade of evening till the gray morning light began to dim its beams nor did he as weak men will treasure up his love in a hidden chamber of his breast he was in reality the thoughtful and earnest student that he seemed he had exerted the whole might of his spirit over itself and he was a conqueror perhaps indeed a summer breeze of sad and gentle thoughts would sometimes visit him but in these brief memories of his love he did not wish that it should be revived or mourn over its event  there were many who felt an interest in fanshawe but the influence of none could prevail upon him to lay aside the habits mental and physical by which he was bringing himself to the grave his passage thither was consequently rapid terminating just as he reached his twentieth year his fellowstudents erected to his memory a monument of roughhewn granite with a white marble slab for the inscription this was borrowed from the grave of nathanael mather whom in his almost insane eagerness for knowledge and in his early death fanshawe resembled    the ashes of a hard student   and a good scholar  many tears were shed over his grave but the thoughtful and the wise though turf never covered a nobler heart could not lament that it was so soon at rest he left a world for which he was unfit and we trust that among the innumerable stars of heaven there is one where he has found happiness  of the other personages of this talehugh crombie being exposed to no strong temptations lived and died an honest man concerning dr melmoth it is unnecessary here to speak the reader if he have any curiosity upon the subject is referred to his life which together with several sermons and other productions of the doctor was published by his successor in the presidency of harley college about the year 1768  it was not till four years after fanshawes death that edward walcott was united to ellen langton their future lives were uncommonly happy ellens gentle almost imperceptible but powerful influence drew her husband away from the passions and pursuits that would have interfered with domestic felicity and he never regretted the worldly distinction of which she thus deprived him theirs was a long life of calm and quiet bliss and what matters it that except in these pages they have left no name behind them
