16141820	the efficiency expert     chapter i  jimmy torrance jr  the gymnasium was packed as jimmy torrance stepped into the ring for the final event of the evening that was to decide the boxing championship of the university drawing to a close were the nearly four years of his college careerprofitable years jimmy considered them and certainly successful up to this point in the beginning of his senior year he had captained the varsity eleven and in the coming spring he would again sally forth upon the diamond as the star initial sacker of collegedom  his football triumphs were in the past his continued baseball successes a foregone conclusionif he won tonight his cup of happiness and an unassailably dominant position among his fellows would be assured leaving nothing more in so far as jimmy reasoned to be desired from four years attendance at one of americas oldest and most famous universities  the youth who would dispute the right to championship honors with jimmy was a dark horse to the extent that he was a freshman and therefore practically unknown he had worked hard however and given a good account of himself in his preparations for the battle and there were rumors as there always are about every campus of marvelous exploits prior to his college days it was even darkly hinted that he was a professional pugilist as a matter of fact he was the best exponent of the manly art of selfdefense that jimmy torrance had ever faced and in addition thereto he outweighed the senior and outreached him  the boxing contest as the faculty members of the athletic committee preferred to call it was from the tap of the gong as pretty a twofisted scrap as ever any aggregation of lowbrowed fight fans witnessed the details of this gory contest while interesting have no particular bearing upon the development of this tale what interests us is the outcome which occurred in the middle of a very bloody fourth round in which jimmy torrance scored a clean knockout  it was a battered but happy jimmy who sat in his room the following monday afternoon striving to concentrate his mind upon a college textbook which should by all the laws of fiction have been well thumbed but in reality possessed unruffled freshness which belied its real age  i wish mused jimmy that i could have got to the bird who invented mathematics before he inflicted all this unnecessary anguish upon an already unhappy world in about three rounds i could have saved thousands from the sorrow which i feel every time i open this blooming book  he was still deeply engrossed in the futile attempt of accomplishing in an hour that for which the college curriculum set aside several months when there came sounds of approaching footsteps rapidly ascending the stairway his door was unceremoniously thrown open and there appeared one of those strange apparitions which is the envy and despair of the smalltown youtha naturally goodlooking young fellow the sartorial arts of whose tailor had elevated his waistline to his armpits dragged down his shoulders and caved in his front until he had the appearance of being badly dished from chin to knees his trousers appeared to have been made for a man with legs six inches longer than his while his hat was evidently several sizes too large since it would have entirely extinguished his face had it not been supported by his ears  hello kid cried jimmy  whats new  whiskers wants you replied the other  faculty meeting they just got through with me  hell muttered jimmy feelingly  i dont know what whiskers wants with me but he never wants to see anybody about anything pleasant  i am here agreed the other to announce to the universe that you are right jimmy he didnt have anything pleasant to say to me in fact he insinuated that dear old alma mater might be able to wiggle along without me if i didnt abjure my criminal life made some nasty comparison between my academic achievements and foxtrotting i wonder jimmy how they get that way  thats why they are profs explained jimmy  there are two kinds of people in this worldhuman beings and profs when does he want me  now  jimmy arose and put on his hat and coat  goodby kid he said pray for me and leave me one cigarette to smoke when i get back and grinning he left the room  james torrance jr was not greatly abashed as he faced the dour tribunal of the faculty the younger members among whom were several he knew to be mighty good fellows at heart sat at the lower end of the long table and with owlish gravity attempted to emulate the appearance and manners of their seniors at the head of the table sat whiskers as the dignified and venerable president of the university was popularly named it was generally believed and solemnly sworn to throughout the large corps of undergraduates that within the knowledge of any living man whiskers had never been known to smile and today he was running true to form  mr torrance he said sighing it has been my painful duty on more than one occasion to call your attention to the uniformly low average of your academic standing at the earnest solicitation of the faculty members of the athletic committee i have been influenced against my better judgment to temporize with an utterly insufferable condition  you are rapidly approaching the close of your senior year and in the light of the records which i have before me i am constrained to believe that it will be utterly impossible for you to graduate unless from now to the end of the semester you devote yourself exclusively to your academic work if you cannot assure me that you will do this i believe it would be to the best interests of the university for you to resign now rather than to fail of graduation and in this decision i am fully seconded by the faculty members of the athletic committee who realize the harmful effect upon university athletics in the future were so prominent an athlete as you to fail at graduation  if they had sentenced jimmy to be shot at sunrise the blow could scarcely have been more stunning than that which followed the realization that he was not to be permitted to round out his fourth successful season at first base but if jimmy was momentarily stunned he gave no outward indication of the fact and in the brief interval of silence following the presidents ultimatum his alert mind functioned with the rapidity which it had often shown upon the gridiron the diamond and the squared circle  just for a moment the thought of being deprived of the pleasure and excitement of the coming baseball season filled his mind to the exclusion of every other consideration but presently a less selfish impulse projected upon the screen of recollection the figure of the father he idolized the boy realized the disappointment that this man would feel should his four years of college end thus disastrously and without the coveted diploma  and then it was that he raised his eyes to those of the president  i hope sir he said that you will give me one more chancethat you will let me go on as i have in the past as far as baseball is concerned with the understanding that if at the end of each month between now and commencement i do not show satisfactory improvement i shall not be permitted to play on the team but please dont make that restriction binding yet if i lay off the track work i believe i can make up enough so that baseball will not interfere with my graduation  and so whiskers who was much more human than the student body gave him credit for being and was in the bargain a good judge of boys gave jimmy another chance on his own terms and the universitys heavyweight champion returned to his room filled with determination to make good at the eleventh hour  possibly one of the greatest obstacles which lay in jimmys path toward academic honors was the fact that he possessed those qualities of character which attracted others to him with the result that there was seldom an hour during the day that he had his room to himself on his return from the faculty meeting he found a halfdozen of his classmates there awaiting his return  well they inquired as he entered  its worse than that said jimmy as he unfolded the harrowing details of what had transpired at his meeting with the faculty and now he said if you birds love me keep out of here from now until commencement there isnt a guy on earth can concentrate on anything with a roomful of you mental ciphers sitting around and yapping about girls and other nonessential creations  nonessential gasped one of his visitors letting his eyes wander over the walls of jimmys study whereon were nailed pinned or hung countless framed and unframed pictures of nonessential creations  all right jimmy said another  we are with you horse foot and artillery when you want us give us the highsign and we will come otherwise we will leave you to your beloved books it is too bad though as the barboy was just explaining how the great drought might be circumvented by means of carrots potato peelings dishwater and a raisin  go on said jimmy i am not interested and the boys left him to his beloved books  jimmy torrance worked hard and by dint of long hours and hardworking tutors he finished his college course and won his diploma nor did he have to forego the crowning honors of his last baseball season although like ulysses s grant he would have graduated at the head of his class had the list been turned upside down     chapter ii  jimmy will accept a position  following his graduation he went to new york to visit with one of his classmates for a short time before returning home he was a very selfsatisfied jimmy nor who can wonder since almost from his matriculation there had been constantly dinned into his ears the plaudits of his fellow students jimmy torrance had been the one big outstanding feature of each succeeding class from his freshman to his senior year and as a junior and senior he had been the acknowledged leader of the student body and as popular a man as the university had ever known  to his fellows as well as to himself he had been a great successthe success of the universityand he and they saw in the future only continued success in whatever vocation he decided to honor with his presence it was in a mental attitude that had become almost habitual with him and which was superinduced by these influences that jimmy approached the new life that was opening before him for a while he would play but in the fall it was his firm intention to settle down to some serious occupation and it was in this attitude that he opened a letter from his fatherthe first that he had received since his graduation  the letter was written on the letterhead of the beatrice corn mills incorporated beatrice nebraska and in the upper lefthand corner in small type appeared james torrance sr president and general manager and this is what he read        dear jim      you have graduatedi didnt think you wouldwith honors in     football baseball prizefighting and five thousand     dollars in debt how you got your diploma is beyond mein     my day you would have got the sack well son i am not     surprised nor disappointedit is what i expected i know     you are clean though and that some day you will awaken to     the sterner side of life and an appreciation of your     responsibilities      to be an entirely orthodox father i should raise merry hell     about your debts and utter inutility at the same time     disinheriting you but instead i am going to urge you to     come home and run in debt here where the cost of living is     not so high as in the eastmeanwhile praying that your     awakening may come while i am on earth to rejoice            your affectionate                   father      am enclosing check to cover your debts and present needs   for a long time the boy sat looking at the letter before him  he reread it once twice three times and with each reading the film of unconscious egotism that had blinded him to his own shortcomings gradually became less opaque until finally he saw himself as his father must see him he had come to college for the purpose of fitting himself to succeed in some particular way in the stern battle of life which must follow his graduation for though his father had ample means to support him in indolence jimmy had never even momentarily considered such an eventuality  in weighing his assets now he discovered that he had probably as excellent a conception of gridiron strategy and tactics as any man in america that as a boxer he occupied a position in the forefront of amateur ranks and he was quite positive that outside of the major leagues there was not a better first baseman  but in the last few minutes there had dawned upon him the realization that none of these accomplishments was greatly in demand in the business world jimmy spent a very blue and unhappy hour and then slowly his natural optimism reasserted itself and with it came the realization of his youth and strength and inherent ability which without egotism he might claim  and then too he mused i have my diploma  i am a college graduate and that must mean something if dad had only reproached me or threatened some condign punishment i dont believe i should feel half as badly as i do but every line of that letter breathes disappointment in me and yet god bless him he tells me to come home and spend his money there not on your life if he wont disinherit me i am going to disinherit myself i am going to make him proud of me hes the best dad a fellow ever had and i am going to show him that i appreciate him  and so he sat down and wrote his father this reply       dear dad      i have your letter and check  you may not believe it but     the former is worth more to me than the latter not     however that i spurn the check which it was just like you     to send without a lot of grumbling and reproaches even if i     do deserve them      your letter shows me what a rotten mess i have made of     myself im not going to hand you a lot of mush dad but i     want to try to do something that will give you reason to at     least have hopes of rejoicing before i come home again if i     fail ill come home anyway and then neither one of us will     have any doubt but what you will have to support me for the     rest of my life however i dont intend to fail and one of     these days i will bob up all serene as president of a bank     or a glue factory in the mean time ill keep you posted as     to my whereabouts but dont send me another cent until i     ask for it and when i do you will know that i have failed      tell mother that i will write her in a day or two probably     from chicago as i have always had an idea that that was one     burg where i could make good      with lots of love to you all                                          your affectionate                                         son  it was a hot july day that james torrance jr alighted from the twentieth century limited at the la salle street station and entering a cab directed that he be driven to a small hotel for he soliloquized i might as well start economizing at once as it might be several days before i land a job such as i want in voicing which sentiments he spoke with the tongues of the prophets  jimmy had many friends in chicago with whom upon the occasion of numerous previous visits to the western metropolis he had spent many hilarious and expensive hours but now he had come upon the serious business of life and there moved within him a strong determination to win financial success without recourse to the influence of rich and powerful acquaintances  since the first crushing blow that his fathers letter had dealt his egotism jimmys selfesteem had been gradually returning though along new and more practical lines his selfassurance was formed in a similar mold to those of all his other salient characteristics and these conformed to his physical proportions for physically mentally and morally jimmy torrance was big not that he was noticeably taller than other men or his features more than ordinarily attractive but there was something so well balanced and harmonious in all the proportions of his frame and features as to almost invariably compel a second glance from even a casual observer especially if the casual observer happened to be in the nonessential creation class  and so jimmy having had plenty of opportunity to commune with himself during the journey from new york was confident that there were many opportunities awaiting him in chicago he remembered distinctly of having read somewhere that the growing need of big business concerns was competent executive materialthat there were fewer big men than there were big jobsand that if such was the case all that remained to be done was to connect himself with the particular big job that suited him  in the lobby of the hotel he bought several of the daily papers and after reaching his room he started perusing the help wanted columns immediately he was impressed and elated by the discovery that there were plenty of jobs and that a satisfactory percentage of them appeared to be big jobs there were so many however that appealed to him as excellent possibilities that he saw it would be impossible to apply for each and every one and then it occurred to him that he might occupy a more strategic position in the negotiations preceding his acceptance of a position if his future employer came to him first rather than should he be the one to apply for the position  and so he decided the wisest plan would be to insert an ad in the situations wanted column and then from the replies select those which most appealed to him in other words he would choose from the cream of those who desired the services of such a man as himself rather than risk the chance of obtaining a less profitable position through undue haste in seizing upon the first opening advertised  having reached this decision and following his habitual custom he permitted no grass to grow beneath his feet writing out an ad he reviewed it carefully compared it with others that he saw upon the printed page made a few changes rewrote it and then descended to the lobby where he called a cab and was driven to the office of one of the areas metropolitan morning newspapers  jimmy felt very important as he passed through the massive doorway into the great general offices of the newspaper of course he didnt exactly expect that he would be ushered into the presence of the president or business manager or that even the advertising manager would necessarily have to pass upon his copy but there was within him a certain sensation that at that instant something was transpiring that in later years would be a matter of great moment and he was really very sorry for the publishers of the newspaper that they did not know who it was who was inserting an ad in their situations wanted column  he could not help but watch the face of the young man who received his ad and counted the words as he was sure that the clerks facial expression would betray his excitement it was a great moment for jimmy torrance he realized that it was probably the greatest moment of his lifethat here jimmy torrance ceased to be and james torrance jr esq began his career but though he carefully watched the face of the clerk he was finally forced to admit that the young man possessed wonderful control over his facial expression  that bird has a regular pokerface mused jimmy never batted an eye and paying for his ad he pocketed the change and walked out  lets see he figured it will be in tomorrow mornings edition  the tired business man will read it either at breakfast or after he reaches his office i understand that there are three million people here in chicago out of that three million it is safe to assume that one million will read my advertisement and of that onemillion there must be at least one thousand who have responsible positions which are at present inadequately filled  of course the truth of the matter is that there are probably tens of thousands of such positions but to be conservative i will assume that there are only one thousand and reducing it still further to almost an absurdity i will figure that only ten per cent of those reply to my advertisement in other words at the lowest possible estimate i should have one hundred replies on the first day i knew it was foolish to run it for three days but the fellow insisted that that was the proper way to do as i got a lower rate  by taking it for three days however it doesnt seem right to make so many busy men waste their time answering the ad when i shall doubtless find a satisfactory position the first day     chapter iii  the lizard  that night jimmy attended a show and treated himself to a lonely dinner afterward he should have liked very much to have looked up some of his friends a telephone call would have brought invitations to dinner and a pleasant evening with convivial companions but he had mapped his course and he was determined to stick to it to the end  there will be plenty of time he thought for amusement after i have gotten a good grasp of my new duties jimmy elected to walk from the theater to his hotel and as he was turning the corner from randolph into la salle a young man jostled him an instant later the stranger was upon his knees his wrist doubled suddenly backward and very close to the breakingpoint  wot t hell yuh doin he screamed  pardon me replied jimmy you got your hand in the wrong pocket  i suppose you meant to put it in your own but you didnt  aw gwan lemme go pleaded the stranger  i didnt get nuthin you aint got the goods on me  now such a tableau as jimmy and his new acquaintance formed cannot be staged at the corner of randolph and la salle beneath an arc light even at midnight without attracting attention and so it was that before jimmy realized it a dozen curious pedestrians were approaching them from different directions and a burly bluecoated figure was shouldering his way forward  jimmy had permitted his captive to rise but he still held tightly to his wrist as the officer confronted them he took one look at jimmys companion and then grabbed him roughly by the arm so its you again is it he growled  i aint done nuthin muttered the man  the officer looked inquiringly at jimmy  whats all the excitement about asked the latter  my friend and i have done nothing  your frind and you replied the policeman  he aint no frind o yours or yez wouldnt be sayin so  well ill admit replied jimmy that possibly i havent known him long enough to presume to claim any close friendship but theres no telling what time may develop  you dont want him pinched asked the policeman  of course not replied jimmy  why should he be pinched  the officer turned roughly upon the stranger shook him viciously a few times and then gave him a mighty shove which all but sent him sprawling into the gutter  gwan wid yez he yelled after him and if i see ye on this beat again ill run yez in an youhe turned upon jimmyyed betther be on your wayand not be afther makin up with ivery dip ye meet  thanks said jimmy  have a cigar  after the officer had helped himself and condescended to relax his stern features into the semblance of a smile the young man bid him good night and resumed his way toward the hotel  pretty early to go to bed he thought as he reached for his watch to note the time running his fingers into an empty pocket gingerly he felt in another pocket where he knew his watch couldnt possibly be nor was carefully jimmy examined each pocket of his coat and trousers a slow and broad grin illumining his face  what do you know about that he mused  and i thought i was a wise guy  a few minutes after jimmy reached his room the office called him on the telephone to tell him that a man had called to see him  send him up said jimmy wondering who it might be since he was sure that no one knew of his presence in the city he tried to connect the call in some way with his advertisement but inasmuch as that had been inserted blind he felt that there could be no possible connection between that and his caller  a few minutes later there was a knock on his door and in response to his summons to enter the door opened and there stood before him the young man of his recent encounter upon the street the latter entered softly closing the door behind him his feet made no sound upon the carpet and no sound came from the door as he closed it nor any slightest click from the latch his utter silence and the stealth of his movements were so pronounced as to attract immediate attention he did not speak until he had reached the center of the room and halted on the opposite side of the table at which jimmy was standing and then a very slow smile moved his lips though the expression of his eyes remained unchanged  miss anything he asked  yes said jimmy  here it is said the visitor laying the others watch upon the table  why this spasm of virtue asked jimmy  oh i dont know replied the other  i guess its because youre a white guy odonnell has been trying to get something on me for the last year hes got it in for mei wouldnt cough every time the big stiff seen me  sit down said jimmy  naw said the other i gotta be goin  come insisted the host sit down for a few minutes at least i was just wishing that i had someone to talk to  the other sank noiselessly into a chair  all right bo he said  jimmy proffered him his cigarcase  no thanks declined the visitor id rather have a coffinnail which jimmy forthwith furnished  i should think said jimmy that your particular line of endeavor would prove rather hazardous in a place where you are known by the police  the other smiled and as before with his lips alone  naw he said this is the safest place to work  if ten per cent of the bulls know me i got that much on them and then some because any boob can spot any one o de harness bunch and i know nearly every fly on the department theyre the guys yuh gotta know and usually i know something besides their names too and again his lips smiled  how much of your time do you have to put in at your occupation to make a living asked jimmy  sometimes i put in six or eight hours a day replied the visitor  de rush hours on de surface line are usually good for two or tree hours a day but i been layin off dat stuff lately and goin in fer de tater crowd deres more money and shorter hours  you confine yourself asked jimmy toerahpocketpicking solely  again the lip smile ill tell youse sumpin bo dat dey dont none o dem big stiffs on de department know de dip game is a stall i learned it when i was a kid an dese yaps tink dats all i know and i keep dem tinkin it by pullin stuff under der noses often enough to give em de hunch dat im still at de same ol business he leaned confidentially across the table if you ever want a box cracked look up the lizard  meaning asked jimmy  me bo im the lizard  box cracked repeated jimmy  an icebox or a hot box  his visitor grinned  safe he explained  oh said jimmy if i ever want any one to break into a safe come to you huh  you get me replied the other  all right said jimmy laughing ill call on you  that the only name you got mr lizard  thats alljust the lizard  now i gotta be beatin it  goin to crack a box asked jimmy  the other smiled his lip smile and turned toward the door  wait a second said jimmy  what would you have gotten on this watch of mine  it would have stood me about twenty bucks  jimmy reached into his pocket and drew forth a roll of bills  here he said handing the other two tens  naw said the lizard shoving the proffered money away  im no cheap skate  come ontake it said jimmy  i may want a box cracked some day  all right said the lizard if you put it that way bo  i should think said jimmy that a man of your ability could earn a living by less precarious methods  you would think so replied the lizard ive tried two or three times to go straight wore out my shoes looking for a job never landed anything that paid me more than ten bucks per and worked nine or ten hours a day and half the time i couldnt get that  i suppose the police hounded you all the time too suggested jimmy  naw said the lizard dats all bunk  de fellows that couldnt even float down a sewer straight pull dat once in a while dey get it in for some guy but deyre glad enough to leave us alone if we leave dem alone i worked four hours today maybe six before i get through and ill stand a chance of makin all the way from fifty dollars to five thousand suppose i was drivin a milkwagon gettin up at tree oclock in the mornin and workin like hellhow much would i get out of dat expectin every minute some one was goin tuh fire me nuthin doindey cant nobody fire me now im my own boss  well said jimmy your logic sounds all right but it all depends upon the viewpoint but ill tell you youve offered me your services ill offer you mine whenever you want a job look me up im going to be general manager of a big concern here and youll find me in the next issue of the telephone directory he handed the lizard his card  tanks said the latter  if you dont want a box cracked any sooner than i want a job the chances are we will never meet again solong and he was gone as noiselessly as he had come  jimmy breakfasted at nine the next morning and as he waited for his bacon and eggs he searched the situations wanted columns of the morning paper until his eye finally alighted upon that for which he soughtthe ad that was to infuse into the business life of the great city a new and potent force before his breakfast was served jimmy had read the few lines over a dozen times and with each succeeding reading he was more and more pleased with the result of his advertising ability as it appeared in print           wantedby college graduateposition as         general manager of large business where ability         energy and experience will be appreciated         address 263s tribune office  he had decided to wait until after lunch before calling at the newspaper office for replies to his advertisement but during breakfast it occurred to him there probably would be several alert prospective employers who would despatch their replies by special messengers and realizing that promptness was one of the cardinal virtues in the business world jimmy reasoned that it would make a favorable impression were he to present himself as soon as possible after the receipt of replies  by a simple system of reasoning he deduced that ten oclock would be none too early to expect some returns from his ad and therefore at ten promptly he presented himself at the want ad department in the tribune office  comparing the number of the receipt which jimmy handed him with the numbers upon a file of little pigeonholes the clerk presently turned back toward the counter with a handful of letters  whew thought jimmy  i never would have guessed that i would receive a bunch like that so early in the morning but then as he saw the clerk running through them one by one he realized that they were not all for him and as the young man ran through them jimmys spirits dropped a notch with each letter that was passed over without being thrown out to him until when the last letter had passed beneath the scrutiny of the clerk and the advertiser realized that he had received no replies he was quite sure that there was some error  nothing said the clerk shaking his head negatively  are you sure you looked in the right compartment asked jimmy  sure replied the clerk  there is nothing for you  jimmy pocketed his slip and walked from the office  this town is slower than i thought it was he mused i guess they do need some live wires here to manage their business  at noon he returned only to be again disappointed and then at two oclock and when he came in at four the same clerk looked up wearily and shook his head  nothing for you he said  i distributed all the stuff myself since you were in last  as jimmy stood there almost dazed by surprise that during an entire day his ad had appeared in chicagos largest newspaper and he had not received one reply a man approached the counter passed a slip similar to jimmys to the clerk and received fully a hundred letters in return jimmy was positive now that something was wrong  are you sure he asked the clerk that my replies havent been sidetracked somewhere i have seen people taking letters away from here all day and that bird there just walked off with a fistful  the clerk grinned  what you advertising for he asked  a position replied jimmy  thats the answer explained the clerk  that fellow there was advertising for help     chapter iv  jimmy hunts a job  once again jimmy walked out onto madison street and turning to his right dropped into a continuous vaudeville show in an attempt to coax his spirits back to somewhere near their normal highwater mark upon the next day he again haunted the newspaper office without reward and again upon the third day with similar results to say that jimmy was dumfounded would be but a futile description of his mental state it was simply beyond him to conceive that in one of the largest cities in the world the center of a thriving district of fifty million souls there was no business man with sufficient acumen to realize how badly he needed james torrance jr to conduct his business for him successfully  with the close of the fourth day and no reply jimmy was thoroughly exasperated the kindly clerk who by this time had taken a personal interest in this steadiest of customers suggested that jimmy try applying for positions advertised in the help wanted column and this he decided to do  there were only two concerns advertising for general managers in the issue which jimmy scanned one ad called for an experienced executive to assume the general management of an old established sash door and blind factory the other insisted upon a man with mailorder experience to take charge of the mailorder department of a large department store  neither of these were precisely what jimmy had hoped for his preference really being for the general management of an automobile manufactory or possibly something in the airplane line sash door and blind sounded extremely prosaic and uninteresting to mr torrance the mailorder proposition while possibly more interesting struck him as being too trifling and unimportant  however he thought it will do no harm to have a talk with these people and possibly i might even consider giving one of them a trial  and so calling a taxi he drove out onto the west side where in a dingy and squalid neighborhood the taxi stopped in front of a grimy unpainted threestory brick building from which a great deal of noise and dust were issuing jimmy found the office on the second floor after ascending a narrow dark and dirty stairway jimmys experience of manufacturing plants was extremely limited but he needed no experience as he entered the room to see that he was in a busy office of a busy plant everything about the office was plain and rather dingy but there were a great many file clerks and typists and considerable bustling about  after stating his business to a young lady who sat behind a switchboard upon the front of which was the word information and waiting while she communicated with an inner office over the telephone he was directed in the direction of a glass partition at the opposite end of the rooma partition in which there were doors at intervals and upon each door a name  he had been told that mr brown would see him and rapping upon the door bearing that name he was bid to enter and a moment later found himself in the presence of a middleaged man whose every gesture and movement was charged with suppressed nerve energy  as jimmy entered the man was reading a letter  he finished it quickly slapped it into a tray and wheeled in his chair toward his caller  well he snapped as jimmy approached him  i came in reply to your advertisement for a general manager announced jimmy confidently  the man sized him up quickly from head to foot  his eyes narrowed and his brows contracted  what experience you had  who you been with and how many years  he snapped the questions at jimmy with the rapidity of machinegun fire  i have the necessary ability replied jimmy to manage your business  how many years have you had in the sash door and blind business snapped mr brown  i have never had any experience in the sash door and blind business replied jimmy i didnt come here to make sash doors and blinds i came here to manage your business  mr brown half rose from his chair  his eyes opened a little wider than normal what the he started and then well of all the once again he found it impossible to go on you came here to manage a sash door and blind factory and dont know anything about the business well of all  i assumed said jimmy that what you wanted in a general manager was executive ability and thats what i have  what you have replied mr brown is a hell of a crust  now run along young fellow i am a very busy manand dont forget to close the door after you as you go out  jimmy did not forget to close the door  as he walked the length of the interminable room between rows of desks before which were seated young men and young women all of whom jimmy thought were staring at him he could feel the deep crimson burning upward from his collar to the roots of his hair  never before in his life had jimmys selfesteem received such a tremendous jolt he was still blushing when he reached his cab and as he drove back toward the loop he could feel successive hot waves suffuse his countenance at each recollection of the humiliating scene through which he had just passed  it was not until the next day that jimmy had sufficiently reestablished his selfconfidence to permit him to seek out the party who wished a mailorder manager and while in this instance he met with very pleasant and gentlemanly treatment his application was no less definitely turned down  for a month jimmy trailed one job after another  at the end of the first week he decided that the streetcars and sole leather were less expensive than taxicabs as his funds were running perilously low and he also lowered his aspirations successively from general managerships through departmental heads assistants thereto office managers assistant office managers and various other vocations all with the same result discovering meanwhile that experience while possibly not essential as some of the ads stated was usually the rock upon which his hopes were dashed  he also learned something else which surprised him greatly that rather than being an aid to his securing employment his college education was a drawback several men telling him bluntly that they had no vacancies for rahrah boys  at the end of the second week jimmy had moved from his hotel to a still less expensive one and a week later to a cheap boardinghouse on the north side at first he had written his father and his mother regularly but now he found it difficult to write them at all toward the middle of the fourth week jimmy had reached a point where he applied for a position as officeboy  ill be damned if im going to quit he said to himself if i have to turn streetsweeper there must be some job here in the city that i am capable of filling and im pretty sure that i can at least get a job as officeboy  and so he presented himself to the office manager of a lifeinsurance company that had advertised such a vacancy a very kindly gentleman interviewed him  what experience have you had he asked  jimmy looked at him aghast  do i have to have experience to be an officeboy he asked  well of course replied the gentleman it is not essential but it is preferable i already have applications from a dozen or more fellows half of whom have had experience and one in particular whom i have about decided to employ held a similar position with another lifeinsurance company  jimmy rose  good day he said and walked out  that day he ate no lunch but he had discovered a place where an abundance might be had for twentyfive cents if one knew how to order and ordered judiciously and so to this place he repaired for his dinner perched upon a high stool he filled at least a corner of the aching void within  sitting in his room that night he took account of his assets and his liabilities his room rent was paid until saturday and this was thursday and in his pocket were one dollar and sixty cents opening his trunk he drew forth a sheet of paper and an envelope and clearing the top of the rickety little table which stood at the head of his bed he sat down on the soiled counterpane and wrote a letter          dear dad         i guess im through  i have tried and        failed  it is hard to admit it but i guess ill        have to  if you will send me the price ill        come home                            with love                            jim    slowly he folded the letter and inserted it in the envelope his face mirroring an utter dejection such as jimmy torrance had never before experienced in his life  failure he muttered unutterable failure  taking his hat he walked down the creaking stairway with its threadbare carpet and out onto the street to post his letter     chapter v  jimmy lands one  miss elizabeth compton sat in the dimly lighted library upon a deepcushioned tapestried sofa she was not alone yet although there were many comfortable chairs in the large room and the sofa was an exceptionally long one she and her companion occupied but little more space than would have comfortably accommodated a single individual  stop it harold she admonished  i utterly loathe being mauled  but i cant help it dear  it seems so absolutely wonderful  i cant believe itthat you are really mine  but im notyet exclaimed the girl  there are a lot of formalities and bridesmaids and ministers and things that have got to be taken into consideration before i am yours and anyway there is no necessity for mussing me up so you might as well know now as later that i utterly loathe this caveman stuff and really harold there is nothing about your appearance that suggests a caveman which is probably one reason that i like you  like me exclaimed the young man  i thought you loved me  i have to like you in order to love you dont i she parried  and one certainly has to like the man she is going to marry  well grumbled mr bince you might be more enthusiastic about it  i prefer explained the girl to be loved decorously  i do not care to be pawed or clawed or crumpled after we have been married for fifteen or twenty years and are really well acquainted  possibly you will permit me to kiss you bince finished for her  dont be silly harold she retorted  you have kissed me so much now that my hair is all down and my face must be a sight lips are what you are supposed to kiss withyou dont have to kiss with your hands  possibly i was a little bit rough  i am sorry apologized the young man but when a fellow has just been told by the sweetest girl in the world that she will marry him its enough to make him a little bit crazy  not at all rejoined miss compton  we should never forget the stratum of society to which we belong and what we owe to the maintenance of the position we hold my father has always impressed upon me the fact that gentlemen or gentlewomen are always gentlefolk under any and all circumstances and conditions i distinctly recall his remark about one of his friends whom he greatly admired to this effect that he always got drunk like a gentleman therefore we should do everything as gentlefolk should do things and when we make love we should make love like gentlefolk and not like hodcarriers or cavemen  yes said the young man ill try to remember  it was a little after nine oclock when harold bince arose to leave  ill drive you home volunteered the girl  just wait and ill have barry bring the roadster around  i thought we should always do the things that gentlefolk should do said bince grinning after being seated safely in the car they had turned out of the driveway into lincoln parkway  what do you mean asked elizabeth  is it perfectly proper for young ladies to drive around the streets of a big city alone after dark  but im not alone she said  you will be after you leave me at home  oh well im different  and im glad that you are exclaimed bince fervently  i wouldnt love you if you were like the ordinary run  bince lived at one of the downtown clubs and after depositing him there and parting with a decorous handclasp the girl turned her machine and headed north for home at erie street came a sudden loud hissing of escaping air  darn exclaimed miss elizabeth compton as she drew in beside the curb and stopped although she knew perfectly well that one of the tires was punctured she got out and walked around in front as though in search of the cause of the disturbance and sure enough there it was flat as a pancake the left front tire  there was an extra wheel on the rear of the roadster but it was heavy and cumbersome and the girl knew from experience what a dirty job changing a wheel is she had just about decided to drive home on the rim when a young man crossed the walk from erie street and joined her in her doleful appraisement of the punctured casing  can i help you any he asked  she looked up at him  thank you she replied but i think ill drive home on it as it is they can change it there  it looks like a new casing he said  it would be too bad to ruin it if you have a spare i will be very glad to change it for you and without waiting for her acquiescence he stripped off his coat rolled up his shirtsleeves and dove under the seat for the jack  elizabeth compton was about to protest but there was something about the way in which the stranger went at the job that indicated that he would probably finish it if he wished to in spite of any arguments she could advance to the contrary as he worked she talked with him discovering not only that he was a rather nice person to look at but that he was equally nice to talk to  she could not help but notice that his clothes were rather badly wrinkled and that his shoes were dusty and well worn for when he kneeled in the street to operate the jack the sole of one shoe was revealed beneath the light of an adjacent arc and she saw that it was badly worn evidently he was a poor young man  she had observed these things almost unconsciously and yet they made their impression upon her so that when he had finished she recalled them and was emboldened thereby to offer him a bill in payment for his services he refused as she had almost expected him to do for while his clothes and his shoes suggested that he might accept a gratuity his voice and his manner belied them  during the operation of changing the wheel the young man had a good opportunity to appraise the face and figure of the girl both of which he found entirely to his liking and when finally she started off after thanking him he stood upon the curb watching the car until it disappeared from view  slowly he drew from his pocket an envelope which had been addressed and stamped for mailing and very carefully tore it into small bits which he dropped into the gutter he could not have told had any one asked him what prompted him to the act a girl had come into his life for an instant and had gone out again doubtless forever and yet in that instant jimmy torrance had taken a new grasp upon his selfesteem  it might have been the girl and again it might not have been  he could not tell possibly it was the simple little act of refusing the tip she had proffered him it might have been any one of a dozen little different things or an accumulation of them all that had brought back a sudden flood of the old selfconfidence and optimism  tomorrow said jimmy as he climbed into his bed i am going to land a job  and he did  in the department store to the general managership of whose mailorder department he had aspired jimmy secured a position in the hosiery department at ten dollars a week the department buyer who had interviewed him asked him what experience he had had with ladies hosiery  about four or five years replied jimmy  for whom did you work  i was in business for myself replied the applicant both in the west and in the east i got my first experience in a small town in nebraska but i carried on a larger business in the east later  so they gave jimmy a trial in a new section of the hosiery department wherein he was the only male clerk the buyer had discovered that there was a sufficient proportion of male customers many of whom displayed evident embarrassment in purchasing hosiery from young ladies to warrant putting a man clerk in one of the sections for this class of trade  the fact of the matter was however that the astute buyer was never able to determine the wisdom of his plan since jimmys entire time was usually occupied in waiting upon impressionable young ladies however inasmuch as it redounded to the profit of the department the buyer found no fault  possibly if jimmy had been almost any other type of man from what he was his presence would not have been so flamboyantly noticeable in a hosiery department his stature his features and his bronzed skin that had lost nothing of its bronze in his months search for work through the hot summer streets of a big city were as utterly out of place as would have been the salient characteristics of a chorusgirl in a blacksmithshop  for the first week jimmy was frightfully embarrassed and to his natural bronze was added an almost continuous flush of mortification from the moment that he entered the department in the morning until he left it at night  it is a job however he thought and ten dollars is better than nothing i can hang onto it until something better turns up  with his income now temporarily fixed at the amount of his wages he was forced to find a less expensive boardingplace although at the time he had rented his room he had been quite positive that there could not be a cheaper or more undesirable habitat for man transportation and other considerations took him to a place on indiana avenue near eighteenth street from whence he found he could walk to and from work thereby saving ten cents a day and believe me he cogitated i need the ten  jimmy saw little of his fellow roomers  a strange drab lot he thought them from the occasional glimpses he had had in passings upon the dark stairway and in the gloomy halls they appeared to be quiet inoffensive sort of folk occupied entirely with their own affairs he had made no friends in the place not even an acquaintance nor did he care to what leisure time he had he devoted to what he now had come to consider as his life workthe answering of blind ads in the help wanted columns of one morning and one evening paperthe two mediums which seemed to carry the bulk of such advertising  for a while he had sought a better position by applying during the noon hour to such places as gave an address close enough to the department store in which he worked to permit him to make the attempt during the fortyfiveminute period he was allowed for his lunch  but he soon discovered that ninetenths of the positions were filled before he arrived and that in the few cases where they were not he not only failed of employment but was usually so delayed that he was late in returning to work after noon  by replying to blind ads evenings he could take his replies to the two newspaper offices during his lunch hour thereby losing no great amount of time although he never received a reply he still persisted as he found the attempt held something of a fascination for him similar probably to that which holds the lottery devotee or the searcher after buried treasurethere was always the chance that he would turn up something big  and so another month dragged by slowly  his work in the department store disgusted him it seemed such a silly futile occupation for a fullgrown man and he was always fearful that the sister or sweetheart or mother of some of his chicago friends would find him there behind the counter in the hosiery section  the store was a large one including many departments and jimmy tried to persuade the hosiery buyer to arrange for his transfer to another department where his work would be more in keeping with his sex and appearance  he rather fancied the automobile accessories line but the buyer was perfectly satisfied with jimmys sales record and would do nothing to assist in the change the university heavyweight champion had reached a point where he loathed but one thing more than he did silk hosiery and that one thing was himself     chapter vi  harold plays the raven  mason compton president and general manager sat in his private office in the works of the international machine company chewing upon an unlighted cigar and occasionally running his fingers through his irongray hair as he compared and recompared two statements which lay upon the desk before him  damn strange he muttered as he touched a button beneath the edge of his desk a boy entered the room ask mr bince if he will be good enough to step in here a moment please said compton and a moment later when harold bince entered the older man leaned back in his chair and motioned the other to be seated  i cant understand these statements harold said compton  here is one for august of last year and this is this augusts statement of costs we never had a better month in the history of this organization than last month and yet our profits are not commensurate with the volume of business that we did thats the reason i sent for these cost statements and have compared them and i find that our costs have increased out of all proportions to what is warranted how do you account for it  principally the increased cost of labor replied bince  the same holds true of everybody else every manufacturer in the country is in the same plight we are  i know agreed compton that that is true to some measure  both labor and raw materials have advanced but we have advanced our prices correspondingly in some instances it seems to me that our advance in prices particularly on our specialties should have given us even a handsomer profit over the increased cost of production than we formerly received  in the last six months since i appointed you assistant manager i am afraid that i have sort of let things get out of my grasp i have a lot of confidence in you harold and now that you and elizabeth are engaged i feel even more inclined to let you shoulder the responsibilities that i have carried alone from the inception of this organization but ive got to be mighty sure that you are going to do at least as well as i did you have shown a great deal of ability but you are young and havent had the advantage of the years of experience that made it possible for me to finally develop a business second to none in this line in the west  i never had a son and after elizabeths mother died i have lived in the hope somehow that she would marry the sort of chap who would really take the place of such a son as every man dreams ofsome one who will take his place and carry on his work when he is ready to lay aside his tools i liked your father harold he was one of the best friends that i ever had and i can tell you now what i couldnt have you a month ago that when i employed you and put you in this position it was with the hope that eventually you would fill the place in my business and in my home of the son i never had  do you think elizabeth guessed what was in your mind asked bince  i dont know replied the older man  i have tried never to say anything to influence her years ago when she was younger we used to talk about it half jokingly and shortly after you told me of your engagement she remarked to me one day that she was happy for she knew you were going to be the sort of son i had wanted  i havent anybody on earth but her harold and when i die she gets the business i have arranged it in my will so you two will share and share alike in profits after i go but that will be some time i am far from being an old man and i am a mighty healthy one however i should like to be relieved of the active management there are a lot of things that i have always wanted to do that i couldnt do because i couldnt spare the time from my business  and so i want you to get thoroughly into the harness as soon as possible that i may turn over the entire management to you but i cant do it harold while the profits are diminishing  as the older mans gaze fell again to statements before him the eyes of the younger man narrowed just a trifle as they rested upon mason compton and then as the older man looked up binces expression changed  ill do my best sir he said smiling  of course i realize as you must that i have tried to learn a great deal in a short time i think i have reached a point now where i pretty thoroughly grasp the possibilities and requirements of my work and i am sure that from now on you will note a decided change for the better on the right side of the ledger  i am sure of it my boy said compton heartily  dont think that i have been finding fault with anything you have done i just wanted to call your attention to these figures they mean something and its up to you to find out just what they do mean  and then there came a light tap on the door which opened immediately before any summons to enter had been given and elizabeth compton entered followed by another young woman  hello there exclaimed compton  what gets us out so early  and harriet too there is only one thing that would bring you girls in here so early  and whats that asked elizabeth  you are going shopping and elizabeth wants some money  they all laughed  youre a regular sherlock holmes exclaimed harriet holden  how much asked compton of his daughter still smiling  how much have you asked elizabeth  i am utterly broke  compton turned to bince  get her what she needs harold he said  the young man started to the door  come with me elizabeth he said we will go out to the cashiers cage and get you fixed up  they entered binces office which adjoined comptons  wait here a minute elizabeth said bince  how much do you want ill get it for you and bring it back i want to see you a moment alone before you go  she told him how much she wanted and he was back shortly with the currency  elizabeth he said i dont know whether you have noticed it or not because your father isnt a man to carry his troubles home but i believe that he is failing rapidly largely from overwork he worries about conditions here which really do not exist i have been trying to take the load off his shoulders so that he could ease up a bit but he has got into a rut from which he cannot be guided  he will simply have to be lifted completely out of it or he will stay here and die in the harness everything is running splendidly and now that i have a good grasp of the business i can handle it dont you suppose you could persuade him to take a trip i know that he wants to travel he has told me so several times and if he could get away from here this fall and stay away for a year if possible it would make a new man of him i am really very much worried about him and while i hate to worry you i feel that you are the only person who can influence him and that something ought to be done and done at once  why harold exclaimed the girl there is nothing the matter with father he was never better in his life nor more cheerful  thats the side of him that he lets you see replied the man  his gaiety is all forced if you could see him after you leave you would realize that he is on the verge of a nervous breakdown your father is not an old man in years but he has placed a constant surtax on his nervous system for the last twentyfive years without a letup and it doesnt make any difference how good a machine may be it is going to wear out some day and the better the machine the more complete will be the wreck when the final break occurs  as he spoke he watched the girls face the changing expression of it which marked her growing mental perturbation  you really believe it is as bad as that harold she asked  it may be worse than i think he said  it is surely fully as bad  the girl rose slowly from the chair  i will try and persuade him to see dr earle  the man took a step toward her  i dont believe a doctor is what he needs he said quickly his condition is one that even a nerve specialist might not diagnose correctly it is only some one in a position like mine who has an opportunity to observe him almost hourly day by day who would realize his condition i doubt if he has any organic trouble whatever what he needs is a long rest entirely free from any thought whatever of business at least elizabeth it will do him no harm and it may prolong his life for years i wouldnt go messing around with any of these medical chaps  well she said at last with a sigh i will talk to him and see if i cant persuade him to take a trip he has always wanted to visit japan and china  just the thing exclaimed bince just the thing for him  the long sea voyage will do him a world of good and now he said stepping to her side and putting an arm around her  she pushed him gently away  no she said i do not feel like kissing now and turning she entered her fathers office followed by bince     chapter vii  jobless again  from her fathers works elizabeth and harriet drove to the shopping district where they strolled through a couple of shops and then stopped at one of the larger stores  jimmy torrance was arranging his stock fully ninetenths of which he could have sworn he had just shown an elderly spinster who had taken at least half an hour of his time and then left without making a purchase his back was toward his counter when his attention was attracted by a feminine voice asking if he was busy as he turned about he recognized her instantlythe girl for whom he had changed a wheel a month before and who unconsciously had infused new ambition into his blood and saved him temporarily at least from becoming a quitter  he noticed as he waited on her that she seemed to be appraising him very carefully and at times there was a slightly puzzled expression on her face but evidently she did not recognize him and finally when she had concluded her purchases he was disappointed that she paid for them in cash he had rather hoped that she would have them charged and sent that he might learn her name and address and then she left with jimmy none the wiser concerning her other than that her first name was elizabeth and that she was even betterlooking than he recalled her to have been  and the girl with her exclaimed jimmy mentally  she was no slouch either they are the two bestlooking girls i have seen in this town notwithstanding the fact that whether one likes chicago or not hes got to admit that there are more pretty girls here than in any other city in the country  im glad she didnt recognize me  of course i dont know her and the chances are that i never shall but i should hate to have any one recognize me here or hereafter as that young man at the stocking counter gad but its beastly that a regular lifesized man should be selling stockings to women for a living or rather for a fraction of a living  while jimmy had always been hugely disgusted with his position the sight of the girl seemed to have suddenly crystallized all those weeks of selfcontempt into a sudden almost mad desire to escape what he considered his degrading and effeminating surroundings one must bear with jimmy and judge him leniently for after all notwithstanding his college diploma and physique he was still but a boy and so while it is difficult for a mature and sober judgment to countenance his next step if one can look back a few years to his own youth he can at least find extenuating circumstances surrounding jimmys seeming foolishness  for with a bang that caused startled clerks in all directions to look up from their work he shattered the decorous monotone of the great store by slamming his sales book viciously upon the counter and without a word of explanation to his fellow clerks marched out of the section toward the buyers desk  well mr torrance asked that gentleman what can i do for you  i am going to quit announced jimmy  quit exclaimed the buyer  why whats wrong  isnt everything perfectly satisfactory you have never complained to me  i cant explain replied jimmy  i am going to quit  i am not satisfied i am going to erahaccept another position  the buyer raised his eyebrows  ah he said  with and he named their closest competitor  no said jimmy  i am going to get a regular hejob  the other smiled  if an increase in salary he suggested would influence you i had intended to tell you that i would take care of you beginning next week i thought of making it fifteen dollars and with that unanswerable argument for jimmys continued service the buyer sat back and folded his hands  nothing stirring said jimmy  i wouldnt sell another sock if you paid me ten thousand dollars a year i am through  oh very well said the buyer aggrievedly but if you leave me this way you will be unable to refer to the house  but nothing not even a team of oxen could have held jimmy in that section another minute and so he got his pay and left with nothing more in view than a slow death by starvation  there exclaimed elizabeth compton as she sank back on the cushions of her car  there what asked harriet  i have placed him  whom  that nicelooking young person who waited on us in the hosiery section  oh said harriet  he was nicelooking wasnt he  but he looked out of place there and i think he felt out of place did you notice how he flushed when he asked you what size and the girls laughed heartily at the recollection but where have you ever met him before harriet asked  i have never met him corrected elizabeth accenting the met he changed a wheel on the roadster several weeks ago one evening after i had taken harold down to the club and he was very nice about it i should say that he is a gentleman although his clothes were pretty badly worn  yes said harriet his suit was shabby but his linen was clean and his coat well brushed  my exclaimed elizabeth  he must have made an impression on some one  well said harriet it isnt often you see such a nicelooking chap in the hosiery section  no said elizabeth and probably if he were as nice as he looks he wouldnt be there  whereupon the subject was changed and she promptly forgot mr jimmy torrance but jimmy was not destined soon to forget her for as the jobless days passed and he realized more and more what an ass he had made of himself and why he had occasion to think about her a great deal although never in any sense reproaching her he realized that the fault was his own and that he had done a foolish thing in giving up his position because of a girl he did not know and probably never would  there came a saturday when jimmy jobless and fundless dreaded his return to the indiana avenue roominghouse where he knew the landlady would be eagerly awaiting him for he was a week in arrears in his room rent already and had been warned he could expect no further credit  there is a nice young man wanting your room the landlady had told him and i shall have to be having it saturday night unless you can pay up  jimmy stood on the corner of clark and van buren looking at his watch i hate to do it he thought but the lizard said he could get twenty for it and twenty would give me another two weeks and so his watch went and two weeks later his cigarettecase and ring followed jimmy had never gone in much for jewelrya fact which he now greatly lamented  some of the clothes he still had were good though badly in want of pressing and when after still further days of fruitless searching for work the proceeds from the articles he had pawned were exhausted it occurred to him he might raise something on all but what he actually needed to cover his nakedness  in his search for work he was still wearing his bestlooking suit the others he would dispose of and with this plan in his mind on his return to his room that night he went to the tiny closet to make a bundle of the things which he would dispose of on the morrow only to discover that in his absence some one had been there before him and that there was nothing left for him to sell  it would be two days before his room rent was again due but in the mean time jimmy had no money wherewith to feed the inner man it was an almost utterly discouraged jimmy who crawled into his bed to spend a sleepless night of worry and vain regret the principal object of his regret being that he was not the son of a blacksmith who had taught him how to shoe horses and who at the same time had been too poor to send him to college  long since there had been driven into his mind the conviction that for any practical purpose in life a higher education was as useless as the proverbial fifth wheel to the coach  and even mused jimmy if i had graduated at the head of my class i would be no better off than i am now     chapter viii  bread from the waters  the next day worn out from loss of sleep the young man started out upon a last frenzied search for employment he had no money for breakfast and so he went breakfastless and as he had no carfare it was necessary for him to walk the seemingly interminable miles from one prospective job to another by the middle of the afternoon jimmy was hungrier than he had ever been before in his life he was so hungry that it actually hurt and he was weak from physical fatigue and from disappointment and worry  ive got to eat he soliloquized fiercely  if i have to go out tonight and pound somebody on the head to get the price and im going to do it he concluded as the odors of cooking food came to him from a cheap restaurant which he was passing he stopped a moment and looked into the window at the catsup bottles and sadlooking pies which the proprietor apparently seemed to think formed an artistic and attractive window display  if i had a brick thought jimmy i would have one of those pies even if i went to the jug for it but his hunger had not made him as desperate as he thought he was and so he passed slowly on and glancing into the windows of the store next door saw a display of secondhand clothes and the sign clothes bought and sold  jimmy looked at those in the window and then down at his own which though wrinkled were infinitely better than anything on display  i wonder he mused if i couldnt put something over in the way of high finance here and acting upon the inspiration he entered the dingy little shop when he emerged twenty minutes later he wore a shabby and rather disreputable suit of handmedowns but he had two silver dollars in his pocket  when jimmy returned to his room that night it was with a full stomach but with the knowledge that he had practically reached the end of his rope he had been unable to bring himself to the point of writing his father an admission of his failure and in fact he had gone so far and in his estimation had sunk so low that he had definitely determined he would rather starve to death now than admit his utter inefficiency to those whose respect he most valued  as he climbed the stairway to his room he heard some one descending from above and as they passed beneath the dim light of a flickering gasjet he realized that the other stopped suddenly and turned back to look after him as jimmy continued his ascent of the stairs and then a low voice inquired  say bo what you doin here  jimmy turned toward the questioner  oh he exclaimed as recognition of the other dawned slowly upon him its you is it my old and esteemed friend the lizard  sure its me replied the lizard  but what you doin here  looking for an assistant general manager  jimmy grinned  dont rub it in he said still smiling  the other ascended toward him his keen eyes appraising him from head to foot  you live here he asked  yes replied jimmy do you  sure i been livin here for the last six months  thats funny said jimmy i have been here about two months myself  whats the matter with you asked the lizard  didnt you like the job as general manager  jimmy flushed  forget it he admonished  wheres your room asked the lizard  up another flight said jimmy  wont you come up  sure said the lizard and together the two ascended the stairs and entered jimmys room under the brighter light there the lizard scrutinized his host  you been against it bo havent you he asked  i sure have said jimmy  gee said the other what a difference clothes make  you look like a regular bum  thanks said jimmy  what you doin asked the lizard  nothing  lose your job  i quit it said jimmy  ive only worked a month since ive been here and that for the munificent salary of ten dollars a week  do you want to make some coin asked the lizard  i sure do said jimmy  i dont know of anything i would rather have  im pullin off something tomorrow night  i can use you and he eyed jimmy shrewdly as he spoke  cracking a box asked jimmy grinning  it might be something like that replied the lizard but you wont have nothin to do but stand where i put you and make a noise like a cat if you see anybody coming it ought to be something good i been working on it for three months well split something like fifty thousand thirtyseventy  is that the usual percentage asked jimmy  its what im offerin you replied the lizard  thirty per cent of fifty thousand dollars  jimmy jingled the few pieces of silver remaining in his pocket fifteen thousand dollars and here he had been walking his legs off and starving in a vain attempt to earn a few paltry dollars honestly  theres something wrong somewhere muttered jimmy to himself  im taking it from an old crab who has more than he can use and all of it he got by robbing people that didnt have any to spare hes a big guy here when anything big is doing the newspaper guys interview him and his name is in all the lists of subscriptions to charitywhen theyre going to be published in the papers ill bet he takes ninetenths of his kale from women and children and hes an honored citizen i aint no angel but whatever ive taken didnt cause nobody any sufferinim a thief bo and im mighty proud of it when i think of what this other guy is  thirty per cent of fifty thousand dollars  jimmy was sitting with his legs crossed he looked down at his illfitting shabby trousers and then turned up the sole of one shoe which was worn through almost to his sock the lizard watched him as a cat watches a mouse he knew that the other was thinking hard and that presently he would reach a decision and through jimmys mind marched a sordid and hateful procession of recent eventshumiliation rebuff shame poverty hunger and in the background the face of his father and the face of a girl whose name even he did not know  presently he looked up at the lizard  nothing doing old top he said  but dont mistake the motives which prompt me to refuse your glittering offer i am moved by no moral scruples however humiliating such a confession should be the way i feel now i would almost as lief go out and rob widows and orphans myself but each of us some time in our life has to consider some one who would probably rather see us dead than disgraced i dont know whether you get me or not  i get you replied the lizard and while you may never wear diamonds youll get more pleasure out of life than i ever will provided you dont starve to death too soon you know i had a hunch you would turn me down and im glad you did if you were going crooked some time i thought id like to have you with me when it comes to men im a pretty good picker thats the reason i have kept out of jail so long i either pick a square one or i work alone  thanks said jimmy but how do you know that after you pull this job i wont tip off the police and claim the reward  the lizard grinned his lip grin  there aint one chance in a million he said  youd starve to death before youd do it and now what you want is a job i can probably get you one if you aint too particular  id do anything said jimmy that i could do and still look a policeman in the face  all right said the lizard  when i come back ill bring you a job of some sort i may be back tonight and i may not be back again for a month and in the mean time you got to live  he drew a roll of bills from his pocket and commenced to count out several  hold on cried jimmy  once again nothing doing  forget it admonished the lizard  im just payin back the twenty you loaned me  but i didnt loan it to you said jimmy i gave it to you as a reward for finding my watch  the lizard laughed and shoved the money across the table  take it he said dont be a damn fool  and now solong  i may bring you home a job tonight but if i dont youve got enough to live on for a couple of weeks  after the lizard had gone jimmy sat looking at the twenty dollars for a long time  that fellow may be a thief he soliloquized but whatever he is hes white just imagine the only friend ive got in chicago is a safeblower     chapter ix  harold sits in a game  when elizabeth compton broached to her father the subject of a muchneeded rest and a trip to the orient he laughed at her why girl he cried i was never better in my life where in the world did you get this silly idea  harold noticed it first she replied and called my attention to it and now i can see that you really have been failing  failing ejaculated compton with a scoff  failing nothing  youre a pair of young idiots im good for twenty years more of hard work but as i told harold i would like to quit and travel and i shall do so just as soon as i am convinced that he can take my place  couldnt he do it now asked the girl  no i am afraid not replied compton  it is too much to expect of him but i believe that in another year he will be able to  and so compton put an end to the suggestion that he travel for his health and that night when bince called she told him that she had been unable to persuade her father that he needed a rest  i am afraid he said that you dont take it seriously enough yourself and that you failed to impress upon him the real gravity of his condition it is really necessary that he gohe must go  the girl looked up quickly at the speaker whose tones seemed unnecessarily vehement  i dont quite understand she said why you should take the matter so to heart father is the best judge of his own condition and while he may need a rest i cannot see that he is in any immediate danger  oh well replied bince irritably i just wanted him to get away for his own sake of course it dont mean anything to me  whats the matter with you tonight anyway harold she asked a half an hour later youre as cross and disagreeable as you can be  no im not he said  there is nothing the matter with me at all  but his denial failed to convince her and as unusually early a few minutes later he left she realized that she had spent a most unpleasant evening  bince went directly to his club where he found four other men who were evidently awaiting him  want to sit in a little game tonight harold asked one of them  oh hell replied bince you fellows have been sitting here all evening waiting for me you know i want to my lucks got to change some time  sure thing it has agreed another of the men  you certainly have been playing in rotten luck but when it does changeoh baby  as the five men entered one of the cardrooms several of the inevitable spectators drew away from the other games and approached their table for it was a matter of club gossip that these five played for the largest stakes of any coterie among the habitues of the cardroom  it was two oclock in the morning before bince disgustedly threw his cards upon the table and rose there was a nasty expression on his face and in his mind a thing which he did not dare voicethe final crystallization of a suspicion that he had long harbored that his companions had been for months deliberately fleecing him tonight he had lost five thousand dollars nor was there a man at the table who did not hold his i o us for similar amounts  im through absolutely through he said  ill be damned if i ever touch another card  his companions only smiled wearily for they knew that tomorrow night he would be back at the table  how much of old man comptons money did you get tonight asked one of the four after bince had left the room  about two thousand dollars was the reply which added to what i already hold puts mr compton in my debt some seven or eight thousand dollars  whereupon they all laughed  i suppose remarked anther that its a damn shame but if we dont get it some one else will  is he paying anything at all asked another  oh yes he comes across with something now and then but well probably have to carry the bulk of it until after the wedding  well i cant carry it forever said the first speaker  im not playing here for my health and rising he too left the room going directly to the buffet he found bince as he was quite sure that he would  look here old man he said i hate to seem insistent but on the level ive got to have some money  ive told you two or three times replied bince that id let you have it as soon as i could get it i cant get you any now  if you havent got it mason compton has retorted the creditor and if you dont come across ill go to him and get it  bince paled  you wouldnt do that harry he almost whimpered  for gods sake dont do that and ill try and see what i can do for you  well replied the other i dont want to be nasty but i need some money badly  give me a little longer begged bince and ill see what i can do  jimmy torrance sat a long time in thought after the lizard left  god he muttered i wonder what dad would say if he knew that i had come to a point where i had even momentarily considered going into partnership with a safeblower and that for the next two weeks i shall be compelled to subsist upon the charity of a criminal  im sure glad that i have a college education  it has helped me materially to win to my present exalted standing in society oh well i might be worse off i suppose at least i dont have to worry about the income tax  it is now october and since the first of the year i have earned forty dollars exactly i have also received a bequest of twenty dollars which of course is exempt i venture to say that there is not another ablebodied adult male in the united states the making of whose incometax schedule would be simpler than mine  with which philosophic trend of thought and the knowledge that he could eat for at least two weeks longer the erstwhile star amateur first baseman sought the doubtful comfort of his narrow lumpy bed  it was in the neighborhood of two oclock the next morning that he was awakened by a gentle tapping upon the panels of his door  who is it he asked  what do you want  its me bo came the whispered reply in the unmistakable tones of the lizard  jimmy arose lighted the gas and opened the door  whats the matter he whispered  are the police on your trail  no replied the lizard grinning i just dropped in to tell you that i grabbed a job for you  fine exclaimed jimmy youre a regular fellow all right  but you might not like the job suggested the lizard  as long as i can earn an honest dollar cried jimmy striking a dramatic pose i care not what it may be  the lizards grin broadened  i aint so sure about that he said  i know your kind  youre a regular gent there is some honest jobs that you would just as soon have as the smallpox and maybe this is one of them  what is it asked jimmy  dont keep me guessing any longer  you know feinheimers cabaret  the basement joint on wells street asked jimmy  sure i know it  well thats where i got you a job said the lizard  what doing asked jimmy  waiter was the reply  it isnt any worse than standing behind a counter selling stockings to women said jimmy  it aint such a bad job admitted the lizard if a guy aint too swelled up some of em make a pretty good thing out of it what with their tips and short changingoh there are lots of little ways to get yours at feinheimers  i see said jimmy but dont he pay any wages  oh sure replied the lizard you get the union scale  when do i go to work  go around and see him tomorrow morning  he will put you right to work  and so the following evening the patrons of feinheimers cabaret saw a new face among the untidy servitors of the establishmenta new face and a new figure both of which looked out of place in the atmosphere of the basement resort  feinheimers cabaret held a unique place among the restaurants of the city its patrons were from all classes of society at noon its many tables were largely filled by staid and respectable business men but at night a certain element of the underworld claimed it as their own and there was always a sprinkling of people of the stage artists literary men and politicians it was as a certain wit described it a social goulash for in addition to its regular habitues there were those few who came occasionally from the upper stratum of society in the belief that they were doing something devilish as a matter of fact slumming parties which began and ended at feinheimers were of no uncommon occurrence and as the place was more than usually orderly it was with the greatest safety that society made excursions into the underworld of crime and vice through its medium     chapter x  at feinheimers  feinheimer liked jimmys appearance  he was big and strong and the fact that feinheimer always retained one or two powerful men upon his payroll accounted in a large measure for the orderliness of his place occasionally one might start something at feinheimers but no one was ever known to finish what he started  and so jimmy found himself waiting upon table at a place that was both reputable and disreputable serving business men at noon and criminals and the women of the underworld at night in the weeks that he was there he came to know many of the local celebrities in various walks of life to know them at least by name there was steve murray the labor leader whom rumor said was one of feinheimers financial backersa large man with a loud voice and the table manners of a durocjersey jimmy took an instinctive dislike to the man the first time that he saw him  and then there was little eva whose real name was edith  she was a demure looking little girl who came in every afternoon at four oclock for her breakfast she usually came to jimmys table when it was vacant and at four oclock she always ate alone later in the evening she would come in again with a male escort who was never twice the same  i wonder whats the matter with me she said to jimmy one day as he was serving her breakfast im getting awfully nervous  thats quite remarkable said jimmy  i should think any one who smoked as many cigarettes and drank as much whisky as you would have perfect nerves  the girl laughed a rather soft and mellow laugh  i suppose i do hit it up a little strong she said  strong exclaimed jimmy  why if i drank half what you do id be in the washingtonian home in a week  she looked at him quizzically for a moment as she had looked at him often since he had gone to work for feinheimer  youre a funny guy she said  i cant quite figure you out  what are you doing here anyway  i never claimed to be much of a waiter said jimmy but i didnt know i was so rotten that a regular customer of the place couldnt tell what i was trying to do  oh go on she cried i dont mean that  these other hashslingers around here look the part aside from that about the only thing they know how to do is roll a souse but youre different  yes said jimmy i am different  my abilities are limited  all i can do is wait on table while they have two accomplishments  oh you dont have to tell me said the girl  i wasnt rubbering  i was just sort of interested in you  thanks said jimmy  she went on with her breakfast while jimmy set up an adjoining table presently when he came to fill her waterglass she looked up at him again  i like you kid she said  youre not fresh  you know what i am as well as the rest of them but you wait on me just the same as you would onshe hesitated and there was a little catch in her voice as she finished her sentencejust the same as you would on a decent girl  jimmy looked at her in surprise  it was the first indication that he had ever had from an habitue of feinheimers that there might lurk within their breasts any of the finer characteristics whose outward indices are pride and shame he was momentarily at a loss as to what to say and as he hesitated the girls gaze went past him and she exclaimed  look whos here  jimmy turned to look at the newcomer and saw the lizard directly behind him  howdy bo said his benefactor  i thought id come in and give you the onceover and heres little eva with a plate of ham and at four oclock in the afternoon  the lizard dropped into a chair at the table with the girl and after jimmy had taken his order and departed for the kitchen little eva jerked her thumb toward his retreating figure  friend of yours she asked  he might have a worse friend replied the lizard noncommittally  whats his graft asked the girl  he aint got none except being on the square  its funny the lizard philosophized but heres me with a bank roll that would choke a horse and you probably with a stocking full of dough and ill bet all the money i ever had or ever expect to have if one of us could change places with that poor simp wed do it  he is a square guy isnt he said the girl  you can almost tell it by looking at him how did you come to know him  oh thats a long story said the lizard  we room at the same place but i knew him before that  on indiana near eighteenth asked the girl  how the hell did you know he queried  i know a lot of things i aint supposed to know replied she  youre a wise guy all right eva and one thing i like about you is that you dont let anything you know hurt you  and then after a pause i like him she said  whats his name  the lizard eyed her for a moment  dont you get to liking him too much he said  that birds the class he aint for any little  cut it exclaimed the girl  im as good as you are and a damn straighter what i get i earn and i dont steal it  the lizard grinned  i guess youre right at that but dont try to pull him down any lower than he is he is coming up again some day to where he belongs  i aint going to try to pull him down said the girl  and anyhow when were you made his godfather  jimmy saw eva almost daily for many weeks  he saw her at her postmeridian breakfastsober and subdued he saw her later in the evening in various stages of exhilaration but at those times she did not come to his table and seldom if ever did he catch her eye  they talked a great deal while she breakfasted and he learned to like the girl and to realize that she possessed two personalities the one which he liked dominated her at breakfast the other which he loathed guided her actions later in the evening neither of them ever referred to those hours of her life and as the days passed jimmy found himself looking forward to the hour when little eva would come to feinheimers for her breakfast     chapter xi  christmas eve  it was christmas eve  elizabeth compton and harriet holden were completing the rounds of their friends homes with christmas remembrancesa custom that they had continued since childhood the last parcel had been delivered upon the south side and they were now being driven north on michigan boulevard toward home elizabeth directed the chauffeur to turn over van buren to state which at this season of the year was almost alive with belated christmas shoppers and those other thousands who always seize upon the slightest pretext for a celebration  it was a noisy joyous crowd whose spirit harmonizing with the bright lights and the gay shop windows infected all who came within its influence as the car moved slowly northward along the worlds greatest retail street the girls leaned forward to watch the passing throng through the windows  isnt it wonderful exclaimed harriet what a transformation a few lights make who would ever think of state street as a fairyland and yet if you half close your eyes the hallucination is complete even the people who by daylight are shoddy and careworn take on an appearance of romance and gaiety and the tawdry colored lights are the scintillant gems of the garden of a fairy prince  dont elizabeth pleaded  the city night always affects me  it makes me want to do something adventurous and on christmas eve it is even worse if you keep on like that i shall soon be telling david to drive us up and down state street all night  i wish we didnt have to go home right away said harriet  i feel like doing something devilish  well lets exclaimed elizabeth  do something devilish inquired harriet what for instance  oh most anything that we shouldnt do replied elizabeth and there isnt anything that we could do down here alone that we should do  they both laughed  i have it exclaimed elizabeth suddenly  well be utterly abandonedwell have supper at feinheimers without an escort  harriet cast a horrified glance at her companion  why elizabeth compton she cried you wouldnt dare you know you wouldnt dare  do you dare me asked the other  but suppose some one should see us argued harriet  your father would never forgive us  if we see any one in feinheimers who knows us argued elizabeth shrewdly they will be just as glad to forget it as we and anyway it will do it no harm i shall have david stay right outside the door so that if i call him he can come i dont know what i would do without david he is a sort of rock of ages and gibraltar all in one  through the speakingtube elizabeth directed david to drive to feinheimers and whatever david may have thought of the order he gave no outward indication of it  christmas eve at feinheimers is or was a riot of unconfined hilarity although the code of ethics of the place was on a higher plane than that which governed the christmas eve and new years eve patrons of socalled respectable restaurants where a woman is not safe from insult even though she be properly escorted while in feinheimers a woman with an escort was studiously avoided by the other celebrators unless she chose to join with them as there was only one class of women who came to feinheimers at night without escort the male habitues had no difficulty in determining who they might approach and who they might not  jimmy torrance was as busy as a cranberry merchant  he had four tables to attend to and while the amount of food he served grew more and more negligible as the evening progressed his trips to the bar were exceedingly frequent one of his tables had been vacated for a few minutes when upon his return from the bar with a round of drinks for steve murray and his party he saw that two women had entered and were occupying his fourth table their backs were toward him and he gave them but little attention other than to note that they were unescorted and to immediately catalogue them accordingly having distributed steve murrays order jimmy turned toward his new patrons and laying a menu card before each he stood between them waiting for their order  what shall we take asked elizabeth of harriet  then what have you thats good and she looked up at the waiter  jimmy prided himself upon selfcontrol and his serving at feinheimers had still further schooled him in the repression of any outward indication of his emotions for as most men of his class he had a welldefined conception of what constituted a perfect waiter one of the requisites being utter indifference to any of the affairs of his patrons outside of those things which actually pertained to his duties as a servitor but in this instance jimmy realized that he had come very close to revealing the astonishment which he felt on seeing this girl in feinheimers and unescorted  if jimmy was schooled in selfcontrol elizabeth compton was equally so she recognized the waiter immediately but not even by a movement of an eyelid did she betray the fact which may possibly be accounted for by the fact that it meant little more to her than as though she had chanced to see the same streetsweeper several times in succession although after he had left with their order she asked harriet if she too had recognized him  immediately replied her friend  it doesnt seem possible that such a goodlooking chap should be occupying such a menial position  there must be something wrong with him rejoined elizabeth probably utterly inefficient  or he may have some vice suggested harriet  he doesnt look it said elizabeth  he looks too utterly healthy for that weve seen some of these drug addicts in our own set as you may readily recall no i shouldnt say that he was that  i suppose the poor fellow has never had an opportunity said harriet he has a good face his eyes and forehead indicate intelligence and his jaw is strong and aggressive probably though he was raised in poverty and knows nothing better than what he is doing now it is too bad that some of these poor creatures couldnt have the advantages of higher education  yes said elizabeth it is too bad  take a man like that with a college education he could attain almost any decree of success he chose  he certainly could agreed harriet and then suddenly why whats the matter elizabeth your face is perfectly scarlet  the other girl tapped the floor with the toe of one boot impatiently  that horrid creature at the next table just winked at me she said disgustedly  harriet looked about in the direction her companion had indicated to see a large overdressed man staring at them there was a smirk on his face and as harriet caught his eye she saw him rise and to her horror realized that he was advancing toward their table  he stopped in front of them with his huge hands resting on the edge of their table and looked down at elizabeth  hello kiddo he said  what are you going to drink  elizabeth gave the man one look such as would utterly have frozen a male from her own stratum of society but it had as little effect upon steve murrays selfassurance as the cork from a popgun would have on the armored sides of a rhinoceros  all right said the man whats the use of asking  theres only one thing when steve murray buys here waiter he yelled pounding on the table the nearest waiter who chanced not to be jimmy who was then in the kitchen came hurriedly forward open up some wine commanded murray come on boys bring your chairs over here he continued addressing his companions lets have a little party  elizabeth compton rose  you will oblige me she said by leaving our table  steve murray laughed uproariously  he had dropped into a chair next to hers  thats great he cried i guess you dont know who i am kiddo  you wont cop off anything better in this joint than steve murray come onlets be friends thats a good girl and before elizabeth realized the mans intentions he had seized her wrist and pulled her down into his lap  it was this scene that broke upon jimmys view as he emerged from the kitchen with a laden tray he saw steve murray seize the girl and he saw her struggling to free herself and then there was a mighty crash as jimmy dropped the tray of steaming food upon the floor and ran quickly forward  murray was endeavoring to draw the girls lips to his as jimmys hand shot between their faces and pushed that of the man away with his free arm he encircled the girls body and attempted to draw her from her assailant  cut it murray he commanded in a low tone of voice  she isnt your sort  who the hell are you cried the labor leader releasing the girl and rising to his feet get the hell out of here you dirty hashslinger any girl in this place belongs to me if i want her there dont only one kind come in here without an escort or with one either for that matter you get back on your job where you belong and the man pressed forward trying to push jimmy aside and lay hands on elizabeth again  jimmy did not strike him then  he merely placed the palm of one hand against the mans breast and pushed him backward but with such force that striking a chair steve murray fell backward and sprawled upon the floor scrambling to his feet he rushed jimmy like a mad bull  in his younger days murray had been a boilermaker and he still retained most of his great strength he was a veritable mountain of a man and now in the throes of a berserker rage he was a formidable opponent his face was white and his lips were drawn back tightly exposing his teeth in a bestial snarl as he charged at jimmy his great arms and huge hands beat to the right and left like enormous flails one blow from which might seemingly have felled an ox  torrance had stood for a moment with an arm still around the girl but as murray rose to his feet he pushed her gently behind him and then as the man was upon him jimmy ducked easily under the others clumsy left and swung a heavy right hook to his jaw as murray staggered to the impact of the blow jimmy reached him again quickly and easily with a left to the nose from which a crimson burst spattered over the waiter and his victim murray went backward and would have fallen but for the fact he came in contact with one of his friends and then he was at jimmy again  by this time waiters and patrons were crowding forward from all parts of the room and feinheimer shrieking at the top of his voice was endeavoring to worm his fat toadlike body through the cordon of excited spectators the proprietor reached the scene of carnage just in time to see jimmy plant a lovely left on the point of murrays jaw  the big man tottered drunkenly for an instant his knees sagged and as jimmy stood in readiness for any eventuality the other crashed heavily to the floor  towering above the others in the room suddenly came a big young fellow shouldering his way through the crowd a young man in the uniform of a chauffeur elizabeth saw him before he discovered her  oh david she cried  quick quick take us out of here  as the chauffeur reached her side and took in the scene he jerked his head toward jimmy did any one hurt you miss  no no she cried  this man was very kind  just get us out of here david as quickly as you can and turning to jimmy how can i ever repay you if it hadnt been for youoh i hate to think what would have happened come out to the car and give david your name and address and i will send you something tomorrow  oh thats all right said jimmy  you just get out of here as quick as you can if the police happened to look in now you might be held as a witness  how utterly horrible exclaimed elizabeth  come david come harriet david making a way for her she started for the door  harriet paused long enough to extend her hand to jimmy  it was wonderfully brave of you she said we could never do enough to repay you my name is harriet holden and she gave him an address on lake shore drive if you will come monday morning about ten oclock she said i am sure that there is something we can do for you if you want a better position she half suggested i know my father could help although he must never know about this tonight  thanks said jimmy smiling  its awfully good of you but you must hurry now there goes your friend  feinheimer stood as one dazed looking down at the bulk of his friend and associate  mein gott he cried what kind of a place you think i run young man he turned angrily on jimmy what you think i hire you for to beat up my best customer  he got what was coming to him said a soft feminine voice at jimmys elbow the man looked to see little eva standing at his side i didnt think anybody could do that to murray she continued lord but it was pretty hes had it coming to him ever since ive known him but the big stiff had everybody around this joint buffaloed he got away with anything he started  feinheimer looked at little eva disgustedly  hes my best customer he cried and a bum waiter comes along and beats him up just when he is trying to have a little innocent sport on christmas eve you take off your apron young man and get your time i wont have no rough stuff in feinheimers  jimmy shrugged his shoulders and grinned  shouldnt i wait to see if i cant do something more for mr murray he suggested  you get out of here cried feinheimer get out of here or ill call the police  jimmy laughed and took off his apron  as he walked back to the servants coatroom as he emerged again and crossed through the diningroom he saw that murray had regained consciousness and was sitting at a table wiping the blood from his face with a wet napkin as murrays eyes fell upon his late antagonist he half rose from his chair and shook his fist at jimmy  ill get you for this young feller he yelled  ill get you yet and dont you forget it  you just had me jimmy called back but it didnt seem to make you very happy  he could still hear murray fuming and cursing as he passed out into the barroom at the front of which was feinheimers office     chapter xii  up or down  after jimmy had received his check and was about to leave a couple of men approached him  we seen that little mixup in there said one of them  you handle your mitts like you been there before  yes said jimmy smiling ive had a little experience in the manly art of selfdefense  the two men were sizing him up  feinheimer can you asked one of them  jimmy nodded affirmatively got anything else in view  no said jimmy  howd you like a job as one of brophys sparring partners  i wouldnt mind said jimmy  what is there in it  they named a figure that was entirely satisfactory to jimmy  come over the day after christmas he was told and well give you a trial  i wonder thought jimmy as he started for home if i have gone up a notch in the social scale or down a notch from the viewpoint of the underworld a pug occupies a more exalted position than a waiter but oh well a jobs a job and at least i wont have to look at that greasy feinheimer all day  at ten oclock monday jimmy was at young brophys training quarters for although he had not forgotten harriet holdens invitation he had never seriously considered availing himself of her offer to help him to a better position while he had not found it difficult to accept the rough friendship and assistance of the lizard the idea of becoming an object of charity as he considered it at the hands of a girl in the same walk of life as that to which he belonged was intolerable  young brophys manager whom jimmy discovered to be one of the men who had accosted him in feinheimers after his trouble with murray took him into a private office and talked with him confidentially for a halfhour before he was definitely employed  it seemed that one of the principal requisites of the position was a willingness to take punishment without attempting to inflict too much upon young brophy the manager did not go into specific details as to the reason for this restriction and jimmy badly in need of a job felt no particular inclination to search too deeply for the root of the matter  what i dont know he soliloquized wont hurt me any but he had not been there many days before the piecing together of chance remarks and the gossip of the hangerson and other sparring partners made it very apparent why brophy should not be badly manhandled as it finally revealed itself to jimmy it was very simple indeed brophy was to be pitted against a man whom he had already outpointed in a former bout he was the ruling favorite in the betting and it was the intention to keep him so while he and his backers quietly placed all their money on the other man  one of the sparring partners who seemed to harbor a petty grudge against brophy finally explained the whole plan to jimmy everything was to be done to carry the impression to the public through the newspapers who were usually well represented at the training quarters that brophy was in the pink of condition that he was training hard that it was impossible to find men who could stand up to him on account of the terrific punishment he inflicted upon his sparring partners and that the result of the fight was already a foregone conclusion and then in the third round young brophy was to lie down and by reclining peacefully on his stomach for ten seconds make more money than several years of hard and conscientious work earnestly performed could ever net him  it was all very very simple but how easily public opinion might be changed should one of the sparring partners really make a good stand against brophy in the presence of members of the newspaper fraternity  i see said jimmy running his fingers through his hair  oh well its none of my business and if the suckers want to bet their money on a prizefight theyre about due to lose it anyway  and so he continued permitting himself to be battered up four or five times a week at the hands of the pussy mr brophy he paid back the twenty the lizard had loaned him got his watch out of pawn and was even figuring on a new suit of clothes never before in his life had jimmy realized what it meant to be prosperous since for obvious reasons young brophys manager was extremely liberal in the matter of salaries with all those connected with the trainingcamp  at first it had been rather humiliating to jimmy to take the drubbings he did at the hands of young brophy in the presence of the audience which usually filled the small gymnasium where the fighter was training it was nearly always about the same crowd however made up of dyedinthewool fans a few newspaper men and a sprinkling of thrillseekers from other walks of life far removed from the prizering jimmy often noticed women among the spectatorswelldressed women with every appearance of refinement and there were always men of the same upper class of society  he mentioned the fact once to the same young man who had previously explained the plan under which the fight was to be faked  thats just part of the graft said his informant  these birds have got next to a bunch of wouldbe sports with more money than brains through the athletic director of he mentioned the name of one of the big athletic clubsand they been inviting em here to watch brophy training every one of the simps will be tryin to get money down on brophy and this bunch will take it all up as fast as they come  the bettin hasnt really started yet in fact they are holding off themselves until the odds are better if brophy goes into the ring a threetoone favorite these fellows will make a killing that will be talked of for the next twenty years  and incidentally give boxing another black eye interjected jimmy  oh what the hell do we care said the other im goin to make mine out of it and you better do the same im goin to put up every cent i can borrow or steal on the other guy  it was saturday the 15th of january just a week before the fight that jimmy trained now almost to perfection stepped into the ring to take his usual mauling for some time past there had been insidiously working its way into his mind a vast contempt for the pugilistic prowess of young brophy  if thought jimmy this bird is of championship caliber i might be a champion myself for though young brophy was not a champion the newspapers had been pointing to him for some time as a likely possibility for these pugilistic honors later  as this mental attitude grew within him and took hold of jimmy it more and more irked him to take the punishment which he inwardly felt he could easily inflict upon brophy instead but as jimmy had learned through lean and hungry months a job is a job and no job is to be sneezed at or lightly thrown aside  there was quite a gathering that afternoon to watch young brophys workout and rather a larger representation than usual from societys younger set the program which had consisted in part of shadow boxing and bag punching by young brophy was to terminate with three rounds with jimmy  for two rounds the young man had permitted brophy to make a monkey of him hitting him where he would at will while jimmy as a result of several weeks of diligent practice was able to put up apparently a very ferocious attempt to annihilate his opponent without doing the latter any material damage  at the close of the second round brophy landed a particularly vicious right which dropped jimmy to the canvas the crowd applauded vociferously and as the gong sounded as jimmy was slowly rising to his feet they were all assured that it was all that had saved the young man from an even worse thrashing  as jimmy returned to his corner there arose within him a determination to thrash young brophy within an inch of his life after the big fight was out of the way and jimmy no longer bound by any obligations for he realized that for some reason brophy had just gone a little too far with his rough tactics there having been in the arrangement with the sparring partners an understanding that when a knockdown was to be staged brophy was to give his opponent the cue no cue had been given however jimmy had not been expecting it and he had been floored with a punch behind which were all the weight and brawn of the pugilist  he had long since ceased to consider what the spectators might think so far as jimmy was concerned they might have been so many chairs he was merely angry at the unnecessary punishment that had been inflicted as he sprawled in his corner he let his eyes run over the faces of the spectators directly in front of him to whom previously he had paid no particular attention and even now it was scarcely more than an involuntary glance but his eyes stopped suddenly upon a face and as recognition suddenly dawned upon him he could feel the hot blood rushing to his own for there was the girl whom fate had thrice before thrown in his path beside her he recognized the miss harriet holden who had been with her the night at feinheimers and with them were two young men  something within jimmy torrance rebelled to a point where it utterly dominated himrebelled at the thought that this girl whom he had unconsciously set upon a pedestal to worship from afar should always find him in some menial and humiliating position it was bad enough that she should see him as a sparring partner of a professional pug but it made it infinitely worse that she should see him as what he must appear an unsuccessful third or fourth rate fighter  everything within jimmys mind turned suddenly topsyturvy  he seemed to lose all sense of proportion and all sense of value in one overpowering thought that he must not again be humiliated in her presence  and so it was that at the tap of the gong for the third round it was not torrance the sparring partner that advanced from his corner but jimmy torrance champion heavyweight boxer of a certain famous university but why enter into the harrowing details of the ensuing minute and a half  in thirty seconds it was unquestionably apparent to every one in the room including young brophy himself that the latter was pitifully outclassed jimmy hit him whenever and wherever he elected to hit and he hit him hard while brophy at best only a second or third rate fighter pussy and undertrained was not only unable to elude the blows of his adversary but equally so to land effectively himself  and there before the eyes of half a dozen newspaper reporters of a dozen wealthy young men who had fully intended to place large sums on brophy and before the eyes of his horrified manager and backer jimmy at the end of ninety seconds landed a punch that sent the flabby mr brophy through the ropes and into dreamland for a much longer period than the requisite ten seconds  before jimmy got dressed and out of the gymnasium he with difficulty escaped a halfdozen more fistic encounters as everybody from the manager down felt that his crime deserved nothing short of capital punishment he had absolutely wrecked a perfectly good scheme in the perfection of which several thousand dollars had been spent and now there could not be even the possibility of a chance of their breaking even     chapter xiii  harriet philosophizes  when jimmy got home that night he saw a light in the lizards room and entered  well said the cracksman hows every little thing  jimmy smiled ruefully  canned again he announced and then he told the lizard the story of his downfall attributing the results of the third round however to brophys unwarranted action at the end of the second  well said the lizard you certainly are the champion boob  there you had a chance to cop off a nice bunch of coin on that fight and instead you kill it for yourself and everybody else  you dont think said jimmy that i would have put any money on that crooked scrap  why not asked the lizard and then he shook his head sadly  no i dont suppose you would theres lots of things about you that i cant understand and one of them is the fact that you would rather starve to death than take a little easy money off of birds that have got more than they got any business to have why with your education and front we two could pull off some of the classiest stuff that this burg ever saw  forget it admonished jimmy  what are you going to do now asked the lizard  go out and hunt for another job said jimmy  well i wish you luck said the lizard  maybe i can find something for you  ill try and in the mean time if you need any mazuma i always got a little roll tucked away in my sock  thanks said jimmy and i dont mind telling you that youre the one man i know whom id just as soon borrow from and would like the opportunity of loaning to you say that you cant understand me and yet youre a whole lot more of an enigma yourself you admit in fact youre inclined to boast that youre a pickpocket and a safeblower and yet id trust you lizard with anything that i had  the lizard smiled and for the first time since he had known him jimmy noticed that his eyes smiled with his lips  ive always had the reputation said the lizard of being a white guy with my friends as a matter of fact i aint no different from what youd probably be if you were in business and what most of your friends are morally theyre a bunch of thieves and crooks of course they dont go out and frisk any one and they dont work with a jimmy or a bottle of soup they work their graft with the help of contracts and lawyers and theyd gyp a friend or a pauper almost as soon as they would an enemy i dont know much about morality but when it comes right down to a question of morals i believe my trade is just as decent as that of a lot of these birds you see rolling up and down mich boul in their limousines  its all in the point of view said jimmy  yes said the lizard  its all in the point of view and my point of view aint warped by no college education  jimmy grinned  eventually lizard you may win me over but when you do why fritter away our abilities upon this simple village when we have the capitals of all europe to play around in  theres something in that said the lizard but dont get it into your head for a minute that i am tryin to drag you from the straight and narrow i think i like you better the way you are  did you ever said harriet holden see anything so weird as the way we keep bumping into that stockingcounter young man  no said elizabeth its commencing to get on my nerves  every time i turn a corner now i expect to bump into him i suppose we see other people many times without recognizing them but he is so utterly goodlooking that he sort of sticks in ones memory  do you know said harriet that i have a suspicion that he recognized us i saw him looking up at us just after that other person knocked him down and i could have sworn that he blushed and then you know he went in and was entirely different from what he had been in the two preceding rounds billy said that he is really a wonderful fighter and there are not very many good fights that billy misses what in the world do you suppose his profession is anyway since we first noticed him he has been a hosiery clerk a waiter and a prizefighter  i dont know i am sure said elizabeth yawning  you seem to be terribly interested in him  i am admitted harriet frankly  hes a regular adventure all in himselfa whole series of adventures  ive never been partial to serials said elizabeth  well i should think one would be a relief after a whole winter of heavy tragedy retorted harriet  what do you mean asked elizabeth  oh i mean harold of course said harriet  hes gone around all winter with a grouch and a face a mile long whats the matter with him anyway  i dont know sighed elizabeth  im afraid hes working too hard  harriet giggled  oh fiddlesticks she exclaimed  you know perfectly well that harold bince will never work himself to death  well he is working hard harriet  father says so  and hes worrying about the business too hes trying so hard to make good  i will admit that he has stuck to his job more faithfully than anybody expected him to  elizabeth turned slowly upon her friend you dont like harold she said why is it  harriet shook her head  i do like him elizabeth for your sake  i suppose the trouble is that i realize that he is not good enough for you i have known him all my life and even as a little child he was never sincere possibly he has changed now i hope so and then again i know as well as you do that you are not in love with him  how perfectly ridiculous cried elizabeth  do you suppose that i would marry a man whom i didnt love  you havent the remotest idea what love is  youve never been in love  have you asked elizabeth  no replied harriet i havent but i know the symptoms and you certainly havent got one of them whenever harold isnt going to be up for dinner or for the evening youre always relieved possibly you dont realize it yourself but you show it to any one who knows you  well i do love him insisted elizabeth and i intend to marry him i never had any patience with this silly lovesick business that requires people to pine away when they are not together and bore everybody else to death when they were  all of which proves said harriet that you havent been stung yet and i sincerely hope that you may never be unless it happens before you marry harold     chapter xiv  in againout again  jimmy torrance was out of a job a week this time and once more he was indebted to the lizard for a position the latter knowing a politician who was heavily interested in a dairy company with the result that jimmy presently found himself driving a milkwagon jimmys route was on the north side which he regretted as it was in the district where a number of the friends of his former life resided his delivery schedule however and the fact that his point of contact with the homes of his customers was at the back door relieved him of any considerable apprehension of being discovered by an acquaintance  his letters home were infrequent for he found that his powers of invention were being rapidly depleted it was difficult to write glowing accounts of the business success he was upon the point of achieving on the strength of any of the positions he so far had held and doubly so during the far greater period that he had been jobless and hungry but he had not been able to bring himself to the point of admitting to his family his long weeks of consistent and unrelieved failure  recently he had abandoned his futile attempts to obtain positions through the medium of the help wanted columns  it is no use he thought  there must be something inherently wrong with me that in a city full of jobs i am unable to land anything without some sort of a pull and then only work that any unskilled laborer could perform  the truth of the matter was that jimmy torrance was slowly approaching that mental condition that is aptly described by the phrase losing your grip one of the symptoms of which was the fact that he was almost contented with his present job  he had driven for about a week when upon coming into the barn after completing his morning delivery he was instructed to take a special order to a certain address on lake shore drive although the address was not that of one of his regular customers he felt that there was something vaguely familiar about it but when he finally arrived he realized that it was a residence at which he had never before called  driving up the alley jimmy stopped in the rear of a large and pretentious home and entering through a gateway in a high stone wall he saw that the walk to the rear entrance bordered a very delightful garden he realized what a wonderfully pretty little spot it must be in the summer time with its pool and fountain and treeshaded benches its vinecovered walls and artistically arranged shrubs and it recalled to jimmy with an accompanying sigh the homes in which he had visited in what seemed now a remote past and also of his own home in the west  on the alley in one corner of the property stood a garage and stable in which jimmy could see men working upon the owners cars and about the boxstalls of his saddle horses at the sight of the horses jimmy heaved another sigh as he continued his way to the rear entrance as he stood waiting for a reply to his summons he glanced back at the stable to see that horses had just entered and that their riders were dismounting evidently two of the women of the household and then a houseman opened the door and jimmy made his delivery and started to retrace his steps to his wagon  approaching him along the walk from the stable were the riderstwo young women laughing and talking as they approached the house and suddenly jimmy in his neat white suit carrying his little tray of milkbottles recognized them and instantly there flashed into recollection the address that harriet holden had given him that night at feinheimers  what infernal luck he groaned inwardly i suppose the next time i see that girl ill be collecting garbage from her back door and then with his eyes straight to the front he stepped aside to let the two pass  it was harriet holden who recognized him first and stopped with a little exclamation of surprise jimmy stopped too there was nothing else that a gentleman might do although he would have given his right hand to have been out of the yard  you never came to the house as i asked you to said miss holden reproachfully we wanted so much to do something to repay you for your protection that night  there was no use in my coming said jimmy for you see i couldnt have accepted anything for what i didi couldnt very well have done anything else could i under the circumstances  there were many other men in the place replied harriet but you were the only one who came to our help  but the others were not jimmy been upon the point of saying gentlemen but then he happened to think that in the eyes of these two girls and according to their standard he might not be a gentleman either well you see he continued lamely they probably didnt know who you were  did you asked elizabeth  no jimmy admitted of course i didnt know who you were but i knew what you were not which was the thing that counted most then  i wish said harriet that you would let us do something for you  yes said elizabeth if a hundred dollars would be of any use to you harriet laid a hand quickly on her friends arm  i wasnt thinking of money she said to jimmy  one cant pay for things like that with money but we know so many people here we might help you in some way if you are not entirely satisfied with your present position  out of the corner of his eye jimmy could not help but note that elizabeth was appraising him critically from head to foot and he felt that he could almost read what was passing through her mind as she took stock of his cheap cotton uniform and his cap with the badge of his employer above the vizor involuntarily jimmy straightened his shoulders and raised his chin a trifle  no thank you he said to harriet it is kind of you but really i am perfectly satisfied with my present job it is by far the best one i have ever held and touching his cap he continued his interrupted way to his wagon  what a strange young man exclaimed harriet he is like many of his class replied elizabeth probably entirely without ambition and with no desire to work any too hard or to assume additional responsibilities  i dont believe it retorted harriet  unless i am greatly mistaken that man is a gentleman everything about him indicates it his inflection even is that of a wellbred man  how utterly silly exclaimed elizabeth  youve heard him speak scarcely a dozen words i venture to say that in a fifteenminute conversation he would commit more horrible crimes against the kings english than even that new stableboy of yours really harriet you seem very much interested in this person  why shouldnt i be asked harriet  hes becoming my little pet mystery i wonder under what circumstances we see him next  probably as a whitewings laughed elizabeth  but if so i positively refuse to permit you to stop in the middle of michigan boulevard and converse with a streetsweeper while im with you  jimmys new job lasted two weeks and then the milkwagon drivers went on strike and jimmy was thrown out of employment  tough luck sympathized the lizard  you sure are the calamity kid but dont worry well land you something else and remember that that partnership proposition is still open  there ensued another month of idleness during which jimmy again had recourse to the help wanted column the lizard tried during the first week to find something for him and then occurred a certain very famous saferobbery and the lizard disappeared     chapter xv  little  eva  early in march jimmy was again forced to part with his watch  as he was coming out of the pawnshop late in the afternoon he almost collided with little eva  for the love of mike cried that young lady where have you been all this time and whats happened to you you look as though youd lost your last friend and then noting the shop from which he had emerged and the deduction being all too obvious she laid one of her shapely hands upon the sleeve of his cheap illfitting coat youre up against it kid aint you she asked  oh its nothing said jimmy ruefully im getting used to it  i guess youre too square said the girl i heard about that brophy business and then she laughed softly do you know who the biggest backers of that graft were  no said jimmy  well dont laugh yourself to death she admonished they were steve murray and feinheimer talk about sore pups you never saw anything like it and when they found who it was that had ditched their wonderful scheme they threw another fit say those birds have been weeping on each others shoulders ever since  do you still breakfast at feinheimers asked jimmy  once in a while said the girl but not so often now  and she dropped her eyes to the ground in what in another than little eva might have been construed as embarrassment where you going now she asked quickly  to eat said jimmy and then prompted by the instincts of his earlier training and without appreciable pause wont you take dinner with me no said the girl but you are going to take dinner with me youre out of a job and broke and the chances are youve just this minute hocked your watch while i have plenty of money no she said as jimmy started to protest this is going to be on me i never knew how much i enjoyed talking with you at breakfast until after you had left feinheimers ive been real lonesome ever since she admitted frankly you talk to me different from what the other men do she pressed his arm gently you talk to me kid just like a fellow might talk to his sister  jimmy didnt know just what rejoinder to make and so he made none  as a matter of fact he had not realized that he had said or done anything to win her confidence nor could he explain his attitude toward her in the light of what he knew of her life and vocation there is a type of man that respects and reveres womanhood for those inherent virtues which are supposed to be the natural attributes of the sex because in their childhood they have seen them exemplified in their mothers their sisters and in the majority of women and girls who were parts of the natural environment of their early lives  it is difficult ever entirely to shatter the faith of such men and however they may be wronged by individuals of the opposite sex their subjective attitude toward woman in the abstract is one of chivalrous respect as far as outward appearances were concerned little eva might have passed readily as a paragon of all the virtues as yet there was no sign nor line of dissipation marked upon her piquant face nor in her consociation with jimmy was there ever the slightest reference to or reminder of her vocation  they chose a quiet and eminently respectable dining place and after they had ordered jimmy spread upon the table an evening paper he had purchased upon the street  help me find a job he said to the girl and together the two ran through the want columns  heres a bunch of them cried the girl laughingly all in one ad night cook one hundred and fifty dollars swing man one hundred and forty dollars roast cook one hundred and twenty dollars broiler one hundred and twenty dollars id better apply for that fry cook one hundred and ten dollars oh heres something for steve murray chicken butcher eighty dollars heres a job id like she cried icecream man one hundred dollars  quit your kidding said jimmy  im looking for a job not an acrostic  well she said here are two solid pages of them but nobody seems to want a waiter what else can you do she asked smiling up at him  i can drive a milkwagon said jimmy but the drivers are all on strike  now be serious she announced lets look for something really good heres somebody wants a finishing superintendent for a string music instrument factory and a business manager and electrical engineer in this one whats an efficiency expert  oh hes a fellow who gums up the works puts you three weeks behind in less than a week and has all your best men resigning inside of a month i know because my dad had one at his plant a few years ago  the girl looked at him for a moment your father is a business man she asked and without waiting for an answer why dont you work for him  it was the first reference that jimmy had ever made to his connections or his past  oh he said hes a long way off andif im no good to any one here i certainly wouldnt be any good to him  his companion made no comment but resumed her reading of the advertisement before her                wanted an efficiency expertmachine works             wants man capable of thoroughly reorganizing large             business along modern lines stopping leaks and             systematizing every activity  call international             machine company west superior street  ask for             mr compton    what do you have to know to be an efficiency expert asked the girl  from what i saw of the bird i just mentioned the less one knows about anything the more successful he should be as an efficiency expert for he certainly didnt know anything and yet the results from kicking everybody in the plant out of his own particular rut eventually worked wonders for the organization if the man had had any sense tact or diplomacy nothing would have been accomplished  why dont you try it asked the girl  jimmy looked at her with a quizzical smile  thank you he said  oh i didnt mean it that way she cried  but from what you tell me i imagine that all a man needs is a front and plenty of punch youve got the front all right with your looks and gift of gab and i leave it to young brophy if you havent got the punch  maybe thats not the punch an efficiency expert needs suggested jimmy  it might be a good thing to have up his sleeve replied the girl and then suddenly do you believe in hunches  sometimes replied jimmy  well this is a hunch take it from me she continued ill bet you can land that job and make good  what makes you think so asked jimmy  i dont know she replied but you know what a womans intuition is  i suppose said jimmy that its the feminine of hunch but however good your hunch or intuition may be it would certainly get a terrible jolt if i presented myself to the head of the international machine company in this scenery do you see anything about my clothes that indicates efficiency  it isnt your clothes that count jimmy she said its the combination of that face of yours and what youve got in your head youre the most efficient looking person i ever saw and if you want a reference ill say this much for you youre the most efficient waiter that feinheimer ever had he said so himself even after he canned you  your enthusiasm said jimmy is contagious  if it wasnt for these sorry rags of mine id take a chance on that hunch of yours  the girl laid her hand impulsively upon his  wont you let me help you she asked id like to and it will only be a loan if you wanted to look at it that way enough to get you a decentlooking outfit such an outfit as you ought to have to land a good job i know and everybody else knows that clothes do count no matter what we say to the contrary ill bet youre some looker when youre dolled up please she continued just try it for a gamble  i dont see how i can he objected  the chances are i could never pay you back and there is no reason in the world why you should loan me money you are certainly under no obligation to me  i wish you would let me jimmy she said it would make me awfully happy  the man hesitated  oh she said im going to do it anyway wait a minute and rising she left the table  in a few minutes she returned here she said youve got to take it and extended her hand toward him beneath the edge of the table i cant said jimmy it wouldnt be right  the girl looked at him and flushed  do you mean she said because its mybecause of what i am  oh no said jimmy please dont think that  and impulsively he took her hand beneath the table at the contact the girl caught her breath with a little quickdrawn sigh  here take it she said and drawing her hand away quickly left a roll of bills in jimmys hand     chapter xvi  jimmy throws a bluff  that afternoon mr harold bince had entered his superiors office with an afternoon paper in his hand  whats the idea of this ad mr compton he asked  why do we need an efficiency expert i wish you had let me know what you intended doing  i knew that if i told you harold you would object said the older man and i thought i would have a talk with several applicants before saying anything about it to any one of course whoever we get will work with you but i would rather not have it generally known about the plant there seems to be a leak somewhere and evidently we are too close to the work to see it ourselves it will require an outsider to discover it  i am very much opposed to the idea said bince these fellows usually do nothing more than disrupt an organization we have a force that has been here many of them for years there is as little lost motion in this plant as in any in the country and if we start in saddling these men with a lot of red tape which will necessitate their filling out innumerable forms for every job about half their time will be spent in bookkeeping which can just as well be done here in the office as it is now i hope that you will reconsider your intention and let us work out our own solution in a practical manner which we can do better in the light of our own experience than can an outsider who knows nothing of our peculiar problems  we will not permit the organization to be disrupted replied mr compton it may do a lot of good to get a new angle on our problems and at least it will do no harm  i cant agree with you replied bince  i think it will do a lot of harm  compton looked at his watch  it is getting late harold he said and this is payday i should think everett could help you with the payroll everett was the cashier  i prefer to do it myself replied bince  everett has about all he can do and anyway i dont like to trust it to any one else and realizing that compton did not care to discuss the matter of the efficiency expert further bince returned to his own office  the following afternoon the office boy entered mr comptons office a gentleman to see you sir he announced he said to tell you that he came in reply to your advertisement  show him in instructed compton and a moment later jimmy entereda rehabilitated jimmy upon his excellent figure the readymade suit had all the appearance of faultlessly tailored garments compton looked up at his visitor and with the glance he swiftly appraised jimmya glance that assured him that here might be just the man he wanted for intelligence aggressiveness and efficiency were evidently the outstanding characteristics of the young man before him after jimmy had presented himself the other motioned him to a chair  i am looking said mr compton for an experienced man who can come in here and find out just what is wrong with us we have an oldestablished business which has been making money for years we are taking all the work that we can possibly handle at the highest prices we have ever received and yet our profits are not at all commensurate with the volume of business it has occurred to me that an experienced man from the outside would be able to more quickly put his finger on the leaks and stop them now tell me just what your experience has been and we will see if we can come to some understanding  from his pocket jimmy drew a halfdozen envelopes and taking the contents from them one by one laid them on the desk before mr compton on the letterheads of half a dozen large outoftown manufacturers in various lines were brief but eulogistic comments upon the work done in their plants by mr james torrance jr as he was reading them mr compton glanced up by chance to see that the face of the applicant was slightly flushed which he thought undoubtedly due to the fact that the other knew he was reading the words of praise contained in the letters whereas the truth of the matter was that jimmys color was heightened by a feeling of guilt  these are very good said mr compton looking up from the letters i dont know that i need go any further a great deal depends on a mans personality in a position of this sort and from your appearance i should imagine that youre all right along that line and you seem to have had the right kind of experience now what arrangement can we make  jimmy had given the matter of pay considerable thought but the trouble was that he did not know what an efficiency expert might be expected to demand he recalled vaguely that the one his father had employed got something like ten dollars a day or one hundred a day jimmy couldnt remember which and so he was afraid that he might ask too much and lose the opportunity or too little and reveal that he had no knowledge of the value of such services  i would rather leave that to you he said what do you think the work would be worth to you  do you expect to continue in this line of work asked mr compton when this job is finished you would want to go somewhere else i suppose  jimmy saw an opening and leaped for it oh no he replied on the contrary i wouldnt mind working into a permanent position and if you think there might be a possibility of that i would consider a reasonable salary arrangement rather than the usual contract rate for expert service  it is very possible said mr compton that if you are the right man there would be a permanent place in the organization for you with that idea in mind i should say that two hundred and fifty dollars a month might be a mutually fair arrangement to begin with  two hundred and fifty dollars a month  jimmy tried to look bored but not too bored  of course he said with the idea that it may become a permanent wellpaying position i think i might be inclined to consider itin fact i am very favorably inclined toward it he added hastily as he thought he noted a sudden waning of interest in comptons expression but be sure yourself that i am the man you want for instance my methodsyou should know something of them first  in jimmys pocket was a small book he had purchased at a secondhand bookshop the evening before upon the cover of which appeared the title how to get more out of your factory he had not had sufficient time to study it thoroughly but had succeeded in memorizing several principal headings on the contents page  at first he explained i wont seem to be accomplishing much as i always lay the foundation of my future work by studying my men some men have that within them which spurs them on while some need artificial initiativeoutside encouragement he quoted glibly from how to get more out of your factory some men extend themselves under stern discipline some respond only to a gentle rein i study menthe men over me under me around me i study them and learn how to get from each the most that is in him at the same time i shall be looking for leaks and investigating timekeeping methods wagepaying systems and planning on efficiency producers later i shall start reducing costs by studying machines handling material economically and producing power at lowest cost keeping the product moving making environment count on the balancesheet and protecting against accident and fire this was as far as jimmy had memorized and so he stopped  i think said mr compton that you have the right idea  some of your points are not entirely clear to me as there are many modern methods that i have not i am sorry to say investigated sufficiently  jimmy did not think it necessary to explain that they were not clear to him either  and now said compton if you are satisfied with the salary when can you start  jimmy rose with a brisk and businesslike manner i am free now he said with the exception of a little personal business which i can doubtless finish up tomorrowsuppose i come thursday  good exclaimed compton but before you go i want you to meet our assistant general manager mr bince and he led jimmy toward binces office  this is mr torrance harold said mr compton as they entered mr bince mr torrance mr torrance is going to help us systematize the plant he will report directly to me and i know you will do everything in your power to help him you can go to mr bince for anything in the way of information you require and harold when mr torrance comes thursday i wish you would introduce him to everett and the various department heads and explain that they are to give him full cooperation and now as i have an appointment i shall have to ask you to excuse me i will see you thursday if there are any questions you want to ask mr bince will be glad to give you any information you wish or care for  jimmy had felt from the moment that he was introduced to bince that the latter was antagonistic and now that the two were alone together he was not long left in doubt as to the correctness of his surmise as soon as the door had closed behind mr compton bince wheeled toward jimmy  i dont mind telling you mr torrance he said that i consider the services of an expert absolutely unnecessary but if mr compton wishes to experiment i will interfere in no way and i shall help you all i can but i sincerely hope that you on your part will refrain from interfering with my activities as a matter of fact you wont have to leave this office to get all the information you need and if you will come to me i can make it easy for you to investigate the entire workings of the plant and save you a great deal of unnecessary personal labor i suppose that you have had a great deal of experience along this line  jimmy nodded affirmatively  just how do you purpose proceeding  oh well said jimmy each one of us really has a system of his own at first i wont seem to be accomplishing much as i always lay the foundation of my future work by studying my men some men have that within them which spurs them on while some need artificial initiativeoutside encouragement he hoped that the door to comptons office was securely closed  some men extend themselves under stern discipline some respond only to a gentle rein i study menthe men over me under me around me i study them and learn how to get from each the most that is in him at the same time i shall be looking for leaks and investigating timekeeping methodshe was looking straight at bince and he could not help but note the slight narrowing of the others lids wagepaying systems and planning on efficiency producers  here he hesitated a moment as though weighing his words though as a matter of fact he had merely forgotten the title of the next chapter but presently he went on again  later i shall start reducing costs by studying machines handling material economically and producing power at lowest costs keeping the product moving making environment count on the balancesheet and protecting against accident and fire  is that all asked mr bince  oh no indeed said jimmy thats just a very brief outline of the way i shall start  ah said mr bince and just how may i ask do you make environment count on the balancesheet i do not quite understand  jimmy was mentally gasping and going down for the third time he had wondered when he read that chapter title just what it might mean  oh he said you will understand that thoroughly when we reach that point it is one of the steps in my method other things lead up to it it is really rather difficult to explain until we have a concrete example something that you can really visualize you know but i assure you that it will be perfectly plain to you when we arrive at that point  and now he said rising i must be going  i have a great deal to attend to this afternoon and tomorrow as i wish to get some personal matters out of the way before i start in here thursday  all right said mr bince i suppose we shall see you thursday but just bear in mind please that you and i can work better together than at crosspurposes     chapter xvii  jimmy on the job  as jimmy left the office he discovered that those last words of binces had made a considerable and a rather unfavorable impression on him he was sure that there was an underlying meaning though just what it portended he was unable to imagine  from the international machine company jimmy went directly to the restaurant where he and little eva had dined the night before he found her waiting for him as they had agreed she would  well what luck she asked as he took the chair next to her  oh i landed the job all right said jimmy but i feel like a crook i dont know how in the world i ever came to stand for those letters of recommendation they were the things that got me the job all right but i honestly feel just as though i had stolen something  dont feel that way said the girl  youll make good i know and then it wont make any difference about the letters  and now said jimmy tell me where you got them you promised me that you would tell me afterward  oh said the girl that was easy  a girl who rooms at the same place i do works in a big printing and engraving plant and i got her to get me some samples of letterheads early this morning in fact i went downtown with her when she went to work and then i went over to the underwood offices and wrote the recommendations out on a machinei used to be a stenographer  and you forged these names asked jimmy horrified  i didnt forge anybodys name replied the girl  i made them up  you mean there are no such men  as far as i know there are not she replied laughing  slowly jimmy drew the letters from his inside pocket and read them one by one spreading them out upon the table before him presently he looked up at the girl  why dont you get a position again as a stenographer he asked  i have been thinking of it she said do you want me to  yes he said i want you to very much  it will be easy she said  there is no reason why i shouldnt except that there was no one ever cared what i did  as she finished speaking they were both aware that a man had approached their table and stopped opposite them jimmy and the girl looked up to see a large man in a dark suit looking down at eva jimmy did not recognize the man but he knew at once what he was  well odonnell whats doing asked the girl  you know whats doing said the officer  how miny toimes do the captin have to be afther isshuin orrders tellin you janes to kape out uv dacent places  the girl flushed  im not working here she said  to hell ye aint sneered odonnell  didnt i see ye flag this guy whin he came in  this young lady is a friend of mine said jimmy  i had an appointment to meet her here  odonnell shifted his gaze from the girl to her escort and for the first time appraised jimmy thoroughly oh its you is it he asked  it is said jimmy you guessed it the first time but far be it from me to know what you have guessed as i never saw you before my friend  well ive seen you before said odonnell and ye put one over on me that time all roight i can see now i dont know what your game was but you and the lizard played it pretty slick when you could pull the wool over patrick odonnells eyes the way ye done  oh said jimmy ive got you now  youre the bull who interfered with my friend and me on randolph and la salle way back last july  i am said odonnell and i thought ye was a foine young gentleman and you are a foine one he said with intense sarcasm  go away and leave us alone said the girl were not doing anything we ate in here last night together this man is perfectly respectable he isnt what you think him at all  im not going to pinch him said odonnell i aint got nothin to pinch him for but the next time i see him ill know him  well said the girl are you going to beat it or are you going to stick around here bothering us all evening there hasnt anybody registered a complaint against me in here  naw said odonnell they aint but you want to watch your step or they will  all right said the girl run along and sell your papers  and she turned again to jimmy and as though utterly unconscious of the presence of the police officer she remarked that big stiff gives me a pain hes the original buttinsky kid  odonnell flushed  watch your step young lady he said as he turned and walked away  i thought said jimmy that it was the customary practise to attempt to mollify the guardians of the law  mollify nothing returned the girl  none of these big bruisers knows what decency is and if youre decent to them they think youre afraid of them when they got something on you you got to be nice but when they havent tell them where they get off i knew he wouldnt pinch me hes got nothing to pinch me for and hed have been out of luck if he had for there hasnt one of them got anything on me  but wont he have it in for you asked jimmy  sure he will said the girl  hes got it in for everybody thats what being a policeman does to a man say most of these guys hate themselves i tell you though she said presently and more seriously im sorry on your account these dicks never forget a face hes got you catalogued and filed away in what he calls his brain alongside of a dip andashe hesitateda girl like me and no matter how high up you ever get if your foot slips up will bob odonnell with these two facts  im not worrying said jimmy  i dont intend to let my foot slip in his direction  i hope not said the girl                    thursday morning jimmy took up his duties as efficiency expert at the plant of the international machine company since his interview with compton his constant companion had been how to get more out of your factory with the result that he felt that unless he happened to be pitted against another efficiency expert he could at least make a noise like efficiency and also he had grasped what he considered the fundamental principle of efficiency namely simplicity  if he reasoned i cannot find in any plant hundreds of operations that are not being done in the simplest manner it will be because i havent even ordinary powers of observation or intelligence for after his second interview with compton jimmy had suddenly realized that the job meant something to him beside the two hundred and fifty dollars a monththat he couldnt deliberately rob compton as he felt that he would be doing unless he could give value received in services and he meant to do his best to accomplish that end  he knew that for a while his greatest asset would be bluff but there was something about mason compton that had inspired in the young man a vast respect and another sentiment that he realized upon better acquaintance might ripen into affection compton reminded him in many ways of his father and with the realization of that resemblance jimmy felt more and more ashamed of the part he was playing but now that he had gone into it he made up his mind that he would stick to it and there was besides the slight encouragement that he had derived from the enthusiasm of the girl who had suggested the idea to him and of her oftrepeated assertion relative to her hunch that he would make good     chapter xviii  the efficiency expert  unlike most other plants the international machine company paid on monday and it was on the monday following his assumption of his new duties that jimmy had his first clash with bince he had been talking with everett the cashier whom in accordance with his method he was studying from everett he had learned that it was payday and he had asked the cashier to let him see the payroll  i dont handle the payroll replied everett a trifle peevishly shortly after mr bince was made assistant general manager a new rule was promulgated to the effect that all salaries and wages were to be considered as confidential and that no one but the assistant general manager would handle the payrolls all i know is the amount of the weekly check he hires and fires everybody and pays everybody  rather unusual isnt it commented jimmy  very said everett heres some of us have been with mr compton since bince was in long clothes and then he comes in here and says that we are not to be trusted with the payroll  well said jimmy i shall have to go to him to see it then  he wont show it to you said everett  oh i guess he will said jimmy and a moment later he knocked at binces office door when bince saw who it was he turned back to his work with a grunt  i am sorry torrance he said but i cant talk with you just now im very busy  working on the payroll said jimmy  yes snarled bince  thats what i came in to see said the efficiency expert  impossible said bince  the international machine companys payroll is confidential absolutely confidential nobody sees it but me or mr compton if he wishes to  i understood from mr compton said jimmy that i was to have full access to all records  that merely applied to operation records said bince  it had nothing to do with the payroll  i should consider the payroll very closely allied to operations responded jimmy  i shouldnt said bince  you wont let me see it then demanded jimmy  look here said bince we agreed that we wouldnt interfere with each other i havent interfered with you now dont you interfere with me this is my work and my office is not being investigated by any efficiency expert or any one else  i dont recall that i made any such agreement said jimmy  i must insist on seeing that payroll  bince turned white with suppressed anger and then suddenly slamming his pen on the desk he wheeled around toward the other  i might as well tell you something he said that will make your path easier here if you know it i understand that you want a permanent job with us if you do you might as well understand now as any other time that you have got to be satisfactory to me of course it is none of your business but it may help you to understand conditions when i tell you that i am to marry mr comptons daughter and when i do that he expects to retire from business leaving me in full charge here now do you get me  jimmy had involuntarily acquired antipathy toward bince at their first meeting an antipathy which had been growing the more that he saw of the assistant general manager this fact coupled with binces present rather nasty manner was rapidly arousing the anger of the efficiency expert i didnt come in here he said to discuss your matrimonial prospects mr bince i came in here to see the payroll and you will oblige me by letting me see it  i tell you again said bince once and for all that you dont see the payroll nor anything else connected with my office and you will oblige me by not bothering me any longer as i told you when you first came in i am very busy  jimmy turned and left the room  he was on the point of going to comptons office and asking for authority to see the payroll and then it occurred to him that compton would probably not take sides against his assistant general manager and future soninlaw  ive got to get at it some other way said jimmy but you bet your life im going to get at it it looks to me as though theres something funny about that payroll  on his way out he stopped at everetts cage what was the amount of the check for the payroll for this week everett he asked  a little over ninetysix hundred dollars  thanks said jimmy and returned to the shops to continue his study of his men and as he studied them he asked many questions made many notes in his little notebook and always there were two questions that were the same what is your name what wages do you get  i guess said jimmy that in a short time i will know as much about the payroll as the assistant general manager  nor was it the payroll only that claimed jimmys attention he found that several handlings of materials could be eliminated by the adoption of simple changes and that a rearrangement of some of the machines removed the necessity for long hauls from one part of the shop to another after an evening with the little volume he had purchased for twentyfive cents in the secondhand bookshop he ordered changes that enabled him to cut five men from the payroll and at the same time do the work more expeditiously and efficiently  little book he said one evening i take my hat off to you you are the best twobits worth i ever purchased  the day following the completion of the changes he had made in the shop he was in comptons office  patton was explaining some of the changes you have made remarked compton patton was the shop foreman he said they were so simple that he wondered none of us had thought of them before i quite agree with him  so do i returned jimmy but then my whole method is based upon simplicity and his mind traveled to the unpretentious little book on the table in his room on indiana avenue  the feature that appeals to me most strongly is that you have been able to get the cooperation of the men continued compton thats what i fearedthat they wouldnt accept your suggestions how did you do it  i showed them how they could turn out more work and make more money by my plan this appealed to the pieceworkers i demonstrated to the others that the right way is the easiest wayi showed them how they could earn their wages with less effort  good said compton you are running into no difficulties then  is there any way in which i can help you  i am getting the best kind of cooperation from the men in the shop practically without exception replied jimmy although there is one fellow a straw boss named krovac who does not seem to take as kindly to the changes i have made as the others but he really doesnt amount to anything as an obstacle jimmy also thought of bince and the payroll but he was still afraid to broach the subject suddenly an inspiration came to him  yes he said i believe your accounting system could be improvedit will take me months to get around to it as my work is primarily in the shop at first at least you can save both time and money by having your books audited by a firm of public accountants who can also suggest a new and more uptodate system  not a bad idea said compton i think we will do it  for another halfhour they discussed jimmys work and then as the latter was leaving compton stopped him  by the way you dont happen to know of a good stenographer do you miss withe is leaving me saturday  jimmy thought a moment  instantly he thought of little eva and what she had said of her experience as a stenographer and her desire to abandon her present life for something in the line of her former work here was a chance to repay her in some measure for her kindness to him  yes he said i do know of a young lady who i believe could do the work shall i have her call on you  if you will please replied compton  as jimmy left the office compton rang for bince and when the latter came told him of his plan to employ a firm of accountants to renovate their entire system of bookkeeping  is that one of torrances suggestions asked bince  yes the idea is his replied compton and i think it is a good one  it seems to me said bince that torrance is balling things up sufficiently as it is without getting in other theorizers who have no practical knowledge of our business the result of all this will be to greatly increase our overhead by saddling us with a lot of redtape in the accounting department similar to that which torrance is loading the producing end with  i am afraid that you are prejudiced harold said compton  i cannot discover that torrance is doing anything to in any way complicate the shop work as a matter of fact a single change which he has just made has resulted in our performing certain operations in less time and to better advantage with five less men than formerly just in this one thing he has not only more than earned his salary but is really paying dividends on our investment  bince was silent for a moment  he had walked to the window and was looking out on the street below then he turned suddenly toward compton  mr compton he said you have made me assistant general manager here and now just when i am reaching a point where i feel i can accomplish something you are practically taking the authority out of my hands and putting it in that of a stranger i feel not only that you are making a grave mistake but that it is casting a reflection on my work it is making a difference in the attitude of the men toward me that i am afraid can never be overcome and consequently while lessening my authority it is also lessening my value to the plant i am going to ask you to drop this whole idea as assistant general manager i feel that it is working injury to the organization and i hope that before it is too latethat in fact immediately you will discharge torrance and drop this idea of getting outsiders to come in and install a new accounting system  youre altogether too sensitive harold replied compton it is no reflection on you whatsoever the system under which we have been working is with very few exceptions the very system that i evolved myself through years of experience in this business if there is any reflection upon any one it is upon me and not you you must learn to realize if you do not already what i realizethat no one is infallible just because the system is mine or yours we must not think that no better system can be devised i am perfectly satisfied with what mr torrance is doing and i agree with his suggestion that we employ a firm of accountants but i think no less of you or your ability on that account  bince saw that it was futile to argue the matter further  very well sir he said i hope that i am mistaken and that no serious harm will result when do you expect to start these accountants in  immediately replied compton  i shall get in touch with somebody today  bince shook his head dubiously as he returned to his own office     chapter xix  plotting  the following monday miss edith hudson went to work for the international machine company as mr comptons stenographer nor could the most fastidious have discovered aught to criticize in the appearance or deportment of little eva  the same day the certified public accountants came  mr harold bince appeared nervous and irritable and he would have been more nervous and more irritable had he known that jimmy had just learned the amount of the paycheck from everett and that he had discovered that although five men had been laid off and no new ones employed since the previous week the payroll check was practically the same as before approximately one thousand dollars more than his notebook indicated it should be  phew whistled jimmy these cpas are going to find this a more interesting job than they anticipated poor old compton i feel mighty sorry for him but he had better find it out now than after that grafter has wrecked his business entirely  that afternoon mr compton left the office earlier than usual complaining of a headache and the next morning his daughter telephoned that he was ill and would not come to the office that day during the morning as bince was walking through the shop he stopped to talk with krovac  pete krovac was a ratfaced little foreigner looked upon among the men as a troublemaker he nursed a perpetual grievance against his employer and his job and whenever the opportunity presented and sometimes when it did not present itself he endeavored to inoculate others with his dissatisfaction bince had hired the man and during the several months that krovac had been with the company the assistant general manager had learned enough from other workers to realize that the man was an agitator and a troublemaker several times he had been upon the point of discharging him but now he was glad that he had not for he thought he saw in him a type that in the light of present conditions might be of use to him  in fact for the past couple of weeks he had been using the man in an endeavor to get some information concerning torrance and his methods that would permit him to go to compton with a valid argument for jimmys discharge  well krovac he said as he came upon the man is torrance interfering with you any now  he hasnt got my job yet growled the other but hes letting out hardworking men with families without any reason the first thing you know youll have a strike on your hands  i havent heard any one else complaining said bince you will though replied krovac they dont any of us know when we are going to be canned to give compton more profit and men are not going to stand for that long  then said bince i take it that he really hasnt interfered with you much  oh hes always around asking a lot of fool questions said krovac last week he asked every man in the place what his name was and what wages he was getting wrote it all down in a little book i suppose he is planning on cutting pay  binces eyes narrowed  he got that information from every man in the shop he asked  yes replied krovac  bince was very pale  he stood in silence for some minutes apparently studying the man before him at last he spoke  krovac he said you dont like this man torrance do you  no said the other i dont  neither do i said bince i know his plans even better than you this shop has short hours and good pay but if we dont get rid of him it will have the longest hours and lowest pay of any shop in the city  well questioned krovac  i think said bince that there ought to be some way to prevent this man doing any further harm here  he looked straight into krovacs eyes  there is muttered the latter  it would be worth something of course suggested bince how much asked krovac  oh i should think it ought to be worth a hundred dollars replied bince  krovac thought for a moment  i think i can arrange it he said but i would have to have fifty now  i cannot give it to you here said bince but if i should happen to pass through the shop this afternoon you might find an envelope on the floor beside your machine after i have gone  the following evening as jimmy alighted from the indiana avenue car at eighteenth street two men left the car behind him he did not notice them although as he made his way toward his boardinghouse he heard footsteps directly in his rear and suddenly noting that they were approaching him rapidly he involuntarily cast a glance behind him just as one of the men raised an arm to strike at him with what appeared to be a short piece of pipe  jimmy dodged the blow and then both men sprang for him  the first one jimmy caught on the point of the chin with a blow that put its recipient out of the fight before he got into it and then his companion who was the larger succeeded in closing with the efficiency expert inadvertently however he caught jimmy about the neck leaving both his intended victims arms free with the result that the latter was able to seize his antagonist low down about the body and then pressing him close to him and hurling himself suddenly forward he threw the fellow backward upon the cement sidewalk with his own body on top with a resounding whack the attackers head came in contact with the concrete his arms relaxed their hold upon jimmys neck and as the latter arose he saw both his assailants temporarily at least out of the fighting  jimmy glanced hastily in both directions  there was no one in sight his boardinghouse was but a few steps away and two minutes later he was safe in his room  a year ago he thought to himself smiling my first thought would have been to have called in the police but the lizard has evidently given me a new viewpoint in regard to them for the latter had impressed upon jimmy the fact that whatever knowledge a policeman might have regarding one was always acquired with the idea that eventually it might be used against the person to whom it pertained  what a policeman dont know about you will never hurt you was one way that the lizard put it  when jimmy appeared in the shop the next morning he noted casually that krovac had a cut upon his chin but he did not give the matter a second thought bince had arrived late his first question as he entered the small outer office where mr comptons stenographer and his worked was addressed to miss edith hudson  is mr torrance down yet he asked  yes replied the girl he has been here some time  do you wish to see him  edith thought that the no which he snapped at her was a trifle more emphatic than the circumstances seemed to warrant nor could she help but notice after he had entered his office the vehement manner in which he slammed the door  i wonder whats eating him thought miss hudson to herself  of course he doesnt like jimmy but why is he so peeved because jimmy came to work this morningi dont quite get it  almost immediately bince sent for krovac and when the latter came and stood before his desk the assistant general manager looked up at him questioningly  well he asked  look at my chin was krovacs reply and he damn near killed the other guy  maybe youll have better luck the next time growled bince  there aint goin to be no next time asserted krovac i dont tackle that guy again  bince held out his hand  all right he said you might return the fifty then  return nothin growled krovac i sure done fifty dollars worth last night  come on said bince hand over the fifty  nothin doin said krovac with an angry snarl  it might be worth another fifty to you to know that i wasnt going to tell old man compton  you  damn  scoundrel  exclaimed bince  dont go callin me names admonished krovac  a fellow that hires another to croak a man for him for one hundred bucks aint got no license to call nobody names  bince realized only too well that he was absolutely in the power of the fellow and immediately his manner changed  come he said krovac there is no use in our quarreling  you can help me and i can help you there must be some other way to get around this  what are you trying to do asked krovac  i got enough on you now to send you up and i dont mind tellin yuh he added that i had a guy hid down there in the shop where he could watch you drop the envelope behind my machine i got a witness yuh understand  mr bince did understand but still he managed to control his temper  what of it he said nobody would believe your story but lets forget that what we want to do is get rid of torrance  that isnt all you want to do said krovac there is something else  bince realized that he was compromised as hopelessly already as he could be if the man had even more information  yes he said there is something beside torrances interference in the shop hes interfering with our accounting system and i dont want it interfered with just now  you mean the payroll asked krovac  it might be said bince  you want them two new guys that are working in the office croaked too asked krovac  i dont want anybody croaked replied bince i didnt tell you to kill torrance in the first place i just said i didnt want him to come back here to work  ah hell what you givin us growled the other i knew what you meant and you knew what you meant too come across straight what do you want  i want all the records of the certified public accountants who are working here said bince after a moments pause i want them destroyed together with the payroll records  where are they  they will all be in the safe in mr comptons office  krovac knitted his brows in thought for several moments say he said we can do the whole thing with one job  what do you mean asked bince  we can get rid of this torrance guy and get the records too  how asked bince do you know where feinheimers is  yes  well you be over there tonight about ten thirty and ill introduce you to a guy who can pull off this whole thing and you and i wont have to be mixed up in it at all  tonight at ten thirty said bince  at feinheimers said krovac     chapter xx  an invitation to dine  as the workman passed through the little outer office edith hudson glanced up at him  where she thought after he had gone have i seen that fellow before  jimmy was in the shop applying how to get more out of your factory to the problems of the international machine company when he was called to the telephone  is this mr torrance asked a feminine voice  it is replied jimmy  i am miss compton  my father will probably not be able to get to the office for several days and as he wishes very much to talk with you he has asked me to suggest that you take dinner with us this evening thank you said jimmy tell mr compton that i will come to the house right after the shop closes tonight  i suppose said elizabeth compton as she turned away from the phone that an efficiency expert is a very superior party and that his conversation will be far above my head  compton laughed  torrance seems to be a very likable chap he said and as far as his work is concerned he is doing splendidly  harold doesnt think so said elizabeth  he is terribly put out about the fellow he told me only the other night that he really believed that it would take years to overcome the bad effect that this man has had upon the organization and upon the work in general  that is all poppycock exclaimed compton rather more irritably than was usual with him for some reason harold has taken an unwarranted dislike to this man but i am watching him closely and i will see that no very serious mistakes are made  when jimmy arrived at the compton home he was ushered into the library where mr compton was sitting in a corner of the room with her back toward the door elizabeth compton sat reading she did not lay aside her book or look in his direction as jimmy entered for the man was in no sense a guest in the light of her understanding of the term he was merely one of her fathers employees here on business to see him doubtless a very ordinary sort of person whom she would of course have to meet when dinner was announced but not one for whom it was necessary to put oneself out in any way  mr compton rose and greeted jimmy cordially and then turned toward his daughter  elizabeth he said this is mr torrance the efficiency expert at the plant  leisurely miss compton laid aside her book  rising she faced the newcomer and as their eyes met jimmy barely stifled a gasp of astonishment and dismay elizabeth comptons arched brows raised slightly and involuntarily she breathed a low ejaculation efficiency expert  simultaneously there flashed through the minds of both in rapid succession a series of recollections of their previous meetings the girl saw the clerk at the stockingcounter the waiter at feinheimers the prizefighter at the training quarters and the milkwagon driver all these things passed through her mind in the brief instant of the introduction and her acknowledgment of it she was too wellbred to permit any outward indication of her recognition of the man other than the first almost inaudible ejaculation that had been surprised from her   the indifference she had felt prior to meeting the efficiency expert  was altered now to a feeling of keen interest as she realized that she  held the power to relieve bince of the further embarrassment of the  mans activities in the plant and also to save her father from the  annoyance and losses that bince had assured her would result from  torrances methods and so she greeted jimmy torrance pleasantly  almost cordially  i am delighted she said but i am afraid that i am a little awed too as i was just saying to father before you came that i felt an efficiency expert must be a very superior sort of person  if she placed special emphasis on the word superior it was so cleverly done that it escaped the notice of her father  oh not at all replied jimmy we efficiency experts are really quite ordinary people one is apt to meet us in any place that nice people are supposed to go  elizabeth felt the color rising slowly to her cheek  she realized then that if she had thrown down the gage of battle the young man had lost no time in taking it up  i am afraid she said that i do not understand very much about the nature or the purpose of your work but i presume the idea is to make the concern with which you are connected more prosperousmore successful  yes said her father that is the idea and even in the short time he has been with us mr torrance has effected some very excellent changes  it must be very interesting work commented the girl a profession that requires years of particular experience and study and i suppose one must be really thoroughly efficient and successful himself too before he can help to improve upon the methods of others or to bring them greater prosperity  quite true said jimmy whatever a man undertakes he should succeed in before he can hope to bring success to others  even in trifling occupations i presume suggested the girl efficiency methods are bestan efficiency expert could doubtlessly drive a milkwagon better than an ordinary person and she looked straight into jimmys eyes an unquestioned challenge in her own  unquestionably said jimmy  he could wait on table better too  or sell stockings suggested elizabeth  it was at this moment that mr compton was called to the telephone in an adjoining room and when he had gone the girl turned suddenly upon jimmy torrance there was no cordiality nor friendship in her expression a sneer upcurved her short upper lip  i do not wish to humiliate you unnecessarily in the presence of my father she said you have managed to deceive him into believing that you are what you claim to be mr bince has known from the start that you are incompetent and incapable of accomplishing the results father thinks you are accomplishing now that you know that i know you to be an impostor what do you intend to do  i intend to keep right on with my work in the plant miss compton replied jimmy  how long do you suppose father would keep you after i told him what i know of you do you think that he would for a moment place the future of his business in the hands of an exwaiter from feinheimersthat he would let a milkwagon driver tell him how to run his business  it probably might make a difference said jimmy if he knew but he will not knowlisten miss compton i have discovered some things there that i have not even dared as yet to tell your father the whole future of the business may depend upon my being there during the next few weeks if i wasnt sure of what i am saying i might consider acceding to your demands rather than to embarrass you with certain knowledge which i have  you refuse to leave then she demanded  i do he said  very well she replied i shall tell father when he returns to this room just what i know of you  will you tell him asked jimmy that you went to the training quarters of a prizefighter or that you dined unescorted at feinheimers at night and were an object of the insulting attentions of such a notorious character as steve murray  the girl flushed you would tell him that she demanded oh of course i might have known that you would it is difficult to realize that any one dining at my fathers home is not a gentleman i had forgotten for the moment  yes said jimmy i would tell him not from a desire to harm you but because this is the only way that i can compel you to refrain from something that would result in inestimable harm to your father     chapter xxi  jimmy tells the truth  mr compton returned to the room before  jimmy  had  discovered whether the girl intended to expose him or not she said nothing about the matter during dinner and immediately thereafter she excused herself leaving the two men alone  during the conversation that ensued jimmy discovered that bince had been using every argument at his command to induce compton to let him go as well as getting rid of the certified public accountants  i cant help but feel said compton that possibly there may be some reason in what mr bince says for he seems to feel more strongly on this subject than almost any question that has ever arisen in the plant wherein we differed and it may be that i am doing wrong to absolutely ignore his wishes in the matter  as a matter of fact mr torrance i have reached the point where i dont particularly relish a fight as i did in the past i would rather have things run along smoothly than to have this feeling of unrest and unpleasantness that now exists in the plant i do not say that you are to blame for it but the fact remains that ever since you came i have been constantly harassed by this same unpleasant condition which grows worse day by day there is no question but what you have accomplished a great deal for us of a practical nature but i believe in view of mr binces feelings in the matter that we had better terminate our arrangement  jimmy suddenly noted how old and tired his employer looked  he realized too that for a week he had been fighting an incipient influenza and that doubtless his entire mental attitude was influenced by the insidious workings of the disease one of the marked symptoms of which he knew to be a feeling of despondency and mental depression which sapped both courage and initiative  they were passing through the hallway from the diningroom to the library and as compton concluded what was equivalent to jimmys discharge he had stopped and turned toward the younger man they were standing near the entrance to the musicroom in which elizabeth chanced to be so that she overheard her fathers words and not without a smile of satisfaction and relief  mr compton replied jimmy no matter what you do with me you simply must not let those cpas go until they have completed their work i know something of what it is going to mean to your business but i would rather that the reports come from them than from me  what do you mean asked compton  i didnt want to be the one to tell you replied jimmy i preferred that the cpas discover it as they will within the next day or twoyou are being systematically robbed i suspected it before i had been there ten days and i was absolutely sure of it at the time i suggested you employ the cpas you are being robbed at the rate of approximately one thousand dollars a week  how asked compton  i would rather you would wait for the report of the cpas returned jimmy  i wish to know now said compton how i am being robbed  jimmy looked straight into the older mans eyes  through the payroll he replied  for a full minute compton did not speak  you may continue with your work in the plant he said at last and we will keep the accountants for a while at least and now i am going to ask you to excuse me i find that i tire very quickly since i have been threatened with influenza  jimmy bid his employer good night and mr compton turned into the library as the former continued along across the hall to the entrance he was putting on his overcoat when elizabeth compton emerged from the musicroom and approached him  i overheard your conversation with father she said it seems to me that you are making a deliberate attempt to cause him worry and apprehensionyou are taking advantage of his illness to frighten him into keeping you in his employ i should think you would be ashamed of yourself  i am sorry that you think that said jimmy  if it was not for your father and you i wouldnt have urged the matter at all  you are just doing it to hold your position retorted the girl and now by threats of blackmail you prevent me from exposing youyou are a despicable cur  jimmy felt the blood mounting to his face he was mortified and angry and yet he was helpless because his traducer was a woman unconsciously he drew himself to his full height  you will have to think about me as you please he said i cannot influence that but i want you to understand that you are not to interfere with my work i think we understand one another perfectly miss compton good night  and as he closed the door behind him he left a very angry young lady biting her lower lip and almost upon the verge of angry tears  the boor she exclaimed he dared to order me about and threaten me  the telephone interrupted her unhappy train of thoughts  it was bince  i am sorry elizabeth he said but i wont be able to come up this evening i have some important business to attend to how is your father  he seems very tired and despondent replied elizabeth that efficiency person was here to dinner he just left  she could not see the startled and angry expression of binces face as he received this information torrance was there he asked how did that happen  father asked him to dinner and when he wanted to discharge the fellow torrance told him something that upset father terribly and urged that he be kept a little while longer to which father agreed  what did he tell him asked bince  oh some alarmist tale about somebody robbing father  i didnt quite make out what it was all about but it had something to do with the payroll  bince went white dont believe anything that fellow says he exclaimed excitedly hes nothing but a crook elizabeth cant you make your father realize that he ought to get rid of the man that he ought to leave things to me instead of trusting an absolute stranger  i have replied the girl and he was on the point of doing it until torrance told him this story  something will have to be done said bince at once  ill be over to see your father in the morning goodby dear and he hung up the receiver  after jimmy left the compton home he started to walk downtown  it was too early to go to his dismal little room on indiana avenue the lizard was still away he had seen nothing of him for weeks and with his going he had come to realize that he had rather depended upon the lizard for company he was full of interesting stories of the underworld and his dry humor and strange philosophy amused and entertained jimmy  and now as he walked along the almost deserted drive after his recent unpleasant scene with elizabeth compton he felt more blue and lonely than he had for many weeks he craved human companionship and so strong was the urge that his thoughts naturally turned to the only person other than the lizard who seemed to have taken any particularly kindly interest in him acting on the impulse he turned west at the first cross street until he came to a drugstore entering a telephonebooth he called a certain number and a moment later had his connection  is that you edith he asked and at the affirmative reply this is jimmy torrance im feeling terribly lonesome i was wondering if i couldnt drag you out to listen to my troubles  surest thing you know cried the girl  where are you  he told her take a clark street car she told him and ill be at the corner of north avenue by the time you get there  as the girl hung up the receiver and turned from the phone a slightly quizzical expression reflected some thought that was in her mind i wonder she said as she returned to her room if he is going to be like the rest  she seated herself before her mirror and critically examined her reflection in the glass she knew she was goodlooking no need of a mirror to tell her that her youth and her good looks had been her stock in trade and yet this evening she appraised her features most critically and as with light fingers she touched her hair now in one place and now in another she found herself humming a gay little tune and she realized that she was very happy  when jimmy torrance alighted from the clark street car he found edith waiting for him  it was mighty good of you he said  i dont know when i have had such a fit of blues but i feel better already  what is the matter she asked  i just had a talk with mr compton he replied he sent for me and i had to tell him something that i didnt want to tell him although hes got to find it out sooner or later anyway  is there something wrong at the plant she asked  wrong doesnt describe it he exclaimed bitterly  the man that he has done the most for and in whose loyalty he ought to have the right of implicit confidence is robbing him blind  bince asked the girl  jimmy nodded  i didnt like that pill she said from the moment i saw him  nor i said jimmy but he is going to marry miss compton and inherit the business hes the last man in the place that compton would suspect it was just like suggesting to a man that his son was robbing him  have you got the goods on him asked edith  i will have as soon as the cpas get to digging into the payroll he replied and i just as good as got the information i need even without that well lets forget our troubles what shall we do  what do you want to do she asked  he could not tell by either her tone or expression with what anxiety she awaited his reply suppose we do something exciting like going to the movies he suggested with a laugh  that suits me all right said the girl  there is a dandy comedy down at the castle  and so they went to the picture show and when it was over he suggested that they have a bite to eat  ill tell you edith suggested  suppose we go to feinheimers restaurant and see if we cant get that table that i used to eat at when you waited on me they both laughed  if old feinheimer sees me he will have me poisoned said jimmy  not if you have any money to spend in his place  it was eleven thirty when they reached feinheimers  the table they wanted was vacant a little table in a corner of the room and furthest from the orchestra the waiter a new man did not know them and no one had recognized them as they entered  jimmy sat looking at the girls profile as she studied the menucard she was very pretty he had always thought her that but somehow tonight she seemed to be different even more beautiful than in the past he wished that he could forget what she had been and he realized as he looked at her sweet girlish face upon which vice had left no slightest impression to mark her familiarity with vice that it might be easy to forget her past and then between him and the face of the girl before him arose the vision of another face the face of the girl that he had set upon a pedestal and worshiped from afar and with the recollection of her came a realization of the real cause of his sorrow and depression earlier in the evening  he had attributed it to the unpleasant knowledge he had been forced to partially impart to her father and also in some measure to the regrettable interview he had had with her but now he knew that these were only contributory causes that the real reason was that during the months she had occupied his thoughts and in the few meetings he had had with her there had developed within him unknown to himself a sentiment for her that could be described by but one wordlove  always though he had realized that she was unattainable there must have lingered within his breast a faint spark of hope that somehow some time there would be a chance but after tonight he knew there could never be a chance she had openly confessed her contempt for him and how would she feel later when she realized that through his efforts her happiness was to be wrecked and the man she loved and was to marry branded as a criminal     chapter xxii  a letter from murray  the girl opposite him looked up from the card before her  the lines of her face were softened by the suggestion of a contented smile my gracious she exclaimed whats the matter now you look as though you had lost your last friend  jimmy quickly forced a smile to his lips  on the contrary he said i think ive found a regular friendin you  it was easy to see that his words pleased her  no continued jimmy i was thinking of what an awful mess i make of everything i tackle  youre not making any mess of this new job she said  youre making good you see my hunch was all right  i wish you hadnt had your hunch he said with a smile  its going to bring a lot of trouble to several people but now that im in it im going to stick to it to a finish  the girls eyes were wandering around the room taking in the faces of the diners about them suddenly she extended her hand and laid it on jimmys  for the love of mike she exclaimed  look over there  slowly jimmy turned his eyes in the direction she indicated  what do you know about that he ejaculated  steve murray and bince  and thick as thieves said the girl  naturally commented jimmy  the two men left the restaurant before edith and jimmy had finished their supper leaving the two hazarding various guesses as to the reason for their meeting  you can bet its for no good said the girl  ive known murray for a long while and i never knew him to do a decent thing in his life  their supper over they walked to clark street and took a northbound car but after alighting jimmy walked with the girl to the entrance of her apartment  i cant thank you enough he said for giving me this evening  it is the only evening i have enjoyed since i struck this town last july  he unlocked the outer door for her and was holding it open  it is i who ought to thank you she said  her voice was very low and filled with suppressed feeling i ought to thank you for this has been the happiest evening of my life and as though she could not trust herself to say more she entered the hallway and closed the door between them  as jimmy turned away to retrace his steps to the carline he found his mind suddenly in a whirl of jumbled emotions for he was not so stupid as to have failed to grasp something of the significance of the girls words and manner  hell he muttered  look what ive done now  the girl hurried to her room and turned on the lights and again she seated herself before her mirror and for a moment sat staring at the countenance reflected before her she saw lips parted to rapid breathing lips that curved sweetly in a happy smile and then as she sat there looking she saw the expression of the face before her change the lips ceased to smile the soft brown eyes went wide and staring as though in sudden horror for a moment she sat thus and then throwing her body forward upon her dressingtable she buried her face in her arms  my god she cried through choking sobs  mason compton was at his office the next morning contrary to the pleas of his daughter and the orders of his physician bince was feeling more cheerful murray had assured him that there was a way out he would not tell bince what the way was  just leave it to me he said  the less you know the better off youll be what you want is to get rid of this fresh guy and have all the papers in a certain vault destroyed you see to it that only the papers you want destroyed are in that vault and ill do the rest  all of which relieved mr harold binces elastic conscience of any feeling of responsibility in the matter whatever murray did was no business of his he was glad that murray hadnt told him  he greeted jimmy torrance almost affably but he lost something of his selfcomposure when mason compton arrived at the office for bince had been sure that his employer would be laid up for at least another week during which time murray would have completed his work  the noon mail brought a letter from murray  show the enclosed to compton it read tell him you found it on your desk and destroy this letter the enclosure was a crudely printed note on a piece of soiled wrappingpaper                          treat your men right or                       suffer the consequences                               i w w    bince laid murrays letter face down upon the balance of the open mail and sat for a long time looking at the ominous words of the enclosure at first he was inclined to be frightened but finally a crooked smile twisted his lips murrays not such a fool after all he soliloquized  hes framing an alibi before he starts  with the note in his hand bince entered comptons office where he found the latter dictating to edith hudson look at this thing exclaimed bince laying the note before compton what do you suppose it means  compton read it and his brows knitted have the men been complaining at all he asked  recently i have heard a little grumbling  replied bince  they havent taken very kindly to torrances changes and i guess some of them are afraid they are going to lose their jobs as they know he is cutting down the force in order to cut costs  he ought to know about this said compton  wait ill have him in and he pressed a button on his desk a moment later jimmy entered and compton showed him the note  what do you think of it asked compton  i doubt if it amounts to much replied jimmy  the men have no grievance it may be the work of some fellow who was afraid of his job but i doubt if it really emanates from any organized scheme of intimidation if i were you sir i would simply ignore it  to jimmys surprise bince agreed with him  it was the first time that bince had agreed with anything jimmy had suggested  very well assented compton but well preserve this bit of evidence in case we may need it later and he handed the slip of paper to edith hudson file this please miss hudson he said and then turning to bince  it may be nothing but i dont like the idea of it  there is apt to be something underlying this or even if it is only a single individual and he happens to be a crank he could cause a lot of trouble suppose for instance one of these crackbrained foreigners in the shop got it into his head that torrance here was grinding him down in order to increase our profits why he might attack him at any time i tell you we have got to be prepared for such a contingency especially now that we have concrete evidence that there is such a man in our employ i think you ought to be armed mr torrance have you a pistol  jimmy shook his head negatively  no sir he said not here  compton opened a desk drawer  take this one he said and handed jimmy an automatic  the latter smiled  really mr compton he said i dont believe i need such an article  i want you to take it insisted compton  i want you to be on the safe side  a moment later bince and jimmy left the office together  jimmy still carried the pistol in his hand  youd better put that thing in your pocket cautioned bince  they were in the small office on which comptons and binces offices opened and jimmy had stopped beside the desk that had been placed there for him  i think ill leave it here he said the thing would be a nuisance in my pocket and he dropped it into one of the desk drawers while bince continued his way toward the shop  compton was looking through the papers and letters on his desk evidently searching for something which he could not find while the girl sat waiting for him to continue his dictation  thats funny commented compton  i was certain that that letter was here  have you seen anything of a letter from mosher  no sir replied edith  well i wish you would step into mr binces office and see if it is on his desk  upon the assistant general managers desk lay a small pile of papers face down which edith proceeded to examine in search of the mosher letter she had turned them all over at once commencing at what had previously been the bottom of the pile so that she ran through them all without finding the mosher letter before she came to murrays epistle  as its import dawned upon her her eyes widened at first in surprise and then narrowed as she realized the value of her discovery at first she placed the letter back with the others just as she had found them but on second thought she took it up quickly and folding it slipped it inside her waist then she returned to comptons office  i cannot find the mosher letter she said     chapter xxiii  laid up  harriet holden was sitting in elizabeths boudoir  and he had the effrontery the latter was saying to tell me what i must do and must not do the idea a miserable little milkwagon driver dictating to me  miss holden smiled  i should not call him very little she remarked  i didnt mean physically retorted elizabeth  it is absolutely insufferable i am going to demand that father discharge the man  and suppose he asks you why asked harriet  you will tell him of course that you want this person discharged because he protected you from the insults and attacks of a ruffian while you were dining in feinheimers at nightis that it  you are utterly impossible harriet cried elizabeth stamping her foot you are as bad as that efficiency person but then i might have expected it you have always it seems to me shown a great deal more interest in the fellow than necessary and probably the fact that harold doesnt like him is enough to make you partial toward him for you have never tried to hide the fact that you dont like harold  if youre going to be cross said harriet i think i shall go home  at about the same time the lizard entered feinheimers  in the far corner of the room murray was seated at a table the lizard approached and sat down opposite him here i am he said what do you want and how did you know i was in town  i didnt know said murray  i got a swell job for you and so i sent out word to get you  youre in luck then said the lizard i just blew in this morning what kind of a job you got  murray explained at length  they got a watchman he concluded but ive got a guy on de inside thatll fix him  when do i pull this off asked the lizard  in about a week  ill let you know the night later  dey ordinarily draw the payroll money monday the same day dey pay but dis week theyll draw it saturday and leave it in the safe itll be layin on top of a bunch of books and papers deyre de tings youre to destroy as i told you it will all be fixed from de inside deres no danger of a pinch all you gotta do is crack de safe put about a four or five tousand dollar roll in your pocket and as you cross de river drop a handful of books and papers in nothin to itits the easiest graft you ever had  youre sure dats all asked the lizard  sure thing replied murray  wheres de place  dat i cant tell you until the day were ready to pull off de job  at four oclock that afternoon jimmy torrance collapsed at his desk the flu had struck him as suddenly and as unexpectedly as it had attacked many of its victims edith hudson found him and immediately notified mr compton with the result that half an hour later jimmy torrance was in a small private hospital in park avenue  that night bince got murray over the phone  he told him of jimmys sickness  hes balled up the whole plan he complained  weve either got to wait until he croaks or is out again before we can go ahead unless something else arises to make it necessary to act before i think i can hold things off though at this end all right  for four or five days jimmy was a pretty sick man  he was allowed to see no one but even if jimmy had been in condition to give the matter any thought he would not have expected to see any one for who was there to visit him in the hospital who was there who knew of his illness to care whether he was sick or well alive or dead it was on the fifth day that jimmy commenced to take notice of anything at comptons orders he had been placed in a private room and given a special nurse and today for the first time he learned of mr comptons kindness and the fact that the nurse was instructed to call jimmys employer twice a day and report the patients condition  mighty nice of him thought jimmy and then to the nurse and the flowers too does he send those  the young woman shook her head negatively  no she said a young lady comes every evening about six and leaves the flowers she always asks about your condition and when she may see you  jimmy was silent for some time  she comes every evening he asked  yes replied the nurse  may i see her this evening asked jimmy  well ask the doctor she replied and the doctor must have given consent for at six oclock that evening the nurse brought edith hudson to his bedside  the girl came every evening thereafter and sat with jimmy as long as the nurse would permit her to remain jimmy discovered during those periods a new side to her character a mothering tenderness that filled him with a feeling of content and happiness the moment that she entered the room and which doubtless aided materially in his rapid convalescence for until she had been permitted to see him jimmy had suffered as much from mental depression as from any other of the symptoms of his disease  he had felt utterly alone and uncared for and in this mental state he had brooded over his failures to such an extent that he had reached a point where he felt that death would be something of a relief militating against his recovery had been the parting words of elizabeth compton the evening that he had dined at her fathers home but now all that was very nearly forgottenat least crowded into the dim vistas of recollection by the unselfish friendship of this girl of the streets  jimmys nurse quite fell in love with edith  she is such a sweet girl she said and always so cheerful  she is going to make some one a mighty good wife and she smiled knowingly at jimmy  the suggestion which her words implied came to jimmy as a distinct shock he had never thought of edith hudson in the light of this suggestion and now he wondered if there could be any such sentiment as it implied in ediths heart but finally he put the idea away with a shrug  impossible he thought she thinks of me as i think of her only as a good friend     chapter xxiv  in the toils  at the office of the international machine company the work of the cpas was drawing to a close their report would soon be ready to submit to mr compton and as the time approached binces nervousness and irritability increased edith noticed that he inquired each day with growing solicitude as to the reports from the hospital relative to jimmys condition she knew that bince disliked jimmy and yet the man seemed strangely anxious for his recovery and return to work  in accordance with jimmys plan the cpas were to give out no information to any one even to mr compton until their investigation and report were entirely completed this plan had been approved by mr compton although he professed to be at considerable loss to understand why it was necessary it was however in accordance with jimmys plan to prevent if possible any interference with the work of the auditors until every available fact in the case had been ascertained and recorded  in the investigation of the payroll bince had worked diligently with the accountants as a matter of fact he had never left them a moment while the payroll records were in their hands and had gone to much pain to explain in detail every question arising therefrom  although the investigators seemed to accept his statements at their face value the assistant general manager was far from being assured that their final report would redound to his credit  on a thursday they informed him that they had completed their investigation and the report would be submitted to mr compton on saturday  when edith reached the hospital that evening she found jimmy in high spirits he was dressed for the first time and assured her that he was quite able to return to work if the doctor would let him but the nurse shook her head you ought to stay here for another week or ten days she admonished him  nothing doing cried jimmy  ill be out of here monday at the latest but when edith told him that the cpas had finished and that their report would be handed in saturday jimmy announced that he would leave the hospital the following day  but you cant do it said the nurse  why not asked jimmy  the doctor wont permit it  edith tried to dissuade him but he insisted that it was absolutely necessary for him to be at the office when the cpas report was made  ill be over there friday evening or saturday morning at the latest he said as she bid him goodbye  and so it was that despite the pleas of his nurse and the orders of his physician jimmy appeared at the plant friday afternoon bince greeted him almost effusively and mr compton seemed glad to see him out again  that evening harold bince met murray at feinheimers and still later the lizard received word that murray wanted to see him  everythings ready the boss explained to the lizard the whole things framed for tomorrow night the watchman was discharged today another man is supposed to have been hired to take the job but of course he wont show up you meet me here at seven thirty tomorrow night and ill give you your final instructions and tell you how to get to the plant the cpas were slow in completing their report at noon on saturday it looked very much to bince that there would be no report ready before monday he had spent most of the forenoon pacing his office and at last unable longer to stand the strain he had announced that he was going out to his country club for a game of golf  he returned to his downtown club about dinnertime and at eight oclock he called up elizabeth compton  come on up said the girl im all alone this evening  father went back to the office to examine some reports that were just finished up late this afternoon  ill be over said bince as soon as i dress if there was any trace of surprise or shock in his tones the girl failed to notice it  at ten oclock that night a figure moved silently through the dark shadows of an alleyway in the area of the international machine companys plant on west superior street as he moved along he counted the basement windows silently and at the fifth window he halted just a casual glance he cast up and down the alley and then kneeling he raised the sash and slipped quietly into the darkness of the basement  at about the same time jimmys landlady called him to the telephone where a mans voice asked if this was mr torrance assured that such was the fact the voice continued i am the new watchman at the plant theres something wrong here i cant get hold of mr compton i think you better come down ill be in mr comptons office the message ceased as though central had disconnected them  funny thought jimmy that he should call me up i wonder what the trouble can be but he lost no time in getting his hat and starting for the works  although the lizard knew that there was no danger of detection yet from long habit he moved through the plant of the international machine company with the noiselessness of a disembodied spirit occasionally and just for the briefest instant he flashed his lamp ahead of him but though he had never been in the place before he found it scarcely necessary so minute had been his instructions for reaching the office from the fifth basement window  the room he sought was on the second floor and the lizard had mounted the steps from the basement to the first floor when he was brought to a sudden stop by a noise from the floor above him the lizard listened intently no he could not be mistaken too often had he heard a similar sound  some one was tiptoeing across the floor above  the lizard was in the hallway close beside the stairs when he realized the footsteps were coming toward the stairway and a moment later that they were cautiously descending the lizard flattened himself against the wall and if he breathed his lungs gave forth no sound  if one may interpret footstepsand the lizard from the fund of a great experience felt that he couldthose descending the stairway from above him might have been described as nervous and repressed for at least they gave the lizard the impression of one who desired to flee in haste and yet dared not do so for fear of attracting attention by the increased noise that greater speed might entail  at least the lizard knew that those were the footsteps of no watchman but whether it be guardian of the law or fellow criminal the lizard had no wish to be discovered he wondered what had gone wrong with murrays plans and suddenly imbued with the natural suspicion of the criminal it occurred to him that the whole thing might be a frameup to get him and yet why murray should wish to get him he could not imagine he ran over in his mind a list of all those who might feel enmity toward him but among them all the lizard could cast upon none who might have sufficient against him to warrant such an elaborate scheme of revenge  the footsteps passed him and continued on toward the foot of the stairs where was the main entrance which opened upon the street at the door the footsteps halted and as the lizards eyes bored through the darkness in the direction of the other prowler the latter struck a match upon the panel of the door and lighted a cigarette revealing his features momentarily but distinctly to the watcher in the shadow of the stairway then he opened the door and passed out into the night  the lizard listening intently for a few moments to assure himself that there was no one else above and that the man who had just departed was not returning at last continued his way to the foot of the stairs which he ascended to the second floor passing through the outer office he paused a moment before the door to comptons private office and then silently turning the knob he gently pushed the door open and stepped into the room  beyond the threshold he halted and pressed the button of his flashlamp for just an instant its faint rays illumined the interior of the room and then darkness blotted out the scene but whatever it was that the little flashlamp had revealed was evidently in the nature of a surprise and perhaps something of a shock to the lizard for he drew back with a muttered oath backed quietly out of the room closed the door after him and moving much more swiftly than he had entered retraced his steps to the fifth window on the alley and was gone from the scene with whatever job he had contemplated unexecuted  a halfhour later detective headquarters at the central station received an anonymous tip send some one to the office of the international machine company on the second floor of west superior street  it was ten thirty when jimmy reached the plant  he entered the front door with his own latchkey pressed the button which lighted the stairway and the landing above and ascending went straight to mr comptons office turned the knob and opened the door to find that the interior was dark   strange he thought that after sending for me the fellow didnt  wait as these thoughts passed through his mind he fumbled on the wall  for the switch and finding it flooded the office with light  as he turned again toward the room he voiced a sudden exclamation of horror for on the floor beside his desk lay the body of mason compton as jimmy stepped quickly toward comptons body and kneeled beside it a man tiptoed quietly up the front stairway while another having ascended from the rear was crossing the outer office with equal stealth  jimmy felt of comptons face and hands  they were warm  and then he placed his ear close against the mans breast in order to see if he could detect the beating of the heart he was in this position when he was startled by a gruff voice behind him  put em up it admonished curtly and jimmy turned to see two men standing in the doorway with pistols leveled at him     chapter xxv  circumstantial evidence  at first jimmy thought they were the perpetrators of the deed but almost immediately he recognized one of them as odonnell the erstwhile traffic officer who had been promoted to a detective sergeancy since jimmy had first met him  compton has been murdered said jimmy dully he is dead  put up your hands snapped odonnell for the second time and be quick about it  it was then for the first time that jimmy realized the meaning that might be put upon his presence alone in the office with his dead employer odonnells partner searched him but found no weapon upon him  wheres the gat he asked  whoever did this probably took it with him said jimmy find the watchman  they made jimmy sit down in a corner and while one of them guarded him the other called up central made his report and asked for an ambulance and the wagon then odonnell commenced to examine the room a moment later he found an automatic behind the door across the room from where comptons body lay  ever see this before asked odonnell holding the pistol up to jimmy  if youre asking me if its mine no said jimmy  i have a gun but its home i never carry it i didnt do this odonnell he continued there was no reason why i should do it so instead of wasting your time on me while the murderer escapes youd better get busy on some other theory too it wont do any harm anyway  the wagon came and took jimmy to the station and later he was questioned by the lieutenant in charge  you say this is not your pistol asked the police officer  it is not replied jimmy  you never saw it before  no i have not  the lieutenant turned to one of his men who went to the door and opening it returned almost immediately with bince  do you know this man mr bince asked the lieutenant  i certainly do said bince  did you ever see this pistol before  bince took the weapon and examined it  yes he said  under what circumstances asked the lieutenant  it was one of two that mr compton had in his desk  this one he loaned to torrance two or three weeks ago i was in the office at the time  the officer turned toward jimmy  now do you recognize it he asked  i havent denied said jimmy that mr compton had loaned me a pistol as a matter of fact i had forgotten all about it i do not particularly recognize this one as the weapon he loaned me though it is of the same type there is no way that i could identify the particular weapon he handed me  but you admit he loaned you one  yes said jimmy  what did you do with it asked the policeman  i put it in my desk within five minutes after he gave it to me and i havent seen it since  you say you couldnt identify the pistol said the officer  jimmy nodded  well we can and have  the number of this pistol was recorded when mr compton bought it as was the number of the other one which is still in his desk they were the only two pistols he ever bought according to mr bince and his daughter aside from one which he had at home which has also been accounted for the drawer in which mr bince saw you place this pistol we found open and the pistol gone it looks pretty bad for you young fellow and if you want a chance to dodge the rope youd better plead guilty and tell us why you did it  jimmy was given little opportunity for sleep that night  a halfdozen times he was called back to the lieutenants office for further questioning he commenced to realize that the circumstantial evidence was strongly against him and now as the girl had warned him his entirely innocent past was brought up against him simply because his existence had been called to the attention of a policeman and the same policeman an inscrutable fate had ordained should discover him alone with a murdered man  odonnell made the most of his meager knowledge of jimmy  he told the lieutenant with embellishments of jimmys association with such characters as the lizard and little eva but the police were still at a loss to discover a motive  this however was furnished the next morning when elizabeth compton white and heavyeyed was brought to the station to identify jimmy there was deep compassion in the young mans face as he was ushered into the presence of the stricken girl while at sight of him hers mirrored horror contempt and hatred  you know this man asked the lieutenant  yes she replied his name is torrance  i have seen him a number of times in the past year he worked as a clerk in a store in the hosiery department and waited on me there later ishe hesitatedi saw him in a place called feinheimers he was a waiter then he was a sparring partner i think they call it for a prizefighter some of my friends took me to a gymnasium to see the fighter training and i recognized this man  i saw him again when he was driving a milkwagon  he  delivered milk at a friends house where i chanced to be the last time i saw him was at my fathers home he had obtained employment in my fathers plant as an efficiency expert he seemed to exercise some strange power over father who believed implicitly in him until recently when he evidently commenced to have doubts for the night that the man was at our house i was sitting in the musicroom when they passed through the hallway and i heard father discharge him but the fellow pleaded to be retained and finally father promised to keep him for a while longer as i recall it at least until certain work was completed at the plant this work was completed yesterday thats all i know i do not know whether father discharged him again or not  harriet holden had accompanied her friend to the police station and was sitting close beside her during the examination her eyes almost constantly upon the face of the prisoner she saw no fear there only an expression of deepseated sorrow for her friend  the lieutenant was still asking questions when there came a knock at the door which was immediately opened revealing odonnell with a young woman whom he brought inside  i guess were getting to the bottom of it announced the sergeant look who i found workin over there as comptons stenographer  well who is she demanded the lieutenant  a jane who used to hang out at feinheimers  she has been runnin around with this bird they tell me over there that compton hired her on this fellows recommendation get hold of the lizard now and youll have the whole bunch  thus did sergeant patrick odonnell solve the entire mystery with sherlockian ease and despatch  at jimmys preliminary hearing he was held to the grand jury and on the strength of the circumstantial evidence against him that body voted a true bill edith hudson against whom there was no evidence of any nature was held as a witness for the state and a net was thrown out for the lizard which dragged in nearly every pickpocket in town except the man they sought  jimmy had been in jail for about a week when he received a visitor  a turnkey brought her to his cell it was harriet holden she greeted him seriously but pleasantly and then she asked the turnkey if she might go inside  its against the rules miss he said but i guess it will be all right he recalled that the sheriff had said that the girls father was a friend of his and so assumed that it would be safe to relax the rules in her behalf he had been too long an employee of the county not to know that rules are often elastic to the proper pressure  i have been wanting to talk to you said the girl to jimmy ever since this terrible thing happened somehow i can not believe that you are guilty and there must be some way in which you can prove your innocence  i have been trying to think out how i might said jimmy but the more i think about it the more damning the circumstantial evidence against me appears  there must always be a motive for a crime like that said harriet  i cannot believe that a simple fear of his discharge would be sufficient motive for any man to kill his employer  not to kill a man who had been as good to me as mr compton was said jimmy or a man whom i admired so much as i did him as a matter of fact he was not going to discharge me miss holden and i had an opportunity there for a very successful future but now that he is dead there is no one who could verify such a statement on my part  who could there be then who might wish to kill him and what could the motive be  i can only think said jimmy of one man and even in his case the idea is too horribletoo preposterous to be entertained  harriet holden looked up at him quickly a sudden light in her eyes and an expression of almost horrified incredulity upon her face you dont mean she started  i wouldnt even use his name in connection with the thought jimmy interrupted but he is the only man of whom i know who could have profited by mr comptons death and on the other hand whose entire future would have been blasted possibly had mr compton lived until the following morning  the girl remained for half an hour longer and when she left she went directly to the home of elizabeth compton  i told you elizabeth she said that i was going to see mr torrance you dissuaded me for some time but i finally went today and i am glad that i went no one except yourself could have loved your father more than i or have been more horrified or grieved at his death but that is no reason why you should aid in the punishment of an innocent man as i am confident that this man torrance is and i tell you elizabeth if you were not prejudiced you would agree with me  i have talked with torrance for over half an hour today and since then nothing can ever make me believe that that man could commit a coldblooded murder harold has always hated himyou admit that yourselfand now you are permitting him to prejudice you against the man purely on the strength of that dislike i am going to help him im going to do it not only to obtain justice for him but to assist in detecting and punishing the true murderer  i dont see harriet how you can take any interest in such a creature said elizabeth you know from the circumstances under which we saw him before father employed him what type of man he is and it was further exemplified by the evidence of his relationship with that common woman of the streets  he told me about her today replied harriet he had only known her very casually but she helped him onceloaned him some money when he needed itand when he found that she had been a stenographer and wanted to give up the life she had been leading and be straight again he helped her  i asked sergeant odonnell particularly about that and even he had to admit that there was no evidence whatever to implicate the girl or show that the relations between her and mr torrance had been anything that was not right and you know yourself how anxious odonnell has been to dig up evidence of any kind derogatory to either of them  how are you going to help him asked elizabeth  take flowers and cake to him in jail  there was a sneer on her face and on her lips if he cares for flowers and cakes replied harriet i probably shall but i have another plan which will probably be more practical     chapter xxvi  the only friends he has  so it befell that the next day a wellknown criminal attorney called on jimmy torrance at the county jail i understand he said to jimmy that you have retained no attorney i have been instructed by one of my clients to take your case  jimmy looked at him in silence for a moment  who is going to pay you he asked with a smile  i understand attorneys expect to be paid  that neednt worry you replied the lawyer  you mean that your client is going to pay for my defense  whats his name  that i am not permitted to tell you replied the lawyer  very well  tell your client that i appreciate his kindness but i cannot accept it  dont be a fool said the attorney this client of mine can well afford the expense and anyway my instructions are to defend you whether you want me to or not so i guess you cant help yourself  jimmy laughed with the lawyer all right he said the first thing i wish youd do is to get miss hudson out of jail there is doubtless some reason for suspicion attaching to me because i was found alone with mr comptons body and the pistol with which he was shot was one that had been given to me and which i kept in my desk but there is no earthly reason why she should be detained she could have had absolutely nothing to do with it  i will see what can be done replied the attorney although i had no instructions to defend her also  i will make that one of the conditions under which i will accept your services said jimmy  the result was that within a few days edith was released  from the moment that she left the jail she was aware that she was being shadowed  i suppose she thought that they expect to open up a fund of new clues through me but she was disturbed nevertheless because she realized that it was going to make difficult a thing that she had been trying to find some means to accomplish ever since she had been arrested  she went directly to her apartment and presently took down the telephonereceiver and after calling a public phone in a building downtown she listened intently while the operator was getting her connection and before the connection was made she hung up the receiver with a smile for she had distinctly heard the sound of a mans breathing over the line and she knew that in all probability odonnell had tapped in immediately on learning that she had been released from jail  that evening she attended a local motionpicture theater which she often frequented it was one of those small affairs the width of a city block with a narrow aisle running down either side and an emergency exit upon the alley at the far end of each aisle the theater was darkened when she entered and a quick glance apprizing her that no one followed her in immediately she continued on down one of the side aisles and passed through the doorway into the alley  five minutes later she was in a telephonebooth in a drugstore two blocks away  is this feinheimers she asked after she had got her connection i want to talk to carl she asked for carl because she knew that this man who had been headwaiter at feinheimers for years would know her voice  is that you carl she asked as a mans voice finally answered the telephone this is little eva  oh hello said the man i thought you were over at the county jail  i was released today she explained  well listen carl ive got to see the lizard ive simply got to see him tonight i was being shadowed but i got away from them do you know where he is  i guess i could find him said carl in a low voice you go out to mother krugers ill tell him youll be there in about an hour  ill be waiting in a taxi outside said the girl  good said carl if he isnt there in an hour you can know that he was afraid to come hes layin pretty low  all right said the girl ill be there  you tell him that he simply must come she hung up the receiver and then called a taxi she gave a number on a side street about a half block away where she knew it would be reasonably dark and consequently less danger of detection  threequarters of an hour later her taxi drew up beside mother krugers but the girl did not alight she had waited but a short time when another taxi swung in beside the roadhouse turned around and backed up alongside hers a man stepped out and peered through the glass of her machine it was the lizard  recognizing the girl he opened the door and took a seat beside her well inquired the lizard whats on your mind  jimmy replied the girl  i thought so  returned the lizard  it looks pretty bad for him dont it i wish there was some way to help him  he did not do it said the girl  it didnt seem like him said the lizard but i got it straight from a guy who knows that he done it all right  who asked edith  murray  i thought he knew a lot about it said the girl thats why i sent for you you havent got any love for murray have you  no replied the lizard not so you could notice it  i think murray knows a lot about that job  if you want to help jimmy i know where you can get the dope that will start something anyway  what is it asked the lizard  this fellow bince who is assistant general manager for compton got a letter from murray two or three weeks before compton was killed murray enclosed a threat signed iww and his letter instructed bince to show the threat to compton i havent got all the dope on it but ive got a hunch that in some way it is connected with this job anyway ive got both murrays letter and the threat he enclosed theyre hidden in my desk at the plant i cant get them of course they wouldnt let me in the place now and murrays so strong with the police that i wouldnt trust them so i havent told any one what i want is for you to go there tonight and get them  the lizard was thinking fast  the girl knew nothing of his connection with the job she did not know that he had entered comptons office and had been first to find his dead body in fact no one knew that even murray did not know that the lizard had succeeded in entering the plant as the latter had told him that he was delayed and that when he reached there a patrol and ambulance were already backed up in front of the building he felt that he had enough knowledge however to make the conviction of jimmy a very difficult proposition but if he divulged the knowledge he had and explained how he came by it he could readily see that suspicion would be at once transferred from jimmy to himself  the lizard therefore was in a quandary  of course if murrays connection was ever discovered the lizard might then be drawn into it but if he could keep murray out the lizard would be reasonably safe from suspicion and now the girl had shown him how he might remove a damaging piece of evidence against murray  you will get it wont you asked the girl  where are these papers he asked  they are in the outer office which adjoins mr comptons  my desk stands at the right of the door as you enter from the main office remove the righthand lower drawer and you will find the papers lying on the little wooden partition directly underneath the drawer  all right said the lizard ill get them  bless you lizard cried the girl i knew you would help you and i are the only friends he has if we went back on him hed be sent up for theres lots of money being used against him he might even be hanged i know from what i have heard that the prosecuting attorney intends to ask for the death penalty  the lizard made no reply as he started to leave the taxi  take them to his attorney said the girl and she gave him the name and address  the lizard grunted and entered his own cab  as he did so a man on a motorcycle drew up on the opposite side and peered through the window the driver had started his motor as the newcomer approached from her cab the girl saw the lizard and the man on the motorcycle look into each others face for a moment then she heard the lizards quick admonition to his driver beat it bo  a sharp halt came from the man on the motorcycle but the taxicab leaped forward and accelerating rapidly turned to the left into the road toward the city the girl had guessed at the first glance that the man on the motorcycle was a police officer as the lizards taxi raced away the officer circled quickly and started in pursuit no chance thought the girl hell get caught sure she could hear the staccato reports from the open exhaust of the motorcycle diminishing rapidly in the distance indicating the speed of the pursued and the pursuer  and then from the distance came a shot and then another and another she leaned forward and spoke to her own driver go on to elmhurst she said and then come back to the city on the st charles road  it was after two oclock in the morning when the lizard entered an apartment on ashland avenue which he had for several years used as a hidingplace when the police were hot upon his trail the people from whom he rented the room were eminently respectable jews who thought their occasional roomer what he represented himself to be a special agent for one of the federal departments a vocation which naturally explained the lizards long absences and unusual hours  once within his room the lizard sank into a chair and wiped the perspiration from his forehead although it was by no means a warm night he drew a folded paper from his inside pocket which when opened revealed a small piece of wrapping paper within they were murrays letter to bince and the enclosure  believe me muttered the lizard that was the toughest job i ever pulled off and all i gets is two pieces of paper but i dont know but what theyre worth it  he sat for a long time looking at the papers in his hand but he did not see them he was thinking of other things of prison walls that he had eluded so far through years of crime of odonnell whom he knew to be working on the compton case and whose boast it had been that sooner or later he would get the lizard of what might naturally be expected were the papers in his hands to fall into the possession of torrances attorney it would mean that murray would be immediately placed in jeopardy and the lizard knew murray well enough to know that he would sacrifice his best friend to save himself and the lizard was by no means murrays best friend  he realized that he knew more about the compton murder case than any one else he was of the opinion that he could clear it up if he were almost any one other than the lizard but with the record of his past life against him would any one believe him in order to prove his assertion it would be necessary to make admissions that might incriminate himself and there would be murray and the compton millions against him and as he pondered these things there ran always through his mind the words of the girl you and i are the only friends he has  hell ejaculated the lizard as he rose from his chair and prepared for bed     chapter xxvii  the trial  edith hudson spent a restless night and early in the morning as early as she thought she could reach him she called the office of jimmys attorney she told the lawyer that some new evidence was to have been brought in to him and asked if he had received it receiving a negative reply she asked that she be called the moment it was brought in  all that day and the next she waited scarcely leaving her room for fear that the call might come while she was away the days ran into weeks and still there was no word from the lizard  jimmy was brought to trial and she saw him daily in the courtroom and as often as they would let her she would visit him in jail on several occasions she met harriet holden also visiting him and she saw that the other young woman was as constant an attendant at court as she  the state had established as unassailable a case as might be built on circumstantial evidence krovac had testified that torrance had made threats against compton in his presence and there was no way in which jimmys attorneys could refute the perjured statement jimmy himself had come to realize that his attorney was fighting now for his life that the verdict of the jury was already a foregone conclusion and that the only thing left to fight for now was the question of the penalty  daily he saw in the courtroom the faces of the three girls who had entered so strangely into his life he noticed with not a little sorrow and regret that elizabeth compton and harriet holden always sat apart and that they no longer spoke he saw the effect of the strain of the long trial on edith hudson she looked wan and worried and then finally she was not in court one day and later through harriet holden he learned that she was confined to her room with a bad cold  jimmys sentiments toward the three women whose interests brought them daily to the courtroom had undergone considerable change the girl that he had put upon a pedestal to worship from afar the girl to whom he had given an idealistic love he saw now in another light his reverence for her had died hard but in the face of her arrogance her vindictiveness and her petty snobbery it had finally succumbed so that when he compared her with the girl who had been of the street the latter suffered in no way by the comparison  harriet holdens friendship and loyalty were a neverending source of wonderment to him but he accepted her own explanation which indeed was fair enough that her innate sense of justice had compelled her to give him her sympathy and assistance  just how far that assistance had gone jimmy did not know though of late he had come to suspect that his attorney was being retained by harriet holdens father  bince appeared in the courtroom only when necessity compelled his presence on the witness stand the nature of the mans testimony was such that like krovacs it was difficult of impeachment although jimmy was positive that bince perjured himself especially in a statement that he made of a conversation he had with mr compton the morning of the murder in which he swore that compton stated that he intended to discharge torrance that day  the effect of the trial seemed to have made greater inroads upon bince than upon jimmy the latter gave no indication of nervous depression or of worry while bince on the other hand was thin pale and haggard his hands and face continually moved and twitched as he sat in the courtroom or on the witness chair never for an instant was he at rest  elizabeth compton had noticed this fact too and commented upon it one evening when bince was at her home  whats the matter with you harold she asked  you look as though you are on the verge of nervous prostration  ive had enough to make any man nervous retorted bince irritably  i cant get over this terrible affair and in addition i have had all the weight and responsibility of the business on my shoulders since and the straightening out of your fathers estate which by the way was in pretty bad shape  i wish elizabeth he went on that we might be married immediately i have asked you so many times before however and you have always refused that i suppose it is useless now i believe that i would get over this nervous condition if you and i were settled down here together i have no real home as you knowthe club is just a stopping place i might as well be living at a hotel if after the days work i could come home to a regular home it would do me a world of good i know we could be married quietly there is every reason why we should especially now that you are left all alone  just what do you mean by immediately she asked  tomorrow he replied  for a long time she demurred but finally she acceded to his wishes for an early marriage though she would not listen to the ceremony being performed the following day they reached a compromise on friday morning a delay of only a few days and harold bince breathed more freely thereafter than he had for a long time before  mr and mrs harold bince entered the courtroom late on friday morning following the brief ceremony that had made them man and wife it had been generally supposed that today the case would go to the jury as the evidence was all in and the final arguments of the attorneys which had started the preceding day would be concluded during the morning session it had been conceded that the judges charge would be brief and perfunctory and there was even hope that the jury might return a verdict before the close of the afternoon session but when bince and his bride entered the courtroom they found torrances attorney making a motion for the admission of new evidence on the strength of the recent discovery of witnesses the evidence of whom he claimed would materially alter the aspect of the case  an hour was consumed in argument before the judge finally granted the motion the first of the new witnesses called was an employee of the international machine company after the usual preliminary questions the attorney for the defense asked him if he was employed in the plant on the afternoon of march 24 the reply was in the affirmative  will you tell the jury please of any occurrence that you witnessed there that afternoon out of the ordinary  i was working at my machine said the witness when pete krovac comes to me and asks me to hide behind a big drillpress and watch what the assistant general manager done when he comes through the shop again so i hides there and i saw this man bince come along and drop an envelope beside krovacs machine and after he left i comes out as krovac picks it up and i seen him take some money out of it  how much money asked the attorney  there was fifty dollars there  he counted it in front of me  did he say what it was for  yes he said bince gave it to him to croak this fellownodding toward jimmy  what fellow asked the attorney  you mean mr torrance the defendant  yes sir  and what else  what happened after that  krovac said hed split it with me if id go along and help him  did you  yes  what happened  the guy beat up krovac and come near croaking me and got away  that is all said the attorney  the prosecuting attorney whose repeated objections to the testimony of the witness had been overruled waived crossexamination  turning to the clerk please call stephen murray said jimmys attorney  murray burly and swaggering took the witness chair  the attorney handed him a letter it was the letter that murray had written bince enclosing the supposed iww threat  did you ever see that before he asked  murray took the letter and read it over several times  he was trying to see in it anything which could possibly prove damaging to him  sure he said at last in a blustering tone of voice  i wrote it but what of it  and this enclosure asked the attorney he handed murray the slip of soiled wrapping paper with the threat lettered upon it this was received with your letter  murray hesitated before replying  oh he said that aint nothing that was just a little joke  you were seen in feinheimers with mr bince on marchdo you recall the object of this meeting  mr bince thought there was going to be a strike at his plant and he wanted me to fix it up for him replied murray  you know the defendant james torrance  yes  didnt he knock you down once for insulting a girl  murray flushed but was compelled to admit the truth of the allegation  you havent got much use for him have you continued the attorney  no i havent replied murray  you called the defendant on the telephone a half or threequarters of an hour before the police discovered mr comptons body did you not  murray started to deny that he had done so  jimmys attorney stopped him just a moment mr murray he said if you will stop a moment and give the matter careful thought i am sure you will recall that you telephoned mr torrance at that time and that you did it in the presence of a witness and the attorney pointed toward the back of the courtroom murray looked in the direction that the other indicated and again he paled and his hand trembled where it rested on the arm of his chair for seated in the back of the courtroom was the headwaiter from feinheimers now do you recall asked the attorney  murray was silent for a moment  suddenly he half rose from his chair yes i remember it he said they are all trying to doublecross me i had nothing to do with killing compton that wasnt in the deal at all ask that man there he will tell you that i had nothing to do with killing compton he hired me and he knows and with shaking finger murray pointed at mr harold bince where he sat with his wife beside the prosecuting attorney     chapter xxviii  the verdict  for a moment there was tense silence in the courtroom which was broken by the defenses perfunctory take the witness to the prosecuting attorney but again crossexamination was waived  call the next witness please and a moment later the lizard emerged from the witnessroom  i wish you would tell the jury said the counsel for defense after the witness had been sworn just what you told me in my office yesterday afternoon  yes sir said the lizard  you see it was like this murray there sent for me and tells me that hes got a job for me he wants me to go and crack a safe at the international machine companys plant he said there was a fellow on the inside helping him that there wouldnt be any watchman there that night and that in the safe i was to crack was some books and papers that was to be destroyed and on top of it was three or four thousand dollars in payroll money that i was to have as my pay for the job murray told me that the guy on the inside who wanted the job done had been working some kind of a payroll graft and he wanted the records destroyed and he also wanted to get rid of the guy that was hep to what he had been doin all that i had to do with it was go and crack the safe and get the records which i was to throw in the river and keep the money for myself but the frameup on the other guy was to send him a phony message that would get him at the plant after i got through and then notify the police so they could catch him there in the room with the cracked safe  i didnt know who they were framin this job on  if i had i wouldnt have had nothin to do with it  well i goes to the plant and finds a window in the basement open just as they tells me it will be but when i gets on the first floor just before i go upstairs to the office which is on the second floor i heard some one walking around upstairs i hid in the hallway while he came down he stopped at the front door and lighted a cigarette and then he went on out and i went upstairs to finish the job  when i gets in comptons office where the safe is i flashes my light and the first thing i sees is comptons body on the floor beside his desk that kind of stuff aint in my line so i beats it out without crackin the safe thats all i know about it until i sees the papers and then for a while i was afraid to say anything because this guy odonnell has it in for me and i know enough about police methods to know that they could frame up a good case of murder against me but after a while miss hudson finds me and puts it up to me straight that this guy torrance hasnt got no friends except me and her  of course she didnt know how much i knew but i did and its been worryin me ever since i was waiting though hopin that something would turn up so that he would be acquitted but i been watchin the papers close and i seen yesterday that there wasnt much chance so here i am  you say that a man came down from mr comptons office just before you went up what time was that  it was about ten oclock about half an hour before the cops finds torrance there  and then you went upstairs and found mr compton dead  yes sir  you say this man that came downstairs stopped and lighted a cigarette before he left the building did you see his face  yes i did  would you recognize him if you saw him again  sure  look around the courtroom and see if you can find him here  sure i can find him  i seen him when i first came in but i cant see his face because hes hiding behind the prosecuting attorney  all eyes were turned in the direction of the prosecuting attorney to see bince leap suddenly to his feet and lean forward upon the desk before him supported by a trembling arm as he shook his finger at the lizard and in highpitched tones screamed its a lie its a lie  for a moment longer he stood looking wildly about the room and then with rapid strides he crossed it to an open window and before any one could interfere he vaulted out to fall four stories to the cement sidewalk below  for  several  minutes  pandemonium reigned in the courtroom  elizabeth compton bince swooned and when she regained consciousness she found herself in the arms of harriet holden  take me home harriet she asked take me away from this place  take me to your home i do not want to go back to mine yet  half an hour later in accordance with the judges charge to the jury a verdict of not guilty was rendered in the case of the people of illinois versus james torrance jr  mr holden and jimmys attorney were the first to congratulate him and the former insisted that he come home with him to dinner  i am sorry said jimmy i should like to immensely but there is some one i must see first if i may i should like to come out later in the evening to thank you and miss holden  jimmy searched about the courtroom until he found the lizard  i dont know how to thank you he said  dont then said the lizard who you ought to thank is that little girl who is sick in bed up on the north side  thats just where i am going now said jimmy is she very sick  pneumonia said the lizard i telephoned her doctor just before i came over here and i guess if you want to see her at all youd better hurry  its not that had is it jimmy said  im afraid it is said the lizard  jimmy lost no time in reaching the street and calling a taxi  a nurse admitted him to the apartment how is she he asked  the nurse shook her head  can she see any one  it wont make any difference now said the nurse and jimmy was led into the room where the girl wasted by fever and suffering lay in a halfcomatose condition upon her narrow bed jimmy crossed the room and laid his hand upon her forehead and at the touch she opened her eyes and looked up at him he saw that she recognized him and was trying to say something and he kneeled beside the bed so that his ear might be closer to her lips  jimmy she whispered you are free  tell me  he told her briefly of what had happened i am so happy she murmured oh jimmy i am so happy  he took one of her wasted hands in his own and carried it to his lips not on the hand she said faintly just once on the lips before i die  he gathered her in his arms and lifted her face to his dear little girl he said you are not going to die it is not as bad as that  she did not reply but only clung to him tightly and against his cheek he felt her tears and a little choking sob before she relaxed and he laid her back again on her pillow he thought she was dead then and he called the nurse but she still breathed though her eyes were closed jimmy sat down on the edge of the bed beside her and stroked her hand after a while she roused again and opened her eyes  jimmy she said will you stay with me until i go  the man could make no articulate response but he pressed her hand reassuringly she was silent again for some time once more she whispered faintly so faintly that he had to lean close to catch her words  miss holden she whispered she is agood girl  it isshewho hiredthe attorney for you go to herjimmywhen iam goneshe lovesyou again there was a long pause  goodbyjimmy she whispered at last  the nurse was standing at the foot of the bed  she came and put her hand on jimmys shoulder it is too bad she said she was such a good girl  yes said jimmy i think she was the best little girl i ever knew  it was after nine oclock when jimmy depressed and sorrowing arrived at the holden home the houseman who admitted him told him that mr holden had been called out but that miss holden was expecting him and he ushered jimmy to the big livingroom and to his consternation he saw that elizabeth compton was there with harriet the latter came forward to greet him and to his surprise the other girl followed her  i discovered today mr torrance she said that i have wronged you however unintentionally it was the fact remains that i might have done you a very great harm and injustice i realize now how very different things might have been if i had listened to you and believed in you at first harriet told me that you were coming tonight and i asked to see you for just a moment to tell you this and also to ask you if you would continue with the international machine company  there is no one now whom i feel i would have so much confidence in as you i wish you would come back and take charge for me if you will tell me that you will consider it we will arrange the details later  if an archangel had suddenly condescended to honor him with an invitation to assist in the management of heaven jimmy could not have been more surprised he realized at what cost of pride and selfesteem the offer must have been made and acknowledgment of error he told her that he would be very glad to assist her for the present at least and then she excused herself on the plea of nervous exhaustion and went to her room  do you know said harriet after elizabeth had gone she really feels worse over her past attitude toward you than she does over harolds death i think she realizes now what i have told her from the first that she never really loved him of course her pride has suffered terribly but she will get over that quickly enough  but do you know i have not had an opportunity before to congratulate you i wish that i might have been there to have heard the verdict but really you dont look half as happy as i should think you would feel  i am happy about that said jimmy but on top of my happiness came a sorrow i just came from ediths apartment she died while i was there  harriet gave a little cry of shocked surprise oh jimmy she cried laying her hand upon his arm oh jimmy i am so sorry it was the first time that she had ever addressed him by his given name but there seemed nothing strange or unusual in the occurrence  she was such a good little girl said harriet  it was strange that so many should use these same words in connection with edith hudson and even this girl so far removed from the sphere in which little eva had existed and who knew something of her past could yet call her good  it gave jimmy a new insight into the sweetness and charity of harriet holdens character yes he said her soul and her heart were good and pure  she believed so in you said the girl  she thought you were the best man who ever lived she told me that you were the only really good man she had ever known and her confidence and belief in you were contagious you will probably never know all that she did for you it was really she that imbued my father and his attorney with a belief in your innocence and it was she who influenced the lizard to take the stand in your behalf yes she was a very good friend  and you have been a good friend said jimmy in the face of the same circumstances that turned miss compton against me you believed in me your generosity made it possible for me to be defended by the best attorney in chicago but more than all that to me has been your friendship and the consciousness of your sympathy at a time when above all things i needed sympathy and now after all you have done for me i came to ask still more of you  what do you want she asked  she was standing very close to him looking up in his face  you harriet he said  she smiled tremulously  i have been yours for a long time jimmy but you didnt know it
