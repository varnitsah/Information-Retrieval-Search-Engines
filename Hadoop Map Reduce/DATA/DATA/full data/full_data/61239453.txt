1892  copyright 1892 by d appleton and company  printed at the appleton press usa         on the plain       my cabin cowers in the pathless sweep     of the terrible northern blast     above its roof the wild clouds leap     and shriek as they hurtle past     the snowwaves hiss along the plain     like spectral wolves they stretch and strain     and race and rampwith hissing beat     like stealthy tread of myriad feet     i hear them pass upon the roof     the icy showers swirl and rattle     at times the moon from storms aloof     shines white and wan within the room     then swift clouds drive across the light     and all the plain is lost to sight     the cabin rocks and on my palm     the sifted snow falls cold and calm      god what a power is in the wind     i lay my cheek to the cabin side     to feel the weight of his giant hands     a speck a fly in the blasting tide     of streaming pitiless icy sands     a single heart with its feeble beat     a mouse in the lions throat

next time you twist hay fr the fire i wisht youd dodge the damp spots said the cook rising from a prolonged scrutiny of the stove and the bread in the oven his pose was threatening  cooks are always grumblin calmly remarked anson drawing on his gloves preparatory to going out to the barn but seein s this is chrismus ill go out an knock a barrel to pieces i want them biscuit to be ok see  yes i see  say bert  well  cant we have some sugarlasses on our biscuits seein its chrismus  well i spose we can ans but were gittin purty low on the thing these days an they aint no tellin when well be able to git more  well jes as you say not as i care anson went out into the roaring wind with a shout of defiance but came back instantly as if to say something he had forgotten say wha dye spose is the trouble over to the norsks i haint seen a sign o smoke over there fr two r three days  well now you speak of it ans ive ben thinkin about that myself im afraid hes out o coal r sick r somethin it ud be mighty tough fr the woman an babe to be there without any fire an this blizzard whoopin her up i guess youd better go over an see whats up i was goin to speak of it this mornin but frgot it im cook this week so i guess the job falls on you  all right here goes  better take a horse  no i guess not the snow is driftin purty bad an he couldnt git through the drifts anyway  well lookout fr yrself ol man it looks purty owly off in the west dont waste any time id hate like thunder to be left alone on a dakota prairie fr the rest o the winter  anson laughed back through the mist of snow that blew in the open door his greatcoat and cap allowing only a glimpse of his cheeks  the sky was bright overhead but low down around the horizon it looked wild the air was frightfully coldfar below zeroand the wind had been blowing almost every day for a week and was still strong the snow was sliding fitfully along the sod with a stealthy menacing motion and far off in the west and north a dense shining cloud of frost was hanging  the plain was almost as lone and level and bare as a polar ocean where death and silence reign undisputedly there was not a tree in sight the grass was mainly burned or buried by the snow and the little shanties of the three or four settlers could hardly be said to be in sight half sunk as they were in drifts a large white owl seated on a section stake was the only living thing to be seen  the boom had not yet struck buster county indeed it did not seem to bert gearheart at this moment that it would ever strike buster county it was as cold dreary and unprofitable an outlook as a man could face and not go utterly mad if any of these pioneers could have forecast the winter they would not have dared to pass it on the plains  bert watched his partner as he strode rapidly across the prairie now lost to sight as a racing troop of snowwaves running shoulderhigh shot between now reappearing as the wind lulled  this is gittin pretty monotonous to tell the honest truth he muttered as he turned from the little window if that railroad dont show up by march in some shape or other im goin to give it up gittin free land like this is a little too costly for me ill go back to wiscons an rent land on shares  bert was a youngerlooking man than his bachelor companion perhaps because his face was cleanshaven and his frame much slighter he was a silent moody young fellow hard to get along with though of great good heart anson wood succeeded in winning and holding his love even through the trials of masculine housekeeping as bert kept on with the dinner he went often to the little window facing the east and looked out each time thawing a hole in the frost on the windowpanes  the wind was rising again and the night promised to be wild as the two preceding nights had been as he moved back and forth setting out their scanty meal he was thinking of the old life back in wisconsin in the deeps of the little coul√©e of the sleighrides with the boys and girls of the christmas doings of the damp thickfalling snow among the pines where the wind had no terrors of musical bells on swift horses in the fragrant deeps where the snowflakes fell like caresses through the tossing branches of the trees  by the side of such a life the plain with its sliding snow and ferocious wind was appallinga treeless expanse and a racingground for snow and wind the mans mood grew darker while he mused he served the meal on the rude box which took the place of table and still his companion did not come ho looked at his watch it was nearly one oclock and yet there was no sign of the sturdy figure of anson  the house of the poor norwegian was about two miles away and out of sight being built in a gully but now the eye could distinguish a house only when less than a mile away a man could not at times be seen at a distance of ten rods though occasional lulls in the wind permitted bert to see nearly to the first moccasin  he may be in the swale muttered the watcher as he stood with his eye to the loophole but the next time he looked the plain was as wild and lone as before save under the rising blast the snow was beginning to ramp and race across the level sod till it looked at times like a sea running white with foam and misty with spray  at two oclock he said well i spose ans has concluded to stay over there to dinner though what the norsk can offer as inducement i swear i dont know ill eat anyhow he can have whats left  he sat down to his lonely meal and ate slowly getting up two or three times from his candlebox in a growing anxiety for ans using the heated poker now to clear a spot on the pane he expressed his growing apprehension manlike by getting angry  i dont see what the darn fool means by stayin so late itll be dark by four oclock er jest as soon as that cloud over there strikes us you couldnt beat sense into some mens heads with a club  he had eaten his dinner now and had taken to pacing up and down the little room which was exactly six paces long and three wide and just high enough to permit anson to walk erect in the highest part  nice fix to leave a man in aint it all alone here an a blizzard comin on if i ever git out o this country alive ill bet ill know enough not to come back he broke out stamping his foot in a rage i dont see what he means by it if hes caught in that blow his life aint worth a cent     chapter ii  her first trip in a blizzard   at halfpast two the feelings of the silent watcher began to change he thought more about his partner out there in the rising wind and thickening snow the blast roared round the little cabin with a deep menacing rising moan and laid to the stovepipe a resounding lip wailing and shouting weirdly berts nervous walk quickened and he looked so often through the pane that the frost had not time to close up  suddenly out of the blinding sweeping snow not ten rods distant the burly form of anson burst head down blindly staggering forward into the teeth of the tempest he walked like a man whose strength was almost gone and he carried a large bundle in his arms  gearhart flung the door open and called in a cheery voice to guide the struggling man to the house he knew what it was to face such a wind  here ye are ol man right this way keep yr head down  then seeing that anson hardly made headway against the terrible blast he rushed out bareheaded as he was and caught and hurried him in and shut the door  reeling blindly his breath roaring like a furnace his eyebrows hung with icicles his face masked with crusted snow anson staggered in crying hoarsely take her then slid to the floor where he lay panting for breath  bert caught the bundle from his arms a wailing halfsmothered cry came from it  what is it ans he asked  a kid warm it said the giant trying with his numbed fingers to undo the shawl which wrapped the bundle bert hurriedly unwound the shawl and a frightened child blueeyed and flaxenhairedflossy as unfrosted cornsilkwas disclosed like a nubbin of corn after the husks are stripped off  why its little flaxen hair wha dye bring her over for  sh said anson hoarsely mind how y git her warm dont y see shes froze  the little creature was about five or possibly six years old scantily clad but neat and pretty as her feet began to get warm before the fire she wailed with pain which bert tried to stop by rubbing  put her hands in yr hair hold her feet in yr handsdont rub em commanded ans who was stripping the ice from his eyelashes and from his matted beard which lay like a shield upon his breast stir up the fire give her some hot coffee an some feed she haint had anything to eat  bert tried to do all these things at once and could not but managed finally to get the child a piece of bread and a cup of coffee and to allay her fears ans began to recover from his horrible journey and was able to speak though his lungs were still painful  ol man he said solemnly and tenderly i came jest as near stayin in that last gully down there as a man could an not the snow was up to my armpits an let me down wherever the weeds was i had to waller if it hadnt ben for her i guess id a give up but i jest grit m teeth an pulled through there guess y hadnt better let her have any more i guess shell go to sleep now shes fed an warmed jest le me take her now ol man  no you git rested up  see here itll rest me to hold that little chap im all right my hands is frosted some an my ears thats all but my breath is gittin back come on now he pleaded  bert surrendered the child who looked up into the bearded face of the rough fellow then rested her head on his breast and went to sleep at last it made his heart thrill as he felt her little head against his breast he never had held a child in his arms before  say bert reckon im a purty fair picture of a famly man now eh throw in a couple o twists more o hay  bert stirred up the fire  well now the little one is off whats up over to the norsks wha dye bring the child for he asked at last  because she was the only livin soul in the shanty  what his face was set in horror  fact  wheres the norsk  i dont know on the prairie somewhere  an the mother  shes here the little one stirred slightly as he leaned forward and ans said with a wink shes asleep he winked significantly and bert understood what the sleep was be a little careful what y sayjes now the little rat is listenin jest say relative when y mean herthe woman y know  yes sir he resumed after a moment i was scart when i saw that housewhen i knocked an no one stirred r come to the door they wasnt a track around an the barn an house was all drifted up i pushed the door open it was cold as a barn an dark i couldnt see anythin fr a minute but i heard a sound o cryin from the bed that made my hair stand up i rushed over there an there lay the mother on the bed with nothin on but some kind of a nightdress an everythindress shawl an allpiled on an around that blessed child  she was sleepin  like a stone i couldnt believe it at first i raved around there split up a chair an the shelves an made a fire then i started to rub the womans hands an feet but she was cold an hard as iron bert shuddered in sympathy then i took the child up an rubbed her tried to find somethin fr her to eatnot a blessed thing in that house finally i thought i better bolt fr home  lucky you did hear that wind great heavens we are in for another twodays blow of it that woman of course stripped herself to save the child  yes she did  jes like a woman why didnt she rip down the shelf an split up the chairs for fuel or keep walkin up an down the room  now there it is she had burnt up a lot o stuff then took to bed with the child she rolled her up in all the quilts an shawls an dresses they was in the house then laid down by the side of her an put her arm over heran frozejes like a motherno judgment  well lay her down now an eat some thin yrself while i go out an look after the chores lord it makes me crawl to think of that woman layin there in the shanty all alone he turned and said in a peculiar hesitating voice he shivered a little as he spoke say did y shut the door  yes an it shuts hard the wind nr wolves cant open it  thats good i couldnt sleep nights if i thought the coyotes could get in berts imagination seized upon that lonely cabin and the figure lying cold as iron upon the bed it appealed to him more than to anson  by four oclock it was dark and the lamp was lighted when bert came in bringing an immense load of haytwists the ferocious wind as if exulting in its undisputed sway over the plain raved in ceaseless fury around the cabin and lashed the roof with a thousand stinging streams of snow the tiny shanty did not rock it shuddered as if with fright the drifts rose higher on the windows and here and there through some unseen crevice the snow fine as bolted flour found its way like oil seeming to penetrate the solid boards and to the stovepipe the storm still laid hoarse lip piping incessantly now dolorously now savagely now high now low  while the two men sat above the fire that night discussing the sad case of the woman the child slept heavily muttering and sobbing in her sleep  the probabilities are said anson in a matteroffact way the norsk took his oxen an started fr summit fr provisions an got caught in this blizzard an froze to death somewheregot lost in some gully probably  but why didnt he come an tell us to look after his famly  well i spose he was afraid to trust us i dont wonder as i remember the treatment their women git from the yankees we look a good eal worse than we are besides an then the poor cuss couldnt talk to us anyhow an hes ben shy ever since he came in october  after a long silence in which gearheart went over and studied the face of the sleeper anson said well if hes dead an the womans dead too weve got to look after this child till some relative turns up an that womans got to be buried  all right whats got to be done had better be done right off weve only one bed ans an a cradle hasnt appeared necessary before how about the sleepin tonight if youre goin into the orphanasylum business youll have to open up correspondence with a furniture store  ans reddened a little it aint mine any moren yours were pardners in this job  no i guess not you look more like a dad an i guess ill shift the responsibility of this thing off onto you ill bunk here on the floor an you take the child an occupy the bed  well all right answered anson going over in his turn and looking down at the white face and towcoloured hair of the little stranger but say we aint got no nightclothes fr the little chap whatll we do put her to sleep jes as she is  i reckon well have to tonight maybe youll find some more clothes over to the shanty  say bert said ans later  well  its too darn cold fr you to sleep on the floor there you git in here on the back side an ill take the child on the front shed be smashed flattern a pancake if she was in the middle she aint biggern a pint o cider anyway  no ol man ill lay here on the floor an kind o heave a twist in once in a while its goin to be cold enough to freeze the tail off a brass bull by daylight  ans bashfully crept in beside the sleeping child taking care not to waken her and lay there thinking of his new responsibility at every shiver of the cowering cabin and rising shriek of the wind his heart went out in love toward the helpless little creature whose dead mother lay in the cold and deserted shanty and whose father was wandering perhaps breathless and despairing on the plain or lying buried in the snow in some deep ravine beside his patient oxen he tucked the clothing in carefully about the child felt to see if her little feet were cold and covered her head with her shawl patting her lightly with his great paw  say bert  well ans what now  if this little chap should wake up an cry fr its mother what in thunder would i do  give it up ol boy was the reply from the depths of the buffalorobes before the fire pat her on the back an tell her not to cry or somethin like that  but she cant tell what i say  oh shell understand if y kind o chuckle an gurgle like a famly man but the little one slept on and when about midnight bert got up to feed the fire he left the stove door open to give light and went softly over to the sleepers ans was sleeping with the little form close to his breast and the poor troubled face safe under his shaggy beard                                                and all night long the blasting wind sweeping the sea of icy sands hissed and howled round the little sod cabin like surf beating on a halfsunken rock the wind and the snow and the darkness possessed the plain and cold whose other name is death was king of the horrible carnival it seemed as though morning and sunlight could not come again so absolute was the sway of night and death     chapter iii  the burial of her dead mother   when anson woke the next morning he found the great flowerlike eyes of the little waif staring straight into his face with a surprise too great for words or cries she stared steadily and solemnly into his open eyes for a while and when he smiled she smiled back but when he lifted his large hand and tried to brush her hair she grew frightened pushing her little fists against him and began to cry mor mor kom  this roused gearheart who said  well ans what are y goin to do with that child this is your mornin to git breakfast come roll out ive got the fire goin good i cant let y off itll break up our system  anson rolled out of the bunk and dressed hurriedly in the cold room the only sound was the roar of the stove devouring the haytwist anson danced about  thunder an black cats aint it cold the wind has died down or wed be froze stiffern a wedge it was mighty good in you ol man to keep the stove goin durin the night the child has opened her eyes brightern a dollar but i tell you i dont like to let her know whats happened to her relatives  the little one began to wail in a frightened way being alone in the dim corner  there she goes now shes wantin to go home thats what shes askin jes likes not say bert what the devil can i do  talk to her ans chuckle to her  talk shell think im threatenin to knock her head off or somethin there there dont ee cry well go see papa soonconfound it man i cant go on with this thing there there see child were goin to have some nice hot pancakes now goin to have breakfast now see ol paps goin to fry some pancakes whoopsee he took down the saucepan and flourished it in order to make his meaning plainer bert laughed  thats as bad as your fist put that down ans youll scare the young one into a fit you aint built fr a jumpinjack  the child did indeed set up a louder and more distracting yell getting desperate anson seized her in his arms and despite her struggles began tossing her on his shoulder the child understood him and ceased to cry especially as gearheart began to set the table making a pleasant clatter whistling the while  the glorious light of the morning made its way only dimly through the thickly frosted windowpanes the boards snapped in the horrible cold out in the barn the cattle were bellowing and kicking with pain  do you know said bert impressively i couldnt keep that woman out o my mind i could see her layin there without any quilts on her an the mice arunnin over her god its tough this bein alone on a prairie on such a night  i knew id feel so an i jest naturally covered her up an tucked the covers in the child alookin on i thought shed feel better seein her ma tucked in good an warm poor little rat  did you do that ol man  you bet i did i couldnt have slep a wink if i hadnt  well why didnt y tell me sot i could sleep  i didnt think youd think of it that way not havin seen her  the child now consented to sit in one of the chairs and put her feet down by the stove she wept silently now with that infrequent indrawn sob more touching than wails she felt that these strangers were her friends but she wanted her mother she ate well and soon grew more resigned she looked first at one and then at the other of the men as they talked trying to understand their strange language then she fell to watching a mouse that stole out from behind the flourbarrels snatching a crumb occasionally and darting back and laughed gleefully once and clapped her hands  now the first thing after the chores ans is that woman over there of course its out o the question buryin her but wed better go over an git what things there is left o the girls an fasten up the shanty to keep the wolves out  but then  what  the mice you cant shut them out  thats so i never thought o that weve got to make a box i guess but its goin to be an awful job for me ans to git her into it i thought i wouldnt have to touch her  le me go ive seen her once an you haint id just as soon  heaven an earth what could i do with the babe shed howl like a coyote an drive me plumb wild no youre elected to take care o the child i aint worth a picayune at it besides you had your share yesterday  and so in the brilliant sunshine of that bitterly cold morning gearheart crunched away over the spotless snow which burned under his feeta land mocking glorious pitiless far off some slender columns of smoke told of two or three hearthfires but mainly the plain was level and lifeless as the polar ocean appallingly silent no cry or stir in the whole expanse no tree to creak nor bell to ring  it required strong effort on the part of the young man to open the door of the cottage and he stood for some time with his hand on the latch looking about there was perfect silence without and within no trace of feet or hands anywhere all was as peaceful and unbroken as a sepulchre  finally as if angry with himself gearheart shook himself and pushed open the door letting the morning sun stream in it lighted the bare little room and fell on the frozen face and rigid halfopen eyes of the dead woman with a strong white glare the thin face and worn largejointed hands lying outside the quilt told of the hardships which had been the lot of the sleeper her clothing was clean and finer than one would expect to see  gearheart stood looking at her for a long time the door still open for he felt reenforced in some way by the sun if any one had come suddenly and closed the door on him and the white figure there he would have cried out and struggled like a madman to escape such was his unreasoning fear of the dead  at length with a long breath he backed out and closed the door going to the barn he found a cow standing at an empty manger and some hens and pigs frozen in the hay looking about for some boards to make a coffin he came upon a long box in which a reaper had been packed and this he proceeded to nail together firmly and to line with pieces of an old stovepipe at such places as he thought the mice would try to enter  when it was all prepared he carried the box to the house and managed to lay it down beside the bed but he could not bring himself to touch the body he went out to see if some one were not coming the sound of a human voice would have relieved him at once and he could have gone on without hesitation but there was no one in sight and no one was likely to be so he returned and summoning all his resolution took one of the quilts from the bed and placed it in the bottom of the box then he removed the pillow from beneath the head of the dead woman and placed that in the box then he paused the cold moisture breaking out on his face  like all young persons born far from war and having no knowledge of death even in its quiet forms he had the most powerful organic repugnance toward a corpse he kept his eye on it as though it were a sleeping horror likely at a sudden sound to rise and walk more than this there had always been something peculiarly sacred in the form of a woman and in his calmer moments the dead mother appealed to him with irresistible power  at last with a sort of moan through his set teeth he approached the bed and threw the sheet over the figure holding it as in a sling then by a mighty effort he swung it stiffly off the bed into the box  he trembled so that he could hardly spread the remaining quilts over the dead face the box was wide enough to receive the stiff curved right arm and he had nothing to do but to nail the cover on which he did in feverish haste then he rose grasped his tools rushed outside slammed the door and set off in great speed across the snow pushed on by an indescribable horror  as he neared home his fresh young blood asserted itself more and more but when he entered the cabin he was still trembling and dropped into a chair like a man out of breath at sight of the ruddy face of anson and with the aid of the heat and light of the familiar little room he shook off part of his horror  gi me a cup o coffee ans im kind o chilly an tired  before drinking he wiped his face and washed his hands again and again at the basin in the corner as though there were something on them which was ineffably unclean the little one who had been weeping again stared at him with two big tears drying on her hollow cheeks  well interrogated anson  i nailed her up safe enough for the present but whatre we goin to do next  i cant see s we can do anythin as long as such weather as this lasts it aint safe fr one of us to go out an leave the other alone besides its thirty below zero an no road moccasins full of snow an another wind likely to rise at any time its mighty tough on this little one but it cant be helped as soon as it moderates a little well try to find a woman an a preacher an bury thatrelative  the only woman i know of is ol mrs cap burdon down on the third moccasin full fifteen miles away     chapter iv  flaxen adopts anson as pap   for nearly two weeks they waited while the wind alternately raved and whispered over them as it scurried the snow south or east or shifted to the south in the night bringing the north end of a south wind the most intolerable and cutting of winds day after day the restless snow sifted or leaped across the waste of glittering crust day after day the sun shone in dazzling splendor but so white and cold that the thermometer still kept down among the thirties they were absolutely alone on the plain except that now and then a desperate wolf or inquisitive owl came by  these were long days for the settlers they would have been longer had it not been for little elga or flaxen as they took to calling her they racked their brains to amuse her and in the intervals of tending the cattle and of cooking or of washing dishes rummaged through all their books and pictures taught her cats cradle played jackstraws with her and with all their resources of song and pantomime strove to fill up the little ones lonely days happy when they succeeded in making her laugh  that settles it said bert one day whanging the basin back into the empty flourbarrel  whats the matter  matter is weve reached the bottom o the flourbarrel an its got to be filled no two ways about that we can get along on biscuit an pancakes in place o meat but we cant put anythin in the place o bread if it looks favorable tomorrow weve got to make a break for summit an see if we cant stock up  early the next morning they brought out the shivering team and piled into the box all the quilts and robes they had and bundling little flaxen in started across the trackless plain toward the low line of hills to the east twentyfive or thirty miles from four oclock in the morning till nearly noon they toiled across the sod now ploughing through the deep snow where the unburned grass had held it now scraping across the bare burned earth now wandering up or down the swales seeking the shallowest places now shovelling a pathway through  the sun rose unobscured as usual and shone down with unusual warmth which afforded the men the satisfaction of seeing little flaxen warm and merry she chattered away in her own tongue and clapped her little hands in glee at sight of the snowbirds running and fluttering about as they approached the low hills the swales got deeper and more difficult to cross but about eleven oclock they came to burdons ranch a sort of halfway haven between their own claim and summit the end of the railway  captain burdon was away but mrs burdon a big slatternly missourian with all the kindliness of a universal mother in her swarthy face and flaccid bosom ushered them into the cavelike dwelling set in the sunny side of water moccasin  set down set right down young uns git out some o them cheers an let the strangers set purty tolable tough weather a feller dont git out much such weather as this ere thout hes jes naturally bleeged to suse heave in another twist an help the little un to take off her shawl  after mrs burdons little flurry of hospitality was over anson found time to tell briefly the history of the child  heavens to betsey i wan to know she cried her fat hands on her knees and her eyes bulging wal wal i declare it beats the dutch so that woman jest frizzed right burside the babe wal i never an the ol man he aint showed up wal now he aint likely to i reckon i saw that norsk go by here that very day an i says to capn says i if that feller dont reach home inside an hour hell go through heaven agittin home says i to the capn  well now said anson stopping the old womans garrulous flow ive got to be off fr summit but i wish youd jest look after this little one here till we git back its purty hard weather fr her to be out an i dont think she ought to  yaas leave her o course shell enjoy playin with the young uns i reckon y did all y could for that woman y cant burry her now the grounds like linkumvity  but as anson turned to leave the little creature sprang up with a torrent of wild words catching him by the coat and pleading strenuously to go with him her accent was unmistakable  you wan to go with ans he inquired looking down into the little tearful face with a strange stirring in his bachelor heart i believe on my soul she does  sures yre born replied mrs burdon shed rather go with you than to stay an fool with the young uns thats what shes tryin to say  do y wan to go asked ans again opening his arms she sprang toward him raising her eager little hands as high as she could and when he lifted her she twined her arms around his neck  poor little critter she aint got no pap ner mam now the old woman explained to the ring of children who still stared silently at the stranger almost without moving  aint he her paap drawled one of the older girls sticking a finger at anson  he is now laughed ans and that settled the question over which he had been pondering for days it meant that as long as she wanted to stay she should be his flaxen and he would be her pap and you can be uncle bert hey he said to bert  good enough said bert     chapter v  flaxen becomes indispensable to the two old bachelors   they never found any living relative and only late in the spring was the fate of the poor father revealed he and his cattle were found side by side in a deep swale where they had foundered in the night and tempest  as for little flaxen she soon recovered her cheerfulness with the buoyancy natural to childhood and learned to prattle in broken english very fast she developed a sturdy selfreliance that was surprising in one so young and long before spring came was indispensable to the two old baches  now bert said ans one day i dont wan to hear you talk in that slipshod way any longer before flaxen you know better youve had more chance than i haveben to school more they aint no excuse for you not an ioty now im goin to say to her never mind how i talk but talk like bert does  oh say now look here ans i cant stand the strain suppose shed hear me swearin at ol barney or the stove  thats jest it you aint goin to swear decided anson and after that bert took the education of the little waif in hand for he was a man of good education his use of dialect and slang sprang mainly from carelessness  but all the little fatherly duties and discipline fell to anson and much perplexed he often got for instance when he bought her an outfit of american clothing at the store they were strange to her and to him and the situation was decidedly embarrassing when they came to try them  now flaxie i guess this thing goes on this side before sos you can button it if it went on so you couldnt reach around to button it dont you see i guess youd better try it so an this thing i judge is a shirt an goes on under that other thing which i reckon is called a shimmy say bert shouldnt you call that a shirt holding up a garment  well yes after a close scrutiny yes i should  and this a shimmy  well now youve got me ans it seems to me ive heard the women folks home talk about shimmies but they were always kind o private about it so i dont think i can help you out that little thing goes underneath sure enough  all right here goes flax if it should turn out to be hind side before no matter  then again little flaxen would want to wear her best dress on weekdays and ans was unable to explain here again bert came to the rescue  git her one dress fer evry day in the week an make her wear em in rotation hang em up an put a tag on each onesunday monday an so on  good idea  and it was done but the embarrassments of attending upon the child soon passed away she quickly grew independent of such help dressed herself and combed her own hair though anson enjoyed doing it himself when he could find time and she helped out not a little about the house she seemed to have forgotten her old life awakening as she had from almost deathly torpor into a new homealmost a new worldwhere a strange language was spoken where no woman was and where no mention of her mother father or native land was ever made before her the little waif was at first utterly bewildered then reconciled and by the time spring came over the prairie was almost happy in the touching way of a child deprived of childish things  oh how sweet spring seemed to those snowweary people day after day the sun crept higher up in the sky day after day the snow gave way a little on the swells and streams of water began to trickle down under the huge banks of snow filling the ravines and then at last came a day when a strange warm wind blew from the northwest soft and sweet and sensuous it was as if it swept some tropic bay filled with a thousand islesa wind like a vast warm breath blown upon the land under its touch the snow did not melt it vanished it fled in a single day from the plain to the gullies another day and the gullies were rivers  it was the chinook which old lambert the trapper and surveyor said came from the pacific ocean  the second morning after the chinook began to blow anson sprang to his feet from his bunk and standing erect in the early morning light yelled hear that  what is it asked bert  there hear it anson smiled holding up his hand joyfully as a mellow boomboomboom broke through the silent air prairiechickens hurrah spring has come that breaks the back o winter short off  hurrah de pring ees come cried little flaxen gleefully clapping her hands in imitation  no man can know what a warm breeze and the note of a bird can mean to him till he is released as these men were released from the bondage of a horrible winter perhaps still more moving was the thought that with the spring the loneliness of the prairie would be broken never again to be so dread and drear for with the coming of spring came the tide of landseekers pouring in teams scurried here and there on the wide prairie carrying surveyors land agents and settlers at summit trains came rumbling in by the first of april emptying thousands of men women and children upon the sod together with cattle machinery and household articles to lie there roofed only by the blue sky summit from being a halfburied store and a blacksmiths shop bloomed out into a town with saloons lumberyards hotels and restaurants the sound of hammer and anvil was incessant and trains clanged and whistled night and day  day after day the settlers got their wagons together and loaded up and then moved down the slope into the fair valley of the sleepy james mrs cap burdon did a rushing business as a hotelkeeper while cap sold hay and oats at rates which made the landseekers gasp  im not out here fr my health was all the explanation he ever made  soon all around the little shanty of anson and bert other shanties were built and filled with young hopeful buoyant souls the railway surveyors came through locating a town about three and another about twelve miles away and straightway the bitter rivalry between boomtown and belleplain began belleplain being their town bert and anson swore by belleplain and correspondingly derided the claims of boomtown  with the coming of spring began the fiercest toil of the pioneersbreaking the sod building harvesting ploughing then the winter again though not so hard to bear then the same round of work again so the land was settled the sod was turned over sod shanties gave way to little frame houses the tide of landseekers passed on the boom burst but the real workers like wood and gearheart went patiently steadily on founding a great state     chapter vi  a question of dress   one morning eight years later flaxen left the home of gearheart and wood with old doll and the buggy bound for belleplain after groceries for harvest she drove with a dash her hat on the back of her head she was seemingly intent on getting all there was possible out of a chew of kerosene gum which she had resolved to throw away upon entering town intending to get a new supply  she had thriven on western air and gum and though hardly more than fourteen years of age her bust and limbs revealed the grace of approaching womanhood however childish her short dress and braided hair might still show her to be her face was large and decidedly of scandinavian type fair in spite of wind and sun and broad at the cheekbones her eyes were as blue and clear as winter ice  as she rode along she sang as well as she could without neglecting the gum sitting at one end of the seat like a man the reins held carelessly in her left hand notwithstanding the swift gait of the horse who always knew when flaxen was driving she met a friend on the road and said hello pulling up her horse with one strong hand  cant stop she explained got to go over to the city to get some groceries for harvest goin to the sociable tomorrow  you bet replied the friend you  i dknow mebbe if the boysll go tata see ye later and away she spun  belleplain had not thriven or to be more exact it had had a rise and fall and as the rise had been considerable so the fall was something worth chronicling it was now a collection of wooden buildings mostly empty graying under the storms and suns of pitiless winters and summers and now just in midsummer surrounded by splendid troops and phalanxes of gorgeous sunflowers whose brown crowns golddusted looked ever toward the sun as it swung through the wide arch of cloudless sky the signs of the empty buildings still remained and one might still read the melancholy decline from splendours of the past in emporiums palace drug stores and mansionhouses  as flaxen would have said belleplains boom had busted her glory had gone with the c b and q which formed the junction at boomtown and left the luckless citizens of belleplain high and dry on the prairie with nothing but a spur to travel on however a few stores yet remained in the midst of desolation  after making her other purchases flaxen entered the redfront drug store to secure the special brand of gum which seemed most delectable and to buy a couple of cigars for the boys  the clerk who was lately from the east and wore his moustache curled upward like the whiskers of a cat was gassing with another young man who sat in a chair with his heels on the counter  well my dear what can i do for you today he said winking at the loafer as if to say now watch me  i want some gum  what kind darling he asked encouraged by the fellow in the chair  i aint your darlingkerosene shoofly an ten cents worth  say jack drawled the other fellow git onto the ankles say sissy you picked your dress too soon shes goin to be a daisy first you know aint y honey he said leaning over and pinching her arm  let me alone you great mean thing ill tell ol pap on you see if i dont cried flaxen her eyes filling with angry tears and as they proceeded to other and bolder remarks she rushed out feeling vaguely the degradation of being so spoken to and so touched it seemed to become more atrocious the more she thought upon it  when she reached home there were still signs of tears on her face and when anson came out to help her alight and noticing it asked whats the matter she burst out afresh crying and talking incoherently anson was astonished  why whats the matter flaxie cant you tell ol pap are ye sick  she shook her head and rushed past him into the house and into her bedroom like a little cyclone of wrath ans slowly followed her much perplexed she was lying face downward on the bed sobbing  whats the matter little one cant y tell ol pap have the girls ben makin fun o yeh again  she shook her head  have the boys ben botherin yeh no reply who was it still silence he was getting stern now tell me right now  jack reevesanan another feller  wha d they do silence tell me  theypinched me anantalked mean to me she replied breaking down again with the memory of the insult  anson began to understand  wal there you dry yr eyes flaxie an go an git supper they wont do it againnot this harvest he added grimly as he marched to the door to enter the buggy  bert coming along from the barn and seeing anson about to drive away asked where he was going anson tried to look indifferent  oh ive got a little business to transact with reeves and some other smart aleck downtown  whats up what have they ben doing asked gearheart reading trouble in the eyes of his friend  well they have ben a little too fresh with flaxen today an need a lesson  theyre equal to it say anson let me go laying his hand on the dasher ready to leap in  no youre too brash you wouldnt know when to quit no you stay right here dont say anything to flaxen about it if she wants to know where im gone tell her i found i was out o nails  as anson drove along swiftly he was in a savage mood and thinking deeply two or three times of late some of his friends had touched rather freely upon the fact that flaxen was becoming a woman girls ripen early out in this climate one old chap had said and your little norsk there is likely to leave you one of these days he felt now that something deliberately and inexpressibly offensive had been said and done to his little girl he didnt want to know just what it was but just who did it that was all it was time to make a protest  hitching his horse to a ring in the sidewalk upon arrival he walked into the drug store which was also the postoffice young reeves was inside the postoffice corner giving out the mail and anson sauntered about the store waiting his chance  he was a dangerouslooking man just now ordinarily his vast frame huge grizzled beard and stern steady eyes would quell a panther but now as he leaned against the counter a shrewd observer would have said lookout for him hes dangerous  his gray shirt loose at the throat showed a neck that resembled the spreading base of an oak tree and his crossed limbs and halfrecumbent pose formed a curious opposition to the look in his eyes  nobody noticed him specially most comers and goers being occupied with their mail merely nodded and passed on  finally some one called for a cigar and reeves having finished in the postoffice department came jauntily along behind the counter directly to where anson stood as he looked casually into the giants eyes he started back but too late one vast hand had clutched him by the collar and he was jerked over the counter and cuffed from hand to hand like a mouse in the paws of a cat though ans used his open palm the punishment was fearful blood burst from his victims nose and mouth he yelled with fright and pain  the rest rushed to help  stand back this is a private affair said ans throwing up a warning hand they paused all knew his strength  it wasnt me screamed reeves as the punishment increased it was doc coe  coe his hands full of papers and letters horrified at what had overtaken reeves stood looking on but now he tried to escape flinging the battered halfsenseless reeves back over the counter where he lay in a heap anson caught coe by the coat just as he was rushing past him and duplicated the punishment ending by kicking him into the street where he lay stunned and helpless ans said then in a voice that the rest heard the next time you insult a girl youd better inquire into the qualities of her guardeen  this little matter attended to he unhitched his horse from the sidewalk and refusing to answer any questions rode off home outwardly as calm as though he had just been shaking hands  supper was about ready when he drove up and through the open door he could see the whitecovered table and could hear the cheerful clatter of dishes flaxen was whistling eight years of hard work had not done much for these sturdy souls but they had managed to secure with incredible toil a comfortable little house surrounded with outbuildings calves and chickens gave life to the barnyard and fields of wheat rippled and ran with swash of heavybearded heads and dapple of shadow and sheen  flaxen was now the housewife and daughter of these hardworking pioneers and a cheery and capable one she had become no one had ever turned up with a better claim to her and so she had grown up with ans and bert going to school when she could spare the time but mainly being adviser and associate at the farm  ans and bert had worked hard winter and summer trying to get ahead but had not succeeded as they had hoped crops had failed for three or four years and money was scarce with them but they had managed to build this small frame house and to get a little stock about them and this year with a good crop would swing clear and be able to do something for flaxenperhaps send her to belleplain to school togged out like a little queen  when anson returned to the house after putting out the horse he found bert reading the paper in the little sittingroom and flaxen putting the tea on the stove  wha d y do to him pap laughed she all her anger gone bert came out to listen  oh nothin pticlar answered ans flinging his hat at a chicken that made as though to come in and rolling up his sleeves preparatory to sozzling his face at the sink i jest cuffed em a little an let em go  is that all said flaxen disappointedly a comical look on her round face  now dont you worry put in bert ansons cuffin a man is rather severe experience i saw him cuff a man once it aint anythin to be desired a second time  they all drew about the table flaxen looked very womanly as she sat cutting the bread and pouring the tea she had always been old in her ways about the house for she had very early assumed the housewifes duties and cares her freshcoloured face beamed with delight as she watched the hungry men devouring the fried pork potatoes and cheese  when y goin to begin cuttin boys collectively they were boys to her but when addressing them separately they were bert and pap  tomorrow r nex day i guess answered anson looking out of the open door dont it look fineall yeller an green i tell ye they aint anything lays over a ripe field o wheat in my eyes you jest take it when the sun strikes it right an the wind is playin on itwhen it kind o sloshes around like wateran the clouds go over it droppin shadders down on it an a hawk kind o goes skimmin over it divin into it once in a while  he did not finish it was not necessary  yes sir adjudged gearheart after a pause leaning his elbows on the table and looking out of the door on the farstretching sunglorified plain  the harvest kind o justifies the winter we have out here that is when we have a harvest such as this fact is we fellers live six months o the year lookin ahead to harvest an tother six months lookin back to it well this wont buy the woman a dress ans we must get that header set up tonight if we can  they pushed their chairs back noisily and rose to go out flaxen said  say which o you boys is goin to help me churn tonight  anson groaned while she laughed  i dont know flax ask us an easier one  well attend to that after it gets too dark to work on the machine added bert  well see t y do i cant do it ive got bread to mix an a chicken to dress say if you dont begin cuttin till day after tomorrow we can go down to the sociable tomorrow night last one o the season  i wish it was the last one before the kingdom come growled bert as he stomped out the door theyre a bad lot the idea o takin down four dollars worth o grub an then payin four dollars for the privilege of eatin half of it ill take my chicken here when im hungry  bert aint partial to sociables is he pap laughed flaxen  i should hate to have the minister dependin on bert for a livin  saay pap  wal babe  i expect ill haf t have a new dress one o these days  think so  you bet  why whats the matter with the one y got on aint no holes in it that i can see looking at it carefully and turning her around as if she were on a pivot  well aint it purty short pap she said suggestively  i swear i dont know but it is conceded anson scratching his head i hadnt paid much tention to it before it certainly is a leetle too short lemme see aint no way o lettin it down is they  nary shes clean down to the last notch now replied flaxen convincingly  couldnt pull through till we thrash he continued still in a tentative manner  could but dont like to she answered laughing again and showing her white teeth pleasantly  i spose itll cost suthin he insinuated in a dubious tone  mattie stuart paid seven dollars fer hern pap an i  seven how manys  dollars pap makin an everythin an then i ought to have a new hat to go with the dress an a new pair o shoes all the girls are wearin white but i reckon i can git along with a good coloured one thatll do fer winter  wal all right ill fix itsome way ans said turning away only to look back and smile to see her dancing up and down and crying  oh goody goody  ill do it if i haf to borrow money at two per cent a month said he to bert as he explained the case hear her sing why dern it id spend all ive got to keep that child twitterin like that wouldnt you eh  bert was silent thinking deeply on a variety of matters suggested by ansons words the crickets were singing from out the weeds near by a lost little wild chicken was whistling in plaintive sweetness down in the barleyfield the flaming light from the halfsunk sun swept along the green and yellow grain glorifying as with a bath of gold everything it touched  i wish that grain hadnt ripened so fast ans its blightin  think so  no i know it i went out to look at it before supper an every one of those spots that look so pretty are just simply burnin up but say aint it a little singular that flaxen should blossom out in a desire for a new dress all at once aint it rather sudden  wal no i dont think it is come to look it all over up one side an down the other shes been growin about an inch a month this summer an her best dress is gittin turrible short the best way you can fix it shes gittin to be most a woman bert  yes i know she is said bert significantly an somethings got to be done right off  wha d ye mean by that ol man  i mean jest this its time we did something religious for that girl she aint had much chance since shes been here with us she aint had no chance at all now i move that we send her away to school this winter give her a good outfit an send her away this aint no sort o way for a girl to grow up in  wal ive ben thinkin o that myself but wherell we send her  oh back to the states somewhere wisconsin or minnesotasomewhere  why not to boomtown  well ill tell yeh ans ive been hearing a good eal off an on about the way were bringin her up here alone with two rough old codgers an i jest want to give her a better chance than the territory affords i want her to git free of us and all like us for a while let her see something of the world besides that business over in belleplain today kind o settled me the plain facts are ans the people are a little too free with her because she is growin up here  i know some fellers that wont be again  well they are beginnin to wink an nudge each other an to say  go on what do they say  they say shes goin to be a woman soon that this fatherly business is bound to play out  id like to see anybody wink when im around id smash em said anson through his set teeth why shes our little babe he broke out as the full significance of the matter came to him my little un im her ol pap why he ended in despair its none o their darn business  there aint no use o howlin ans you cant smash a whole neighborhood  but what are we goin to do  well ill tell ye what we mustnt do we mustnt tog her out jest yet  why not asked anson not seeing these subtle distinctions of time and place  because you tog her out this week or next without any apparent reason in a new hat an dress an gloves an go down to one o these sociables with her an youd have to clean out the whole crowd theyd all be winkin an nudgin an grinninsee  wal go on said the crushed giant whatll we do  just let things go on as they are for the present till we git ready to send her to school  but i promised the togs  all right ive stated the case gearheart returned with the air of a man who washed his hands of the whole affair  anson rose with a sudden gesture jest hear her whistlin away like a lark i dont see how im goin to go in there an spoil all her fun i cant do it thats all  well now you leave it all to me ill state the case to her in a way thatll catch hersee if i dont she aint no common girl  it was growing dark as they went in and the girls face could not be seen  well bert are y ready to help churn  yes i guess so if ansll milk  oh hell milk he jest loves to milk ol brindle when the flies are thick  oh you bet said ans to make her laugh  now flaxen coughed gearheart in beginning weve been discussin your case an weve come to the conclusion that you ought to have the togs specified in the indictment this to take away the gravity of what was to follow but were kind o up a tree about just what wed better do the case is this weve got to buy a horse to fill out our team an thats agoin to take about all we can rake an scrape  we may have to git our groceries on tick now if you could only pull through till after anson broke in  its purty tough flaxie an paps awful sorry but if you could jest pull through  it was a great blow to poor little flaxen and she broke down and cried unrestrainedly  iidont see why i cant have things like the rest o the girls it was her first reproach and it cut to the heart anson swore under his breath and was stepping forward to say something when gearheart restrained him  but y see flaxie we aint askin you to give up the dress only to wait on us for a month or so till we thrash  thats it babe said anson going over to where she sat with her arms lying on the table and her face hidden upon them we could spend dollars then where we couldnt cents now  and they wont be any more thingumiyjigs at the church anyhow an the wheats blightin on the knolls besides  but the first keen disappointment over she was her brave self once more  well all right boys she said her trembling voice curiously at variance with her words ill get along somehow but i tell you ill have something scrumptious to pay for thissee if i dont she was smiling again faintly itll cost moren one ten dollars for my togs as you call em now pap you go an milk that cow an bert you glue yerself to that churndasher an dont you stop to breathe or swear till its done  thats the girl to havethats our own flaxie she knows how hard things come on a farm cheered anson  i bet i do she said wiping away the last trace of her tears and smiling at her palpable hit and then began the thump of the dasher and out in the dusk anson was whistling as he milked  she went down to the sociable the next night in her old dress and bravely looked happy for paps sake bert did not go anson was a rather handsome old fellow huge bearded like a russian though the colour of his beard was a wolf brindle resembling a bunch of dry buffalograss bert was accustomed to say that he looked the father of the girl for she had the same robust development carried herself as erect and looked everybody in the eye with the same laughing directness  there were some sly remarks among a ribald few but on the whole everything passed off as usual they were both general favorites and as a matter of fact few people remarked that flaxens dress was not good enough she certainly forgot all about it so complete was her absorption in the gayety of the evening  wal now for four weeks hard times flaxen said anson as they were jogging homeward about eleven oclock  i can stand my share of it pap she stoutly replied im no chicken     chapter vii  after harvest   all through those four or five weeks at every opportunity the partners planned the future of their waif in the harvestfield when they had a moment together one would say to the other  well let her stay two years if she likes it eh  certainly she neednt come back till she wants to we may be rich enough to sell out then and move back ourselves im gittin tired o this prairie myself if we could sell wed put her through a whole course o sprouts  you bet sell when you can find a buyer ill sign the deed  all right  and then they would go to work again toiling and planning for the future every day during august these men worked with the energy of demons up early in the morning and out late at night harvesting their crop all day the header clattered to and fro with bert or ans astride the rudder a cloud of dust rolling up from the ground out of which the painted flanges of the reel flashed like swordstrokes all day and day after day while the gulls sailed and soared in the hazy air and the larks piped from the dun grass these human beings covered with grime and sweat worked in heat and parching wind and never for an hour did they forget their little waif and her needs and she did her part in the house she rose as early as they and worked almost as late it was miraculous they admitted  one night toward the last of the harvest they were returning along the road from a neighboring farm where they had been to head some late wheat the tired horses with downhung heads and swinging traces were walking sullenly but swiftly along the homeward road the wagon rumbling sleepily the stars were coming out in the east while yet the rose and amethyst of the fallen sun lighted the western sky through the air growing moist came the sound of reapers still going men were shouting blithely while voices of women and children came from the cabins where yellow lights began to twinkle  anson and bert blackened with dust and perspiration and weary to the point of listlessness sat with elbows on knees talking in low slow tones on the neverfailing topic crops and profits their voices chimed with the sound of the wagon  theres the light broke out ans rousing himself and the team flaxens got supper all ready for us shes a regular little trojan that girl is they aint many girls o fourteen that ud stay there contented all day alone an keep all the whole business in applepie order shell get her pay some day  well try to pay her but say ol man aint it about time to open up our plans to her  wal yes it is you kind o start the thing tonight an well have it over with  as they drove up flaxen came to the door hello boys what makes ye so late  finishin up a field babe all done  she clapped her hands and danced up and down  goody all done at last well yank them horses out o their harnesses an come to biscuits theyre jest sizzlin hot  all right well be there in about two jerks of a lambs tail in flytime bert grab a tug im hungry as a wolf  it was about the first of september and the nights were getting cool and the steaming supper seemed like a feast to the chilled and stiffened men coming in a little later and sitting down with the sound of the girls cheery voice in their ears the tea was hot so were the biscuits the pyramid of hot mashed potato had a lump of halfmelted butter in the hollow top and there were canned peaches and canned salmon  yes were about finished up harvestin said bert as they settled themselves at the table an its about time to talk about gittin you off to school  dont worry about that it aint no great job i reckon i can git ready in about seventeen jiffies stopwatch time  not if you are goin away off to some city in the east  yes but i aint y see  oh yes you are bert an ive ben talkin it all over fr the last three weeks were goin to send you back to st peter to the seminary  i guess not pap id like to know what you think youre adoin sendin me way back there boomtowns good enough fer me  there there flaxie dont git mad y see we think they aint anythin good enough for you nothin too good for a girl that stays to home an cooks fr two old cusses  you aint cusses youre jest as good as you can be but i aint agointhere  why not  cause i aint thats why  why dont y wan to go back there where the people have nice houses an where theys a good  well i dont know enough thats why i aint goin back to no seminary to be laughed at cause i dont know beans  but you do laughed bert with an attempt to lighten the gloomyou know canned beans  theyd laff at me i know an call me a little norsk she was ready to cry  ill bet they wont not when they see our new dress an our new gold watchdress jest the color o crowsfoot grass watch thirty carats fine id laugh to see em callin my babe names then  and so by bribing coaxing and lying they finally obtained her tearful consent they might not have succeeded even then had it not been for a young lady in boomtown who was going back to the same school and who offered to take her in charge but there was hardly a day that she did not fling herself down into a chair and cry out  i jest aint goin im all right here an i dont see why you cant let me stay here i aint made no fuss seems as if you thought it was fun fr me to go way off there where i dont know anythin an where i dont know anybody  but having come to a conclusion the men were relentless they hired sewinggirls and skirmished back and forth between boomtown and the farm like mad their steady zeal made up for her moody and fitful enthusiasm however she grew more resigned to the idea as the days wore on toward the departure though her fits of dark and unusual musing were alarming to anson who feared a desperate retreat at the last moment  he took her over to see miss holt one day but not before he had prepared the way  i spose things are in purty good shape around this seminary he asked  oh yes indeed there are three large buildings libraries picturegalleries and musicrooms the boardinghalls are carpeted and the parlors are really elegant  uhhum commented anson well now im goin to bring my girl over to see you an i guess it ud be jest as well if you didnt mention these fineries an things y see shes afraid of all such things it ud be better to tell her that things werent very gorgeous thereabout like the graded school in boomtown say she aint used to these musichalls an things kind o make her think st peter aint no great shakes anyhow  i see laughed the quickwitted girl and she succeeded in removing a good deal of flaxens dread of the seminary  wal babe tomorrow said anson as they were eating supper and he was astonished to see her break out in weeping  why dont you keep harpin away on that the whole while she exclaimed cant you leave me alone a minute seems to me youre jest crazy to git rid o me  oh we are put in bert were jest lickin our chops to git back to sour flapjacks an soggy bread jest seems as though we couldnt wait till tomorrow noon to begin doing our own cookin again  this cleared the air a little and they spent the rest of the evening without saying very much directly upon the departure the two men sat up late after flaxen had gone to bed there was the trunk and valise which would not let them forget even for a moment what was coming on the morrow every time anson looked at her he sighed and tried to swallow the lump in his throat  say bert lets let her stay if she wants to he said suddenly after they had been in silence for a long time  dont make a cussed fool of yourself ans growled bert who saw that heroic measures were necessary go to bed an dont you say another word weve got to take our medicine like men     chapter viii  an empty house   anson was the more talkative of the two next morning however  come come brace up babe anybody ud think wed lost all the rest of our family when were only doin the square thing by our daughter thats all why youll be as happy as a canary in lessn two weeks young folks is about the same everywhere an youll git acquainted in lessn two jiffies  they were on the road to boomtown to put flaxen on the train it was about the tenth of september early in the cold crisp air of a perfect morning in the south there was a vast phantom lake with duplicate cities here and there along the winding shores which stretched from east to west the grainstacks stood around so thickly that they seemed like walls of a great lowbuilt town the mirage bringing into vision countless hundreds of them commonly below the horizon  the smoke of steam threshingmachines mounted into the still air here and there and hung long in a slowly drifting cloud above the land the prairielark the last of the singing birds whistled softly and infrequently from the dry grass the gulls were streaming south from the lakes  they were driving her to boomtown to avoid the inquisitive eyes of the good people of belleplain i may break down an blubber said anson to bert an if i do i dont want them cussed idiots standin around laughinits better to go on the c b and q anyhow  notwithstanding his struggle to keep talk going anson was unsuccessful from the very moment that belleplain faded to an unsubstantial group of shadows and disappeared from the level plain into the air just as boomtown correspondingly wavered into sight ahead silence so profound was a restraint on them all and poor flaxen with wide eyes looked wistfully on the plain that stretched away into unknown regions she was thinking of her poor mother whom she dimly remembered in the horror of that first winter naturally of a gay buoyant disposition she had not dwelt much upon her future or her past but now that the familiar plain seemed slipping from her sight entirely she was conscious of its beauty and rapt with the associated emotions which came crowding upon her she felt as though she were leaving the tried and true for the unknown and uncertain  boys she said finally do you spose ive got any folks  i shouldnt wonder if y had babe somewhere back in the ol country  they couldnt talk with me if i could find em could they  i reckon not less you study so hard that you can learn their lingo said ans seeing another opportunity to add a reason for going to school  well boys thats what im goin to do an by an by well go over there an see if we cant find em wont we  thats the talk now youre gittin down to business rejoined ans  i spose st peter is a good eal biggern boomtown she said sighfully as they neared the emporium of the sleepy james  a little said the astute gearheart  the clanging of the engines and the noise of shouting gave her a sinking sensation in the chest and she clung to ansons arm as they drove past the engine she was deafened by the hiss of the escaping steam of the monster standing motionless headed toward the east ready to leap on its sounding way  on the platform they found miss holt and a number of other friends waiting there was a great deal of clanging and whanging and scuffling it seemed to the poor overwrought girl miss holt took her in charge at once and tried to keep her cheerful when they had checked her trunk and the train was about ready to start ans looked uneasy and fidgeted about bert looked on silent and dark flaxen with her new long dress and new hat looked quite the woman and miss holt greeted her as such indeed she kept so close to her that anson looked in vain for a chance to say something more which was on his mind finally as the train was about going he said hesitatingly  elga jest a minute she stared for a moment then came up to him  i didnt want to call y flaxen afore her he explained but youaintkissed us goodbye he ended hesitatingly  the tears were already streaming down her cheeks and this was too much she flung her arms about his neck and sobbed on his bosom with the abandon of girlish grief  i dont wan to go t all pap  oh yes y do elga yes y do dont mind us well be all right ill have bert writin a full half the time there kiss me goodbye an git onbert here too  she kissed him twice through his bristling moustache and going to bert offered her lips and then came back to anson and threw herself against his broad strong breast she had no one to love but these two it seemed as if she were leaving everything in the world anson took her on his firm arm and helped her on the car and followed her till she was seated beside miss holt  dont cry babe youll make ol pap feel turrible hell break right down here afore all these people an blubber if y dont cheer up why youll soon be as happy as a fly in soup goodbye goodbye  the train started and anson brushing his eyes with his great brown hand swung himself off and stood looking at her as the train passed him she rushed to the rear end of the car and remained there looking back at the little station till the sympathetic miss holt gently led her back to her seat then she flattened her round cheek against the pane and tried to see the boys when the last house of the town passed by her window she sank back in her seat and sobbed silently                                                i feel as if id ben attendin my own funeral said anson after they had got into their wagon and the train had gone out of sight in the haze of the prairie  well its pretty tough on that child to go off that way to her the world is all a great mystery when you an i go to heaven it wont be any greater change for us than this change for flaxenevery face strange every spot new  wal she aint far away but we can look out for her she aint poor nr fatherless as long as we live hey  and then silence fell on them as they were jogging homeward they saw the gray gulls rise from the sod and go home to the lake for the night they heard the crickets evening chorus broaden and deepen to an endless and monotonous symphony while behind fantastic thin and rainless clouds the sun sank in unspeakable glory of colour the air perfectly still was cool almost to frostiness and far above the fair stars broke from the lilac and gold of the sunflushed sky lights in the farmhouses began to appear  once or twice anson said shes about at summit now i hope shes chirked up  they met threshingcrews going noisily home to supper once they met an outfit engine tank separator all moving along like a train of cars while every few minutes the red light from the furnace gleamed on the man who was stuffing the straw into the furnacedoor bringing out his face so plainly that they knew him as the night grew deeper an occasional owl flapped across the fields in search of mice  were bound to miss her like thunder bert no two ways about that cant help but miss her on the cookin hey  bert nodded without looking up as they came in sight of home at last and saw the house silhouetted against the faintly yellow sky ans said with a sigh  no light an no singin there tonight     chapter ix  baching it again   the fact is flaxen has spiled us laughed anson a couple of days later when bert was cursing the soggy biscuit weve got so hightoned that we cant stand common cookin time was wed a thought ourselves lucky to git as good as that reclect them flapjacks we ust to make by mighty you could shoe a horse with em say i wish i could jest slip in an see what shes adoin about now hey  shes probably writin a letter she wont do much of anythin else for the first week  i hope youre right said anson  they got a queer little letter every wednesday each one for several weeks pitifully like the others      dear boys i thought i would take my pen in hand to tell you i dont     like it one bit the school is just as mene as it can be the girls     do laugh at me they call me toehead if i catch em right i will     fix their heads they is one girl who i like she is from pipestone     she dont know no moren i do she says my dress is prittyol nig an     the drake all rite i wish i was home elga  the wish to be home was in all these letters like a sob the men read them over carefully and gravely and finally anson would put them away in the bible bought on flaxens account for safekeeping  as the letters improved in form their exultation increased  say bert dont you notice she writes better now she makes big is now in place o little ones seems s if she runs the sentence all together though  shell come out all right you see she goes into the preparatory department where they teach writin an spellin youll see her hand improve right along now  and it did and she ceased to wail for home and ceased to say that she hated her studies  i am getting along splendid she wrote some weeks after this i like my teacher her name is holt she is just as nice as she can be she is cousin to the one who came with me i live with her uncle and i can go to soshibles whenever i want to but the other girls cant i am feeling pretty good but i wish you boys was here  she did not wish to be at home this time  winter shut down on the broad land again with that implacable remorseless brilliancy of fierce cold which characterises the northern plain stopping work on the farm and bolting all doors hardly a day that the sun did not shine but the light was hard white glittering and cold the winds treacherous the snow wild and restless there was now comparatively little danger of being lost even in the fiercest storms but still life in one of these little cabins had an isolation almost as terrible as that of a ship wedged amid the icefloes of the polar regions  day after day rising to feed the cattle night after night bending over the sooty stove listening to the ceaseless voice of the wind as it beat and brushed whispered moaned and piped or screamed around the windows and eavesthis was their life varied with an occasional visit to the store or the postoffice or by the call of a neighbour it is easy to conceive that flaxens bright letters were like bursts of birdsong in their loneliness many of the young men their neighbours went back east to spend the winterback to michigan iowa new york or elsewhere  ans why dont you go back an visit your folks asked bert one day ill take care o things  wal the fact is ive ben away so long they dont care whether im alive er dead i aint got no near relatives except a sister an shes got all the famly she can tend to  same here we aint very affectionate anyway our famly and i dont write still id like to go back just to see how they all are  why not go  well i dont know i guess i must one o these days ive kind o ben waitin till we got into a little better shape i hate to go back poor  so do i its hard work fr me to give up beat i aint goin to do it yet awhile  sometimes a neighbour dropped in during the middle of the day and on pleasant days they would harness up the team and take a drive down to the store and the postoffice but mainly they vegetated like a couple of huge potatoes in a cellar as did most of the settlers there was nothing else to do  it was the worst winter since the first that they had spent in the country the snow seemed never still it slid streamed rose in the air ceaselessly it covered the hay drifted up the barn door swept the fields bare and carrying the dirt of the ploughed fields with it built huge black drifts wherever there was a windbreak cornfield or other obstruction  there were moments when bert was wellnigh desperate only contact with hard work and cold winds saved him he was naturally a more ambitious more austere man than anson he was not content to vegetate but longed to escape he felt that he was wasting his life  it was in december that the letter first came from flaxen which mentioned will kendall      o boys i had the best time we had a party at our house and lots     of boys came and girls too and they were nice the boys i mean     will kendall he is the nicest feller you ever seen he has got     black eyes and brown hair and a gold watchchain with a locket with     some girls hair in it and he said it was his sisters hair but i     told him i didnt believe it do you we had cake and popcorn and     lasses candy and will he took me out to supper  bert was reading the letter and at this point he stopped and raised his eyes and the two men gazed at each other without a word for a long time then anson laughed  shes gittin over her homesickness shes all right now shes got out to a sociable  after that there was hardly a letter that did not mention kendall in some innocent fashion among the other boys and girls who took part in the sleighrides parties and sociables but the morbidly acute bert if he saw said nothing and anson did not see  who d y spose this kendall is asked anson one night late in the winter of gearheart who was reading the paper while his companion reread a letter from flaxen seems to me shes writin a good eal about him lately  oh some slick little drygoods clerk or druggist said bert with unwarrantable irritation  she seems to have a good eal to say about him anyway repeated anson in a meditative way  oh thats natural enough they are two young folks together replied bert with a careless accent to remove any suspicion which his hasty utterance might have raised in ansons mind  wal i guess youre right agreed anson after a pause relieved this relief was made complete when in other letters which came she said less and less about kendall if they had been more experienced they would have been disturbed by this suspicious fact  then again when anson wrote asking what has become of that kendall you wrote so much about she replied that he was there and began writing of him again in a careless sort of way with the craft of woman already manifest in the change of front  spring came again and that everrecurring miracle the good green grass sprang forth from its covering of ice and snow up from its hidingplace in the dark cold sod  again the two men set to work ferociously at the seeding up early in the wide sweet dawn toiling through the day behind harrow and seeder coming in at noon to a poor and badly cooked meal hurrying back to the field and working till night coming in at sundown so tired that one leg could hardly be dragged by the otherthis was their daily life  one day as they were eating their supper of sour bread and canned beans gearheart irritatedly broke out ans why dont you git married it ud simplify matters a good eal if you should old russ is no good  whats the matter with your gittin married replied anson imperturbably pinching oil the cooked part of the loaf skilfully leaving the doughy part  i aint on the marry thats all  neither am i  well you ought to be  dont see it  well now let me show it we cant go on this way im gittin so poor you can count my ribs through my shirt jest think how comfortable it would make things no more awful coffee no more canned baked beans no more cussed infernal everlastin leathery flapjacks no more soggy breadconfound it here he seized the round inner part of the loaf from which the crust had been flaked and flung it through the open door far down toward the garden  bert thats the last bit of bread weve got in the house  whats the odds we couldnt eat it  we could a baked it over  we could eat dog but we dont replied bert gloomily his temper was getting frightful of late  well be all right when flaxen comes back said ans laughing  say now youve said that a thousand times this winter you know well enough flaxens out o this we aint countin on her blurted gearheart just in the mood to say disagreeable things  wha d y mean aint she comin back in june  probably but she wont stay  no thats so shell have to go back in september but thats three months an we may sell out by that time if we have a good crop anyway well live high fer a spell we ought to have a letter from her tonight hadnt we  im goin down to see if youll wash the dishes  all right take a horse  no the horses are tired ill foot it  wal aint you too  want anythin from the store  yes git a hunk o bacon an some canned corn tomatoes an some canned salmon if y think we can stand the pressure bring home a can o peaches  and so gearheart started off for town in the dusk afoot in order to spare the horse as though he had not himself walked all day long in the soft muddy ground the wind was soft and moist and the light of the stars coming out in the east fell upon ins upturned eyes with unspeakable majesty yet he saw them but dimly he was dreaming of a face which was often in his mind nowa face not unlike flaxens only older more glorified more womanly he was asking himself some searching questions tonight as his tired limbs dragged themselves over the grassy road  what was he toiling for anyway what mattered all this terrible tramping to and frowas it an end or only a means would there ever come anything like satisfaction of desire life for him had been a silent gloomy and almost purposeless struggle he had not looked forward to anything very definite though vaguely he had hoped for something better  as his eyes fell upon the twinkling yellow lights of the village his thoughts came back to flaxen and to the letter which he expected to receive from her he quickened his steps though his feet were sore and his limbs stiff and lame  the one little street presented its usual saturdaynight appearance teams were hitched to the narrow plank walk before the battlemented wooden stores men stood here and there in listless knots smoking talking of the weather and of seeding while their wives surrounded by shy children traded within being saturday night the saloons were full of men and shouts and the clink of beer mugs could be heard at intervals but the larger crowd was gathered at the postoffice uncouth farmers of all nationalities clerks landsharks lawyers and giggling girls in couples who took delight in mingling with the crowd  judge sid balser was over from boomtown and was talking expansively to a crowd of leading citizens about a scheme to establish a horsecar line between boomtown and belleplain  colonel arran of the belleplain argus in another corner not ten feet away was saying that the judge was a scoundrel a blowhard and would down his best lover for a pewter cent to all of which the placid judge was accustomed and gave no heed  bert paid no attention to the colonel or to the judge or to any of this buzzing they are just talking to hear themselves make a noise anyway they talk about building up the countrythey who are a rope and a grindstone around the necks of the rest of us who do the work  when gearheart reached his box he found a large square letter in it and looking at it saw that it was from flaxen directed to anson her picture probably he said as he held it up as he was pushing rapidly out he heard a halfdrunken fellow say in what he thought was an inaudible tone  theres gearheart wonder whats become of his little norsk  gearheart turned and pushing through the crowd thrust his eyes into the face of the speaker with a glare that paralysed the poor fool  whats become o your sense he snarled and his voice had in it a carnivorous note  with this warning he turned contemptuously and passed out leaving the discomfited rowdy to settle accounts with his friends but there was a low note in the ruffians voice an insinuating inflection which stayed with him all along the way home like a bad taste in the mouth he saw by the aid of a number of these sidelights of late that flaxen never could come back to them in the old relation but how could she come back  gearheart stopped and gazed thoughtfully upward she must come back as the wife of ans or himself pooh she is only a child he said snapping his finger and walking on but the insistence remained she is not a childshe is a maiden soon to be a woman she has no relatives no home to go to but ours after her two or three years of schooling are over it must still be her home no breath of scandal shall touch her if i can prevent it and after her two years are upafter a long motionless reverie he strode forwardshe shall choose between us  there had grown up between the two friends of late a constraint or to be more exact gearheart had held himself in before his friend had not discussed these problems with him at all ans is just like a boy he had said to himself he dont seem to understand the case and i dont know as its my duty to enlighten him he either feels very sure about her or he has not understood the situation  he was thinking this now as he strode across the spongy sod toward the lighted windows of the shanty the air was damp and chill for the ice was not yet out of the ponds or swamps of tall grasses an occasional prairiecock sent forth a muffled drowsy boom lowhung flights of geese gabbling anxiously or the lessorderly ducks with hissing wings swept by overhead darkly limned against the stars there was a strange charm in the raw air the weary man almost forgot his pain as he drew deep breathings of the night  it was significant of the restraint that had grown up between him and anson that he held the letter from flaxen unopened in his hand simply because it was directed to his friend he knew that it was as much to him as to anson and yet feeling as he had of late he would not open it for he would have been angry if anson had opened one directed to him he simply judged anson by himself  the giant was asleep when he entered his great shaggy head lay beside the lamp on his crossed arms bert laid the letter down beside him and shook him  hello got back hey the sleeper said rousing up sluggishly anything then he caught sight of the letter oh bless her little heart wonder what it is picture bet my hat here he opened it  geewhittiker thunder and turf goshallfridaylook athere aint she growed he yelled holding the picture by the corner and moving it into all sorts of positions thats my little girlour flaxen she cant grow so purty but what id know her see that hair done up on the top of her head look at that dress an the thingumajigs around her neck oh shes gittin there smith hey  shes changing pretty fast said bert listlessly  changin fast say ol man whats the matter with you are y sick  im played out thats all  darn my skin i should think y would be draggin all day an then walkin all o four mile to the postoffice jest lay down on the bed there ol boy while i read the letter to yeh say ol man dont you git up in the mornin till you please ill look after the breakfast insisted anson struck with remorse by the expression on berts face but heres the letter short an sweet      dear boys bless the little fist that wrote that i send my     picture i think it is a nice one the girls say it flatters     me but will says it dont what the devil do we care what will     saysi guess it does dont you i wish i had a picture of     you both i want to show the girls how handsome you are she     means me of course no confound it how handsome you are both     of you i wish you would send me your pictures both of you i     aint got much to say i will write again soon      elga  bert looked at the picture over ansons shoulder but did not seem to pay much attention to it  wal ill go out an shut the barn door nights git cold after the sun goes down you neednt peel the taters tonight well bake em brussels an all tomorrow mornin  when anson had gone bert snatched up the picture with great eagerness and gazed upon it with a steady devouring glance how womanly she looked with her hair done up so and the broad fair face and full bosom  he heard anson returning from the barn and hastily laid the picture down and when anson entered was apparently dropping off to sleep     chapter x  flaxen comes home on a vacation   it was in june just before the ending of the school that flaxen first began to write about delaying her return anson was wofully disappointed he had said all along that she would make tracks for home just as soon as school was out and he had calculated just when she would arrive and on the second day after the close of school for the summer he drove down to the train to meet her she did not come but he got a letter which said that one of her friends wanted her to stay two weeks with her until after the fourth of july  shes an awful nice girl and we will have a grand time she has a rich father and a piano and a pony and a buggy it will just be grand  i dont blame her none sighed anson to bert i dont want her to come away while shes enjoyin herself itll be a big change for her to come back an cook fr us old mossbacks after bein at school an in good company all these months  he was plainly disturbed her vacation was going to be all too short at the best and he was so hungry for the sight of her still he could not blame her for staying under the circumstances as he told bert his feelings did not count he just wanted her to got all she could out of life there aint much anyway for us poor devils but what little there is we want her to have  the fourth of july was the limit of her stay and on the sixth seventh and eighth anson drove regularly to the evening train to meet her  on the third day another letter came saying that she would reach home the next monday with this anson rode home in triumph during the next few days he went to the barbers and had his great beard shaved off made me look so old he explained seeing berts wild start of surprise ive ben carryin that mop o hair round so long id kind o got into the notion o bein old myself got a kind o crick in the back y know but i aint i aint ten years oldern you be  and he was not his long blond moustache shaved beard and clipped hair made a new man of him and a very handsome man too in a large way he was curiously embarrassed by berts prolonged scrutiny and said jocosely  weve got to brace up a little now company boarders comin young lady from st peters seminary city airs an all that sort o thing dont you let me see you eatin pie with yr knife ill break the shins of any man that feeds himself with anythin cept the silverplated forks ive bought  flaxen had been gone almost a year and a year counts for much at her age besides anson had exaggerated ideas of the amount of learning she could absorb in a year at a boardingseminary and he had also a very vague idea of what society was in st peter although he seemed suddenly to awake to the necessity of bracing up a little and getting things generally into shape he bought a new suit of clothes and a secondhand twoseated carriage notwithstanding the sarcastic reflection of his partner who was making his own silent comment upon this thing  the paternal business is auskerspeelt he said to himself ans is goin in on shape now well its all right nobodys business but ours let her go smith but they wont be no talk in this neighbourhood when they get hold of whats goin onoh no he smiled grimly we can stand it i guess but itll be hard on her ans is a little too previous its too soon to spring this trap on the poor little thing  they stood side by side on the platform the next monday when the train rolled into the station at boomtown panting with fatigue from its long run flaxen caught sight of bert first as she sprang off the train and running to him kissed him without much embarrassment then she looked around saying  wheres ol pap didnt he  why flaxen dont ye know me he cried out at her elbow  she knew his voice but his shaven face so much more youthful was so strange that she knew him only by his eyes laughing down into hers nevertheless she kissed him doubtfully  oh whatve you done youve shaved off your whiskers you dont look a bit natural i  she was embarrassed almost frightened at the change in him he looked so queer his fair untroubled smiling face and blond moustache made him look younger than bert  nev mind that shell grow again if y like it better get int this new buggyits ours they aint no flies on us today not many said ans in high glee elaborately assisting her to the carriage not appreciating the full meaning of the situation  as they rode home he was extravagantly gay he sat beside her and she drove wild with delight at the prairie the wheat the gulls everything  aint no dust on our cloes said ans coughing winking at bert and brushing off with an elaborately finical gesture an imaginary fleck from his knee and elbow aint we togged out i guess nobody said boo to us down to st peter eh  you like my cloes said flaxen with charming directness  you bet theyre scrumptious  well they ought to be theyre my best except my white dress i thought youd like em i wore em apurpose  like em theyreyoure jest as purty as a red lily er a wild rose in the wheatahem aint she bert ol boy were jest about starvin to death we are  i knew youd be whatll i stir up for supper biscuits  um um say what y spose ive got to go with em  honey  oh youre too sharp wailed ans while flaxen went off into a peal of laughter say berts ben in the damnedestexcuse meplaguedest temper fer the last two munce as you ever did see  while this chatter was going on bert sat silent and unsmiling on the back seat he was absorbed in seeing the exquisite colour that played in her check and the equally charming curves of her figure she was well dressed and was wonderfully mature he was saying to himself ans aint got no more judgment than a boy we cant keep that girl here moren that the girl neverll be contented again unless he did not allow himself to go farther he dared not even think farther  they had a merry time that night quite like old times the biscuits were light and flaky the honey was delightsome and the milk and butter procured specially were fresh they shouted in laughter as flaxen insisted on their eating potatoes with a fork and opposed the use of the knife in scooping up the honey from their plates even the saturnine bert forgot his gloom and laughed too as ans laboriously dipped his honey with a fork and finally growing desperate split a biscuit in half and in the good old boyish way sopped it in the honey  there thats the christian way of doing things he exulted while flaxen laughed how bright she washow strange she acted there were moments when she embarrassed them by some new womanly grace or accomplishment some new air which she had caught from her companions or teachers at school it was truly amazing how much she had absorbed outside of her regular studies she indeed was no longer a girl she was a young woman and to them a beautiful one  not a day passed without some added surprise which made anson exult and say shes gettin her moneys worth down thereno two ways about that     chapter xi  flaxen grows restless   but as the excitement of getting back died out poor flaxen grew restless moody and unaccountable before she had always been the same cheery frank boyish creature as bert said you know where to find her now she was full of strange tempers and moods she would work most furiously for a time and then suddenly fall dreaming looking away out on the shimmering plain toward the east  at berts instigation a middleaged widow had been hired at a fabulous price to come and do the most of the work for them thus releasing flaxen from the weight of the hard work which perhaps was all the worse for her hard work might have prevented the unbearable sleepless pain within she hated the slatternly mrs green at once for her meddling with her affairs though the good woman meant no offence she was jocose in the broad way of middleaged persons to whom a loveaffair is legitimate food for raillery  but gearhearts keen eye was on flaxen as well he saw how eagerly she watched for the mail on tuesdays and fridays and how she sought a quiet place at once in order to read and dream over her letters she was restless a day or two before a certain letter came with an eager excited expectant air then after reading it she was absentminded flighty in conversation and at last listlessly uneasy moving slowly about from one thing to another in a kind of restless inability to take continued interest in anything  all this if it came to the attention of anson at all was laid to the schooling the girl had had  of course itll seem a little slow to you flaxie but harvestin is comin on soon an then thingsll be a little more lively  but gearheart was not so slowwitted he had had sisters and girl cousins and knew the symptoms as mrs green would have put it he noticed that when flaxen read her letters to them there was one which she carefully omitted he knew that this was the letter which meant the most to her he saw how those letters affected her and thought he had divined in what way  one day when flaxen after reading her letters sprang up and ran into her bedroom her eyes filled with sudden tears gearheart crooked his finger at ans and they went out to the barn together  it was nearly one oclock on an intolerable day peculiar to the dakota plain a frightfully hot withering and powerful wind was abroad the thermometer stood nearly a hundred in the shade and the wind so far from being a relief was suffocating because of its heat and the dust it swept along with it  the heavyheaded grain and russet grass writhed and swirled as if in agony and dashed high in waves of green and yellow the cornleaves had rolled up into long cords like the lashes of a whip and beat themselves into tatters on the dry smooth spot their blows had made beneath them they seemed ready to turn to flame in the pitiless furnacelike blast everywhere in the air was a silverwhite impalpable mist which gave to the cloudless sky a whitish cast the glittering gulls were the only living things that did not move listlessly and did not long for rain they soared and swooped exulting in the sounding wind now throwing themselves upon it like a swimmer then darting upward with miraculous ease to dip again into the shining hissing tumultuous waves of the grass  along the roads prodigious trains of dust rose hundreds of feet in the air and drove like vast caravans with the wind so powerful was the blast that men hesitated about going out with carriages and everybody watched feverishly expecting to see fire break out on the prairie and sweep everything before it work in the fields had stopped long before dinner and the farmers waited praying or cursing for the wheat was just at the right point to be blighted  as the two men went out to the shed side by side they looked out on the withering wheatstalks and cornleaves with gloomy eyes  another day like this an they wont be wheat enough in this whole county to make a cake said anson with a calm intonation which after all betrayed the anxiety he felt they sat down in the wagonshed near the horses mangers they listened to the roar of the wind and the pleasant sound of the horses eating their hay a good while before either of them spoke again finally bert said sullenly  we cant put up hay such a day as this you couldnt haul it home under lock an key while this infernal wind is blowin its gittin worse if anythin  anson said nothing but waited to hear what bert had brought him out here for bert speared away with his knife at a strip of board anson sat on a wagontongue his elbows on his knees looking intently at the grave face of his companion the horses ground cheerily at the hay  ans weve got to send flaxen back to st peter shes so homesick she dont know what to do  ans eyes fell  i know it ive ben hopin shed git over that but its purty tough on her after bein with the young folks in the city fr a year to come back here on a farm he did not finish for a moment but she cant stand it id looked ahead to havin her here till september but i cant stand it to see her cryin like she did today weve got to give up the idee o her livin here i dont see any other way but to sell out an go back east somewhere  bert saw that anson was still ignorant of the real state of affairs but thought he would say nothing for the present  yes thats the best thing we can do well send her right back an take our chances on the crops we can git enough to live on an keep her at school i guess  they sat silent for a long time while the wind tore round the shed bert spearing at the stick and anson watching the hens as they vainly tried to navigate in the wind finally anson spoke  the fact is bert this aint no place fr a woman anywaysuch a woman as flaxens gittin to be they aint nothin goin on nothin to see r hear you cant expect a girl to be contented with this country after shes seen any other no trees no flowers jest a lot o little shanties full o flies  i knew all that ans a year ago i knew shed never come back here but i jest said its the thing to dogive her a chance if we dont have a cent now lets go back to the house an tell her she neednt stay here if she dont want to  wha d ye spose was in that letter  couldnt say some girls description of a picnic er somethin bert was not yet ready to tell what he knew when they returned to the house the girl was still invisible in her room mrs green was busy clearing up the dinnerdishes  i dont knows i ever see such a wind back to michigan seems as if it ud blow the hair off yr head  oh this aint nothin this is a gentle zephyr wait till y see a wind  wal i hope to goodness i wont never see a wind zephyrs is all i can mortally stand  anson went through the little sittingroom and knocked on flaxens door  flaxie we want to talk to yeh there was no answer and he came back and sat down bert pointed to the letter which flaxen had flung down on the table the giant took it folded it up and called heres yr letter babe  the door opened a little and a faint tearful voice said  read it if ye want to boys then the door closed tightly again and they heard her fling herself on the bed anson handed the letter to bert who read it in a steady voice      dear darling i have good news to tell you my uncle was out     from wisconsin to see me and he was pleased with what i had     done and he bought out mr ford and gave me the whole half     interest im to pay him back when i please aint that     glorious now we can get married right off cant we darling     so you just show this letter to your father and tell

and talk things over if you cant come back soon i will     come on write soon      yours till death      will  from the first word anson winced grew perplexed then suffered his head drooped forward on his hands his elbows rested on his vast spread knees he drew his breath with a long grieving gasp bert read on steadily to the end then glanced at his companion with a deep frown darkening his face but he was not taken by surprise he had not had paternal affection change to the passion of a lover only to have it swept down like a halfopened flower for the first time in his life anson writhed in mental agony he saw it all it meant eternal separation it meant a long ache in his heart which time could scarcely deaden into a tolerable pain  gearheart rose and went out unwilling to witness the agony of his friend and desiring himself to be alone anson sat motionless with his hands covering his wet eyes going over the past and trying to figure the future  he began in that storm felt again the little form and face of the wailing child thought of the frightful struggle against the wind and snow of the touch of the little hands and feet of her pretty prattle and gleeful laughter then of her helpful and oddlywomanish ways as she grew older of the fresh clear voice calling him pap and ordering him about with a roguish air of her beauty now when for the first time he had begun to hope that she might be something dearer to him  how could he live without her she had grown to be a part of him he had long ceased to think of the future without her as he sat so the bedroom door opened and flaxens tearful face looked out at him he did not seem to hear and she stole up to him and putting her arm around his neck laid her cheek on his heada dear familiar childish gesture used when she wished to propitiate him he roused himself and put his arm about her waist tried to speak and finally said in a sorry attempt at humor wofully belied by the tears on his face and the choking in his throat  you tell that fellerif he wants ye to jest come angit yethats all     chapter xii  flaxen says goodbye   elga went back to her friends the holts in the course of a week it hurt anson terribly to see how eager she was to get away and he grew a little bittera quality of temper bert did not know he possessed  whats that little whippersnapper ever done for her that she should leave us in the shade fr himfrget us an all weve done fr her an climb out an leave us just at his wink it beats me but its all right i dont blame her if she feels soonly it does seem queer now dont it  it does thats a factspecially the idea of leaving us for a thing like that  after arriving at a complete understanding of the matter they said no more about it but went to work to make everything as pleasant for flaxen as possible again they rode down to the station with her down past the wide level fields of grain which the blazing sun had ripened prematurely again they parted from her at the train but this time the girl was eager to go and yet a peculiar feeling of sadness was mixed with her eagerness to be off  now boys youll come down just as soon as you can this fall wont you she said tearfully as they stood in the aisle of the car i wisht youd sell out an come back there an livei want you to  well well try anson said speaking with difficulty the lump in his throat was so big and so dry  they rode home in silence again but this time there was something darker and more sullen in their thoughts  well ans that settles it were orphaned again sure he tried to give a little touch of jocoseness to it but failed miserably  yes anson sighed deeply well haf t stand it i spose but its tough  it was hard but it would have been harder had not the rush and push of the harvest come upon them just as it did they never spoke of the matter again except as a matter settled till they received a letter from the young people asking their consent to an early marriage  they both read the letter and then anson said without raising his eyes  well what d you think of it  oh we might as well say yes replied bert irritably  but shes so young  she seems so to us but my mother was married at fifteen if shes going to leave us why the sooner she has a home the better i spose  i spose youre right but id rather have em put it off a year  oh a year wouldnt make any difference and besides you cant stop the thing now shes out of our hands  they wrote giving their consent and the wedding was fixed for late september to enable the falls work to be put out of the way for elgas sake they bought new suits and hats before starting on their trip though the harvest hardly justified any extravagance  under other circumstances they would have rejoiced over the trip for it was carrying them back to the gleam of leafdappled streams and waving trees and deep cool forests it made their nostrils dilate with pleasure as they whirled past fernfilled ravines out of which the rivulets stole with stealthy circuits under mossy rocks they were both forestborn and it was like getting back home out of a strange desert country to come back into the states  st peter was a small town situated on the steep bank of a broad riverthat is to say the business street was there but the seminary and the residence part of the town was on a high and beautiful plateau tho country was well diversified with wood and prairie  kendall and elga met them at the station elga with flushed face was searching the carwindows with eager glance when anson appeared on the platform the quick rush she made for him drove out all his bitterness it made him understand that she loved him as if he were her father  she greeted bert with a little less warmth and chattering with joy she led the way up the street with anson she had a hundred things to tell him and he listened in a daze she seemed so different from his flaxen bert walked behind with kendall who did not impress him favourably  he was a harmless little creature enoughsmall a little inclined to bowlegs and dudish in manner and dress his hair was smoothed till it shone like ebony and he wore the latest designs in standing collars high on his slim neck his hands were beautifully small and white and held several rings he had the manners of a drygoods clerk  he cant abuse her thats one good thing about the whelp thought bert as he crushed the young bridegrooms hand in his brown palm just to see him cringe  as for kendall he was a little afraid of these big fellows so sullen and strong and he tried his best to please them chirping away brightly upon all kinds of things ending up by telling them his business plans  were one o the best cities on the river couldnt be a better place fer a business stand dont you see and were getting to the front with our wholesale department of courseha ha my wifes father ought to know how im getting on so youre welcome to look over my books our trade is a cash trade so far as our retail trade goes and were mighty careful who gets tick from us on the wholesale trade were developing a great business  bert and anson made no replies to his chatter and he pattered along by ansons side like a small boy showing them the town and its beauties anson inwardly despised the little man but held it a sort of treason to think so and tried to look upon him kindly  the wedding took place in the house of the holt family and was in charge of miss holt elgas teacher kendalls parents could not be present which was a great disappointment to elga but will was secretly glad of it his father was a very crusty and brutal old fellow and he would not have fitted in smoothly beside bert and anson who were as uncomfortable as men could well be both wished to avoid it but dared not object  anson stood bravely through the ceremony as the father of the bride and bore himself with his usual massive rude dignity but he inwardly winced as he saw elga looking very stately and beautiful in her brides veil towering half a head above the sleekhaired little clerk not a few of the company smiled at the contrast but she had no other feeling than perfect love and happiness  when the ceremony was over and anson looked around for bert he was gone he couldnt stand the pressure of the crowd and the whispered comments and had slipped away early in the evening  among the presents which were laid on the table in the diningroom was a long envelope addressed to mrs will kendall it contained a deed for a house and lot in one of the most desirable parts of the suburbs it was from gearheart but there was no other written word this gift meant the sale of his claim in dakota  when anson got back to the hotel that night wondering and alarmed at his partners absence he found a letter from him it was savage and hopeless      this climate is getting too frigid for my lungs im going to     emigrate to california i made a mistake i ought to have gone in     for standup collars shiny hair and bowlegs youd better skip     back to dakota and sell your claim keep my share of the stock and     tools it aint worth bothering about dont try to live there     alone old man if you cant sell marry dont let that girl break     you all up too we are all fools but some can get over it quicker     than others      if that little bowlegged thing gets under your feet or abuses her     jest get your toe under him and hoist him over into the alley      goodbye and good luck old man      bert  and the next day the doubly bereaved man started on his lonely journey back to the dakota claim back to an empty house with a gnawing pain in his heart and a constriction like an iron band about his throat back to his broad fields to plod to and fro alone  as he began to realize it all and to think how terrible was this loss he laid his head down on the carseat before him and cried his first great trial had come to him and meeting it like a man he must now weep like a woman     chapter xiii  flaxens great need   flaxen wrote occasionally during the next year letters all too short and too far between for the lonely man toiling away on his brown farm these letters were very much alike telling mainly of how happy she was and of what she was going to do by and by on christmas or thanksgiving once she sent a photograph of herself and husband and anson after studying it for a long time took a pair of shears and cut the husband off and threw him into the fire  that fellow gives me the ague he muttered  bert did not write and there was hardly a night that ans lay down on his bed that he did not wonder where his chum was especially as the winter came on unusually severe reminding him of that first winter in the territory day after day he spent alone in his house going out only to feed the cattle or to get the mail the sad wind was always in his ears but with the passage of time the pain in his heart lost its intensity  one day he got a letter from flaxen that startled and puzzled him it was like a cry for help somehow  dear old pap i wish you was here and then in another place came the piteous cry oh i wish i had some folks  all night long that cry rang in the mans head with a wailing falling cadence like the note of a lost little prairiechicken  i wonder what that whelp has been doin now if hes begun to abuse her ill wring his neck she wants me an dasnt ask me to come poor chick ill be pap an mam to ye both he said at last with sudden resolution  the day after the receipt of this letter a telegram was handed to him at the postoffice which he opened with trembling hands      anson wood your daughter is ill wants you come at once      dr dietrich  he got into his wagon mechanically and lashed his horses into a run he must get home and arrange about his stock and catch the seven oclock train his mind ran the round of the possibilities in the case until it ached with the hopeless fatigue of it when he got upon the train for an allnight ride he looked like a man suffering some great physical pain  he sat there all night in a common seathe could not afford to pay for a sleeper sat and suffered the honest torture that can come to a manto sit and think the same dread apprehensive wondering thoughts to strain at the seat as if to push the train faster and to ache with the desire to fly like the eagle he tried to be patient but he could only grow numb with the effort  a glorious winter sun was beginning to light up the frost foliage of the maples lining st peters streets when anson stiff with cold and haggard with a night of sleepless riding sprang off the train and looked about him the beauty of the morning made itself felt even through his care these rows of resplendent maples heavy with iridescent frost were like fairyland to him fresh from the treeless prairie as he walked on under them showers of powdered rubies and diamonds fell down upon him the colonnades seemed like those leading to some enchanted palace such as he had read of in boyhood every shrub in the yards was similarly decked and the snug cottages were like the little house which he had once seen at the foot of the christmastree in a german church years before  feet crunched along cheerily on the sidewalks bells of drayteams were beginning to sound and workmen to whistle  anson was met at the door by a hardfaced middleaged woman  hows my girl he asked  oh shes nicely walk in  can i see her now  shes sleepin i guess you better wait a little while till after breakfast  wheres kendall was his next question  i dn know haint seen im sence yesterday he dont amount to much anyway and in these cases there aint no dependin on a boy like that its nachel fer girls to call on their mothers an fathers in such cases  anson was about to ask her what the trouble was with his girl when she turned away she could not be dangerously ill anyway there was comfort in that  after he had eaten a slight breakfast of bad coffee and yellow biscuits mrs stickney came back  shes awake an wants to see yeh now dont get excited she aint dangerous  anson was alarmed and puzzled at her manner her smile mystified him  what is the matter he demanded  her reply was common enough but it stopped him with his foot on the threshold he understood at last the majesty and mystery of birth was like a light in his face and dazzled him he was awed and exalted at the same time  open the door i want to see her he said in a new tone  as they entered the darkened chamber he heard his girls eager cry  is that you pap wailed her faint sweet voice  yes its me flaxie he crossed the room and knelt by the bed she flung her arms round his neck  o pappy pappy i wanted you oh my poor mamma o pap i dont like her she whispered indicating the nurse with her eyes o pap i hate to think of mother lying there in the snowan bertwhere is bert pap perhaps hes in the blizzard too  shes a little flighty said the nurse in her matteroffact tone  anson groaned as he patted the pale cheek of the sufferer  dont worry flaxie berts all right hell come home soon why dont you send for the doctor he said to the nurse  hell be here soon dont worry over that indicating flaxen who was whispering to herself they ofn do that  do you spose i can find my folks if i go back to norway she said to anson a little after  yes i guess so little one when you get well well try an see  perhaps if i found my aunt shed look like mamma an id know then how mamma looked wouldnt i perhaps if the wheat is good this year we can go back an find her cant we then her words melted into a moan of physical pain and the nurse said  now i guess youd better go an see if you cant hurry the doctor up yes now hes got to go she went on to flaxen drowning out her voice and putting her imploring hands back upon the bed  anson saw it all now in her fear and pain she had turned to himpoor motherless little birdforgetting her boyhusband or feeling the need of a broader breast and stronger hand it was a beautiful trust and as the great shaggy man went out into the morning he was exalted by the thought my little babemy flaxen he said with unutterable love and pity  again his mind ran over the line of his lifethe cabin the dead woman the baby face nestling at his throat the girl coming to him with her trials and triumphs his heart swelled so that he could not have spoken but deep in his throat he muttered a dumb prayer and how he suffered that day hearing her babble mixed with moanings every time the door opened once the doctor said  its no use for you to stand here wood it only makes you suffer and dont help her a particle  it seems s if it helped her an soi guess ill stay she may call for me an if she does he said resolutely im goin in doctor how is she now  shes slightly delirious now but still she knows youre here she now and then speaks of you but doesnt call for you  but she did call for him and he went in and kneeling by her side he talked to her and held her hands stroked her hair and soothed her as he need to when a little child unable to speak save in her pretty norseland tongue and at last when opiates were given and he rose and staggered from the room it seemed as though he had lived years  so weary was he that when the doctor came out and said you may go to sleep now he dropped heavily on a lounge and fell asleep almost with the motion even the preparations for breakfast made by the hoarsevoiced servantgirl did not wake him but the drawling nasal tone of kendall did he sat up and looked at the oily little clerk it was after seven oclock  hello said kendall when d you get in  shortly after you went out said anson in reply  kendall felt the rebuke and as he twisted his cuffs into place said well y see i couldnt do no gooda man aint any good in such cases anywayso i just thought id run down to st paul an do a little buying  anson turned away and went into the kitchen to wash his face and to comb his hair glad to get rid of the sight of kendall for a moment mrs stickney was toasting some bread  shes awake an wants to see you when you woke up its a girlthought id tell yeyes shes comfortable say tween you an me a man at ud run offwaal she ended expressively glancing at kendall  once more anson caught his breath as he entered the darkened chamber he was a rough untaught man but there was something in him that made that room holy and mysterious but the figure on the bed was tranquil now and the voice though weak and low was flaxens own  he stopped as his eyes fell on her she was no longer a girl the majesty of maternity was on her pale face and in her great eyes a faint expectant smile was on her lips her eyes were fixed on his face as she drew the cover from the little red weirdlywrinkled face at her throat  before he could speak and while he was looking down at the mite of humanity kendall stepped into the room  hello ellie how are  a singular revulsion came out on her face she turned to anson make him go way i dont want him  all right said kendall cheerfully glad to escape  isnt she beautiful the mother whispered does she look like me she asked artlessly  shes beautiful to me because shes yours flaxie replied anson with a delicacy all the more striking because of the contrast with his great frame and hard rough hands but there my girl go to sleep like baby an dont worry any more  you aint goin away while im sick she asked following him with her eyes unnaturally large  i wont never go way again if you dont want me to he replied  oh im so glad she sighed restfully  he was turning to go when she wailed reproachfully pap you didnt kiss baby  anson turned and came back shes sleepin an i thought it wasnt right to kiss a girl without she said so  this made flaxen smile and anson went out with a lighter heart than he had had for two years kendall met him outside and said confidentially  i dont spose it was just the thing for me to do butconfound it i never could stand a sickroom anyway i couldnt do any good anywayjust been in the way shell get over her mad in a few days think so  but she did not her singular and sudden dislike of him continued and though she passively submitted to his being in the room she would not speak a word to him nor look at him as long as she could avoid it and when he approached the baby or took it in his arms a jealous frown came on her face  as for anson he grew to hate the sound of that little chuckle of kendalls the part in the mans hair and the hang of his cutaway coat made him angry the trim legs a little bowed the big cuffs hiding the small cold hands and the peculiar set of his faultless collar grew daily more insupportable  say looky here kendall said he in desperation one day i wish you didnt like me quite so well we dont hitch first rateat least i dont seems to me youre neglectin your business too much  he was going to tell him to keep away but he relented as he looked down at the harmless little man with his thin boyish face  oh my business is all right gregory looks after it mostly anyhow but i say if you wanted to go into the dray business theres a firstclass opening now clark wants to sell  it ended in anson seeing clark and buying out his line of drays turning in his claim toward the paymenta transaction which made flaxen laugh for joy for she had not felt certain before that he would remain in st peter she was getting about the house now looking very wifely in her long warm wraps her slow motions contrasting strongly with the old restless springing steps anson remembered so well  night after night as he sat beside the fire and held baby listening to the changed voice of his girl and watching the grave new expressions of her face the tooth of time took hold upon him powerfully and he would feel his shaggy head and think ill soon be gray soon be gray while the little one cooed and sprang and pulled at his beard which had grown long again and had white hairs in it  kendall spent most of his time at the store or downtown somewhere and so all of those long delicious winter evenings were flaxens and ansons and his enjoyment of them was pathetic the cheerful little sittingroom the open grate the gracious evergrowing womanliness of elga the pressure of soft little limbs and the babble of a liquid baby language were like the charm of an unexpected indiansummer day between two gray november storms     chapter xiv  kendall steps out   one night kendall did not come home but as he had been talking of going to st paul they were not disturbed about itin fact they both took but very mild interest in his coming or going in the morning while they were at breakfast there came a knock at the door  come in shouted anson in the western way not rising  mcdaniel the county sheriff entered  wheres kendall he asked without ceremony  i dont know went away yesterday  the sheriff looked at his companion skipped between two days  whats up asked anson while elga stared and baby reached slyly for the sugarbowl  nothing the sheriff said in a tone which meant everything come out here he said to anson anson went out with him and he told him that kendall had purchased goods on credit and gambled the money away and was ruined  his stock of goods was seized and the house was saved only through the firmness of anson  flaxen shut her lips and said nothing and he could not read her silence one day she came to him with a letter  read that she exclaimed scornfully he saw that it was dated from eau claire wisconsin      dear darling wife im all right here with father it was all     gregorys faulthe was always betting on something im coming     back as soon as the old man can raise the money to pay fitch     dont worry about me they cant take the house anyway you     might rent the house sell the furniture on the sly and come     back here the old man will give me another show i dont owe     more than a thousand dollars anyway write soon your loving      will  she did not need to say what she thought of the advice the little villain gave  anson went quietly on with his work making a living for himself and flaxen and baby it never occurred to either of them that any other arrangement was necessary kendall wrote once or twice a month for awhile saying each time ill come back and settle up and asking her to come to him but she did not reply and never referred to him outside her home and when others inquired after him she replied evasively  hes in wisconsin somewhere i dont know where  is he coming back  i dont know  she often spoke of bert and complained of his silence once she said  i guess hes forgot us pap  i guess not more likely hes thinkin weve fergot him hell turn up some bright mornin with a pocketful o rocks he aint no spring chicken bert aint all the same i wisht hed write anson said to himself                                                the sad death of kendall came to them without much disturbing force he had been out of their lives so long that when anson came in with the paper and letter telling of the accident and with his instinctive delicacy left her alone to read the news flaxen was awed and saddened but had little sense of personal pain and loss  young kendall the newspaper went on under its scareheads was on a visit to la crosse and while skating with a party on the bayou where the la crosse river empties into the father of waters skated into an airhole the two young ladies with him were rescued but the fated man was swept under the ice he was the son etc  when anson came back flaxen sat with the letter in her hand and the paper on her lap she was meditating deeply but what was in her mind anson never knew she had grown more and more reticent of late she sighed rose and resumed her evening tasks     chapter xv  bert comes back   one raw march evening when the wind was roaring among the gray branches of the maples like a lion in wrath some one knocked on the door  come in shouted anson who was giving baby her regular ride on his boots  come in added flaxen  gearheart walked in slowly closed the door behind his back and stood devouring the cheerful scene he was poorly dressed and wore a wide limp hat they did not know him till he bared his head  bert yelled anson tossing the baby to his shoulder and leaping toward his chum tramping and shaking and clapping like a madman scaring the child  my goshallhemlock im glad to see ye gimme that paw again come to the fire this is flaxie as though he had not had his eyes on her face all the time ben sick  berts hollow cough prompted this question  yes had some kind of a fever down in arizony oh im all right now he added in reply to an anxious look from flaxen  an this is  babyelsie she replied putting a finishing touch to the little ones dress motherlike  wheres he he asked a little later  anson replied with a little gesture which silenced bert at the same time that it explained and when flaxen was busy a few moments later anson said  gone up the spout  at the table they grew quite gay talking over old times and berts pale face grew rosier catching a reflection of the happy faces opposite  say bert do you remember the time you threw that pan o biscuits i made out into the grass an killed every dog in the township then they roared  i remember your flapjacks that always split open in the middle an no amount o heat could cook em inside bert replied  then they grew sober again when bert said with a pensive cadence well i tell you those were days of hard work but manys the time ive looked back at em these last three years wishin theyd never ended an that wed never got scattered  we wont be again will we pap  not if i can help it anson replied  but how are you bert rich  bert put his hand into his pocket and laid a handful of small coins on the table  thats the size o my pilefour dollars he said smiling faintly the whole o my three years work  well never mind ol man ive got a chance fer yeh still an ol bach  still an old bach he looked at flaxen irresistibly drawn to her face she dropped her eyes she could not have told why  and so wood  gearheart was painted on the sides of the drays and they all continued to live in the little yellow cottage enjoying life much more than the men at least had ever dared to hope and little elsie grew to be a great girl and a nuisance with her desire to yide with ganpap  there is no spot more delightful in early april than the sunny side of the barn and ans and bert felt this though they did not say it the eaves were dripping the doves cooing the hens singing their harshthroated weirdly suggestive songs and the thrilling warmth and vitality of the sun and wind of spring made the great rude fellows shudder with a strange delight anson held out his palm to catch the sunshine in it took off his hat to feel the wind and mused  this is a great worldand a great day i wisht it was always spring  say began bert abruptly it seems pretty well understood that youre her fatherbut where do i come in  you ought to be her husband a light leaped into the younger mans face but go slow anson went on gravely this package is marked glass handle with care   the end     d appleton  cos
