96374358	illustration roland graeme and catherine seton before queen mary               the abbot  being the sequel to the monastery       by sir walter scott                              introduction1831  from what is said in the introduction to the monastery it must necessarily be inferred that the author considered that romance as something very like a failure it is true the booksellers did not complain of the sale because unless on very felicitous occasions or on those which are equally the reverse literary popularity is not gained or lost by a single publication leisure must be allowed for the tide both to flow and ebb but i was conscious that in my situation not to advance was in some degree to recede and being naturally unwilling to think that the principle of decay lay in myself i was at least desirous to know of a certainty whether the degree of discountenance which i had incurred was now owing to an illmanaged story or an illchosen subject  i was never i confess one of those who are willing to suppose the brains of an author to be a kind of milk which will not stand above a single creaming and who are eternally harping to young authors to husband their efforts and to be chary of their reputation lest it grow hackneyed in the eyes of men perhaps i was and have always been the more indifferent to the degree of estimation in which i might be held as an author because i did not put so high a value as many others upon what is termed literary reputation in the abstract or at least upon the species of popularity which had fallen to my share for though it were worse than affectation to deny that my vanity was satisfied at my success in the department in which chance had in some measure enlisted me i was nevertheless far from thinking that the novelist or romancewriter stands high in the ranks of literature but i spare the reader farther egotism on this subject as i have expressed my opinion very fully in the introductory epistle to the fortunes of nigel first edition and although it be composed in an imaginary character it is as sincere and candid as if it had been written without my gown and band  in a word when i considered myself as having been unsuccessful in the monastery i was tempted to try whether i could not restore even at the risk of totally losing my socalled reputation by a new hazardi looked round my library and could not but observe that from the time of chaucer to that of byron the most popular authors had been the most prolific even the aristarch johnson allowed that the quality of readiness and profusion had a merit in itself independent of the intrinsic value of the composition talking of churchill i believe who had little merit in his prejudiced eyes he allowed him that of fertility with some such qualification as this a crabapple can bear but crabs after all but there is a great difference in favour of that which bears a large quantity of fruit however indifferent and that which produces only a few  looking more attentively at the patriarchs of literature whose earner was as long as it was brilliant i thought i perceived that in the busy and prolonged course of exertion there were no doubt occasional failures but that still those who were favourites of their age triumphed over these miscarriages by the new efforts which they made their errors were obliterated they became identified with the literature of their country and after having long received law from the critics came in some degree to impose it and when such a writer was at length called from the scene his death first made the public sensible what a large share he had occupied in their attention i recollected a passage in grimms correspondence that while the unexhausted voltaire sent forth tract after tract to the very close of a long life the first impression made by each as it appeared was that it was inferior to its predecessors an opinion adopted from the general idea that the patriarch of ferney must at last find the point from which he was to decline but the opinion of the public finally ranked in succession the last of voltaires essays on the same footing with those which had formerly charmed the french nation the inference from this and similar facts seemed to me to be that new works were often judged of by the public not so much from their own intrinsic merit as from extrinsic ideas which readers had previously formed with regard to them and over which a writer might hope to triumph by patience and by exertion there is risk in the attempt  if he fall in good night or sink or swim  but this is a chance incident to every literary attempt and by which men of a sanguine temper are little moved  i may illustrate what i mean by the feelings of most men in travelling if we have found any stage particularly tedious or in an especial degree interesting particularly short or much longer than we expected our imaginations are so apt to exaggerate the original impression that on repeating the journey we usually find that we have considerably overrated the predominating quality and the road appears to be duller or more pleasant shorter or more tedious than what we expected and consequently than what is actually the case it requires a third or fourth journey to enable us to form an accurate judgment of its beauty its length or its other attributes  in the same manner the public judging of a new work which it receives perhaps with little expectation if surprised into applause becomes very often ecstatic gives a great deal more approbation than is due and elevates the child of its immediate favour to a rank which as it affects the author it is equally difficult to keep and painful to lose if on this occasion the author trembles at the height to which he is raised and becomes afraid of the shadow of his own renown he may indeed retire from the lottery with the prize which he has drawn but in future ages his honour will be only in proportion to his labours if on the contrary he rushes again into the lists he is sure to be judged with severity proportioned to the former favour of the public if he be daunted by a bad reception on this second occasion he may again become a stranger to the arena if on the contrary he can keep his ground and stand the shuttlecocks fate of being struck up and down he will probably at length hold with some certainty the level in public opinion which he may be found to deserve and he may perhaps boast of arresting the general attention in the same manner as the bachelor samson carrasco of fixing the weathercock la giralda of seville for weeks months or years that is for as long as the wind shall uniformly blow from one quarter to this degree of popularity the author had the hardihood to aspire while in order to attain it he assumed the daring resolution to keep himself in the view of the public by frequent appearances before them  it must be added that the authors incognito gave him greater courage to renew his attempts to please the public and an advantage similar to that which jack the giantkiller received from his coat of darkness in sending the abbot forth so soon after the monastery he had used the wellknown practice recommended by bassanio    in my school days when i had lost one shaft   i shot another of the selfsame flight   the selfsame way with more advised watch   to find the other forth  and to continue the simile his shafts like those of the lesser ajax were discharged more readily that the archer was as inaccessible to criticism personally speaking as the grecian archer under his brothers sevenfold shield  should the reader desire to know upon what principles the abbot was expected to amend the fortune of the monastery i have first to request his attention to the introductory epistle addressed to the imaginary captain clutterbuck a mode by which like his predecessors in this walk of fiction the real author makes one of his dramatis personae the means of communicating his own sentiments to the public somewhat more artificially than by a direct address to the readers a pleasing french writer of fairy tales monsieur pajon author of the history of prince soly has set a diverting example of the same machinery where he introduces the presiding genius of the land of romance conversing with one of the personages of the tale  in this introductory epistle the author communicates in confidence to captain clutterbuck his sense that the white lady had not met the taste of the times and his reason for withdrawing her from the scene the author did not deem it equally necessary to be candid respecting another alteration the monastery was designed at first to have contained some supernatural agency arising out of the fact that melrose had been the place of deposit of the great robert bruces heart the writer shrunk however from filling up in this particular the sketch as it was originally traced nor did he venture to resume in continuation the subject which he had left unattempted in the original work thus the incident of the discovery of the heart which occupies the greater part of the introduction to the monastery is a mystery unnecessarily introduced and which remains at last very imperfectly explained in this particular i was happy to shroud myself by the example of the author of caleb williams who never condescends to inform us of the actual contents of that iron chest which makes such a figure in his interesting work and gives the name to mr colmans drama  the public had some claim to inquire into this matter but it seemed indifferent policy in the author to give the explanation for whatever praise may be due to the ingenuity which brings to a general combination all the loose threads of a narrative like the knitter at the finishing of her stocking i am greatly deceived if in many cases a superior advantage is not attained by the air of reality which the deficiency of explanation attaches to a work written on a different system in life itself many things befall every mortal of which the individual never knows the real cause or origin and were we to point out the most marked distinction between a real and a fictitious narrative we would say that the former in reference to the remote causes of the events it relates is obscure doubtful and mysterious whereas in the latter case it is a part of the authors duty to afford satisfactory details upon the causes of the separate events he has recorded and in a word to account for every thing the reader like mungo in the padlock will not be satisfied with hearing what he is not made fully to comprehend  i omitted therefore in the introduction to the abbot any attempt to explain the previous story or to apologize for unintelligibility  neither would it have been prudent to have endeavoured to proclaim in the introduction to the abbot the real spring by which i hoped it might attract a greater degree of interest than its immediate predecessor a taking title or the announcement of a popular subject is a recipe for success much in favour with booksellers but which authors will not always find efficacious the cause is worth a moments examination  there occur in every country some peculiar historical characters which are like a spell or charm sovereign to excite curiosity and attract attention since every one in the slightest degree interested in the land which they belong to has heard much of them and longs to hear more a tale turning on the fortunes of alfred or elizabeth in england or of wallace or bruce in scotland is sure by the very announcement to excite public curiosity to a considerable degree and ensure the publishers being relieved of the greater part of an impression even before the contents of the work are known this is of the last importance to the bookseller who is at once to use a technical phrase brought home all his outlay being repaid but it is a different case with the author since it cannot be denied that we are apt to feel least satisfied with the works of which we have been induced by titles and laudatory advertisements to entertain exaggerated expectations the intention of the work has been anticipated and misconceived or misrepresented and although the difficulty of executing the work again reminds us of hotspurs task of oerwalking a current roaring loud yet the adventurer must look for more ridicule if he fails than applause if he executes his undertaking  notwithstanding a risk which should make authors pause ere they adopt a theme which exciting general interest and curiosity is often the preparative for disappointment yet it would be an injudicious regulation which should deter the poet or painter from attempting to introduce historical portraits merely from the difficulty of executing the task in a satisfactory manner something must be trusted to the generous impulse which often thrusts an artist upon feats of which he knows the difficulty while he trusts courage and exertion may afford the means of surmounting it  it is especially when he is sensible of losing ground with the public that an author may be justified in using with address such selection of subject or title as is most likely to procure a rehearing it was with these feelings of hope and apprehension that i venture to awaken in a work of fiction the memory of queen mary so interesting by her wit her beauty her misfortunes and the mystery which still does and probably always will overhang her history in doing so i was aware that failure would be a conclusive disaster so that my task was something like that of an enchanter who raises a spirit over whom he is uncertain of possessing an effectual control and i naturally paid attention to such principles of composition as i conceived were best suited to the historical novel  enough has been already said to explain the purpose of composing the abbot the historical references are as usual explained in the notes that which relates to queen marys escape from lochleven castle is a more minute account of that romantic adventure than is to be found in the histories of the period    abbotsford   1st january 1831                               introductory epistle  from the author of waverley to captain clutterbuck late of his majestys  regiment of infantry  dear captain  i am sorry to observe by your last favour that you disapprove of the numerous retrenchments and alterations which i have been under the necessity of making on the manuscript of your friend the benedictine and i willingly make you the medium of apology to many who have honoured me more than i deserve  i admit that my retrenchments have been numerous and leave gaps in the story which in your original manuscript would have run wellnigh to a fourth volume as my printer assures me i am sensible besides that in consequence of the liberty of curtailment you have allowed me some parts of the story have been huddled up without the necessary details but after all it is better that the travellers should have to step over a ditch than to wade through a morassthat the reader should have to suppose what may easily be inferred than be obliged to creep through pages of dull explanation i have struck out for example the whole machinery of the white lady and the poetry by which it is so ably supported in the original manuscript but you must allow that the public taste gives little encouragement to those legendary superstitions which formed alternately the delight and the terror of our predecessors in like manner much is omitted illustrative of the impulse of enthusiasm in favour of the ancient religion in mother magdalen and the abbot but we do not feel deep sympathy at this period with what was once the most powerful and animating principle in europe with the exception of that of the reformation by which it was successfully opposed  you rightly observe that these retrenchments have rendered the title no longer applicable to the subject and that some other would have been more suitable to the work in its present state than that of the abbot who made so much greater figure in the original and for whom your friend the benedictine seems to have inspired you with a sympathetic respect i must plead guilty to this accusation observing at the same time in manner of extenuation that though the objection might have been easily removed by giving a new title to the work yet in doing so i should have destroyed the necessary cohesion between the present history and its predecessor the monastery which i was unwilling to do as the period and several of the personages were the same  after all my good friend it is of little consequence what the work is called or on what interest it turns provided it catches the public attention for the quality of the wine could we but insure it may according to the old proverb render the bush unnecessary or of little consequence  i congratulate you upon your having found it consistent with prudence to establish your tilbury and approve of the colour and of your boys livery subdued green and pinkas you talk of completing your descriptive poem on the ruins of kennaquhair with notes by an antiquary i hope you have procured a steady horsei remain with compliments to all friends dear captain very much  yours c c c  the author of waverley                                        the abbot

douglas  the time which passes over our heads so imperceptibly makes the same gradual change in habits manners and character as in personal appearance at the revolution of every five years we find ourselves another and yet the samethere is a change of views and no less of the light in which we regard them a change of motives as well as of actions nearly twice that space had glided away over the head of halbert glendinning and his lady betwixt the period of our former narrative in which they played a distinguished part and the date at which our present tale commences  two circumstances only had imbittered their union which was otherwise as happy as mutual affection could render it the first of these was indeed the common calamity of scotland being the distracted state of that unhappy country where every mans sword was directed against his neighbours bosom glendinning had proved what murray expected of him a steady friend strong in battle and wise in counsel adhering to him from motives of gratitude in situations where by his own unbiassed will he would either have stood neuter or have joined the opposite party hence when danger was nearand it was seldom far distantsir halbert glendinning for he now bore the rank of knighthood was perpetually summoned to attend his patron on distant expeditions or on perilous enterprises or to assist him with his counsel in the doubtful intrigues of a halfbarbarous court he was thus frequently and for a long space absent from his castle and from his lady and to this ground of regret we must add that their union had not been blessed with children to occupy the attention of the lady of avenel while she was thus deprived of her husbands domestic society  on such occasions she lived almost entirely secluded from the world within the walls of her paternal mansion visiting amongst neighbors was a matter entirely out of the question unless on occasions of solemn festival and then it was chiefly confined to near kindred of these the lady of avenel had none who survived and the dames of the neighbouring barons affected to regard her less as the heiress of the house of avenel than as the wife of a peasant the son of a churchvassal raised up to mushroom eminence by the capricious favour of murray  the pride of ancestry which rankled in the bosom of the ancient gentry was more openly expressed by their ladies and was moreover imbittered not a little by the political feuds of the time for most of the southern chiefs were friends to the authority of the queen and very jealous of the power of murray the castle of avenel was therefore on all these accounts as melancholy and solitary a residence for its lady as could well be imagined still it had the essential recommendation of great security the reader is already aware that the fortress was built upon an islet on a small lake and was only accessible by a causeway intersected by a double ditch defended by two drawbridges so that without artillery it might in those days be considered as impregnable it was only necessary therefore to secure against surprise and the service of six able men within the castle was sufficient for that purpose if more serious danger threatened an ample garrison was supplied by the male inhabitants of a little hamlet which under the auspices of halbert glendinning had arisen on a small piece of level ground betwixt the lake and the hill nearly adjoining to the spot where the causeway joined the mainland  the lord of avenel had found it an easy matter to procure inhabitants as he was not only a kind and beneficent overlord but well qualified both by his experience in arms his high character for wisdom and integrity and his favour with the powerful earl of murray to protect and defend those who dwelt under his banner in leaving his castle for any length of time he had therefore the consolation to reflect that this village afforded on the slightest notice a band of thirty stout men which was more than sufficient for its defence while the families of the villagers as was usual on such occasions fled to the recesses of the mountains drove their cattle to the same places of shelter and left the enemy to work their will on their miserable cottages  one guest only resided generally if not constantly at the castle of avenel this was henry warden who now felt himself less able for the stormy task imposed on the reforming clergy and having by his zeal given personal offence to many of the leading nobles and chiefs did not consider himself as perfectly safe unless when within the walls of the strong mansion of some assured friend he ceased not however to serve his cause as eagerly with his pen as he had formerly done with his tongue and had engaged in a furious and acrimonious contest concerning the sacrifice of the mass as it was termed with the abbot eustatius formerly the subprior of kennaquhair answers replies duplies triplies quadruplies followed thick upon each other and displayed as is not unusual in controversy fully as much zeal as christian charity the disputation very soon became as celebrated as that of john knox and the abbot of crosraguel raged nearly as fiercely and for aught i know the publications to which it gave rise may be as precious in the eyes of bibliographers footnote the tracts which appeared in the disputation between the scottish reformer and quentin kennedy abbot of crosraguel are among the scarcest in scottish bibliography see mcries life of knox p 258 but the engrossing nature of his occupation rendered the theologian not the most interesting companion for a solitary female and his grave stern and absorbed deportment which seldom showed any interest except in that which concerned his religious profession made his presence rather add to than diminish the gloom which hung over the castle of avenel to superintend the tasks of numerous female domestics was the principal part of the ladys daily employment her spindle and distaff her bible and a solitary walk upon the battlements of the castle or upon the causeway or occasionally but more seldom upon the banks of the little lake consumed the rest of the day but so great was the insecurity of the period that when she ventured to extend her walk beyond the hamlet the warder on the watchtower was directed to keep a sharp lookout in every direction and four or five men held themselves in readiness to mount and sally forth from the castle on the slightest appearance of alarm  thus stood affairs at the castle when after an absence of several weeks the knight of avenel which was now the title most frequently given to sir halbert glendinning was daily expected to return home day after day however passed away and he returned not letters in those days were rarely written and the knight must have resorted to a secretary to express his intentions in that manner besides intercourse of all kinds was precarious and unsafe and no man cared to give any public intimation of the time and direction of a journey since if his route were publicly known it was always likely he might in that case meet with more enemies than friends upon the road the precise day therefore of sir halberts return was not fixed but that which his ladys fond expectation had calculated upon in her own mind had long since passed and hope delayed began to make the heart sick  it was upon the evening of a sultry summers day when the sun was halfsunk behind the distant western mountains of liddesdale that the lady took her solitary walk on the battlements of a range of buildings which formed the front of the castle where a flat roof of flagstones presented a broad and convenient promenade the level surface of the lake undisturbed except by the occasional dipping of a tealduck or coot was gilded with the beams of the setting luminary and reflected as if in a golden mirror the hills amongst which it lay embossed the scene otherwise so lonely was occasionally enlivened by the voices of the children in the village which softened by distance reached the ear of the lady in her solitary walk or by the distant call of the herdsman as he guided his cattle from the glen in which they had pastured all day to place them in greater security for the night in the immediate vicinity of the village the deep lowing of the cows seemed to demand the attendance of the milkmaidens who singing shrilly and merrily strolled forth each with her pail on her head to attend to the duty of the evening the lady of avenel looked and listened the sounds which she heard reminded her of former days when her most important employment as well as her greatest delight was to assist dame glendinning and tibb tackett in milking the cows at glendearg the thought was fraught with melancholy  why was i not she said the peasant girl which in all mens eyes i seemed to be halbert and i had then spent our life peacefully in his native glen undisturbed by the phantoms either of fear or of ambition his greatest pride had then been to show the fairest herd in the halidome his greatest danger to repel some pilfering snatcher from the border and the utmost distance which would have divided us would have been the chase of some outlying deer but alas what avails the blood which halbert has shed and the dangers which he encounters to support a name and rank dear to him because he has it from me but which we shall never transmit to our posterity with me the name of avenel must expire  she sighed as the reflections arose and looking towards the shore of the lake her eye was attracted by a group of children of various ages assembled to see a little ship constructed by some village artist perform its first voyage on the water it was launched amid the shouts of tiny voices and the clapping of little hands and shot bravely forth on its voyage with a favouring wind which promised to carry it to the other side of the lake some of the bigger boys ran round to receive and secure it on the farther shore trying their speed against each other as they sprang like young fawns along the shingly verge of the lake the rest for whom such a journey seemed too arduous remained watching the motions of the fairy vessel from the spot where it had been launched the sight of their sports pressed on the mind of the childless lady of avenel  why are none of these prattlers mine she continued pursuing the tenor of her melancholy reflections their parents can scarce find them the coarsest foodand i who could nurse them in plenty i am doomed never to hear a child call me mother  the thought sunk on her heart with a bitterness which resembled envy so deeply is the desire of offspring implanted in the female breast she pressed her hands together as if she were wringing them in the extremity of her desolate feeling as one whom heaven had written childless a large staghound of the greyhound species approached at this moment and attracted perhaps by the gesture licked her hands and pressed his large head against them he obtained the desired caresses in return but still the sad impression remained  wolf she said as if the animal could have understood her complaints thou art a noble and beautiful animal but alas the love and affection that i long to bestow is of a quality higher than can fall to thy share though i love thee much  and as if she were apologizing to wolf for withholding from him any part of her regard she caressed his proud head and crest while looking in her eyes he seemed to ask her what she wanted or what he could do to show his attachment at this moment a shriek of distress was heard on the shore from the playful group which had been lately so jovial the lady looked and saw the cause with great agony  the little ship the object of the childrens delighted attention had stuck among some tufts of the plant which bears the waterlily that marked a shoal in the lake about an arrowflight from the shore a hardy little boy who had taken the lead in the race round the margin of the lake did not hesitate a moment to strip off his wyliecoat plunge into the water and swim towards the object of their common solicitude the first movement of the lady was to call for help but she observed that the boy swam strongly and fearlessly and as she saw that one or two villagers who were distant spectators of the incident seemed to give themselves no uneasiness on his account she supposed that he was accustomed to the exercise and that there was no danger but whether in swimming the boy had struck his breast against a sunken rock or whether he was suddenly taken with cramp or whether he had overcalculated his own strength it so happened that when he had disembarrassed the little plaything from the flags in which it was entangled and sent it forward on its course he had scarce swam a few yards in his way to the shore than he raised himself suddenly from the water and screamed aloud clapping his hands at the same time with an expression of fear and pain  the lady of avenel instantly taking the alarm called hastily to the attendants to get the boat ready but this was an affair of some time the only boat permitted to be used on the lake was moored within the second cut which intersected the canal and it was several minutes ere it could be unmoored and got under way meantime the lady of avenel with agonizing anxiety saw that the efforts that the poor boy made to keep himself afloat were now exchanged for a faint struggling which would soon have been over but for aid equally prompt and unhopedfor wolf who like some of that large species of greyhound was a practised waterdog had marked the object of her anxiety and quitting his mistresss side had sought the nearest point from which he could with safety plunge into the lake with the wonderful instinct which these noble animals have so often displayed in the like circumstances he swam straight to the spot where his assistance was so much wanted and seizing the childs underdress in his mouth he not only kept him afloat but towed him towards the causeway the boat having put off with a couple of men met the dog halfway and relieved him of his burden they landed on the causeway close by the gates of the castle with their yet lifeless charge and were there met by the lady of avenel attended by one or two of her maidens eagerly waiting to administer assistance to the sufferer  he was borne into the castle deposited upon a bed and every mode of recovery resorted to which the knowledge of the times and the skill of henry warden who professed some medical science could dictate for some time it was all in vain and the lady watched with unspeakable earnestness the pallid countenance of the beautiful child he seemed about ten years old his dress was of the meanest sort but his long curled hair and the noble cast of his features partook not of that poverty of appearance the proudest noble in scotland might have been yet prouder could he have called that child his heir while with breathless anxiety the lady of avenel gazed on his wellformed and expressive features a slight shade of colour returned gradually to the cheek suspended animation became restored by degrees the child sighed deeply opened his eyes which to the human countenance produces the effect of light upon the natural landscape stretched his arms towards the lady and muttered the word mother that epithet of all others which is dearest to the female ear  god madam said the preacher has restored the child to your wishes it must be yours so to bring him up that he may not one day wish that he had perished in his innocence  it shall be my charge said the lady and again throwing her arms around the boy she overwhelmed him with kisses and caresses so much was she agitated by the terror arising from the danger in which he had been just placed and by joy at his unexpected deliverance  but you are not my mother said the boy recovering his recollection and endeavouring though faintly to escape from the caresses of the lady of avenel you are not my motheralas i have no motheronly i have dreamt that i had one  i will read the dream for you my love answered the lady of avenel and i will be myself your mother surely god has heard my wishes and in his own marvellous manner hath sent me an object on which my affections may expand themselves she looked towards warden as she spoke the preacher hesitated what he should reply to a burst of passionate feeling which perhaps seemed to him more enthusiastic than the occasion demanded in the meanwhile the large staghound wolf which dripping wet as he was had followed his mistress into the apartment and had sat by the bedside a patient and quiet spectator of all the means used for resuscitation of the being whom he had preserved now became impatient of remaining any longer unnoticed and began to whine and fawn upon the lady with his great rough paws  yes she said good wolf and you shall be remembered also for your days work and i will think the more of you for having preserved the life of a creature so beautiful  but wolf was not quite satisfied with the share of attention which he thus attracted he persisted in whining and pawing upon his mistress his caresses rendered still more troublesome by his long shaggy hair being so much and thoroughly wetted till she desired one of the domestics with whom he was familiar to call the animal out of the apartment wolf resisted every invitation to this purpose until his mistress positively commanded him to be gone in an angry tone when turning towards the bed on which the body still lay half awake to sensation half drowned in the meanders of fluctuating delirium he uttered a deep and savage growl curled up his nose and lips showing his full range of white and sharpened teeth which might have matched those of an actual wolf and then turning round sullenly followed the domestic out of the apartment  it is singular said the lady addressing warden the animal is not only so goodnatured to all but so particularly fond of children what can ail him at the little fellow whose life he has saved  dogs replied the preacher are but too like the human race in their foibles though their instinct be less erring than the reason of poor mortal man when relying upon his own unassisted powers jealousy my good lady is a passion not unknown to them and they often evince it not only with respect to the preferences which they see given by their masters to individuals of their own species but even when their rivals are children you have caressed that child much and eagerly and the dog considers himself as a discarded favourite  it is a strange instinct said the lady and from the gravity with which you mention it my reverend friend i would almost say that you supposed this singular jealousy of my favourite wolf was not only well founded but justifiable but perhaps you speak in jest  i seldom jest answered the preacher life was not lent to us to be expended in that idle mirth which resembles the crackling of thorns under the pot i would only have you derive if it so please you this lesson from what i have said that the best of our feelings when indulged to excess may give pain to others there is but one in which we may indulge to the utmost limit of vehemence of which our bosom is capable secure that excess cannot exist in the greatest intensity to which it can be excitedi mean the love of our maker  surely said the lady of avenel we are commanded by the same authority to love our neighbour  ay madam said warden but our love to god is to be unboundedwe are to love him with our whole heart our whole soul and our whole strength the love which the precept commands us to bear to our neighbour has affixed to it a direct limit and qualificationwe are to love our neighbour as ourself as it is elsewhere explained by the great commandment that we must do unto him as we would that he should do unto us here there is a limit and a bound even to the most praiseworthy of our affections so far as they are turned upon sublunary and terrestrial objects we are to render to our neighbour whatever be his rank or degree that corresponding portion of affection with which we could rationally expect we should ourselves be regarded by those standing in the same relation to us hence neither husband nor wife neither son nor daughter neither friend nor relation are lawfully to be made the objects of our idolatry the lord our god is a jealous god and will not endure that we bestow on the creature that extremity of devotion which he who made us demands as his own share i say to you lady that even in the fairest and purest and most honourable feelings of our nature there is that original taint of sin which ought to make us pause and hesitate ere we indulge them to excess  i understand not this reverend sir said the lady nor do i guess what i can have now said or done to draw down on me an admonition which has something a taste of reproof  lady said warden i crave your pardon if i have urged aught beyond the limits of my duty but consider whether in the sacred promise to be not only a protectress but a mother to this poor child your purpose may meet the wishes of the noble knight your husband the fondness which you have lavished on the unfortunate and i own most lovely child has met something like a reproof in the bearing of your household dogdisplease not your noble husband men as well as animals are jealous of the affections of those they love  this is too much reverend sir said the lady of avenel greatly offended you have been long our guest and have received from the knight of avenel and myself that honour and regard which your character and profession so justly demand but i am yet to learn that we have at any time authorized your interference in our family arrangements or placed you as a judge of our conduct towards each other i pray this may be forborne in future  lady replied the preacher with the boldness peculiar to the clergy of his persuasion at that time when you weary of my admonitions when i see that my services are no longer acceptable to you and the noble knight your husband i shall know that my master wills me no longer to abide here and praying for a continuance of his best blessings on your family i will then were the season the depth of winter and the hour midnight walk out on yonder waste and travel forth through these wild mountains as lonely and unaided though far more helpless than when i first met your husband in the valley of glendearg but while i remain here i will not see you err from the true path no not a hairsbreadth without making the old mans voice and remonstrance heard  nay but said the lady who both loved and respected the good man though sometimes a little offended at what she conceived to be an exuberant degree of zeal we will not part this way my good friend women are quick and hasty in their feelings but believe me my wishes and my purposes towards this child are such as both my husband and you will approve of the clergyman bowed and retreated to his own apartment     chapter the second     how steadfastly he fixd his eyes on me   his dark eyes shining through forgotten tears   then stretchd his little arms and calld me mother   what could i do i took the bantling home   i could not tell the imp he had no mother                          count basil  when warden had left the apartment the lady of avenel gave way to the feelings of tenderness which the sight of the boy his sudden danger and his recent escape had inspired and no longer awed by the sternness as she deemed it of the preacher heaped with caresses the lovely and interesting child he was now in some measure recovered from the consequences of his accident and received passively though not without wonder the tokens of kindness with which he was thus loaded the face of the lady was strange to him and her dress different and far more sumptuous than any he remembered but the boy was naturally of an undaunted temper and indeed children are generally acute physiognomists and not only pleased by that which is beautiful in itself but peculiarly quick in distinguishing and replying to the attentions of those who really love them if they see a person in company though a perfect stranger who is by nature fond of children the little imps seem to discover it by a sort of freemasonry while the awkward attempts of those who make advances to them for the purpose of recommending themselves to the parents usually fail in attracting their reciprocal attention the little boy therefore appeared in some degree sensible of the ladys caresses and it was with difficulty she withdrew herself from his pillow to afford him leisure for necessary repose  to whom belongs our little rescued varlet was the first question which the lady of avenel put to her handmaiden lilias when they had retired to the hall  to an old woman in the hamlet said lilias who is even now come so far as the porters lodge to inquire concerning his safety is it your pleasure that she be admitted  is it my pleasure said the lady of avenel echoing the question with a strong accent of displeasure and surprise can you make any doubt of it what woman but must pity the agony of the mother whose heart is throbbing for the safety of a child so lovely  nay but madam said lilias this woman is too old to be the mother of the child i rather think she must be his grandmother or some more distant relation  be she who she will lilias replied the lady she must have an aching heart while the safety of a creature so lovely is uncertain go instantly and bring her hither besides i would willingly learn something concerning his birth  lilias left the hall and presently afterwards returned ushering in a tall female very poorly dressed yet with more pretension to decency and cleanliness than was usually combined with such coarse garments the lady of avenel knew her figure the instant she presented herself it was the fashion of the family that upon every sabbath and on two evenings in the week besides henry warden preached or lectured in the chapel at the castle the extension of the protestant faith was upon principle as well as in good policy a primary object with the knight of avenel the inhabitants of the village were therefore invited to attend upon the instructions of henry warden and many of them were speedily won to the doctrine which their master and protector approved these sermons homilies and lectures had made a great impression on the mind of the abbot eustace or eustatius and were a sufficient spur to the severity and sharpness of his controversy with his old fellowcollegiate and ere queen mary was dethroned and while the catholics still had considerable authority in the border provinces he more than once threatened to levy his vassals and assail and level with the earth that stronghold of heresy the castle of avenel but notwithstanding the abbots impotent resentment and notwithstanding also the disinclination of the country to favour the new religion henry warden proceeded without remission in his labours and made weekly converts from the faith of rome to that of the reformed church amongst those who gave most earnest and constant attendance on his ministry was the aged woman whose form tall and otherwise too remarkable to be forgotten the lady had of late observed frequently as being conspicuous among the little audience she had indeed more than once desired to know who that statelylooking woman was whose appearance was so much above the poverty of her vestments but the reply had always been that she was an englishwoman who was tarrying for a season at the hamlet and that no one knew more concerning her she now asked her after her name and birth  magdalen graeme is my name said the woman i come of the graemes of heathergill in nicol forest footnote a district of cumberland lying close to the scottish border a people of ancient blood  and what make you continued the lady so far distant from your home  i have no home said magdalen graeme it was burnt by your borderridersmy husband and my son were slainthere is not a drops blood left in the veins of any one which is of kin to mine  that is no uncommon fate in these wild times and in this unsettled land said the lady the english hands have been as deeply dyed in our blood as ever those of scotsmen have been in yours  you have right to say it lady answered magdalen graeme for men tell of a time when this castle was not strong enough to save your fathers life or to afford your mother and her infant a place of refuge and why ask ye me then wherefore i dwell not in mine own home and with mine own people  it was indeed an idle question answered the lady where misery so often makes wanderers but wherefore take refuge in a hostile country  my neighbours were popish and massmongers said the old woman it has pleased heaven to give me a clearer sight of the gospel and i have tarried here to enjoy the ministry of that worthy man henry warden who to the praise and comfort of many teacheth the evangel in truth and in sincerity  are you poor again demanded the lady of avenel  you hear me ask alms of no one answered the englishwoman  here there was a pause the manner of the woman was if not disrespectful at least much less than gracious and she appeared to give no encouragement to farther communication the lady of avenel renewed the conversation on a different topic  you have heard of the danger in which your boy has been placed  i have lady and how by an especial providence he was rescued from death may heaven make him thankful and me  what relation do you bear to him  i am his grandmother lady if it so please you the only relation he hath left upon earth to take charge of him  the burden of his maintenance must necessarily be grievous to you in your deserted situation pursued the lady  i have complained of it to no one said magdalen graeme with the same unmoved dry and unconcerned tone of voice in which she had answered all the former questions  if said the lady of avenel your grandchild could be received into a noble family would it not advantage both him and you  received into a noble family said the old woman drawing herself up and bending her brows until her forehead was wrinkled into a frown of unusual severity and for what purpose i pray youto be my ladys page or my lords jackman to eat broken victuals and contend with other menials for the remnants of the masters meal would you have him to fan the flies from my ladys face while she sleeps to carry her train while she walks to hand her trencher when she feeds to ride before her on horseback to walk after her on foot to sing when she lists and to be silent when she bidsa very weathercock which though furnished in appearance with wings and plumage cannot soar into the aircannot fly from the spot where it is perched but receives all its impulse and performs all its revolutions obedient to the changeful breath of a vain woman when the eagle of helvellyn perches on the tower of lanercost and turns and changes his place to show how the wind sits roland graeme shall be what you would make him  the woman spoke with a rapidity and vehemence which seemed to have in it a touch of insanity and a sudden sense of the danger to which the child must necessarily be exposed in the charge of such a keeper increased the ladys desire to keep him in the castle if possible  you mistake me dame she said addressing the old woman in a soothing manner i do not wish your boy to be in attendance on myself but upon the good knight my husband were he himself the son of a belted earl he could not better be trained to arms and all that befits a gentleman than by the instructions and discipline of sir halbert glendinning  ay answered the old woman in the same style of bitter irony i know the wages of that servicea curse when the corslet is not sufficiently brighteneda blow when the girth is not tightly drawnto be beaten because the hounds are at faultto be reviled because the foray is unsuccessfulto stain his hands for the masters bidding in the blood alike of beast and of manto be a butcher of harmless deer a murderer and defacer of gods own image not at his own pleasure but at that of his lordto live a brawling ruffian and a common stabberexposed to heat to cold to want of food to all the privations of an anchoret not for the love of god but for the service of satanto die by the gibbet or in some obscure skirmishto sleep out his brief life in carnal security and to awake in the eternal fire which is never quenched  nay said the lady of avenel but to such unhallowed course of life your grandson will not be here exposed my husband is just and kind to those who live under his banner and you yourself well know that youth have here a strict as well as a good preceptor in the person of our chaplain  the old woman appeared to pause  you have named she said the only circumstance which can move me i must soon onward the vision has said iti must not tarry in the same spoti must oni must on it is my weirdswear then that you will protect the boy as if he were your own until i return hither and claim him and i will consent for a space to part with him but especially swear he shall not lack the instruction of the godly man who hath placed the gospeltruth high above those idolatrous shavelings the monks and friars  be satisfied dame said the lady of avenel the boy shall have as much care as if he were born of my own blood will you see him now  no answered the old woman sternly to part is enough i go forth on my own mission i will not soften my heart by useless tears and wailings as one that is not called to a duty  will you not accept of something to aid you in your pilgrimage said the lady of avenel putting into her hands two crowns of the sun the old woman flung them down on the table  am i of the race of cain she said proud lady that you offer me gold in exchange for my own flesh and blood  i had no such meaning said the lady gently nor am i the proud woman you term me alas my own fortunes might have taught me humility even had it not been born with me  the old woman seemed somewhat to relax her tone of severity  you are of gentle blood she said else we had not parleyed thus long togetheryou are of gentle blood and to such she added drawing up her tall form as she spoke pride is as graceful as is the plume upon the bonnet but for these pieces of gold lady you must needs resume them i need not money i am well provided and i may not care for myself nor think how or by whom i shall be sustained farewell and keep your word cause your gates to be opened and your bridges to be lowered i will set forward this very night when i come again i will demand from you a strict account for i have left with you the jewel of my life sleep will visit me but in snatches food will not refresh me rest will not restore my strength until i see roland graeme once more farewell  make your obeisance dame said lilias to magdalen graeme as she retired make your obeisance to her ladyship and thank her for her goodness as is but fitting and right  the old woman turned short around on the officious waitingmaid let her make her obeisance to me then and i will return it why should i bend to heris it because her kirtle is of silk and mine of blue lockeramgo to my ladys waitingwoman know that the rank of the man rates that of the wife and that she who marries a churls son were she a kings daughter is but a peasants bride  lilias was about to reply in great indignation but her mistress imposed silence on her and commanded that the old woman should be safely conducted to the mainland  conduct her safe exclaimed the incensed waitingwoman while magdalen graeme left the apartment i say duck her in the loch and then we will see whether she is witch or not as every body in the village of lochside will say and swear i marvel your ladyship could bear so long with her insolence but the commands of the lady were obeyed and the old dame dismissed from the castle was committed to her fortune she kept her word and did not long abide in that place leaving the hamlet on the very night succeeding the interview and wandering no one asked whither the lady of avenel inquired under what circumstances she had appeared among them but could only learn that she was believed to be the widow of some man of consequence among the graemes who then inhabited the debateable land a name given to a certain portion of territory which was the frequent subject of dispute betwixt scotland and englandthat she had suffered great wrong in some of the frequent forays by which that unfortunate district was wasted and had been driven from her dwellingplace she had arrived in the hamlet no one knew for what purpose and was held by some to be a witch by others a zealous protestant and by others again a catholic devotee her language was mysterious and her manners repulsive and all that could be collected from her conversation seemed to imply that she was under the influence either of a spell or of a vowthere was no saying which since she talked as one who acted under a powerful and external agency  such were the particulars which the ladys inquiries were able to collect concerning magdalen graeme being far too meagre and contradictory to authorize any satisfactory deduction in truth the miseries of the time and the various turns of fate incidental to a frontier country were perpetually chasing from their habitations those who had not the means of defence or protection these wanderers in the land were too often seen to excite much attention or sympathy they received the cold relief which was extorted by general feelings of humanity a little excited in some breasts and perhaps rather chilled in others by the recollection that they who gave the charity today might themselves want it tomorrow magdalen graeme therefore came and departed like a shadow from the neighbourhood of avenel castle  the boy whom providence as she thought had thus strangely placed under her care was at once established a favourite with the lady of the castle how could it be otherwise he became the object of those affectionate feelings which finding formerly no object on which to expand themselves had increased the gloom of the castle and imbittered the solitude of its mistress to teach him reading and writing as far as her skill went to attend to his childish comforts to watch his boyish sports became the ladys favourite amusement in her circumstances where the ear only heard the lowing of the cattle from the distant hills or the heavy step of the warder as he walked upon his post or the halfenvied laugh of her maiden as she turned her wheel the appearance of the blooming and beautiful boy gave an interest which can hardly be conceived by those who live amid gayer and busier scenes young roland was to the lady of avenel what the flower which occupies the window of some solitary captive is to the poor wight by whom it is nursed and cultivatedsomething which at once excited and repaid her care and in giving the boy her affection she felt as it were grateful to him for releasing her from the state of dull apathy in which she had usually found herself during the absence of sir halbert glendinning  but even the charms of this blooming favourite were unable to chase the recurring apprehensions which arose from her husbands procrastinated return soon after roland graeme became a resident at the castle a groom despatched by sir halbert brought tidings that business still delayed the knight at the court of holyrood the more distant period which the messenger had assigned for his masters arrival at length glided away summer melted into autumn and autumn was about to give place to winter and yet he came not     chapter the third    the waning harvestmoon shone broad and bright  the warders horn was heard at dead of night  and while the portalswide were flung  with trampling hoofs the rocky pavement rung                                          leyden  and you too would be a soldier roland said the lady of avenel to her young charge while seated on a stone chair at one end of the battlements she saw the boy attempt with a long stick to mimic the motions of the warder as he alternately shouldered or ported or sloped pike  yes lady said the boyfor he was now familiar and replied to her questions with readiness and alacritya soldier will i be for there neer was gentleman but who belted him with the brand  thou a gentleman said lilias who as usual was in attendance such a gentleman as i would make of a beancod with a rusty knife  nay chide him not lilias said the lady of avenel for beshrew me but i think he comes of gentle bloodsee how it musters in his face at your injurious reproof  had i my will madam answered lilias a good birchen wand should make his colour muster to better purpose still  on my word lilias said the lady one would think you had received harm from the poor boyor is he so far on the frosty side of your favour because he enjoys the sunny side of mine  over heavens forbode my lady answered lilias i have lived too long with gentles i praise my stars for it to fight with either follies or fantasies whether they relate to beast bird or boy  lilias was a favourite in her own class a spoiled domestic and often accustomed to take more licence than her mistress was at all times willing to encourage but what did not please the lady of avenel she did not choose to hear and thus it was on the present occasion she resolved to look more close and sharply after the boy who had hitherto been committed chiefly to the management of lilias he must she thought be born of gentle blood it were shame to think otherwise of a form so noble and features so fairthe very wildness in which he occasionally indulged his contempt of danger and impatience of restraint had in them something nobleassuredly the child was born of high rank such was her conclusion and she acted upon it accordingly the domestics around her less jealous or less scrupulous than lilias acted as servants usually do following the bias and flattering for their own purposes the humour of the lady and the boy soon took on him those airs of superiority which the sight of habitual deference seldom fails to inspire it seemed in truth as if to command were his natural sphere so easily did he use himself to exact and receive compliance with his humours the chaplain indeed might have interposed to check the air of assumption which roland graeme so readily indulged and most probably would have willingly rendered him that favour but the necessity of adjusting with his brethren some disputed points of church discipline had withdrawn him for some time from the castle and detained him in a distant part of the kingdom  matters stood thus in the castle of avenel when a winded bugle sent its shrill and prolonged notes from the shore of the lake and was replied to cheerily by the signal of the warder the lady of avenel knew the sounds of her husband and rushed to the window of the apartment in which she was sitting a band of about thirty spearmen with a pennon displayed before them winded along the indented shores of the lake and approached the causeway a single horseman rode at the head of the party his bright arms catching a glance of the october sun as he moved steadily along even at that distance the lady recognized the lofty plume bearing the mingled colours of her own liveries and those of glendonwyne blended with the hollybranch and the firm seat and dignified demeanour of the rider joined to the stately motion of the darkbrown steed sufficiently announced halbert glendinning  the ladys first thought was that of rapturous joy at her husbands returnher second was connected with a fear which had sometimes intruded itself that he might not altogether approve the peculiar distinction with which she had treated her orphan ward in this fear there was implied a consciousness that the favour she had shown him was excessive for halbert glendinning was at least as gentle and indulgent as he was firm and rational in the intercourse of his household and to her in particular his conduct had ever been most affectionately tender  yet she did fear that on the present occasion her conduct might incur sir halberts censure and hastily resolving that she would not mention the anecdote of the boy until the next day she ordered him to be withdrawn from the apartment by lilias  i will not go with lilias madam answered the spoiled child who had more than once carried his point by perseverance and who like his betters delighted in the exercise of such authorityi will not go to liliass gousty roomi will stay and see that brave warrior who comes riding so gallantly along the drawbridge  you must not stay roland said the lady more positively than she usually spoke to her little favourite  i will reiterated the boy who had already felt his consequence and the probable chance of success  you will roland answered the lady what manner of word is that i tell you you must go  will answered the forward boy is a word for a man and must is no word for a lady  you are saucy sirrah said the ladylilias take him with you instantly  i always thought said lilias smiling as she seized the reluctant boy by the arm that my young master must give place to my old one  and you too are malapert mistress said the lady hath the moon changed that ye all of you thus forget yourselves  lilias made no reply but led off the boy who too proud to offer unavailing resistance darted at his benefactress a glance which intimated plainly how willingly he would have defied her authority had he possessed the power to make good his point  the lady of avenel was vexed to find how much this trifling circumstance had discomposed her at the moment when she ought naturally to have been entirely engrossed by her husbands return but we do not recover composure by the mere feeling that agitation is mistimed the glow of displeasure had not left the ladys cheek her ruffled deportment was not yet entirely composed when her husband unhelmeted but still wearing the rest of his arms entered the apartment his appearance banished the thoughts of every thing else she rushed to him clasped his ironsheathed frame in her arms and kissed his martial and manly face with an affection which was at once evident and sincere the warrior returned her embrace and her caress with the same fondness for the time which had passed since their union had diminished its romantic ardour perhaps but it had rather increased its rational tenderness and sir halbert glendinnings long and frequent absences from his castle had prevented affection from degenerating by habit into indifference  when the first eager greetings were paid and received the lady gazed fondly on her husbands face as she remarked you are altered halbertyou have ridden hard and far today or you have been ill  i have been well mary answered the knight passing well have i been and a long ride is to me thou well knowest but a thing of constant custom those who are born noble may slumber out their lives within the walls of their castles and manorhouses but he who hath achieved nobility by his own deeds must ever be in the saddle to show that he merits his advancement  while he spoke thus the lady gazed fondly on him as if endeavouring to read his inmost soul for the tone in which he spoke was that of melancholy depression  sir halbert glendinning was the same yet a different person from what he had appeared in his early years the fiery freedom of the aspiring youth had given place to the steady and stern composure of the approved soldier and skilful politician there were deep traces of care on those noble features over which each emotion used formerly to pass like light clouds across a summer sky that sky was now not perhaps clouded but still and grave like that of the sober autumn evening the forehead was higher and more bare than in early youth and the locks which still clustered thick and dark on the warriors head were worn away at the temples not by age but by the constant pressure of the steel cap or helmet his beard according to the fashion of the time grew short and thick and was turned into mustaches on the upper lip and peaked at the extremity the cheek weatherbeaten and embrowned had lost the glow of youth but showed the vigorous complexion of active and confirmed manhood halbert glendinning was in a word a knight to ride at a kings right hand to bear his banner in war and to be his counsellor in time of peace for his looks expressed the considerate firmness which can resolve wisely and dare boldly still over these noble features there now spread an air of dejection of which perhaps the owner was not conscious but which did not escape the observation of his anxious and affectionate partner  something has happened or is about to happen said the lady of avenel this sadness sits not on your brow without causemisfortune national or particular must needs be at hand  there is nothing new that i wot of said halbert glendinning but there is little of evil which can befall a kingdom that may not be apprehended in this unhappy and divided realm  nay then said the lady i see there hath really been some fatal work on foot my lord of murray has not so long detained you at holyrood save that he wanted your help in some weighty purpose  i have not been at holyrood mary answered the knight i have been several weeks abroad  abroad and sent me no word replied the lady  what would the knowledge have availed but to have rendered you unhappy my love replied the knight your thoughts would have converted the slightest breeze that curled your own lake into a tempest raging in the german ocean  and have you then really crossed the sea said the lady to whom the very idea of an element which she had never seen conveyed notions of terror and of wonderreally left your own native land and trodden distant shores where the scottish tongue is unheard and unknown  really and really said the knight taking her hand in affectionate playfulness i have done this marvellous deedhave rolled on the ocean for three days and three nights with the deep green waves dashing by the side of my pillow and but a thin plank to divide me from it  indeed my halbert said the lady that was a tempting of divine providence i never bade you unbuckle the sword from your side or lay the lance from your handi never bade you sit still when your honour called you to rise and ride but are not blade and spear dangers enough for one mans life and why would you trust rough waves and raging seas  we have in germany and in the low countries as they are called answered glendinning men who are united with us in faith and with whom it is fitting we should unite in alliance to some of these i was despatched on business as important as it was secret i went in safety and i returned in security there is more danger to a mans life betwixt this and holyrood than are in all the seas that wash the lowlands of holland  and the country my halbert and the people said the lady are they like our kindly scots or what bearing have they to strangers  they are a people mary strong in their wealth which renders all other nations weak and weak in those arts of war by which other nations are strong  i do not understand you said the lady  the hollander and the fleming mary pour forth their spirit in trade and not in war their wealth purchases them the arms of foreign soldiers by whose aid they defend it they erect dikes on the seashore to protect the land which they have won and they levy regiments of the stubborn switzers and hardy germans to protect the treasures which they have amassed and thus they are strong in their weakness for the very wealth which tempts their masters to despoil them arms strangers in their behalf  the slothful hinds exclaimed mary thinking and feeling like a scotswoman of the period have they hands and fight not for the land which bore them they should be notched off at the elbow  nay that were but hard justice answered her husband for their hands serve their country though not in battle like ours look at these barren hills mary and at that deep winding vale by which the cattle are even now returning from their scanty browse the hand of the industrious fleming would cover these mountains with wood and raise corn where we now see a starved and scanty sward of heath and ling it grieves me mary when i look on that land and think what benefit it might receive from such men as i have lately seenmen who seek not the idle fame derived from dead ancestors or the bloody renown won in modern broils but tread along the land as preservers and improvers not as tyrants and destroyers  these amendments would here be but a vain fancy my halbert answered the lady of avenel the trees would be burned by the english foemen ere they ceased to be shrubs and the grain that you raised would be gathered in by the first neighbour that possessed more riders than follow your train why should you repine at this the fate that made you scotsman by birth gave you head and heart and hand to uphold the name as it must needs be upheld  it gave me no name to uphold said halbert pacing the floor slowly my arm has been foremost in every strifemy voice has been heard in every council nor have the wisest rebuked me the crafty lethington the deep and dark morton have held secret council with me and grange and lindsay have owned that in the field i did the devoir of a gallant knightbut let the emergence be passed when they need my head and hand and they only know me as son of the obscure portioner of glendearg  this was a theme which the lady always dreaded for the rank conferred on her husband the favour in which he was held by the powerful earl of murray and the high talents by which he vindicated his right to that rank and that favour were qualities which rather increased than diminished the envy which was harboured against sir halbert glendinning among a proud aristocracy as a person originally of inferior and obscure birth who had risen to his present eminence solely by his personal merit the natural firmness of his mind did not enable him to despise the ideal advantages of a higher pedigree which were held in such universal esteem by all with whom he conversed and so open are the noblest minds to jealous inconsistencies that there were moments in which he felt mortified that his lady should possess those advantages of birth and high descent which he himself did not enjoy and regretted that his importance as the proprietor of avenel was qualified by his possessing it only as the husband of the heiress he was not so unjust as to permit any unworthy feelings to retain permanent possession of his mind but yet they recurred from time to time and did not escape his ladys anxious observation  had we been blessed with children she was wont on such occasions to say to herself had our blood been united in a son who might have joined my advantages of descent with my husbands personal worth these painful and irksome reflections had not disturbed our union even for a moment but the existence of such an heir in whom our affections as well as our pretensions might have centred has been denied to us  with such mutual feelings it cannot be wondered that it gave the lady pain to hear her husband verging towards this topic of mutual discontent on the present as on other similar occasions she endeavoured to divert the knights thoughts from this painful channel  how can you she said suffer yourself to dwell upon things which profit nothing have you indeed no name to uphold you the good and the brave the wise in council and the strong in battle have you not to support the reputation your own deeds have won a reputation more honourable than mere ancestry can supply good men love and honour you the wicked fear and the turbulent obey you and is it not necessary you should exert yourself to ensure the endurance of that love that honour and wholesome fear and that necessary obedience  as she thus spoke the eye of her husband caught from hers courage and comfort and it lightened as he took her hand and replied it is most true my mary and i deserve thy rebuke who forget what i am in repining because i am not what i cannot be i am now what the most famed ancestors of those i envy were the mean man raised into eminence by his own exertions and sure it is a boast as honourable to have those capacities which are necessary to the foundation of a family as to be descended from one who possessed them some centuries before the hay of loncarty who bequeathed his bloody yoke to his lineagethe dark gray man who first founded the house of douglas had yet less of ancestry to boast than i have for thou knowest mary that my name derives itself from a line of ancient warriors although my immediate forefathers preferred the humble station in which thou didst first find them and war and counsel are not less proper to the house of glendonwyne even in its most remote descendants than to the proudest of their baronage footnote this was a house of ancient descent and superior consequence including persons who fought at bannockburn and otterburn and closely connected by alliance and friendship with the great earls of douglas the knight in this story argues as most scotsmen would do in his situation for all of the same clan are popularly considered as descended from the same stock and as having a right to the ancestral honor of the chief branch this opinion though sometimes ideal is so strong even at this day of innovation that it may be observed as a national difference between my countrymen and the english if you ask an englishman of good birth whether a person of the same name be connected with him he answers if in dubio nohe is a mere namesake ask a similar question of a scot i mean a scotsman he replieshe is one of our clan i daresay there is a relationship though i do not know how distant the englishman thinks of discountenancing a species of rivalry in society the scotsmans answer is grounded on the ancient idea of strengthening the clan  he strode across the hall as he spoke and the lady smiled internally to observe how much his mind dwelt upon the prerogatives of birth and endeavoured to establish his claims however remote to a share in them at the very moment when he affected to hold them in contempt it will easily be guessed however that she permitted no symptom to escape her that could show she was sensible of the weakness of her husband a perspicacity which perhaps his proud spirit could not very easily have brooked  as he returned from the extremity of the hall to which he had stalked while in the act of vindicating the title of the house of glendonwyne in its most remote branches to the full privileges of aristocracy where he said is wolf i have not seen him since my return and he was usually the first to welcome my homecoming  wolf said the lady with a slight degree of embarrassment for which perhaps she would have found it difficult to assign any reason even to herself wolf is chained up for the present he hath been surly to my page  wolf chained upand wolf surly to your page answered sir halbert glendinning wolf never was surly to any one and the chain will either break his spirit or render him savageso ho thereset wolf free directly  he was obeyed and the huge dog rushed into the hall disturbing by his unwieldy and boisterous gambols the whole economy of reels rocks and distaffs with which the maidens of the household were employed when the arrival of their lord was a signal to them to withdraw and extracting from lilias who was summoned to put them again in order the natural observation that the lairds pet was as troublesome as the ladys page  and who is this page mary said the knight his attention again called to the subject by the observation of the waitingwomanwho is this page whom every one seems to weigh in the balance with my old friend and favourite wolfwhen did you aspire to the dignity of keeping a page or who is the boy  i trust my halbert said the lady not without a blush you will not think your wife entitled to less attendance than other ladies of her quality  nay dame mary answered the knight it is enough you desire such an attendantyet i have never loved to nurse such useless menialsa ladys pageit may well suit the proud english dames to have a slender youth to bear their trains from bower to hall fan them when they slumber and touch the lute for them when they please to listen but our scottish matrons were wont to be above such vanities and our scottish youth ought to be bred to the spear and the stirrup  nay but my husband said the lady i did but jest when i called this boy my page he is in sooth a little orphan whom we saved from perishing in the lake and whom i have since kept in the castle out of charitylilias bring little roland hither  roland entered accordingly and flying to the ladys side took hold of the plaits of her gown and then turned round and gazed with an attention not unmingled with fear upon the stately form of the knightroland said the lady go kiss the hand of the noble knight and ask him to be thy protectorbut roland obeyed not and keeping his station continued to gaze fixedly and timidly on sir halbert glendinninggo to the knight boy said the lady what dost thou fear child go kiss sir halberts hand  i will kiss no hand save yours lady answered the boy  nay but do as you are commanded child replied the ladyhe is dashed by your presence she said apologizing to her husband but is he not a handsome boy  and so is wolf said sir halbert as he patted his huge fourfooted favourite a handsome dog but he has this double advantage over your new favourite that he does what he is commanded and hears not when he is praised  nay now you are displeased with me replied the lady and yet why should you be so there is nothing wrong in relieving the distressed orphan or in loving that which is in itself lovely and deserving of affection but you have seen mr warden at edinburgh and he has set you against the poor boy  my dear mary answered her husband mr warden better knows his place than to presume to interfere either in your affairs or mine i neither blame your relieving this boy nor your kindness for him but i think considering his birth and prospects you ought not to treat him with injudicious fondness which can only end in rendering him unfit for the humble situation to which heaven has designed him  nay but my halbert do but look at the boy said the lady and see whether he has not the air of being intended by heaven for something nobler than a mere peasant may he not be designed as others have been to rise out of a humble situation into honour and eminence  thus far had she proceeded when the consciousness that she was treading upon delicate ground at once occurred to her and induced her to take the most natural but the worst of all courses in such occasions whether in conversation or in an actual bog namely that of stopping suddenly short in the illustration which she had commenced her brow crimsoned and that of sir halbert glendinning was slightly overcast but it was only for an instant for he was incapable of mistaking his ladys meaning or supposing that she meant intentional disrespect to him  be it as you please my love he replied i owe you too much to contradict you in aught which may render your solitary mode of life more endurable make of this youth what you will and you have my full authority for doing so but remember he is your charge not mineremember he hath limbs to do mans service a soul and a tongue to worship god breed him therefore to be true to his country and to heaven and for the rest dispose of him as you listit is and shall rest your own matter  this conversation decided the fate of roland graeme who from thenceforward was little noticed by the master of the mansion of avenel but indulged and favoured by its mistress  this situation led to many important consequences and in truth tended to bring forth the character of the youth in all its broad lights and deep shadows as the knight himself seemed tacitly to disclaim alike interest and control over the immediate favourite of his lady young roland was by circumstances exempted from the strict discipline to which as the retainer of a scottish man of rank he would otherwise have been subjected according to all the rigour of the age but the steward or master of the householdsuch was the proud title assumed by the head domestic of each petty barondeemed it not advisable to interfere with the favourite of the lady and especially since she had brought the estate into the present family master jasper wingate was a man experienced as he often boasted in the ways of great families and knew how to keep the steerage even when the wind and tide chanced to be in contradiction  this prudent personage winked at much and avoided giving opportunity for farther offence by requesting little of roland graeme beyond the degree of attention which he was himself disposed to pay rightly conjecturing that however lowly the place which the youth might hold in the favour of the knight of avenel still to make an evil report of him would make an enemy of the lady without securing the favour of her husband with these prudential considerations and doubtless not without an eye to his own ease and convenience he taught the boy as much and only as much as he chose to learn readily admitting whatever apology it pleased his pupil to allege in excuse for idleness or negligence as the other persons in the castle to whom such tasks were delegated readily imitated the prudential conduct of the majordomo there was little control used towards roland graeme who of course learned no more than what a very active mind and a total impatience of absolute idleness led him to acquire upon his own account and by dint of his own exertions the latter were especially earnest when the lady herself condescended to be his tutress or to examine his progress  it followed also from his quality as my ladys favourite that roland was viewed with no peculiar goodwill by the followers of the knight many of whom of the same age and apparently similar origin with the fortunate page were subjected to severe observance of the ancient and rigorous discipline of a feudal retainer to these roland graeme was of course an object of envy and in consequence of dislike and detraction but the youth possessed qualities which it was impossible to depreciate  pride and a sense of early ambition did for him what severity and constant instruction did for others in truth the youthful roland displayed that early flexibility both of body and mind which renders exercise either mental or bodily rather matter of sport than of study and it seemed as if he acquired accidentally and by starts those accomplishments which earnest and constant instruction enforced by frequent reproof and occasional chastisement had taught to others such military exercises such lessons of the period as he found it agreeable or convenient to apply to he learned so perfectly as to confound those who were ignorant how often the want of constant application is compensated by vivacity of talent and ardent enthusiasm the lads therefore who were more regularly trained to arms to horsemanship and to other necessary exercises of the period while they envied roland graeme the indulgence or negligence with which he seemed to be treated had little reason to boast of their own superior acquirements a few hours with the powerful exertion of a most energetic will seemed to do for him more than the regular instruction of weeks could accomplish for others  under these advantages if indeed they were to be termed such the character of young roland began to develope itself it was bold peremptory decisive and overbearing generous if neither withstood nor contradicted vehement and passionate if censured or opposed he seemed to consider himself as attached to no one and responsible to no one except his mistress and even over her mind he had gradually acquired that species of ascendancy which indulgence is so apt to occasion and although the immediate followers and dependents of sir halbert glendinning saw his ascendancy with jealousy and often took occasion to mortify his vanity there wanted not those who were willing to acquire the favour of the lady of avenel by humouring and taking part with the youth whom she protected for although a favourite as the poet assures us has no friend he seldom fails to have both followers and flatterers  the partisans of roland graeme were chiefly to be found amongst the inhabitants of the little hamlet on the shore of the lake these villagers who were sometimes tempted to compare their own situation with that of the immediate and constant followers of the knight who attended him on his frequent journeys to edinburgh and elsewhere delighted in considering and representing themselves as more properly the subjects of the lady of avenel than of her husband it is true her wisdom and affection on all occasions discountenanced the distinction which was here implied but the villagers persisted in thinking it must be agreeable to her to enjoy their peculiar and undivided homage or at least in acting as if they thought so and one chief mode by which they evinced their sentiments was by the respect they paid to young roland graeme the favourite attendant of the descendant of their ancient lords this was a mode of flattery too pleasing to encounter rebuke or censure and the opportunity which it afforded the youth to form as it were a party of his own within the limits of the ancient barony of avenel added not a little to the audacity and decisive tone of a character which was by nature bold impetuous and incontrollable  of the two members of the household who had manifested an early jealousy of roland graeme the prejudices of wolf were easily overcome and in process of time the noble dog slept with bran luath and the celebrated hounds of ancient days but mr warden the chaplain lived and retained his dislike to the youth that good man singleminded and benevolent as he really was entertained rather more than a reasonable idea of the respect due to him as a minister and exacted from the inhabitants of the castle more deference than the haughty young page proud of his mistresss favour and petulant from youth and situation was at all times willing to pay his bold and free demeanour his attachment to rich dress and decoration his inaptitude to receive instruction and his hardening himself against rebuke were circumstances which induced the good old man with more haste than charity to set the forward page down as a vessel of wrath and to presage that the youth nursed that pride and haughtiness of spirit which goes before ruin and destruction on the other hand roland evinced at times a marked dislike and even something like contempt of the chaplain most of the attendants and followers of sir halbert glendinning entertained the same charitable thoughts as the reverend mr warden but while roland was favoured by their lady and endured by their lord they saw no policy in making their opinions public  roland graeme was sufficiently sensible of the unpleasant situation in which he stood but in the haughtiness of his heart he retorted upon the other domestics the distant cold and sarcastic manner in which they treated him assumed an air of superiority which compelled the most obstinate to obedience and had the satisfaction at least to be dreaded if he was heartily hated  the chaplains marked dislike had the effect of recommending him to the attention of sir halberts brother edward who now under the conventual appellation of father ambrose continued to be one of the few monks who with the abbot eustatius had notwithstanding the nearly total downfall of their faith under the regency of murray been still permitted to linger in the cloisters at kennaquhair respect to sir halbert had prevented their being altogether driven out of the abbey though their order was now in a great measure suppressed and they were interdicted the public exercise of their ritual and only allowed for their support a small pension out of their once splendid revenues father ambrose thus situated was an occasional though very rare visitant at the castle of avenel and was at such times observed to pay particular attention to roland graeme who seemed to return it with more depth of feeling than consisted with his usual habits  thus situated years glided on during which the knight of avenel continued to act a frequent and important part in the convulsions of his distracted country while young graeme anticipated both in wishes and personal accomplishments the age which should enable him to emerge from the obscurity of his present situation     chapter the fourth     amid their cups that freely flowd     their revelry and mirth   a youthful lord taxd valentine     with base and doubtful birth                  valentine and orson  when roland graeme was a youth about seventeen years of age he chanced one summer morning to descend to the mew in which sir halbert glendinning kept his hawks in order to superintend the training of an eyas or young hawk which he himself at the imminent risk of neck and limbs had taken from the celebrated eyry in the neighborhood called gledscraig as he was by no means satisfied with the attention which had been bestowed on his favourite bird he was not slack in testifying his displeasure to the falconers lad whose duty it was to have attended upon it  what ho sir knave exclaimed roland is it thus you feed the eyas with unwashed meat as if you were gorging the foul brancher of a worthless hoodiecrow by the mass and thou hast neglected its castings also for these two days thinkst thou i ventured my neck to bring the bird down from the crag that thou shouldst spoil him by thy neglect and to add force to his remonstrances he conferred a cuff or two on the negligent attendant of the hawks who shouting rather louder than was necessary under all the circumstances brought the master falconer to his assistance  adam woodcock the falconer of avenel was an englishman by birth but so long in the service of glendinning that he had lost much of his notional attachment in that which he had formed to his master he was a favourite in his department jealous and conceited of his skill as masters of the game usually are for the rest of his character he was a jester and a parcel poet qualities which by no means abated his natural conceit a jolly fellow who though a sound protestant loved a flagon of ale better than a long sermon a stout man of his hands when need required true to his master and a little presuming on his interest with him  adam woodcock such as we have described him by no means relished the freedom used by young graeme in chastising his assistant hey hey my ladys page said he stepping between his own boy and roland fair and softly an it like your gilt jackethands off is fair playif my boy has done amiss i can beat him myself and then you may keep your hands soft  i will beat him and thee too answered roland without hesitation an you look not better after your business see how the bird is cast away between you i found the careless lurdane feeding him with unwashed flesh and she an eyas footnote there is a difference amongst authorities how long the nestling hawk should be fed with flesh which has previously been washed  go to said the falconer thou art but an eyas thyself child rolandwhat knowest thou of feeding i say that the eyas should have her meat unwashed until she becomes a branchertwere the ready way to give her the frounce to wash her meat sooner and so knows every one who knows a gled from a falcon  it is thine own laziness thou false english blood that dost nothing but drink and sleep retorted the page and leaves that lither lad to do the work which he minds as little as thou  and am i so idle then said the falconer that have three cast of hawks to look after at perch and mew and to fly them in the field to bootand is my ladys page so busy a man that he must take me up shortand am i of false english bloodi marvel what blood thou artneither englander nor scotfish nor flesha bastard from the debateable land without either kith kin or allymarry out upon thee foul kite that would fain be a tercel gentle  the reply to this sarcasm was a box on the ear so well applied that it overthrew the falconer into the cistern in which water was kept for the benefit of the hawks up started adam woodcock his wrath no way appeased by the cold immersion and seizing on a truncheon which stood by would have soon requited the injury he had received had not roland laid his hand on his poniard and sworn by all that was sacred that if he offered a stroke towards him he would sheath the blade in his bowels the noise was now so great that more than one of the household came in and amongst others the majordomo a grave personage already mentioned whose gold chain and white wand intimated his authority at the appearance of this dignitary the strife was for the present appeased he embraced however so favourable an opportunity to read roland graeme a shrewd lecture on the impropriety of his deportment to his fellowmenials and to assure him that should he communicate this fray to his master who though now on one of his frequent expeditions was speedily expected to return which but for respect to his lady he would most certainly do the residence of the culprit in the castle of avenel would be but of brief duration but however added the prudent master of the household i will report the matter first to my lady  very just very right master wingate exclaimed several voices together my lady will consider if daggers are to be drawn on us for every idle word and whether we are to live in a wellordered household where there is the fear of god or amidst drawn dirks and sharp knives  the object of this general resentment darted an angry glance around him and suppressing with difficulty the desire which urged him to reply in furious or in contemptuous language returned his dagger into his scabbard looked disdainfully around upon the assembled menials turned short upon his heel and pushing aside those who stood betwixt him and the door left the apartment  this will be no tree for my nest said the falconer if this cocksparrow is to crow over us as he seems to do  he struck me with his switch yesterday said one of the grooms because the tail of his worships gelding was not trimmed altogether so as suited his humour  and i promise you said the laundress my young master will stick nothing to call an honest woman slut and quean if there be but a speck of soot upon his bandcollar  if master wingate do not his errand to my lady was the general result there will be no tarrying in the same house with roland graeme  the master of the household heard them all for some time and then motioning for universal silence he addressed them with all the dignity of malvolio himselfmy mastersnot forgetting you my mistressesdo not think the worse of me that i proceed with as much care as haste in this matter our master is a gallant knight and will have his sway at home and abroad in wood and field in hall and bower as the saying is our lady my benison upon her is also a noble person of long descent and rightful heir of this place and barony and she also loves her will as for that matter show me the woman who doth not now she hath favoured doth favour and will favour this jackanapefor what good part about him i know not save that as one noble lady will love a messan dog and another a screaming popinjay and a third a barbary ape so doth it please our noble dame to set her affections upon this stray elf of a page for nought that i can think of save that shewas the cause of his being saved the mores the pity from drowning and here master wingate made a pause  i would have been his caution for a gray groat against salt water or fresh said rolands adversary the falconer marry if he crack not a rope for stabbing or for snatching i will be content never to hood hawk again  peace adam woodcock said wingate waving his hand i prithee peace mannow my lady liking this springald as aforesaid differs therein from my lord who loves never a bone in his skin now is it for me to stir up strife betwixt them and put astwere my finger betwixt the bark and the tree on account of a pragmatical youngster whom nevertheless i would willingly see whipped forth of the barony have patience and this boil will break without our meddling i have been in service since i wore a beard on my chin till now that that beard is turned gray and i have seldom known any one better themselves even by taking the ladys part against the lords but never one who did not dirk himself if he took the lords against the ladys  and so said lilias we are to be crowed over every one of us men and women cock and hen by this little upstarti will try titles with him first i promise youi fancy master wingate for as wise as you look you will be pleased to tell what you have seen today if my lady commands you  to speak the truth when my lady commands me answered the prudential majordomo is in some measure my duty mistress lilias always providing for and excepting those cases in which it cannot be spoken without breeding mischief and inconvenience to myself or my fellowservants for the tongue of a talebearer breaketh bones as well as jeddartstaff footnote a species of battleaxe so called as being in especial use in that ancient burgh whose armorial bearing still represent an armed horseman brandishing such a weapon  but this imp of satan is none of your friends or fellowservants said lilias and i trust you mean not to stand up for him against the whole family besides  credit me mrs lilias replied the senior should i see the time fitting i would with right goodwill give him a lick with the rough side of my tongue  enough said master wingate answered lilias then trust me his song shall soon be laid if my mistress does not ask me what is the matter below stairs before she be ten minutes of time older she is no born woman and my name is not lilias bradbourne  in pursuance of her plan mistress lilias failed not to present herself before her mistress with all the exterior of one who is possessed of an important secretthat is she had the corners of her mouth turned down her eyes raised up her lips pressed as fast together as if they had been sewed up to prevent her babbling and an air of prim mystical importance diffused over her whole person and demeanour which seemed to intimate i know something which i am resolved not to tell you  lilias had rightly read her mistresss temper who wise and good as she was was yet a daughter of grandame eve and could not witness this mysterious bearing on the part of her waitingwoman without longing to ascertain the secret cause for a space mrs lilias was obdurate to all inquiries sighed turned her eyes up higher yet to heaven hoped for the best but had nothing particular to communicate all this as was most natural and proper only stimulated the ladys curiosity neither was her importunity to be parried withthank god i am no makebateno talebearerthank god i never envied any ones favour or was anxious to propale their misdemeanouronly thank god there has been no bloodshed and murder in the housethat is all  bloodshed and murder exclaimed the lady what does the quean meanif you speak not plain out you shall have something you will scarce be thankful for  nay my lady answered lilias eager to disburden her mind or in chaucers phrase to unbuckle her mail if you bid me speak out the truth you must not be moved with what might displease youroland graeme has dirked adam woodstockthat is all  good heaven said the lady turning pale as ashes is the man slain  no madam replied lilias but slain he would have been if there had not been ready help but may be it is your ladyships pleasure that this young esquire shall poniard the servants as well as switch and baton them  go to minion said the lady you are saucytell the master of the household to attend me instantly  lilias hastened to seek out mr wingate and hurry him to his ladys presence speaking as a word in season to him on the way i have set the stone atrowling look that you do not let it stand still  the steward too prudential a person to commit himself otherwise answered by a sly look and a nod of intelligence and presently after stood in the presence of the lady of avenel with a look of great respect for his lady partly real partly affected and an air of great sagacity which inferred no ordinary conceit of himself  how is this wingate said the lady and what rule do you keep in the castle that the domestics of sir halbert glendinning draw the dagger on each other as in a cavern of thieves and murderersis the wounded man much hurt and whatwhat hath become of the unhappy boy  there is no one wounded as yet madam replied he of the golden chain it passes my poor skill to say how many may be wounded before pasche footnote easter if some rule be not taken with this youthnot but the youth is a fair youth he added correcting himself and able at his exercise but somewhat too ready with the ends of his fingers the butt of his ridingswitch and the point of his dagger  and whose fault is that said the lady but yours who should have taught him better discipline than to brawl or to draw his dagger  if it please your ladyship so to impose the blame on me answered the steward it is my part doubtless to bear itonly i submit to your consideration that unless i nailed his weapon to the scabbard i could no more keep it still than i could fix quicksilver which defied even the skill of raymond lullius  tell me not of raymond lullius said the lady losing patience but send me the chaplain hither you grow all of you too wise for me during your lords long and repeated absences i would to god his affairs would permit him to remain at home and rule his own household for it passes my wit and skill  god forbid my lady said the old domestic that you should sincerely think what you are now pleased to say your old servants might well hope that after so many years duty you would do their service more justice than to distrust their gray hairs because they cannot rule the peevish humour of a green head which the owner carries it may be a brace of inches higher than becomes him  leave me said the lady sir halberts return must now be expected daily and he will look into these matters himselfleave me i say wingate without saying more of it i know you are honest and i believe the boy is petulant and yet i think it is my favour which hath set all of you against him  the steward bowed and retired after having been silenced in a second attempt to explain the motives on which he acted  the chaplain arrived but neither from him did the lady receive much comfort on the contrary she found him disposed in plain terms to lay to the door of her indulgence all the disturbances which the fiery temper of roland graeme had already occasioned or might hereafter occasion in the family i would he said honoured lady that you had deigned to be ruled by me in the outset of this matter sith it is easy to stem evil in the fountain but hard to struggle against it in the stream you honoured madam a word which i do not use according to the vain forms of this world but because i have ever loved and honoured you as an honourable and elect ladyyou i say madam have been pleased contrary to my poor but earnest counsel to raise this boy from his station into one approaching to your own  what mean you reverend sir said the lady i have made this youth a pageis there aught in my doing so that does not become my character and quality  i dispute not madam said the pertinacious preacher your benevolent purpose in taking charge of this youth or your title to give him this idle character of page if such was your pleasure though what the education of a boy in the train of a female can tend to save to ingraft foppery and effeminacy on conceit and arrogance it passes my knowledge to discover but i blame you more directly for having taken little care to guard him against the perils of his condition or to tame and humble a spirit naturally haughty overbearing and impatient you have brought into your bower a lions cub delighted with the beauty of his fur and the grace of his gambols you have bound him with no fetters befitting the fierceness of his disposition  you have let him grow up as unawed as if he had been still a tenant of the forest and now you are surprised and call out for assistance when he begins to ramp rend and tear according to his proper nature  mr warden said the lady considerably offended you are my husbands ancient friend and i believe your love sincere to him and to his household yet let me say that when i asked you for counsel i expected not this asperity of rebuke if i have done wrong in loving this poor orphan lad more than others of his class i scarce think the error merited such severe censure and if stricter discipline were required to keep his fiery temper in order it ought i think to be considered that i am a woman and that if i have erred in this matter it becomes a friends part rather to aid than to rebuke me i would these evils were taken order with before my lords return he loves not domestic discord or domestic brawls and i would not willingly that he thought such could arise from one whom i favouredwhat do you counsel me to do  dismiss this youth from your service madam replied the preacher  you cannot bid me do so said the lady you cannot as a christian and a man of humanity bid me turn away an unprotected creature against whom my favour my injudicious favour if you will has reared up so many enemies  it is not necessary you should altogether abandon him though you dismiss him to another service or to a calling better suiting his station and character said the preacher elsewhere he maybe an useful and profitable member of the commonwealhere he is but a makebate and a stumblingblock of offence the youth has snatches of sense and of intelligence though he lacks industry i will myself give him letters commendatory to olearius schinderhausen a learned professor at the famous university of leyden where they lack an underjanitorwhere besides gratis instruction if god give him the grace to seek it he will enjoy five merks by the year and the professors castoff suit which he disparts with biennially  this will never do good mr warden said the lady scarce able to suppress a smile we will think more at large upon this matter in the meanwhile i trust to your remonstrances with this wild boy and with the family for restraining these violent and unseemly jealousies and bursts of passion and i entreat you to press on him and them their duty in this respect towards god and towards their master  you shall be obeyed madam said warden on the next thursday i exhort the family and will with gods blessing so wrestle with the demon of wrath and violence which hath entered into my little flock that i trust to hound the wolf out of the fold as if he were chased away with bandogs  this was the part of the conference from which mr warden derived the greatest pleasure the pulpit was at that time the same powerful engine for affecting popular feeling which the press has since become and he had been no unsuccessful preacher as we have already seen it followed as a natural consequence that he rather overestimated the powers of his own oratory and like some of his brethren about the period was glad of an opportunity to handle any matters of importance whether public or private the discussion of which could be dragged into his discourse in that rude age the delicacy was unknown which prescribed time and place to personal exhortations and as the courtpreacher often addressed the king individually and dictated to him the conduct he ought to observe in matters of state so the nobleman himself or any of his retainers were in the chapel of the feudal castle often incensed or appalled as the case might be by the discussion of their private faults in the evening exercise and by spiritual censures directed against them specifically personally and by name the sermon by means of which henry warden purposed to restore concord and good order to the castle of avenel bore for text the wellknown words he who striketh with the sword shall perish by the sword and was a singular mixture of good sense and powerful oratory with pedantry and bad taste he enlarged a good deal on the word striketh which he assured his hearers comprehended blows given with the point as well as with the edge and more generally shooting with handgun crossbow or longbow thrusting with a lance or doing any thing whatever by which death might be occasioned to the adversary in the same manner he proved satisfactorily that the word sword comprehended all descriptions whether backsword or baskethilt cutandthrust or rapier falchion or scimitar but if he continued with still greater animation the text includeth in its anathema those who strike with any of those weapons which man hath devised for the exercise of his open hostility still more doth it comprehend such as from their form and size are devised rather for the gratification of privy malice by treachery than for the destruction of an enemy prepared and standing upon his defence such he proceeded looking sternly at the place where the page was seated on a cushion at the feet of his mistress and wearing in his crimson belt a gay dagger with a gilded hiltsuch more especially i hold to be those implements of death which in our modern and fantastic times are worn not only by thieves and cutthroats to whom they most properly belong but even by those who attend upon women and wait in the chambers of honourable ladies yes my friendsevery species of this unhappy weapon framed for all evil and for no good is comprehended under this deadly denunciation whether it be a stillet which we have borrowed from the treacherous italian or a dirk which is borne by the savage highlandman or a whinger which is carried by our own border thieves and cutthroats or a dudgeondagger all are alike engines invented by the devil himself for ready implements of deadly wrath sudden to execute and difficult to be parried even the common swordandbuckler brawler despises the use of such a treacherous and malignant instrument which is therefore fit to be used not by men or soldiers but by those who trained under female discipline become themselves effeminate hermaphrodites having female spite and female cowardice added to the infirmities and evil passions of their masculine nature  the effect which this oration produced upon the assembled congregation of avenel cannot very easily be described the lady seemed at once embarrassed and offended the menials could hardly contain under an affectation of deep attention the joy with which they heard the chaplain launch his thunders at the head of the unpopular favourite and the weapon which they considered as a badge of affectation and finery mrs lilias crested and drew up her head with all the deepfelt pride of gratified resentment while the steward observing a strict neutrality of aspect fixed his eyes upon an old scutcheon on the opposite side of the wall which he seemed to examine with the utmost accuracy more willing perhaps to incur the censure of being inattentive to the sermon than that of seeming to listen with marked approbation to what appeared so distasteful to his mistress  the unfortunate subject of the harangue whom nature had endowed with passions which had hitherto found no effectual restraint could not disguise the resentment which he felt at being thus directly held up to the scorn as well as the censure of the assembled inhabitants of the little world in which he lived his brow grew red his lip grew pale he set his teeth he clenched his hand and then with mechanical readiness grasped the weapon of which the clergyman had given so hideous a character and at length as the preacher heightened the colouring of his invective he felt his rage become so ungovernable that fearful of being hurried into some deed of desperate violence he rose up traversed the chapel with hasty steps and left the congregation  the preacher was surprised into a sudden pause while the fiery youth shot across him like a flash of lightning regarding him as he passed as if he had wished to dart from his eyes the same power of blighting and of consuming but no sooner had he crossed the chapel and shut with violence behind him the door of the vaulted entrance by which it communicated with the castle than the impropriety of his conduct supplied warden with one of those happier subjects for eloquence of which he knew how to take advantage for making a suitable impression on his hearers he paused for an instant and then pronounced in a slow and solemn voice the deep anathema he hath gone out from us because he was not of usthe sick man hath been offended at the wholesome bitter of the medicinethe wounded patient hath flinched from the friendly knife of the surgeonthe sheep hath fled from the sheepfold and delivered himself to the wolf because he could not assume the quiet and humble conduct demanded of us by the great shepherd ah my brethren beware of wrathbeware of pridebeware of the deadly and destroying sin which so often shows itself to our frail eyes in the garments of light what is our earthly honour pride and pride onlywhat our earthly gifts and graces pride and vanity voyagers speak of indian men who deck themselves with shells and anoint themselves with pigments and boast of their attire as we do of our miserable carnal advantagespride could draw down the morningstar from heaven even to the verge of the pitpride and selfopinion kindled the flaming sword which waves us off from paradisepride made adam mortal and a weary wanderer on the face of the earth which he had else been at this day the immortal lord ofpride brought amongst us sin and doubles every sin it has brought it is the outpost which the devil and the flesh most stubbornly maintain against the assaults of grace and until it be subdued and its barriers levelled with the very earth there is more hope of a fool than of the sinner rend then from your bosoms this accursed shoot of the fatal apple tear it up by the roots though it be twisted with the chords of your life profit by the example of the miserable sinner that has passed from us and embrace the means of grace while it is called today ere your conscience is seared as with a firebrand and your ears deafened like those of the adder and your heart hardened like the nether millstone up then and be doingwrestle and overcome resist and the enemy shall flee from youwatch and pray lest ye fall into temptation and let the stumbling of others be your warning and your example above all rely not on yourselves for such selfconfidence is even the worst symptom of the disorder itself the pharisee perhaps deemed himself humble while he stooped in the temple and thanked god that he was not as other men and even as the publican but while his knees touched the marble pavement his head was as high as the topmost pinnacle of the temple do not therefore deceive yourselves and offer false coin where the purest you can present is but as drossthink not that suchwill pass the assay of omnipotent wisdom yet shrink not from the task because as is my bounden duty i do not disguise from you its difficulties selfsearching can do muchmeditation can do muchgrace can do all  and he concluded with a touching and animating exhortation to his hearers to seek divine grace which is perfected in human wakness  the audience did not listen to this address without being considerably affected though it might be doubted whether the feelings of triumph excited by the disgraceful retreat of the favourite page did not greatly qualify in the minds of many the exhortations of the preacher to charity and to humility and in fact the expression of their countenances much resembled the satisfied triumphant air of a set of children who having just seen a companion punished for a fault in which they had no share con their task with double glee both because they themselves are out of the scrape and because the culprit is in it  with very different feelings did the lady of avenel seek her own apartment she felt angry at warden having made a domestic matter in which she took a personal interest the subject of such public discussion but this she knew the good man claimed as a branch of his christian liberty as a preacher and also that it was vindicated by the universal custom of his brethren but the selfwilled conduct of her protegé afforded her yet deeper concern that he had broken through in so remarkable a degree not only the respect due to her presence but that which was paid to religious admonition in those days with such peculiar reverence argued a spirit as untameable as his enemies had represented him to possess and yet so far as he had been under her own eye she had seen no more of that fiery spirit than appeared to her to become his years and his vivacity this opinion might be founded in some degree on partiality in some degree too it might be owing to the kindness and indulgence which she had always extended to him but still she thought it impossible that she could be totally mistaken in the estimate she had formed of his character the extreme of violence is scarce consistent with a course of continued hypocrisy although lilias charitably hinted that in some instances they were happily united and there fore she could not exactly trust the report of others against her own experience and observation the thoughts of this orphan boy clung to her heartstrings with a fondness for which she herself was unable to account he seemed to have been sent to her by heaven to fill up those intervals of languor and vacuity which deprived her of much enjoyment perhaps he was not less dear to her because she well saw that he was a favourite with no one else and because she felt that to give him up was to afford the judgment of her husband and others a triumph over her own a circumstance not quite indifferent to the best of spouses of either sex  in short the lady of avenel formed the internal resolution that she would not desert her page while her page could be rationally protected and with a view of ascertaining how far this might be done she caused him to be summoned to her presence     chapter the fifth     in the wild storm   the seaman hews his mast down and the merchant   heaves to the billows wares he once deemd precious   so prince and peer mid popular contentions   cast off their favourites                                   old play  it was some time ere roland graeme appeared the messenger his old friend lilias had at first attempted to open the door of his little apartment with the charitable purpose doubtless of enjoying the confusion and marking the demeanour of the culprit but an oblong bit of iron ycleped a bolt was passed across the door on the inside and prevented her benign intentions lilias knocked and called at intervals rolandroland graememaster roland graeme an emphasis on the word master will you be pleased to undo the doorwhat ails youare you at your prayers in private to complete the devotion which you left unfinished in publicsurely we must have a screened seat for you in the chapel that your gentility may be free from the eyes of common folks still no whisper was heard in reply well master roland said the waitingmaid i must tell my mistress that if she would have an answer she must either come herself or send those on errand to you who can beat the door down  what says your lady answered the page from within  marry open the door and you shall hear answered the waitingmaid i trow it becomes my ladys message to be listened to face to face and i will not for your idle pleasure whistle it through a keyhole  your mistresss name said the page opening the door is too fair a cover for your impertinencewhat says my lady  that you will be pleased to come to her directly in the withdrawingroom answered lilias i presume she has some directions for you concerning the forms to be observed in leaving chapel in future  say to my lady that i will directly wait on her answered the page and returning into his apartment he once more locked the door in the face of the waitingmaid  rare courtesy muttered lilias and returning to her mistress acquainted her that roland graeme would wait on her when it suited his convenience  what is that his addition or your own phrase lilias said the lady coolly  nay madam replied the attendant not directly answering the question he looked as if he could have said much more impertinent things than that if i had been willing to hear thembut here he comes to answer for himself  roland graeme entered the apartment with a loftier mien and somewhat a higher colour than his wont there was embarrassment in his manner but it was neither that of fear nor of penitence  young man said the lady what trow you i am to think of your conduct this day  if it has offended you madam i am deeply grieved replied the youth  to have offended me alone replied the lady were but littleyou have been guilty of conduct which will highly offend your masterof violence to your fellowservants and of disrespect to god himself in the person of his ambassador  permit me again to reply said the page that if i have offended my only mistress friend and benefactress it includes the sum of my guilt and deserves the sum of my penitencesir halbert glendinning calls me not servant nor do i call him masterhe is not entitled to blame me for chastising an insolent groomnor do i fear the wrath of heaven for treating with scorn the unauthorized interference of a meddling preacher  the lady of avenel had before this seen symptoms in her favourite of boyish petulance and of impatience of censure or reproof but his present demeanour was of a graver and more determined character and she was for a moment at a loss how she should treat the youth who seemed to have at once assumed the character not only of a man but of a bold and determined one she paused an instant arid then assuming the dignity which was natural to her she said is it to me roland that you hold this language is it for the purpose of making me repent the favour i have shown you that you declare yourself independent both of an earthly and a heavenly master have you forgotten what you were and to what the loss of my protection would speedily again reduce you  lady said the page i have forgot nothing i remember but too much i know that but for you i should have perished in yon blue waves pointing as he spoke to the lake which was seen through the window agitated by the western wind your goodness has gone farther madamyou have protected me against the malice of others and against my own folly you are free if you are willing to abandon the orphan you have reared you have left nothing undone by him and he complains of nothing and yet lady do not think i have been ungratefuli have endured something on my part which i would have borne for the sake of no one but my benefactress  for my sake said the lady and what is it that i can have subjected you to endure which can be remembered with other feelings than those of thanks and gratitude  you are too just madam to require me to be thankful for the cold neglect with which your husband has uniformly treated meneglect not unmingled with fixed aversion you are too just madam to require me to be grateful for the constant and unceasing marks of scorn and malevolence with which i have been treated by others or for such a homily as that with which your reverend chaplain has at my expense this very day regaled the assembled household  heard mortal ears the like of this said the waitingmaid with her hands expanded and her eyes turned up to heaven he speaks as if he were son of an earl or of a belted knight the least penny  the page glanced on her a look of supreme contempt but vouchsafed no other answer his mistress who began to feel herself seriously offended and yet sorry for the youths folly took up the same tone  indeed roland you forget yourself so strangely said she that you will tempt me to take serious measures to lower you in your own opinion by reducing you to your proper station in society  and that added lilias would be best done by turning him out the same beggars brat that your ladyship took him in  lilias speaks too rudely continued the lady but she has spoken the truth young man nor do i think i ought to spare that pride which hath so completely turned your head you have been tricked up with fine garments and treated like the son of a gentleman until you have forgot the fountain of your churlish blood  craving your pardon most honourable madam lilias hath not spoken truth nor does your ladyship know aught of my descent which should entitle you to treat it with such decided scorn i am no beggars bratmy grandmother begged from no one here nor elsewhereshe would have perished sooner on the bare moor we were harried out and driven from our homea chance which has happed elsewhere and to others avenel castle with its lake and its towers was not at all times able to protect its inhabitants from want and desolation  hear but his assurance said lilias he upbraids my lady with the distresses of her family  it had indeed been a theme more gratefully spared said the lady affected nevertheless with the allusion  it was necessary madam for my vindication said the page or i had not even hinted at a word that might give you pain but believe honoured lady i am of no churls blood my proper descent i know not but my only relation has said and my heart has echoed it back and attested the truth that i am sprung of gentle blood and deserve gentle usage  and upon an assurance so vague as this said the lady do you propose to expect all the regard all the privileges befitting high rank and distinguished birth and become a contender for concessions which are only due to the noble go to sir know yourself or the master of the household shall make you know you are liable to the scourge as a malapert boy you have tasted too little the discipline fit for your age and station  the master of the household shall taste of my dagger ere i taste of his discipline said the page giving way to his restrained passion lady i have been too long the vassal of a pantoufle and the slave of a silver whistle you must henceforth find some other to answer your call and let him be of birth and spirit mean enough to brook the scorn of your menials and to call a church vassal his master  i have deserved this insult said the lady colouring deeply for so long enduring and fostering your petulance begone sir leave this castle tonighti will send you the means of subsistence till you find some honest mode of support though i fear your imaginary grandeur will be above all others save those of rapine and violence begone sir and see my face no more  the page threw himself at her feet in an agony of sorrow my dear and honoured mistress he said but was unable to bring out another syllable  arise sir said the lady and let go my mantlehypocrisy is a poor cloak for ingratitude  i am incapable of either madam said the page springing up with the hasty start of passion which belonged to his rapid and impetuous temper think not i meant to implore permission to reside here it has been long my determination to leave avenel and i will never forgive myself for having permitted you to say the word begone ere i said i leave you i did but kneel to ask your forgiveness for an illconsidered word used in the height of displeasure but which ill became my mouth as addressed to you other grace i asked notyou have done much for mebut i repeat that you better know what you yourself have done than what i have suffered  roland said the lady somewhat appeased and relenting towards her favourite you had me to appeal to when you were aggrieved you were neither called upon to suffer wrong nor entitled to resent it when you were under my protection  and what said the youth if i sustained wrong from those you loved and favoured was i to disturb your peace with idle talebearings and eternal complaints no madam i have borne my own burden in silence and without disturbing you with murmurs and the respect with which you accuse me of wanting furnishes the only reason why i have neither appealed to you nor taken vengeance at my own hand in a manner far more effectual it is well however that we part i was not born to be a stipendiary favoured by his mistress until ruined by the calumnies of others may heaven multiply its choicest blessings on your honoured head and for your sake upon all that are dear to you  he was about to leave the apartment when the lady called upon him to return he stood still while she thus addressed him it was not my intention nor would it be just even in the height of my displeasure to dismiss you without the means of support take this purse of gold  forgive me lady said the boy and let me go hence with the consciousness that i have not been degraded to the point of accepting alms if my poor services can be placed against the expense of my apparel and my maintenance i only remain debtor to you for my life and that alone is a debt which i can never repay put up then that purse and only say instead that you do not part from me in anger  no not in anger said the lady in sorrow rather for your wilfulness but take the gold you cannot but need it  may god evermore bless you for the kind tone and the kind word but the gold i cannot take i am able of body and do not lack friends so wholly as you may think for the time may come that i may yet show myself more thankful than by mere words he threw himself on his knees kissed the hand which she did not withdraw and then hastily left the apartment  lilias for a moment or two kept her eye fixed on her mistress who looked so unusually pale that she seemed about to faint but the lady instantly recovered herself and declining the assistance which her attendant offered her walked to her own apartment     chapter the sixth     thou hast each secret of the household francis   i dare be sworn thou hast been in the buttery   steeping thy curious humour in fat ale   and in thy butlers tattleay or chatting   with the glib waitingwoman oer her comfits   these bear the key to each domestic mystery                                   old play  upon the morrow succeeding the scene we have described the disgraced favourite left the castle and at breakfasttime the cautious old steward and mrs lilias sat in the apartment of the latter personage holding grave converse on the important event of the day sweetened by a small treat of comfits to which the providence of mr wingate had added a little flask of racy canary  he is gone at last said the abigail sipping her glass and here is to his good journey  amen answered the steward gravely i wish the poor deserted lad no ill  and he is gone like a wildduck as he came continued mrs lilias no lowering of drawbridges or pacing along causeways for him my master has pushed off in the boat which they call the little herod more shame to them for giving the name of a christian to wood and iron and has rowed himself by himself to the farther side of the loch and off and away with himself and left all his finery strewed about his room i wonder who is to clean his trumpery out after himthough the things are worth lifting too  doubtless mistress lilias answered the master of the household in the which case i am free to think they will not long cumber the floor  and now tell me master wingate continued the damsel do not the very cockles of your heart rejoice at the house being rid of this upstart whelp that flung us all into shadow  why mistress lilias replied wingate as to rejoicingthose who have lived as long in great families as has been my lot will be in no hurry to rejoice at any thing and for roland graeme though he may be a good riddance in the main yet what says the very sooth proverb seldom comes a better  seldom comes a better indeed echoed mrs lilias i say never can come a worse or one half so bad he might have been the ruin of our poor dear mistress here she used her kerchief body and soul and estate too for she spent more coin on his apparel than on any four servants about the house  mistress lilias said the sage steward i do opine that our mistress requireth not this pity at your hands being in all respects competent to take care of her own body soul and estate into the bargain  you would not mayhap have said so answered the waitingwoman had you seen how like lots wife she looked when young master took his leave my mistress is a good lady and a virtuous and a welldoing lady and a wellspoken ofbut i would not sir halbert had seen her last evening for two and a plack  oh foy foy foy reiterated the steward servants should hear and see and say nothing besides that my lady is utterly devoted to sir halbert as well she may being as he is the most renowned knight in these parts  well well said the abigail i mean no more harm but they that seek least renown abroad are most apt to find quiet at home thats all and my ladys lonesome situation is to be considered that made her fain to take up with the first beggars brat that a dog brought her out of the loch  and therefore said the steward i say rejoice not too much or too hastily mistress lilias for if your lady wished a favourite to pass away the time depend upon it the time will not pass lighter now that he is gone so she will have another favourite to choose for herself and be assured if she wishes such a toy she will not lack one  and where should she choose one but among her own tried and faithful servants said mrs lilias who have broken her bread and drunk her drink for so many years i have known many a lady as high as she is that never thought either of a friend or favourite beyond their own waitingwomanalways having a proper respect at the same time for their old and faithful master of the household master wingate  truly mistress lilias replied the steward i do partly see the mark at which you shoot but i doubt your bolt will fall short matters being with our lady as it likes you to suppose it will neither be your crimped pinners mrs lilias speaking of them with due respect nor my silver hair or golden chain that will fill up the void which roland graeme must needs leave in our ladys leisure there will be a learned young divine with some new doctrinea learned leech with some new druga bold cavalier who will not be refused the favour of wearing her colours at a running at the ringa cunning harper that could harp the heart out of womans breast as they say signer david rizzio did to our poor queenthese are the sort of folk who supply the loss of a wellfavoured favourite and not an old steward or a middleaged waitingwoman  well replied lilias you have experience master wingate and truly i would my master would leave off his picking hither and thither and look better after the affairs of his household there will be a papestrie among us next for what should i see among masters clothes but a string of gold beads i promise you aves and credos bothi seized on them like a falcon  i doubt it not i doubt it not said the steward sagaciously nodding his head i have often noticed that the boy had strange observances which savoured of popery and that he was very jealous to conceal them but you will find the catholic under the presbyterian cloak as often as the knave under the friars hoodwhat then we are all mortalright proper beads they are he added looking attentively at them and may weigh four ounces of fine gold  and i will have them melted down presently she said before they be the misguiding of some poor blinded soul  very cautious indeed mistress lilias said the steward nodding his head in assent  i will have them made said mrs lilias into a pair of shoebuckles i would not wear the popes trinkets or whatever has once borne the shape of them one inch above my instep were they diamonds instead of goldbut this is what has come of father ambrose coming about the castle as demure as a cat that is about to steal cream  father ambrose is our masters brother said the steward gravely  very true master wingate answered the dame but is that a good reason why he should pervert the kings liege subjects to papistrie  heaven forbid mistress lilias answered the sententious majordomo but yet there are worse folk than the papists  i wonder where they are to be found said the waitingwoman with some asperity but i believe master wingate if one were to speak to you about the devil himself you would say there were worse people than satan  assuredly i might say so replied the steward supposing that i saw satan standing at my elbow  the waitingwoman started and having exclaimed god bless us i added i wonder master wingate you can take pleasure in frightening one thus  nay mistress lilias i had no such purpose was the reply but look you herethe papists are but put down for the present but who knows how long this word present will last there are two great popish earls in the north of england that abominate the very word reformation i mean the northumberland and westmoreland earls men of power enough to shake any throne in christendom then though our scottish king be god bless him a true protestant yet he is but a boy and here is his mother that was our queeni trust there is no harm to say god bless her tooand she is a catholic and many begin to think she has had but hard measure such as the hamiltons in the west and some of our border clans here and the gordons in the north who are all wishing to see a new world and if such a new world should chance to come up it is like that the queen will take back her own crown and that the mass and the cross will come up and then down go pulpits genevagowns and black silk skullcaps  and have you master jasper wingate who have heard the word and listened unto pure and precious mr henry warden have you i say the patience to speak or but to think of popery coming down on us like a storm or of the woman mary again making the royal seat of scotland a throne of abomination no marvel that you are so civil to the cowled monk father ambrose when he comes hither with his downcast eyes that he never raises to my ladys face and with his low sweettoned voice and his benedicites and his benisons and who so ready to take them kindly as master wingate  mistress lilias replied the butler with an air which was intended to close the debate there are reasons for all things if i received father ambrose debonairly and suffered him to steal a word now arid then with this same roland graeme it was not that i cared a brass bodle for his benison or malison either but only because i respected my masters blood and who can answer if mary come in again whether he may not be as stout a tree to lean to as ever his brother hath proved to us for down goes the earl of murray when the queen comes by her own again and good is his luck if he can keep the head on his own shoulders and down goes our knight with the earl his patron and who so like to mount into his empty saddle as this same father ambrose the pope of rome can so soon dispense with his vows and then we should have sir edward the soldier instead of ambrose the priest  anger and astonishment kept mrs lilias silentwhile her old friend in his selfcomplacent manner was making known to her his political speculations at length her resentment found utterance in words of great ire and scorn what master wingate have you eaten my mistresss bread to say nothing of my masters so many years that you could live to think of her being dispossessed of her own castle of avenel by a wretched monk who is not a drops blood to her in the way of relation i that am but a woman would try first whether my rock or his cowl was the better metal shame on you master wingate i if i had not held you as so old an acquaintance this should have gone to my ladys ears though i had been called pickthank and talepyet for my pains as when i told of roland graeme shooting the wild swan  master wingate was somewhat dismayed at perceiving that the details which he had given of his farsighted political views had produced on his hearer rather suspicion of his fidelity than admiration of his wisdom and endeavoured as hastily as possible to apologize and to explain although internally extremely offended at the unreasonable view as he deemed it which it had pleased mistress lilias bradbourne to take of his expressions and mentally convinced that her disapprobation of his sentiments arose solely out of the consideration that though father ambrose supposing him to become the master of the castle would certainly require the services of a steward yet those of a waitingwoman would in the supposed circumstances be altogether superfluous  after his explanation had been received as explanations usually are the two friends separated lilias to attend the silver whistle which called her to her mistresss chamber and the sapient majordomo to the duties of his own department they parted with less than their usual degree of reverence and regard for the steward felt that his worldly wisdom was rebuked by the more disinterested attachment of the waitingwoman and mistress lilias bradbourne was compelled to consider her old friend as something little better than a timeserver     chapter the seventh     when i hae a saxpence under my thumb   then i get credit in ilka town   but when i am puir they bid me gae by   oh poverty parts good company                          old song  while the departure of the page afforded subject for the conversation which we have detailed in our last chapter the late favourite was far advanced on his solitary journey without well knowing what was its object or what was likely to be its end he had rowed the skiff in which he left the castle to the side of the lake most distant from the village with the desire of escaping from the notice of the inhabitants his pride whispered that he would be in his discarded state only the subject of their wonder and compassion and his generosity told him that any mark of sympathy which his situation should excite might be unfavourably reported at the castle a trifling incident convinced him he had little to fear for his friends on the latter score he was met by a young man some years older than himself who had on former occasions been but too happy to be permitted to share in his sports in the subordinate character of his assistant ralph fisher approached to greet him with all the alacrity of an humble friend  what master roland abroad on this side and without either hawk or hound  hawk or hound said roland i will never perhaps hollo to again i have been dismissedthat is i have left the castle  ralph was surprised what you are to pass into the knights service and take the black jack and the lance  indeed replied roland graeme i am noti am now leaving the service of avenel for ever  and whither are you going then said the young peasant  nay that is a question which it craves time to answeri have that matter to determine yet replied the disgraced favourite  nay nay said ralph i warrant you it is the same to you which way you gomy lady would not dismiss you till she had put some lining into the pouches of your doublet  sordid slave said roland graeme dost thou think i would have accepted a boon from one who was giving me over a prey to detraction and to ruin at the instigation of a canting priest and a meddling servingwoman the bread that i had bought with such an alms would have choked me at the first mouthful  ralph looked at his quondam friend with an air of wonder not unmixed with contempt well he said at length no occasion for passioneach man knows his own stomach bestbut were i on a black moor at this time of day not knowing whither i was going i should be glad to have a broad piece or two in my pouch come by them as i couldbut perhaps you will go with me to my fathersthat is for a night for tomorrow we expect my uncle menelaus and all his folk but as i said for one night  the coldblooded limitation of the offered shelter to one night only and that tendered most unwillingly offended the pride of the discarded favourite  i would rather sleep on the fresh heather as i have done many a night on less occasion said roland graeme than in the smoky garret of your father that smells of peat smoke and usquebaugh like a highlanders plaid  you may choose my master if you are so nice replied ralph fisher you may be glad to smell a peatfire and usquebaugh too if you journey long in the fashion you propose you might have said godamercy for your proffer thoughit is not every one that will put themselves in the way of illwill by harbouring a discarded servingman  ralph said roland graeme i would pray you to remember that i have switched you before now and this is the same ridingwand which you have tasted  ralph who was a thickset clownish figure arrived at his full strength and conscious of the most complete personal superiority laughed contemptuously at the threats of the slightmade stripling  it may be the same wand he said but not the same hand and that is as good rhyme as if it were in a ballad look you my ladys page that was when your switch was up it was no fear of you but of your betters that kept mine downand i wot not what hinders me from clearing old scores with this hazel rung and showing you it was your ladys liverycoat which i spared and not your flesh and blood master roland  in the midst of his rage roland graeme was just wise enough to see that by continuing this altercation he would subject himself to very rude treatment from the boor who was so much older and stronger than himself and while his antagonist with a sort of jeering laugh of defiance seemed to provoke the contest he felt the full bitterness of his own degraded condition and burst into a passion of tears which he in vain endeavoured to conceal with both his hands  even the rough churl was moved with the distress of his quondam companion  nay master roland he said i did but as twere jest with theei would not harm thee man were it but for old acquaintance sake but ever look to a mans inches ere you talk of switchingwhy thine arm man is but like a spindle compared to minebut hark i hear old adam woodcock hollowing to his hawkcome along man we will have a merry afternoon and go jollily to my fathers in spite of the peatsmoke and usquebaugh to boot maybe we may put you into some honest way of winning your bread though its hard to come by in these broken times  the unfortunate page made no answer nor did he withdraw his hands from his face and fisher continued in what he imagined a suitable tone of comfort  why man when you were my ladys minion men held you proud and some thought you a papist and i wot not what and so now that you have no one to bear you out you must be companionable and hearty and wait on the ministers examinations and put these things out of folks head and if he says you are in fault you must jouk your head to the stream and if a gentleman or a gentlemans gentleman give you a rough word or a light blow you must only say thank you for dusting my doublet or the like as i have done by youbut hark to woodcocks whistle again come and i will teach you all the trick ont as we go on  i thank you said roland graeme endeavouring to assume an air of indifference and of superiority but i have another path before me and were it otherwise i could not tread in yours  very true master roland replied the clown and every man knows his own matters best and so i will not keep you from the path as you say give us a grip of your hand man for auld lang synewhat not clap palms ere we partwell so be ita wilful man will have his way and so farewell and the blessing of the morning to you  goodmorrowgoodmorrow said roland hastily and the clown walked lightly off whistling as he went and glad apparently to be rid of an acquaintance whose claims might be troublesome and who had no longer the means to be serviceable to him  roland graeme compelled himself to walk on while they were within sight of each other that his former intimate might not augur any vacillation of purpose or uncertainty of object from his remaining on the same spot but the effort was a painful one he seemed stunned as it were and giddy the earth on which he stood felt as if unsound and quaking under his feet like the surface of a bog and he had once or twice nearly fallen though the path he trode was of firm greensward he kept resolutely moving forward in spite of the internal agitation to which these symptoms belonged until the distant form of his acquaintance disappeared behind the slope of a hill when his heart failed at once and sitting down on the turf remote from human ken he gave way to the natural expressions of wounded pride grief and fear and wept with unrestrained profusion and unqualified bitterness  when the first violent paroxysm of his feelings had subsided the deserted and friendless youth felt that mental relief which usually follows such discharges of sorrow the tears continued to chase each other down his cheeks but they were no longer accompanied by the same sense of desolation an afflicting yet milder sentiment was awakened in his mind by the recollection of his benefactress of the unwearied kindness which had attached her to him in spite of many acts of provoking petulance now recollected as offences of a deep dye which had protected him against the machinations of others as well as against the consequences of his own folly and would have continued to do so had not the excess of his presumption compelled her to withdraw her protection  whatever indignity i have borne he said has been the just reward of my own ingratitude and have i done well to accept the hospitality the more than maternal kindness of my protectress yet to detain from her the knowledge of my religionbut she shall know that a catholic has as much gratitude as a puritanthat i have been thoughtless but not wickedthat in my wildest moments i have loved respected and honoured herand that the orphan boy might indeed be heedless but was never ungrateful  he turned as these thoughts passed through his mind and began hastily to retread his footsteps towards the castle but he checked the first eagerness of his repentant haste when he reflected on the scorn and contempt with which the family were likely to see the return of the fugitive humbled as they must necessarily suppose him into a supplicant who requested pardon for his fault and permission to return to his service he slackened his pace but he stood not still  i care not he resolutely determined let them wink point nod sneer speak of the conceit which is humbled of the pride which has had a falli care not it is a penance due to my folly and i will endure it with patience but if she also my benefactress if she also should think me sordid and weakspirited enough to beg not for her pardon alone but for a renewal of the advantages which i derived from her favourher suspicion of my meanness i cannoti will not brook  he stood still and his pride rallying with constitutional obstinacy against his more just feeling urged that he would incur the scorn of the lady of avenel rather than obtain her favour by following the course which the first ardour of his repentant feelings had dictated to him  if i had but some plausible pretext he thought some ostensible reason for my return some excuse to allege which might show i came not as a degraded supplicant or a discarded menial i might go thitherbut as i am i cannotmy heart would leap from its place and burst  as these thoughts swept through his mind something passed in the air so near him as to dazzle his eyes and almost to brush the plume in his cap he looked upit was the favourite falcon of sir halbert which flying around his head seemed to claim his attention as that of a wellknown friend roland extended his arm and gave the accustomed whoop and the falcon instantly settled on his wrist and began to prune itself glancing at the youth from time to time an acute and brilliant beam of its hazel eye which seemed to ask why he caressed it not with his usual fondness  ah diamond he said as if the bird understood him thou and i must be strangers henceforward many a gallant stoop have i seen thee make and many a brave heron strike down but that is all gone and over and there is no hawking more for me  and why not master roland said adam woodcock the falconer who came at that instant from behind a few alder bushes which had concealed him from view why should there be no more hawking for you why man what were our life without our sportsthou knowst the jolly old song    and rather would allan in dungeon lie   than live at large where the falcon cannot fly   and allan would rather lie in sextons pound   than live where he followed not the merry hawk and hound  the voice of the falconer was hearty and friendly and the tone in which he halfsung halfrecited his rude ballad implied honest frankness and cordiality but remembrance of their quarrel and its consequences embarrassed roland and prevented his reply the falconer saw his hesitation and guessed the cause  what now said he master roland do you who are half an englishman think that i who am a whole one would keep up anger against you and you in distress that were like some of the scots my masters reverence always excepted who can be fair and false and wait their time and keep their mind as they say to themselves and touch pot and flagon with you and hunt and hawk with you and after all when time serves pay off some old feud with the point of the dagger canny yorkshire has no memory for such old sores why man an you had hit me a rough blow maybe i would rather have taken it from you than a rough word from another for you have a good notion of falconry though you stand up for washing the meat for the eyases so give us your hand man and bear no malice  roland though he felt his proud blood rebel at the familiarity of honest adams address could not resist its downright frankness covering his face with the one hand he held out the other to the falconer and returned with readiness his friendly grasp  why this is hearty now said woodcock i always said you had a kind heart though you have a spice of the devil in your disposition that is certain i came this way with the falcon on purpose to find you and yon halfbred lubbard told me which way you took flight you ever thought too much of that kestrilkite master roland and he knows nought of sport after all but what he caught from you i saw how it had been betwixt you and i sent him out of my company with a wanioni would rather have a rifler on my perch than a false knave at my elbowand now master roland tell me what way wing ye  that is as god pleases replied the page with a sigh which he could not suppress  nay man never droop a feather for being cast off said the falconer who knows but you may soar the better and fairer flight for all this yetlook at diamond there tis a noble bird and shows gallantly with his hood and bells and jesses but there is many a wild falcon in norway that would not change properties with himand that is what i would say of you you are no longer my ladys page and you will not clothe so fair or feed so well or sleep so soft or show so gallantwhat of all that if you are not her page you are your own man and may go where you will without minding whoop or whistle the worst is the loss of the sport but who knows what you may come to they say that sir halbert himself i speak with reverence was once glad to be the abbots forester and now he has hounds and hawks of his own and adam woodcock for a falconer to the boot  you are right and say well adam answered the youth the blood mantling in his cheeks the falcon will soar higher without his bells than with them though the bells be made of silver  that is cheerily spoken replied the falconer and whither now  i thought of going to the abbey of kennaquhair answered roland graeme to ask the counsel of father ambrose  and joy go with you said the falconer though it is likely you may find the old monks in some sorrow they say the commons are threatening to turn them out of their cells and make a devils mass of it in the old church thinking they have forborne that sport too long and troth i am clear of the same opinion  then will father ambrose be the better of having a friend beside him said the page manfully  ay but my young fearnought replied the falconer the friend will scarce be the better of being beside father ambrosehe may come by the redders lick and that is ever the worst of the battle  i care not for that said the page the dread of a lick should not hold me back but i fear i may bring trouble between the brothers by visiting father ambrose i will tarry tonight at saint cuthberts cell where the old priest will give me a nights shelter and i will send to father ambrose to ask his advice before i go down to the convent  by our lady said the falconer and that is a likely planand now he continued exchanging his frankness of manner for a sort of awkward embarrassment as if he had somewhat to say that he had no ready means to bring outand now you wot well that i wear a pouch for my hawks meat footnote this same hag like every thing belonging to falconry was esteemed an honourable distinction and worn often by the nobility and gentry one of the sommervilles of camnethan was called sir john with the red bag because it was his wont to wear his hawking pouch covered with satin of that colour and so forth but wot you what it is lined with master roland  with leather to be sure replied roland somewhat surprised at the hesitation with which adam woodcock asked a question apparently so simple  with leather lad said woodcock ay and with silver to the boot of that see here he said showing a secret slit in the lining of his bag of officehere they are thirty good harry groats as ever were struck in bluff old hals time and ten of them are right heartily at your service and now the murder is out  rolands first idea was to refuse his assistance but he recollected the vows of humility which he had just taken upon him and it occurred that this was the opportunity to put his newformed resolution to the test assuming a strong command of himself he answered adam woodcock with as much frankness as his nature permitted him to wear in doing what was so contrary to his inclinations that he accepted thankfully of his kind offer while to soothe his own reviving pride he could not help adding he hoped soon to requite the obligation  that as you listthat as you list young man said the falconer with glee counting out and delivering to his young friend the supply he had so generously offered and then adding with great cheerfulnessnow you may go through the world for he that can back a horse wind a horn hollow a greyhound fly a hawk and play at sword and buckler with a whole pair of shoes a green jacket and ten lilywhite groats in his pouch may bid father care hang himself in his own jesses farewell and god be with you  so saying and as if desirous to avoid the thanks of his companion he turned hastily round and left roland graeme to pursue his journey alone     chapter the eight     the sacred tapers lights are gone   gray moss has clad the altar stone   the holy image is oerthrown     the bell has ceased to toll   the long ribbd aisles are burst and shrunk   the holy shrines to ruin sunk   departed is the pious monk     gods blessing on his soul                              rediviva  the cell of saint cuthbert as it was called marked or was supposed to mark one of those restingplaces which that venerable saint was pleased to assign to his monks when his convent being driven from lindisfern by the danes became a peripatetic society of religionists and bearing their patrons body on their shoulders transported him from place to place through scotland and the borders of england until he was pleased at length to spare them the pain of carrying him farther and to choose his ultimate place of rest in the lordly towers of durham the odour of his sanctity remained behind him at each place where he had granted the monks a transient respite from their labours and proud were those who could assign as his temporary restingplace any spot within their vicinity there were few cells more celebrated and honoured than that of saint cuthbert to which roland graeme now bent his way situated considerably to the northwest of the great abbey of kennaquhair on which it was dependent in the neighbourhood were some of those recommendations which weighed with the experienced priesthood of rome in choosing their sites for places of religion  there was a well possessed of some medicinal qualities which of course claimed the saint for its guardian and patron and occasionally produced some advantage to the recluse who inhabited his cell since none could reasonably expect to benefit by the fountain who did not extend their bounty to the saints chaplain a few rods of fertile land afforded the monk his plot of garden ground an eminence well clothed with trees rose behind the cell and sheltered it from the north and the east while the front opening to the southwest looked up a wild but pleasant valley down which wandered a lively brook which battled with every stone that interrupted its passage  the cell itself was rather plainly than rudely constructeda low gothic building with two small apartments one of which served the priest for his dwellingplace the other for his chapel as there were few of the secular clergy who durst venture to reside so near the border the assistance of this monk in spiritual affairs had not been useless to the community while the catholic religion retained the ascendancy as he could marry christen and administer the other sacraments of the roman church of late however as the protestant doctrines gained ground he had found it convenient to live in close retirement and to avoid as much as possible drawing upon himself observation or animadversion the appearance of his habitation however when roland graeme came before it in the close of the evening plainly showed that his caution had been finally ineffectual  the pages first movement was to knock at the door when he observed to his surprise that it was open not from being left unlatched but because beat off its upper hinge it was only fastened to the doorpost by the lower and could therefore no longer perform its functions somewhat alarmed at this and receiving no answer when he knocked and called roland began to look more at leisure upon the exterior of the little dwelling before he ventured to enter it the flowers which had been trained with care against the walls seemed to have been recently torn down and trailed their dishonoured garlands on the earth the latticed window was broken and dashed in the garden which the monk had maintained by his constant labour in the highest order and beauty bore marks of having been lately trod down and destroyed by the hoofs of animals and the feet of men  the sainted spring had not escaped it was wont to rise beneath a canopy of ribbed arches with which the devotion of elder times had secured and protected its healing waters these arches were now almost entirely demolished and the stones of which they were built were tumbled into the well as if for the purpose of choking up and destroying the fountain which as it had shared in other days the honour of the saint was in the present doomed to partake his unpopularity part of the roof had been pulled down from the house itself and an attempt had been made with crows and levers upon one of the angles by which several large cornerstones had been forced out of their place but the solidity of ancient masonwork had proved too great for the time or patience of the assailants and they had relinquished their task of destruction such dilapidated buildings after the lapse of years during which nature has gradually covered the effects of violence with creeping plants and with weatherstains exhibit amid their decay a melancholy beauty but when the visible effects of violence appear raw and recent there is no feeling to mitigate the sense of devastation with which they impress the spectators and such was now the scene on which the youthful page gazed with the painful feelings it was qualified to excite  when his first momentary surprise was over roland graeme was at no loss to conjecture the cause of these ravages the destruction of the popish edifices did not take place at once throughout scotland but at different times and according to the spirit which actuated the reformed clergy some of whom instigated their hearers to these acts of demolition and others with better taste and feeling endeavoured to protect the ancient shrines while they desired to see them purified from the objects which had attracted idolatrous devotion from time to time therefore the populace of the scottish towns and villages when instigated either by their own feelings of abhorrence for popish superstition or by the doctrines of the more zealous preachers resumed the work of destruction and exercised it upon some sequestered church chapel or cell which had escaped the first burst of their indignation against the religion of rome in many places the vices of the catholic clergy arising out of the wealth and the corruption of that tremendous hierarchy furnished too good an apology for wreaking vengeance upon the splendid edifices which they inhabited and of this an old scottish historian gives a remarkable instance  why mourn ye said an aged matron seeing the discontent of some of the citizens while a stately convent was burnt by the multitude why mourn ye for its destruction if you knew half the flagitious wickedness which has been perpetrated within that house you would rather bless the divine judgment which permits not even the senseless walls that screened such profligacy any longer to cumber christian ground  but although in many instances the destruction of the roman catholic buildings might be in the matrons way of judging an act of justice and in others an act of policy there is no doubt that the humour of demolishing monuments of ancient piety and munificence and that in a poor country like scotland where there was no chance of their being replaced was both useless mischievous and barbarous  in the present instance the unpretending and quiet seclusion of the monk of saint cuthberts had hitherto saved him from the general wreck but it would seem ruin had now at length reached him anxious to discover if he had at least escaped personal harm roland graeme entered the half ruined cell  the interior of the building was in a state which fully justified the opinion he had formed from its external injuries the few rude utensils of the solitarys hut were broken down and lay scattered on the floor where it seemed as if a fire had been made with some of the fragments to destroy the rest of his property and to consume in particular the rude old image of saint cuthbert in its episcopal habit which lay on the hearth like dagon of yore shattered with the axe and scorched with the flames but only partially destroyed in the little apartment which served as a chapel the altar was overthrown and the four huge stones of which it had been once composed lay scattered around the floor the large stone crucifix which occupied the niche behind the altar and fronted the supplicant while he paid his devotion there had been pulled down and dashed by its own weight into three fragments there were marks of sledgehammers on each of these yet the image had been saved from utter demolition by the size and strength of the remaining fragments which though much injured retained enough of the original sculpture to show what it had been intended to represent  footnote i may here observe that this is entirely an ideal scene saint cuthbert a person of established sanctity had no doubt several places of worship on the borders where he flourished whilst living but tillmouth chapel is the only one which bears some resemblance to the hermitage described in the text it has indeed a well famous for gratifying three wishes for every worshipper who shall quaff the fountain with sufficient belief in its efficacy at this spot the saint is said to have landed in his stone coffin in which he sailed down the tweed from melrose and here the stone coffin long lay in evidence of the fact the late sir francis blake delaval is said to have taken the exact measure of the coffin and to have ascertained by hydrostatic principles that it might have actually swum a profane farmer in the neighborhood announced his intention of converting this last bed of the saint into a trough for his swine but the profanation was rendered impossible either by the saint or by some pious votary in his behalf for on the following morning the stone sarcophargus was found broken in two fragments  tillmouth chapel with these points of resemblance lies however in exactly the opposite direction as regards melrose which the supposed cell of st cuthbert is said to have borne towards kennaquhair  roland graeme secretly nursed in the tenets of rome saw with horror the profanation of the most sacred emblem according to his creed of our holy religion  it is the badge of our redemption he said which the felons have dared to violatewould to god my weak strength were able to replace itmy humble strength to atone for the sacrilege  he stooped to the task he first meditated and with a sudden and to himself almost an incredible exertion of power he lifted up the one extremity of the lower shaft of the cross and rested it upon the edge of the large stone which served for its pedestal encouraged by this success he applied his force to the other extremity and to his own astonishment succeeded so far as to erect the lower end of the limb into the socket out of which it had been forced and to place this fragment of the image upright  while he was employed in this labour or rather at the very moment when he had accomplished the elevation of the fragment a voice in thrilling and wellknown accents spoke behind him these wordswell done thou good and faithful servant thus would i again meet the child of my lovethe hope of my aged eyes  roland turned round in astonishment and the tall commanding form of magdalen graeme stood beside him she was arrayed in a sort of loose habit in form like that worn by penitents in catholic countries but black in colour and approaching as near to a pilgrims cloak as it was safe to wear in a country where the suspicion of catholic devotion in many places endangered the safety of those who were suspected of attachment to the ancient faith roland graeme threw himself at her feet she raised and embraced him with affection indeed but not unmixed with gravity which amounted almost to sternness  thou hast kept well she said the bird in thy bosom footnote an expression used by sir ralph percy slain in the battle of hedglymoor in 1464 when dying to express his having preserved unstained his fidelity to the house of lancaster as a boy as a youth thou hast held fast thy faith amongst hereticsthou hast kept thy secret and mine own amongst thine enemies i wept when i parted from youi who seldom weep then shed tears less for thy death than for thy spiritual dangeri dared not even see thee to bid thee a last farewellmy grief my swelling grief had betrayed me to these heretics but thou hast been faithfuldown down on thy knees before the holy sign which evil men injure and blaspheme down and praise saints and angels for the grace they have done thee in preserving thee from the leprous plague which cleaves to the house in which thou wert nurtured  if my motherso i must ever call you replied graemeif i am returned such as thou wouldst wish me thou must thank the care of the pious father ambrose whose instructions confirmed your early precepts and taught me at once to be faithful and to be silent  be

detested brother works against the realm and the churchbut he knew not of thy lineage  i could not myself tell him that answered roland i knew but darkly from your words that sir halbert glendinning holds mine inheritance and that i am of blood as noble as runs in the veins of any scottish baronthese are things not to be forgotten but for the explanation i must now look to you  and when time suits thou shalt not look for it in vain but men say my son that thou art bold and sudden and those who bear such tempers are not lightly to be trusted with what will strongly move them  say rather my mother returned roland graeme that i am laggard and coldbloodedwhat patience or endurance can you require of which he is not capable who for years has heard his religion ridiculed and insulted yet failed to plunge his dagger into the blasphemers bosom  be contented my child replied magdalen graeme the time which then and even now demands patience will soon ripen to that of effort and

be dismissed as if i were the meanest of the train  it is the better my child replied she thy mind will be the more hardened to undertake that which must be performed  let it be nothing then against the lady of avenel said the page as thy look and words seem to imply i have eaten her breadi have experienced her favouri will neither injure nor betray her  of that hereafter my son said she but learn this that it is not for thee to capitulate in thy duty and to say this will i do and that will i leave undoneno roland god and man will no longer abide the wickedness of this generation seest thou these fragments knowest thou what they representand canst thou think it is for thee to make distinctions amongst a race so accursed by heaven that they renounce violate blaspheme and destroy whatsoever we are commanded to believe in whatsoever we are commanded to reverence  as she spoke she bent her head towards the broken image with a countenance in which strong resentment and zeal were mingled with an expression of ecstatic devotion she raised her left hand aloft as in the act of making a vow and thus proceeded bear witness for me blessed symbol of our salvation bear witness holy saint within whose violated temple we stand that as it is not for vengeance of my own that my hate pursues these people so neither for any favour or earthly affection towards any amongst them will i withdraw my hand from the plough when it shall pass through the devoted furrow bear witness holy saint once thyself a wanderer and fugitive as we are nowbear witness mother of mercy queen of heavenbear witness saints and angels  in this high train of enthusiasm she stood raising her eyes through the fractured roof of the vault to the stars which now began to twinkle through the pale twilight while the long gray tresses which hung down over her shoulders waved in the nightbreeze which the chasm and fractured windows admitted freely  roland graeme was too much awed by early habits as well as by the mysterious import of her words to ask for farther explanation of the purpose she obscurely hinted at nor did she farther press him on the subject for having concluded her prayer or obtestation by clasping her hands together with solemnity and then signing herself with the cross she again addressed her grandson in a tone more adapted to the ordinary business of life  thou must hence she said roland thou must hence but not till morningand now how wilt thou shift for thy nights quartersthou hast been more softly bred than when we were companions in the misty hills of cumberland and liddesdale  i have at least preserved my good mother the habits which i then learnedcan lie hard feed sparingly and think it no hardship since i was a wanderer with thee on the hills i have been a hunter and fisher and fowler and each of these is accustomed to sleep freely in a worse shelter than sacrilege has left us here  than sacrilege has left us here said the matron repeating his words and pausing on them most true my son and gods faithful children are now worst sheltered when they lodge in gods own house and the demesne of his blessed saints we shall sleep cold here under the nightwind which whistles through the breaches which heresy has made they shall lie warmer who made themay and through a long hereafter  notwithstanding the wild and singular expression of this female she appeared to retain towards roland graeme in a strong degree that affectionate and sedulous love which women bear to their nurslings and the children dependent on their care it seemed as if she would not permit him to do aught for himself which in former days her attention had been used to do for him and that she considered the tall stripling before her as being equally dependent on her careful attention as when he was the orphan child who had owed all to her affectionate solicitude  what hast thou to eat now she said as leaving the chapel they went into the deserted habitation of the priest or what means of kindling a fire to defend thee from this raw and inclement air poor child thou hast made slight provision for a long journey nor hast thou skill to help thyself by wit when means are scanty but our lady has placed by thy side one to whom want in all its forms is as familiar as plenty and splendour have formerly been and with want roland come the arts of which she is the inventor  with an active and officious diligence which strangely contrasted with her late abstracted and high tone of catholic devotion she set about her domestic arrangements for the evening a pouch which was hidden under her garment produced a flint arid steel and from the scattered fragments around those pertaining to the image of saint cuthbert scrupulously excepted she obtained splinters sufficient to raise a sparkling and cheerful fire on the hearth of the deserted cell  and now she said for needful food  think not of it mother said roland unless you yourself feel hunger it is a little thing for me to endure a nights abstinence and a small atonement for the necessary transgression of the rules of the church upon which i was compelled during my stay in the castle  hunger for myself answered the matronknow youth that a mother knows not hunger till that of her child is satisfied and with affectionate inconsistency totally different from her usual manner she added roland you must not fast you have dispensation you are young and to youth food and sleep are necessaries not to be dispensed with husband your strength my childyour sovereign your religion your country require it let age macerate by fast and vigil a body which can only suffer let youth in these active times nourish the limbs and the strength which action requires  while she thus spoke the scrip which had produced the means of striking fire furnished provision for a meal of which she herself scarce partook but anxiously watched her charge taking a pleasure resembling that of an epicure in each morsel which he swallowed with a youthful appetite which abstinence had rendered unusually sharp roland readily obeyed her recommendations and ate the food which she so affectionately and earnestly placed before him but she shook her head when invited by him in return to partake of the refreshment her own cares had furnished and when his solicitude became more pressing she refused him in a loftier tone of rejection  young man she said you know not to whom or of what you speak they to whom heaven declares its purpose must merit its communication by mortifying the senses they have that within which requires not the superfluity of earthly nutriment which is necessary to those who are without the sphere of the vision to them the watch spent in prayer is a refreshing slumber and the sense of doing the will of heaven is a richer banquet than the tables of monarchs can spread before thembut do thou sleep soft my son she said relapsing from the tone of fanaticism into that of maternal affection and tenderness do thou sleep sound while life is but young with thee and the cares of the day can be drowned in the slumbers of the evening different is thy duty and mine and as different the means by which we must qualify and strengthen ourselves to perform it from thee is demanded strength of bodyfrom me strength of soul  when she thus spoke she prepared with ready address a palletcouch composed partly of the dried leaves which had once furnished a bed to the solitary and the guests who occasionally received his hospitality and which neglected by the destroyers of his humble cell had remained little disturbed in the corner allotted for them to these her care added some of the vestures which lay torn and scattered on the floor with a zealous hand she selected all such as appeared to have made any part of the sacerdotal vestments laying them aside as sacred from ordinary purposes and with the rest she made with dexterous promptness such a bed as a weary man might willingly stretch himself on and during the time she was preparing it rejected even with acrimony any attempt which the youth made to assist her or any entreaty which he urged that she would accept of the place of rest for her own use sleep thou said she roland graeme sleep thouthe persecuted the disinherited orphanthe son of an illfated mothersleep thou i go to pray in the chapel beside thee  the manner was too enthusiastically earnest too obstinately firm to permit roland graeme to dispute her will any farther yet he felt some shame in giving way to it it seemed as if she had forgotten the years that had passed away since their parting and expected to meet in the tall indulged and wilful youth whom she had recovered the passive obedience of the child whom she had left in the castle of avenel this did not fail to hurt her grandsons characteristic and constitutional pride he obeyed indeed awed into submission by the sudden recurrence of former subordination and by feelings of affection and gratitude still however he felt the yoke  have i relinquished the hawk and the hound he said to become the pupil of her pleasure as if i were still a childi whom even my envious mates allowed to be superior in those exercises which they took most pains to acquire and which came to me naturally as if a knowledge of them had been my birthright this may not and must not be i will be no reclaimed sparrowhawk who is carried hooded on a womans wrist and has his quarry only shown to him when his eyes are uncovered for his flight i will know her purpose ere it is proposed to me to aid it  these and other thoughts streamed through the mind of roland graeme and although wearied with the fatigues of the day it was long ere he could compose himself to rest     chapter the ninth     kneel with meswear ittis not in words i trust   save when theyre fenced with an appeal to heaven                                    old play  after passing the night in that sound sleep for which agitation and fatigue had prepared him roland was awakened by the fresh morning air and by the beams of the rising sun his first feeling was that of surprise for instead of looking forth from a turret window on the lake of avenel which was the prospect his former apartment afforded an unlatticed aperture gave him the view of the demolished garden of the banished anchorite he sat up on his couch of leaves and arranged in his memory not without wonder the singular events of the preceding day which appeared the more surprising the more he considered them he had lost the protectress of his youth and in the same day he had recovered the guide and guardian of his childhood the former deprivation he felt ought to be matter of unceasing regret and it seemed as if the latter could hardly be the subject of unmixed selfcongratulation he remembered this person who had stood to him in the relation of a mother as equally affectionate in her attention and absolute in her authority a singular mixture of love and fear attended upon his early remembrances as they were connected with her and the fear that she might desire to resume the same absolute control over his motionsa fear which her conduct of yesterday did not tend much to dissipateweighed heavily against the joy of this second meeting  she cannot mean said his rising pride to lead and direct me as a pupil when i am at the age of judging of my own actionsthis she cannot mean or meaning it will feel herself strangely deceived  a sense of gratitude towards the person against whom his heart thus rebelled checked his course of feeling he resisted the thoughts which involuntarily arose in his mind as he would have resisted an actual instigation of the foul fiend and to aid him in his struggle he felt for his beads but in his hasty departure from the castle of avenel he had forgotten and left them behind him  this is yet worse he said but two things i learned of her under the most deadly charge of secrecyto tell my beads and to conceal that i did so and i have kept my word till now and when she shall ask me for the rosary i must say i have forgotten it do i deserve she should believe me when i say i have kept the secret of my faith when i set so light by its symbol  he paced the floor in anxious agitation in fact his attachment to his faith was of a nature very different from that which animated the enthusiastic matron but which notwithstanding it would have been his last thought to relinquish  the early charges impressed on him by his grandmother had been instilled into a mind and memory of a character peculiarly tenacious child as he was he was proud of the confidence reposed in his discretion and resolved to show that it had not been rashly intrusted to him at the same time his resolution was no more than that of a child and must necessarily have gradually faded away under the operation both of precept and example during his residence at the castle of avenel but for the exhortations of father ambrose who in his lay estate had been called edward glendinning this zealous monk had been apprized by an unsigned letter placed in his hand by a pilgrim that a child educated in the catholic faith was now in the castle of avenel perilously situated so was the scroll expressed as ever the three children who were cast into the fiery furnace of persecution the letter threw upon father ambrose the fault should this solitary lamb unwillingly left within the demesnes of the prowling wolf become his final prey there needed no farther exhortation to the monk than the idea that a soul might be endangered and that a catholic might become an apostate and he made his visits more frequent than usual to the castle of avenel lest through want of the private encouragement and instruction which he always found some opportunity of dispensing the church should lose a proselyte and according to the romish creed the devil acquire a soul  still these interviews were rare and though they encouraged the solitary boy to keep his secret and hold fast his religion they were neither frequent nor long enough to inspire him with any thing beyond a blind attachment to the observances which the priest recommended he adhered to the forms of his religion rather because he felt it would be dishonourable to change that of his fathers than from any rational conviction or sincere belief of its mysterious doctrines it was a principal part of the distinction which in his own opinion singled him out from those with whom he lived and gave him an additional though an internal and concealed reason for contemning those of the household who showed an undisguised dislike of him and for hardening himself against the instructions of the chaplain henry warden  the fanatic preacher he thought within himself during some one of the chaplains frequent discourses against the church of rome he little knows whose ears are receiving his profane doctrine and with what contempt and abhorrence they hear his blasphemies against the holy religion by which kings have been crowned and for which martyrs have died  but in such proud feelings of defiance of heresy as it was termed and of its professors which associated the catholic religion with a sense of generous independence and that of the protestants with the subjugation of his mind and temper to the direction of mr warden began and ended the faith of roland graeme who independently of the pride of singularity sought not to understand and had no one to expound to him the peculiarities of the tenets which he professed his regret therefore at missing the rosary which had been conveyed to him through the hands of father ambrose was rather the shame of a soldier who has dropped his cockade or badge of service than that of a zealous votary who had forgotten a visible symbol of his religion  his thoughts on the subject however were mortifying and the more so from apprehension that his negligence must reach the ears of his relative he felt it could be no one but her who had secretly transmitted these beads to father ambrose for his use and that his carelessness was but an indifferent requital of her kindness  nor will she omit to ask me about them said he to himself for hers is a zeal which age cannot quell and if she has not quitted her wont my answer will not fail to incense her  while he thus communed with himself magdalen graeme entered the apartment the blessing of the morning on your youthful head my son she said with a solemnity of expression which thrilled the youth to the heart so sad and earnest did the benediction flow from her lips in a tone where devotion was blended with affection and thou hast started thus early from thy couch to catch the first breath of the dawn but it is not well my roland enjoy slumber while thou canst the time is not far behind when the waking eye must be thy portion as well as mine  she uttered these words with an affectionate and anxious tone which showed that devotional as were the habitual exercises of her mind the thoughts of her nursling yet bound her to earth with the cords of human affection and passion  but she abode not long in a mood which she probably regarded as a momentary dereliction of her imaginary high callingcome she said youth up and be doingit is time that we leave this place  and whither do we go said the young man or what is the object of our journey  the matron stepped back and gazed on him with surprise not unmingled with displeasure  to what purpose such a question she said is it not enough that i lead the way hast thou lived with heretics till thou hast learned to instal the vanity of thine own private judgment in place of due honour and obedience  the time thought roland graeme within himself is already come when i must establish my freedom or be a willing thrall for everi feel that i must speedily look to it  she instantly fulfilled his foreboding by recurring to the theme by which her thoughts seemed most constantly engrossed although when she pleased no one could so perfectly disguise her religion  thy beads my sonhast thou told thy beads  roland graeme coloured high he felt the storm was approaching but scorned to avert it by a falsehood  i have forgotten my rosary he said at the castle of avenel  forgotten thy rosary she exclaimed false both to religion and to natural duty hast thou lost what was sent so far and at such risk a token of the truest affection that should have been every bead of it as dear to thee as thine eyeballs  i am grieved it should have so chanced mother replied the youth and much did i value the token as coming from you for what remains i trust to win gold enough when i push my way in the world and till then beads of black oak or a rosary of nuts must serve the turn  hear him said his

value may be replaced by the wages of his profane labour and whose virtue may be supplied by a string of hazelnutsthis is heresyso henry warden the wolf who ravages the flock of the shepherd hath taught thee to speak and to think  mother said roland graeme i am no heretic i believe and i pray according to the rules of our churchthis misfortune i regret but i cannot amend it  thou canst repent it though replied his spiritual directress repent it in dust and ashes atone for it by fasting prayer and penance instead of looking on me with a countenance as light as if thou hadst lost but a button from thy cap  mother said roland be appeased i will remember my fault in the next confession which i have space and opportunity to make and will do whatever the priest may require of me in atonement for the heaviest fault i can do no morebut mother he added after a moments pause let me not incur your farther displeasure if i ask whither our journey is bound and what is its object i am no longer a child but a man and at my own disposal with down upon my chin and a sword by my sidei will go to the end of the world with you to do your pleasure but i owe it to myself to inquire the

nothingyou can owe nothingto me you owe every thingyour life when an infantyour support while a childthe means of instruction and the hopes of honourand sooner than thou shouldst abandon the noble cause to which i have devoted thee would i see thee lie a corpse at my feet  roland was alarmed at the vehement agitation with which she spoke and which threatened to overpower her aged frame and he hastened to replyi forget nothing of what i owe to you my dearest mothershow me how my blood can testify my gratitude and you shall judge if i spare it but blindfold obedience has in it as little merit as reason  saints and angels replied magdalen and do i hear these words from the child of my hopes the nursling by whose bed i have kneeled and for whose weal i have wearied every saint in heaven with prayers roland by obedience only canst thou show thy affection and thy gratitude what avails it that you might perchance adopt the course i propose to thee were it to be fully explained thou wouldst not then follow my command but thine own judgment thou wouldst not do the will of heaven communicated through thy best friend to whom thou owest thine all but thou wouldst observe the blinded dictates of thine own imperfect reason hear me roland a lot calls theesolicits theedemands theethe proudest to which man can be destined and it uses the voice of thine earliest thy best thine only friendwilt thou resist it then go thy wayleave me heremy hopes on earth are gone and witheredi will kneel me down before yonder profaned altar and when the raging heretics return they shall dye it with the blood of a martyr  but my dearest mother said roland graeme whose early recollections of her violence were formidably renewed by these wild expressions of reckless passion i will not forsake youi will abide with youworlds shall not force me from your sidei will protecti will defend youi will live with you and die for you  one word my son were worth all thesesay only i will obey you  doubt it not mother replied the youth i will and that with all my heart only  nay i receive no qualifications of thy promise said magdalen graeme catching at the word the obedience which i require is absolute and a blessing on thee thou darling memory of my beloved child that thou hast power to make a promise so hard to human pride trust me well that in the design in which thou dost embark thou hast for thy partners the mighty and the valiant the power of the church and the pride of the noble succeed or fail live or die thy name shall be among those with whom success or failure

themselves to gods cause and that of their lawful sovereign amen so be it the blessed eyes of saints and martyrs which see our resolve shall witness the execution or their ears which hear our vow shall hear our deathgroan drawn in the sacred cause  while thus speaking she held roland graeme firmly with one hand while she pointed upward with the other to leave him as it were no means of protest against the obtestation to which he was thus made a party when she had finished her appeal to heaven she left him no leisure for farther hesitation or for asking any explanation of her purpose but passing with the same ready transition as formerly to the solicitous attentions of an anxious parent overwhelmed him with questions concerning his residence in the castle of avenel and the qualities and accomplishments he had acquired  it is well she said when she had exhausted her inquiries my gay gosshawk  footnote the comparison is taken from some beautiful verses in an old ballad entitled fause foodrage published in the minstrelsy of the scottish border a deposed queen to preserve her infant son from the traitors who have slain his father exchanges him with the female offspring of a

bred him will have cause to fear as well as to wonder at his flightlet us now she said to our morning meal and care not though it be a scanty one a few hours walk will bring us to more friendly quarters  they broke their fast accordingly on such fragments as remained of their yesterdays provision and immediately set out on their farther journey magdalen graeme led the way with a firm and active step much beyond her years and roland graeme followed pensive and anxious and far from satisfied with the state of dependence to which he seemed again to be reduced  am i for ever he said to himself to be devoured with the desire of independence and free agency and yet to be for ever led on by circumstances to follow the will of others     chapter the tenth     she dwelt unnoticed and alone     beside the springs of dove   a maid whom there was none to praise     and very few to love                         wordsworth  in the course of their journey the travellers spoke little to each other magdalen graeme chanted from time to time in a low voice a part of some one of those beautiful old latin hymns which belong to the catholic service muttered an ave or a credo and so passed on lost in devotional contemplation the meditations of her grandson were more bent on mundane matters and many a time as a moorfowl arose from the heath and shot along the moor uttering his bold crow of defiance he thought of the jolly adam woodcock and his trusty gosshawk or as they passed a thicket where the low trees and bushes were intermingled with tall fern furze and broom so as to form a thick and intricate cover his dreams were of a roebuck and a brace of gazehounds but frequently his mind returned to the benevolent and kind mistress whom he had left behind him offended justly and unreconciled by any effort of his  my step would be lighter he thought and so would my heart could i but have returned to see her for one instant and to say lady the orphan boy was wild but not ungrateful  travelling in these divers moods about the hour of noon they reached a small straggling village in which as usual were seen one or two of those predominating towers or peel houses which for reasons of defence elsewhere detailed were at that time to be found in every border hamlet a brook flowed beside the village and watered the valley in which it stood there was also a mansion at the end of the village and a little way separated from it much dilapidated and in very bad order but appearing to have been the abode of persons of some consideration the situation was agreeable being an angle formed by the stream bearing three or four large sycamore trees which were in full leaf and served to relieve the dark appearance of the mansion which was built of a deep red stone the house itself was a large one but was now obviously too big for the inmates several windows were built up especially those which opened from the lower story others were blockaded in a less substantial manner the court before the door which had once been defended with a species of low outerwall now ruinous was paved but the stones were completely covered with long gray nettles thistles and other weeds which shooting up betwixt the flags had displaced many of them from their level even matters demanding more peremptory attention had been left neglected in a manner which argued sloth or poverty in the extreme the stream undermining a part of the bank near an angle of the ruinous wall had brought it down with a corner turret the ruins of which lay in the bed of the river the current interrupted by the ruins which it had overthrown and turned yet nearer to the site of the tower had greatly enlarged the breach it had made and was in the process of undermining the ground on which the house itself stood unless it were speedily protected by sufficient bulwarks  all this attracted roland graemes observation as they approached the dwelling by a winding path which gave them at intervals a view of it from different points  if we go to yonder house he said to his mother i trust it is but for a short visit it looks as if two rainy days from the northwest would send the whole into the brook  you see but with the eyes of the body said the old woman god will defend his own though it be forsaken and despised of men better to dwell on the sand under his law than fly to the rock of human trust  as she thus spoke they entered the court before the old mansion and roland could observe that the front of it had formerly been considerably ornamented with carved work in the same darkcoloured freestone of which it was built but all these ornaments had been broken down and destroyed and only the shattered vestiges of niches and entablatures now strewed the place which they had once occupied the larger entrance in front was walled up but a little footpath which from its appearance seemed to be rarely trodden led to a small wicket defended by a door well clenched with ironheaded nails at which magdalen graeme knocked three times pausing betwixt each knock until she heard an answering tap from within at the last knock the wicket was opened by a pale thin female who said benedicti qui venient in nomine domini they entered and the portress hastily shut behind them the wicket and made fast the massive fastenings by which it was secured  the female led the way through a narrow entrance into a vestibule of some extent paved with stone and having benches of the same solid material ranged around at the upper end was an oriel window but some of the intervals formed by the stone shafts and mullions were blocked up so that the apartment was very gloomy  here they stopped and the mistress of the mansion for such she was embraced magdalen graeme and greeting her by the title of sister kissed her with much solemnity on either side of the face  the blessing of our lady be upon you my sister were her next words and they left no doubt upon rolands mind respecting the religion of their hostess even if he could have suspected his venerable and zealous guide of resting elsewhere than in the habitation of an orthodox catholic they spoke together a few words in private during which he had leisure to remark more particularly the appearance of his grandmothers friend  her age might be betwixt fifty and sixty her looks had a mixture of melancholy and unhappiness that bordered on discontent and obscured the remains of beauty which age had still left on her features her dress was of the plainest and most ordinary description of a dark colour and like magdalen graemes something approaching to a religious habit strict neatness and cleanliness of person seemed to intimate that if poor she was not reduced to squalid or heartbroken distress and that she was still sufficiently attached to life to retain a taste for its decencies if not its elegancies her manner as well as her features and appearance argued an original condition and education far above the meanness of her present appearance in short the whole figure was such as to excite the idea that female must have had a history worth knowing while roland graeme was making this very reflection the whispers of the two females ceased and the mistress of the mansion approaching him looked on his face and person with much attention and as it seemed some interest  this then she said addressing his relative is the child of thine unhappy daughter sister magdalen and him the only shoot from your ancient tree you are willing to devote to the good cause  yes by the rood answered magdalen graeme in her usual tone of resolved determination to the good cause i devote him flesh and fell sinew and limb body and soul  thou art a happy woman sister magdalen answered her companion that lifted so high above human affection and human feeling thou canst bind such a victim to the horns of the altar had i been called to make such a sacrificeto plunge a youth so young and fair into the plots and bloodthirsty dealings of the time not the patriarch abraham when he led isaac up the mountain would have rendered more melancholy obedience  she then continued to look at roland with a mournful aspect of compassion until the intentness of her gaze occasioned his colour to rise and he was about to move out of its influence when he was stopped by his grandmother with one hand while with the other she divided the hair upon his forehead which was now crimson with bashfulness while she added with a mixture of proud affection and firm resolutionay look at him well my sister for on a fairer face thine eye never rested i too when i first saw him after a long separation felt as the worldly feel and was half shaken in my purpose but no wind can tear a leaf from the withered tree which has long been stripped of its foliage and no mere human casualty can awaken the mortal feelings which have long slept in the calm of devotion  while the old woman thus spoke her manner gave the lie to her assertions for the tears rose to her eyes while she added but the fairer and the more spotless the victim is it not my sister the more worthy of acceptance  she seemed glad to escape from the sensations which agitated her and instantly added he will escape my sisterthere will be a ram caught in the thicket and the hand of our revolted brethren shall not be on the youthfull joseph heaven can defend its own rights even by means of babes and sucklings of women and beardless boys  heaven hath left us said the other female for our sins and our fathers the succours of the blessed saints have abandoned this accursed land we may win the crown of martyrdom but not that of earthly triumph one too whose prudence was at this deep crisis so indispensable has been called to a better world the abbot eustatius is no more  may his soul have mercy said magdalen graeme and may heaven too have mercy upon us who linger behind in this bloody land his loss is indeed a perilous blow to our enterprise for who remains behind possessing his farfetched experience his selfdevoted zeal his consummate wisdom and his undaunted courage he hath fallen with the churchs standard in his hand but god will raise up another to lift the blessed banner whom have the chapter elected in his room  it is rumoured no one of the few remaining brethren dare accept the office the heretics have sworn that they will permit no future election and will heavily punish any attempt to create a new abbot of saint marys conjuraverunt inter se principes dicentes projiciamus laqueos ejus  quousque domineejaculated magdalen this my sister were indeed a perilous and fatal breach in our band but i am firm in my belief that another will arise in the place of him so untimely removed where is thy daughter catharine  in the parlour answered the matron butshe looked at roland graeme and muttered something in the ear of her friend  fear it not answered magdalen graeme it is both lawful and necessaryfear nothing from himi would he were as well grounded in the faith by which alone comes safety as he is free from thought deed or speech of villany therein is the heretics discipline to be commended my sister that they train up their youth in strong morality and choke up every inlet to youthful folly  it is but a cleansing the outside of the cup answered her friend a whitening of the sepulchre but he shall see catharine since you sister judge it safe and meetfollow us youth she added and led the way from the apartmentwith her friend these were the only words which the matron had addressed to roland graeme who obeyed them in silence as they paced through several winding passages and waste apartments with a very slow step the young page had leisure to make some reflections on his situationreflections of a nature which his ardent temper considered as specially disagreeable it seemed he had now got two mistresses or tutoresses instead of one both elderly women and both it would seem in league to direct his motions according to their own pleasure and for the accomplishment of plans to which he was no party this he thought was too much arguing reasonably enough that whatever right his grandmother and benefactress had to guide his motions she was neither entitled to transfer her authority or divide it with another who seemed to assume without ceremony the same tone of absolute command over him  but it shall not long continue thus thought roland i will not be all my life the slave of a womans whistle to go when she bids and come when she calls no by saint andrew the hand that can hold the lance is above the control of the distaff i will leave them the slippd collar in their hands on the first opportunity and let them execute their own devices by their own proper force it may save them both from peril for i guess what they meditate is not likely to prove either safe or easythe earl of murray and his heresy are too well rooted to be grubbed up by two old women  as he thus resolved they entered a low room in which a third female was seated this apartment was the first he had observed in the mansion which was furnished with moveable seats and with a wooden table over which was laid a piece of tapestry a carpet was spread on the floor there was a grate in the chimney and in brief the apartment had the air of being habitable and inhabited  but rolands eyes found better employment than to make observations on the accommodations of the chamber for this second female inhabitant of the mansion seemed something very different from any thing he had yet seen there at his first entry she had greeted with a silent and low obeisance the two aged matrons then glancing her eyes towards roland she adjusted a veil which hung back over her shoulders so as to bring it over her face an operation which she performed with much modesty but without either affected haste or embarrassed timidity  during this manoeuvre roland had time to observe that the face was that of a girl apparently not much past sixteen and that the eyes were at once soft and brilliant to these very favourable observations was added the certainty that the fair object to whom they referred possessed an excellent shape bordering perhaps on enbonpoint and therefore rather that of a hebe than of a sylph but beautifully formed and shown to great advantage by the close jacket and petticoat which she wore after a foreign fashion the last not quite long enough to conceal a very pretty foot which rested on a bar of the table at which she sate her round arms and taper fingers very busily employed in repairingthe piece of tapestry which was spread on it which exhibited several deplorable fissures enough to demand the utmost skill of the most expert seamstress  it is to be remarked that it was by stolen glances that roland graeme contrived to ascertain these interesting particulars and he thought he could once or twice notwithstanding the texture of the veil detect the damsel in the act of taking similar cognizance of his own person the matrons in the meanwhile continued their separate conversation eyeing from time to time the young people in a manner which left roland in no doubt that they were the subject of their conversation at length he distinctly heard magdalen graeme say these wordsnay my sister we must give them opportunity to speak together and to become acquainted they must be personally known to each other or how shall they be able to execute what they are intrusted with  it seemed as if the matron not fully satisfied with her friends reasoning continued to offer some objections but they were borne down by her more dictatorial friend  it must be so she said my dear sister let us therefore go forth on the balcony to finish our conversationand do you she said addressing roland and the girl become acquainted with each other  with this she stepped up to the young woman and raising her veil discovered features which whatever might be their ordinary complexion were now covered with a universal blush  licitum sit said magdalen looking at the other matron  vix licitum replied the other with reluctant and hesitating acquiescence and again adjusting the veil of the blushing girl she dropped it so as to shade though not to conceal her countenance and whispered to her in a tone loud enough for the page to hear remember catharine who thou art and for what destined  the matron then retreated with magdalen graeme through one of the casements of the apartment that opened on a large broad balcony which with its ponderous balustrade had once run along the whole south front of the building which faced the brook and formed a pleasant and commodious walk in the open air it was now in some places deprived of the balustrade in others broken and narrowed but ruinous as it was could still be used as a pleasant promenade here then walked the two ancient dames busied in their private conversation yet not so much so but that roland could observe the matrons as their thin forms darkened the casement in passing or repassing before it dart a glance into the apartment to see how matters were going on there     chapter the eleventh     life hath its may and is mirthful then   the woods are vocal and the flowers all odour   its very blast has mirth intand the maidens   the while they don their cloaks to screen their kirtles   laugh at the rain that wets them                              old play  catherine was at the happy age of innocence and buoyancy of spirit when after the first moment of embarrassment was over a situation of awkwardness like that in which she was suddenly left to make acquaintance with a handsome youth not even known to her by name struck her in spite of herself in a ludicrous point of view she bent her beautiful eyes upon the work with which she was busied and with infinite gravity sate out the two first turns of the matrons upon the balcony but then glancing her deep blue eye a little towards roland and observing the embarrassment under which he laboured now shifting on his chair and now dangling his cap the whole man evincing that he was perfectly at a loss how to open the conversation she could keep her composure no longer but after a vain struggle broke out into a sincere though a very involuntary fit of laughing so richly accompanied by the laughter of her merry eyes which actually glanced through the tears which the effort filled them with and by the waving of her rich tresses that the goddess of smiles herself never looked more lovely than catherine at that moment a court page would not have left her long alone in her mirth but roland was countrybred and besides having some jealousy as well as bashfulness he took it into his head that he was himself the object of her inextinguishable laughter his endeavours to sympathize with catherine therefore could carry him no farther than a forced giggle which had more of displeasure than of mirth in it and which so much enhanced that of the girl that it seemed to render it impossible for her ever to bring her laughter to an end with whatever anxious pains she laboured to do so for every one has felt that when a paroxysm of laughter has seized him at a misbecoming time and place the efforts which he made to suppress it nay the very sense of the impropriety of giving way to it tend only to augment and prolong the irresistible impulse  it was undoubtedly lucky for catherine as well as for roland that the latter did not share in the excessive mirth of the former for seated as she was with her back to the casement catherine could easily escape the observation of the two matrons during the course of their promenade whereas graeme was so placed with his side to the window that his mirth had he shared that of his companion would have been instantly visible and could not have failed to give offence to the personages in question he sate however with some impatience until catherine had exhausted either her power or her desire of laughing and was returning with good grace to the exercise of her needle and then he observed with some dryness that there seemed no great occasion to recommend to them to improve their acquaintance as it seemed that they were already tolerably familiar  catherine had an extreme desire to set off upon a fresh score but she repressed it strongly and fixing her eyes on her work replied by asking his pardon and promising to avoid future offence  roland had sense enough to feel that an air of offended dignity was very much misplaced and that it was with a very different bearing he ought to meet the deep blue eyes which had borne such a hearty burden in the laughing scene he tried therefore to extricate himself as well as he could from his blunder by assuming a tone of correspondent gaiety and requesting to know of the nymph how it was her pleasure that they should proceed in improving the acquaintance which had commenced so merrily  that she said you must yourself discover perhaps i have gone a step too far in opening our interview  suppose said roland graeme we should begin as in a talebook by asking each others names and histories  it is right well imagined said catherine and shows an argute judgment do you begin and i will listen and only put in a question or two at the dark parts of the story come unfold then your name and history my new acquaintance  i am called roland graeme and that tall woman is my grandmother  and your tutoressgood who are your parents  they are both dead replied roland  ay but who were they you had parents i presume  i suppose so said roland but i have never been able to learn much of their history my father was a scottish knight who died gallantly in his stirrupsmy mother was a graeme of hathergill in the debateable landmost of her family were killed when the debateable country was burned by lord maxwell and herries of caerlaverock  is it long ago said the damsel  before i was born answered the page  that must be a great while since said she shaking her head gravely look you i cannot weep for them  it needs not said the youth they fell with honour  so much for your lineage fair sir replied his companion of whom i like the living specimen a glance at the casement far less than those that are dead your much honoured grandmother looks as if she could make one weep in sad earnest and now fair sir for your own personif you tell not the tale faster it will be cut short in the middle mother bridget pauses longer and longer every time she passes the window and with her there is as little mirth as in the grave of your ancestors  my tale is soon toldi was introduced into the castle of avenel to be page to the lady of the mansion  she is a strict huguenot is she not said the maiden  as strict as calvin himself but my grandmother can play the puritan when it suits her purpose and she had some plan of her own for quartering me in the castleit would have failed however after we had remained several weeks at the hamlet but for an unexpected master of ceremonies  and who was that said the girl  a large black dog wolf by name who brought me into the castle one day in his mouth like a hurt wildduck and presented me to the lady  a most respectable introduction truly said catherine and what might you learn at this same castle i love dearly to know what my acquaintances can do at need  to fly a hawk hollow to a hound back a horse and wield lance bow and brand  and to boast of all this when you have learned it said catherine which in france at least is the surest accomplishment of a page but proceed fair sir how came your huguenot lord and your no less huguenot lady to receive and keep in the family so perilous a person as a catholic page  because they knew not that part of my history which from infancy i have been taught to keep secretand because my granddames former zealous attendance on their heretic chaplain had laid all this suspicion to sleep most fair callipolis said the page and in so saying he edged his chair towards the seat of the fair querist  nay but keep your distance most gallant sir answered the blueeyed maiden for unless i greatly mistake these reverend ladies will soon interrupt our amicable conference if the acquaintance they recommend shall seem to proceed beyond a certain pointso fair sir be pleased to abide by your station and reply to my questionsby what achievements did you prove the qualities of a page which you had thus happily acquired  roland who began to enter into the tone and spirit of the damsels conversation replied to her with becoming spirit  in no feat fair gentlewoman was i found inexpert wherein there was mischief implied i shot swans hunted cats frightened servingwomen chased the deer and robbed the orchard i say nothing of tormenting the chaplain in various ways for that was my duty as a good catholic  now as i am a gentlewoman said catherine i think these heretics have done catholic penance in entertaining so allaccomplished a servingman and what fair sir might have been the unhappy event which deprived them of an inmate altogether so estimable  truly fair gentlewoman answered the youth your real proverb says that the longest lane will have a turning and mine was moreit was in fine a turning off  good said the merry young maiden it is an apt play on the word and what occasion was taken for so important a catastrophenay start not for my learning i do know the schoolsin plain phrase why were you sent from service  the page shrugged his shoulders while he replieda short tale is soon toldand a short horse soon curried i made the falconers boy taste of my switchthe falconer threatened to make me brook his cudgelhe is a kindly clown as well as a stout and i would rather have been cudgelled by him than any man in christendom to choosebut i knew not his qualities at that timeso i threatened to make him brook the stab and my lady made me brook the begone so adieu to the pages office and the fair castle of aveneli had not travelled far before i met my venerable parentand so tell your tale fair gentlewoman for mine is done  a happy grandmother said the maiden who had the luck to find the stray page just when his mistress had slipped his leash and a most lucky page that has jumped at once from a page to an old ladys gentlemanusher  all this is nothing of your history answered roland graeme began to be much interested in the congenial vivacity of this facetious young gentlewoman tale for tale is fellowtravellers justice  wait till we are fellowtravellers then replied catherine  nay you escape me not so said the page if you deal not justly by me i will call out to dame bridget or whatever your dame be called and proclaim you for a cheat  you shall not need answered the maidenmy history is the counterpart of your own the same words might almost serve change but dress and name i am called catherine seyton and i also am an orphan  have your parents been long dead  this is the only question said she throwing down her fine eyes with a sudden expression of sorrow that is the only question i cannot laugh at  and dame bridget is your grandmother  the sudden cloud passed away like that which crosses for an instant the summer sun and she answered with her usual lively expression worse by twenty degreesdame bridget is my maiden aunt  over gods forbode said rolandalas that you have such a tale to tell and what horror comes next  your own history exactly i was taken upon trial for service  and turned off for pinching the duenna or affronting my ladys waitingwoman  nay our history varies there said the damselour mistress broke up house or had her house broke up which is the same thing and i am a free woman of the forest  and i am as glad of it as if any one had lined my doublet with cloth of gold said the youth  i thank you for your mirth said she but the matter is not likely to concern you  nay but go on said the page for you will be presently interrupted the two good dames have been soaring yonder on the balcony like two old hooded crows and their croak grows hoarser as night comes on they will wing to roost presentlythis mistress of yours fair gentlewoman who was she in gods name  oh she has a fair name in the world replied catherine seyton few ladies kept a fairer house or held more gentlewomen in her household my aunt bridget was one of her housekeepers we never saw our mistresss blessed face to be sure but we heard enough of her were up early and down late and were kept to long prayers and light food  out upon the penurious old beldam said the page  for heavens sake blaspheme not said the girl with an expression of feargod pardon us both i meant no harm i speak of our blessed saint catherine of siennamay god forgive me that i spoke so lightly and made you do a great sin and a great blasphemy this was her nunnery in which there were twelve nuns and an abbess my aunt was the abbess till the heretics turned all adrift  and where are your companions asked the youth  with the last years snow answered the maiden east north south and westsome to france some to flanders some i fear into the world and its pleasures we have got permission to remain or rather our remaining has been connived at for my aunt has great relations among the kerrs and they have threatened a deathfeud if any one touches us and bow and spear are the best warrant in these times  nay then you sit under a sure shadow said the youth and i suppose you wept yourself blind when saint catherine broke up housekeeping before you had taken arles footnote anglice earnestmoney in her service  hush for heavens sake said the damsel crossing herself no more of that but i have not quite cried my eyes out said she turning them upon him and instantly again bending them upon her work it was one of those glances which would require the threefold plate of brass around the heart more than it is needed by the mariners to whom horace recommends it our youthful page had no defence whatever to offer  what say you catherine he said if we two thus strangely turned out of service at the same time should give our two most venerable duennas the torch to hold while we walk a merry measure with each other over the floor of this weary world  a goodly proposal truly said catherine and worthy the madcap brain of a discarded pageand what shifts does your worship propose we should live byby singing ballads cutting purses or swaggering on the highway for there i think you would find your most productive exchequer  choose you proud peat said the page drawing off in huge disdain at the calm and unembarrassed ridicule with which his wild proposal was received and as he spoke the words the casement was again darkened by the forms of the matronsit opened and admitted magdalen graeme and the mother abbess so we must now style her into the apartment     chapter the twelfth     nay hear me brotheri am elder wiser   and holier than thouand age and wisdom   and holiness have peremptory claims   and will be listend to                               old play  when the matrons reentered and put an end to the conversationwhich we have detailed in the last chapter dame magdalen graeme thus addressed her grandson and his pretty companion have you spoke together my childrenhave you become known to each other as fellowtravellers on the same dark and dubious road whom chance hath brought together and who study to learn the tempers and dispositions of those by whom their perils are to be shared  it was seldom the lighthearted catharine could suppress a jest so that she often spoke when she would have acted more wisely in holding her peace  your grandson admires the journey which you propose so very greatly that he was even now preparing for setting out upon it instantly  this is to be too forward roland said the dame addressing him as yesterday you were over slackthe just mean lies in obedience which both waits for the signal to start and obeys it when givenbut once again my children have you so perused each others countenances that when you meet in whatever disguise the times may impose upon you you may recognize each in the other the secret agent of the mighty work in which you are to be leaguedlook at each other know each line and lineament of each others countenance learn to distinguish by the step by the sound of the voice by the motion of the hand by the glance of the eye the partner whom heaven hath sent to aid in working its willwilt thou know that maiden whensoever or wheresoever you shall again meet her my roland graeme  as readily as truly did roland answer in the affirmative and thou my daughter wilt thou again remember the features of this youth  truly mother replied catherine seyton i have not seen so many men of late that i should immediately forget your grandson though i mark not much about him that is deserving of especial remembrance  join hands then my children said magdalen graeme but in saying so was interrupted by her companion whose conventual prejudices had been gradually giving her more and more uneasiness and who could remain acquiescent no longer  nay my good sister you forget said she to magdalen catharine is the betrothed bride of heaventhese intimacies cannot be  it is in the cause of heaven that i command them to embrace said magdalen with the full force of her powerful voice the end sister sanctifies the means we must use  they call me lady abbess or mother at the least who address me said dame bridget drawing herself up as if offended at her friends authoritative mannerthe lady of heathergill forgets that she speaks to the abbess of saint catherine  when i was what you call me said magdalen you indeed were the abbess of saint catherine but both names are now gone with all the rank that the world and that the church gave to them and we are now to the eye of human judgment two poor despised oppressed women dragging our dishonoured old age to a humble grave but what are we in the eye of heavenministers sent forth to work his willin whose weakness the strength of the church shall be manifestedbefore whom shall be humbled the wisdom of murray and the dark strength of mortonand to such wouldst thou apply the narrow rules of thy cloistered seclusionor hast thou forgotten the order which i showed thee from thy superior subjecting thee to me in these matters  on thy head then be the scandal and the sin said the abbess sullenly  on mine be they both said magdalen i say embrace each other my children  but catherine aware perhaps how the dispute was likely to terminate had escaped from the apartment and so disappointed the grandson at least as much as the old matron  she is gone said the abbess to provide some little refreshment but it will have little savour to those who dwell in the world for i at least cannot dispense with the rules to which i am vowed because it is the will of wicked men to break down the sanctuary in which they wont to be observed  it is well my sister replied magdalen to pay each even the smallest tithes of mint and cummin which the church demands and i blame not thy scrupulous observance of the rules of thine order but they were established by the church and for the churchs benefit and reason it is that they should give way when the salvation of the church herself is at stake  the abbess made no reply  one more acquainted with human nature than the inexperienced page might have found amusement in comparing the different kinds of fanaticisms which these two females exhibited the abbess timid narrowminded and discontented clung to ancient usages and pretensions which were ended by the reformation and was in adversity as she had been in prosperity scrupulous weakspirited and bigoted while the fiery and more lofty spirit of her companion suggested a wider field of effort and would not be limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinary schemes which were suggested by her bold and irregular imagination but roland graeme instead of tracing these peculiarities of character in the two old damps only waited with great anxiety for the return of catherine expecting probably that the proposal of the fraternal embrace would be renewed as his grandmother seemed disposed to carry matters with a high hand  his expectations or hopes if we may call them so were however disappointed for when catherine reentered on the summons of the abbess and placed on the table an earthen pitcher of water and four wooden platters with cups of the same materials the dame of heathergill satisfied with the arbitrary mode in which she had borne down the opposition of the abbess pursued her victory no farthera moderation for which her grandson in his heart returned her but slender thanks  in the meanwhile catherine continued to place upon the table the slender preparations for the meal of a recluse which consisted almost entirely of colewort boiled and served up in a wooden platter having no better seasoning than a little salt and no better accompaniment than some coarse barleybread in very moderate quantity the waterpitcher already mentioned furnished the only beverage after a latin grace delivered by the abbess the guests sat down to their spare entertainment the simplicity of the fare appeared to produce no distaste in the females who ate of it moderately but with the usual appearance of appetite but roland graeme had been used to better cheer sir halbert glendinning who affected even an unusual degree of nobleness in his housekeeping maintained it in a style of genial hospitality which rivalled that of the northern barons of england he might think perhaps that by doing so he acted yet more completely the part for which he was bornthat of a great baron and a leader two bullocks and six sheep weekly were the allowance when the baron was at home and the number was not greatly diminished during his absence a boll of malt was weekly brewed into ale which was used by the household at discretion bread was baked in proportion for the consumption of his domestics and retainers and in this scene of plenty had roland graeme now lived for several years it formed a bad introduction to lukewarm greens and springwater and probably his countenance indicated some sense of the difference for the abbess observed it would seem my son that the tables of the heretic baron whom you have so long followed are more daintily furnished than those of the suffering daughters of the church and yet not upon the most solemn nights of festival when the nuns were permitted to eat their portion at mine own table did i consider the cates which were then served up as half so delicious as these vegetables and this water on which i prefer to feed rather than do aught which may derogate from the strictness of my vow it shall never be said that the mistress of this house made it a house of feasting when days of darkness and of affliction were hanging over the holy church of which i am an unworthy member  well hast thou said my sister replied magdalen graeme but now it is not only time to suffer in the good cause but to act in it and since our pilgrims meal is finished let us go apart to prepare for our journey tomorrow and to advise on the manner in which these children shall be employed and what measures we can adopt to supply their thoughtlessness and lack of discretion  notwithstanding his indifferent cheer the heart of roland graeme bounded high at this proposal which he doubted not would lead to another têteâtête betwixt him and the pretty novice but he was mistaken catherine it would seem had no mind so far to indulge him for moved either by delicacy or caprice or some of those indescribable shades betwixt the one and the other with which women love to tease and at the same time to captivate the ruder sex she reminded the abbess that it was necessary she should retire an hour before vespers and receiving the ready and approving nod of her superior she arose to withdraw but before leaving the apartment she made obeisance to the matrons bending herself till her hands touched her knees and then made a lesser reverence to roland which consisted in a slight bend of the body and gentle depression of the head this she performed very demurely but the party on whom the salutation was conferred thought he could discern in her manner an arch and mischievous exultation over his secret disappointmentthe devil take the saucy girl he thought in his heart though the presence of the abbess should have repressed all such profane imaginationsshe is as hardhearted as the laughing hyaena that the storybooks tell ofshe has a mind that i shall not forget her this night at least  the matrons now retired also giving the page to understand that he was on no account to stir from the convent or to show himself at the windows the abbess assigning as a reason the readiness with which the rude heretics caught at every occasion of scandalizing the religious orders  this is worse than the rigour of mr henry warden himself said the page when he was left alone for to do him justice however strict in requiring the most rigid attention during the time of his homilies he left us to the freedom of our own wills afterwardsay and would take a share in our pastimes too if he thought them entirely innocent but these old women are utterly wrapt up in gloom mystery and selfdenialwell then if i must neither stir out of the gate nor look out at window i will at least see what the inside of the house contains that may help to pass away ones timeperadventure i may light on that blueeyed laugher in some corner or other  going therefore out of the chamber by the entrance opposite to that through which the two matrons had departed for it may be readily supposed that he had no desire to intrude on their privacy he wandered from one chamber to another through the deserted edifice seeking with boyish eagerness some source of interest and amusement here he passed through a long gallery opening on either hand into the little cells of the nuns all deserted and deprived of the few trifling articles of furniture which the rules of the order admitted  the birds are flown thought the page but whether they will find themselves worse off in the open air than in these damp narrow cages i leave my lady abbess and my venerable relative to settle betwixt them i think the wild young lark whom they have left behind them would like best to sing under gods free sky  a winding stair strait and narrow as if to remind the nuns of their duties of fast and maceration led down to a lower suite of apartments which occupied the ground story of the house these rooms were even more ruinous than those which he had left for having encountered the first fury of the assailants by whom the nunnery had been wasted the windows had been dashed in the doors broken down and even the partitions betwixt the apartments in some places destroyed as he thus stalked from desolation to desolation and began to think of returning from so uninteresting a research to the chamber which he had left he was surprised to hear the low of a cow very close to him the sound was so unexpected at the time and place that roland graeme started as if it had been the voice of a lion and laid his hand on his dagger while at the same moment the light and lovely form of catherine seyton presented itself at the door of the apartment from which the sound had issued  good even to you valiant champion said she since the days of guy of warwick never was one more worthy to encounter a dun cow  cow said roland graeme by my faith i thought it had been the devil that roared so near me who ever heard of a convent containing a cowhouse  cow and calf may come hither now answered catherine for we have no means to keep out either but i advise you kind sir to return to the place from whence you came  not till i see your charge fair sister answered roland and made his way into the apartment in spite of the half serious half laughing remonstrances of the girl  the poor solitary cow now the only severe recluse within the nunnery was quartered in a spacious chamber which had once been the refectory of the convent the roof was graced with groined arches and the wall with niches from which the images had been pulled down these remnants of architectural ornaments were strangely contrasted with the rude crib constructed for the cow in one corner of the apartment and the stack of fodder which was piled beside it for her food footnote this like the cell of saint cuthbert is an imaginary scene but i took one or two ideas of the desolation of the interior from a story told me by my father in his youthit may be near eighty years since as he was born in 1729he had occasion to visit an old lady who resided in a border castle of considerable renown only one very limited portion of the extensive ruins sufficed for the accommodation of the inmates and my father amused himself by wandering through the part that was untenanted in a diningapartment having a roof richly adorned with arches and drops there was deposited a large stack of hay to which calves were helping themselves from opposite sides as my father was scaling a dark ruinous turnpike staircase his greyhound ran up before him and probably was the means of saving his life for the animal fell through a trapdoor or aperture in the stair thus warning the owner of the danger of the ascent as the dog continued howling from a great depth my father got the old butler who alone knew most of the localities about the castle to unlock a sort of stable in which killbuck was found safe and sound the place being filled with the same commodity which littered the stalls of augeas and which had rendered the dogs fall an easy one  by my faith said the page crombie is more lordly lodged than any one here  you had best remain with her said catherine and supply by your filial attentions the offspring she has had the ill luck to lose  i will remain at least to help you to prepare her nights lair pretty catherine said roland seizing upon a pitchfork  by no means said catherine for besides that you know not in the least how to do her that service you will bring a chiding my way and i get enough of that in the regular course of things  what for accepting my assistance said the pagefor accepting my assistance who am to be your confederate in some deep matter of import that were altogether unreasonableand now i think on it tell me if you can what is this mighty emprise to which i am destined  robbing a birds nest i should suppose said catherine considering the champion whom they have selected  by my faith said the youth and he that has taken a falcons nest in the scaurs of polmoodie has done something to brag of my fair sisterbut that is all over nowa murrain on the nest and the eyases and their food washed or unwashed for it was all anon of cramming these worthless kites that i was sent upon my present travels save that i have met with you pretty sister i could eat my daggerhilt for vexation at my own folly but as we are to be fellowtravellers  fellowlabourers not fellowtravellers answered the girl for to your comfort be it known that the lady abbess and i set out earlier than you and your respected relative tomorrow and that i partly endure your company at present because it may be long ere we meet again  by saint andrew but it shall not though answered roland i will not hunt at all unless we are to hunt in couples  i suspect in that and in other points we must do as we are bid replied the young ladybut hark i hear my aunts voice  the old lady entered in good earnest and darted a severe glance at her niece while roland had the ready wit to busy himself about the halter of the cow  the young gentleman said catherine gravely is helping me to tie the cow up faster to her stake for i find that last night when she put her head out of window and lowed she alarmed the whole village andwe shall be suspected of sorcery among the heretics if they do not discover the cause of the apparition or lose our cow if they do  relieve yourself of that fear said the abbess somewhat ironically the person to whom she is now sold comes for the animal presently  good night then my poor companion said catherine patting the animals shoulders i hope thou hast fallen into kind hands for my happiest hours of late have been spent in tending theei would i had been born to no better task  now out upon thee meanspirited wench said the abbess is that a speech worthy of the name of seyton or of the mouth of a sister of this house treading the path of electionand to be spoken before a stranger youth toogo to my oratory minionthere read your hours till i come thither when i will read you such a lecture as shall make you prize the blessings which you possess  catherine was about to withdraw in silence casting a half sorrowful half comic glance at roland graeme which seemed to sayyou see to what your untimely visit has exposed me when suddenly changing her mind she came forward to the page and extended her hand as she bid him good evening their palms had pressed each other ere the astonished matron could interfere and catherine had time to sayforgive me mother it is long since we have seen a face that looked with kindness on us since these disorders have broken up our peaceful retreat all has been gloom and malignity i bid this youth kindly farewell because he has come hither in kindness and because the odds are great that we may never again meet in this world i guess better than he that the schemes on which you are rushing are too mighty for your management and that you are now setting the stone arolling which must surely crush you in its descent i bid farewell she added to my fellowvictim  this was spoken with a tone of deep and serious feeling altogether different from the usual levity of catherines manner and plainly showed that beneath the giddiness of extreme youth and total inexperience there lurked in her bosom a deeper power of sense and feeling than her conduct had hitherto expressed  the abbess remained a moment silent after she had left the room the proposed rebuke died on her tongue and she appeared struck with the deep and foreboding tone in which her niece had spoken her goodeven she led the way in silence to the apartment which they had formerly occupied and where there was prepared a small refection as the abbess termed it consisting of milk and barleybread magdalen graeme summoned to take share in this collation appeared from an adjoining apartment but catherine was seen no more there was little said during the hasty meal and after it was finished roland graeme was dismissed to the nearest cell where some preparations had been made for his repose  the strange circumstances in which he found himself had their usual effect in preventing slumber from hastily descending on him and he could distinctly hear by a low but earnest murmuring in the apartment which he had left that the matrons continued in deep consultation to a late hour as they separated he heard the abbess distinctly express herself thus in a word my sister i venerate your character and the authority with which my superiors have invested you yet it seems to me that ere entering on this perilous course we should consult some of the fathers of the church  and how and where are we to find a faithful bishop or abbot at whom to ask counsel the faithful eustatius is no morehe is withdrawn from a world of evil and from the tyranny of heretics may heaven and our lady assoilzie him of his sins and abridge the penance of his mortal infirmitieswhere shall we find another with whom to take counsel  heaven will provide for the church said the abbess and the faithful fathers who yet are suffered to remain in the house of kennaquhair will proceed to elect an abbot they will not suffer the staff to fall down or the mitre to be unfilled for the threats of heresy  that will i learn tomorrow said magdalen graeme yet who now takes the office of an hour save to partake with the spoilers in their work of plundertomorrow will tell us if one of the thousand saints who are sprung from the house of saint marys continues to look down on it in its miseryfarewell my sisterwe meet at edinburgh  benedicito answered the abbess and they parted  to kennaquhair and to edinburgh we bend our way thought roland graeme that information have i purchased by a sleepless hourit suits well with my purpose at kennaquhair i shall see father ambroseat edinburgh i shall find the means of shaping my own course through this bustling world without burdening my affectionate relationat edinburgh too i shall see again the witching novice with her blue eyes and her provoking smilehe fell asleep and it was to dream of catherine seyton     chapter the thirteenth     what dagon up againi thought we had hurld him   down on the threshold never more to rise   bring wedge and axe and neighbours lend your hands   and rive the idol into winter fagots                    athelstane or the converted dane  roland graeme slept long and sound and the sun was high over the horizon when the voice of his companion summoned him to resume their pilgrimage and when hastily arranging his dress he went to attend her call the enthusiastic matron stood already at the threshold prepared for her journey there was in all the deportment of this remarkable woman a promptitude of execution and a sternness of perseverance founded on the fanaticism which she nursed so deeply and which seemed to absorb all the ordinary purposes and feelings of mortality one only human affection gleamed through her enthusiastic energies like the broken glimpses of the sun through the rising clouds of a storm it was her maternal fondness for her grandsona fondness carried almost to the verge of dotage in circumstances where the catholic religion was not concerned but which gave way instantly when it chanced either to thwart or come in contact with the more settled purpose of her soul and the more devoted duty of her life her life she would willingly have laid down to save the earthly object of her affection but that object itself she was ready to hazard and would have been willing to sacrifice could the restoration of the church of rome have been purchased with his blood her discourse by the way excepting on the few occasions in which her extreme love of her grandson found opportunity to display itself in anxiety for his health and accommodation turned entirely on the duty of raising up the fallen honours of the church and replacing a catholic sovereign on the throne there were times at which she hinted though very obscurely and distantly that she herself was foredoomed by heaven to perform a part in this important task and that she had more than mere human warranty for the zeal with which she engaged in it but on this subject she expressed herself in such general language that it was not easy to decide whether she made any actual pretensions to a direct and supernatural call like the celebrated elizabeth barton commonly called the nun of kent footnote a fanatic nun called the holy maid of kent who pretended to the gift of prophecy and power of miracles having denounced the doom of speedy death against henry viii for his marriage with anne boleyn the prophetess was attainted in parliament and executed with her accomplices her imposture was for a time so successful that even sir thomas more was disposed to be a believer or whether she dwelt upon the general duty which was incumbent on all catholics of the time and the pressure of which she felt in an extraordinary degree  yet though magdalen graeme gave no direct intimation of her pretensions to be considered as something beyond the ordinary class of mortals the demeanour of one or two persons amongst the travellers whom they occasionally met as they entered the more fertile and populous part of the valley seemed to indicate their belief in her superior attributes it is true that two clowns who drove before them a herd of cattleone or two village wenches who seemed bound for some merrymakinga strolling soldier in a rusted morion and a wandering student as his threadbare black cloak and his satchel of books proclaimed himpassed our travellers without observation or with a look of contempt and moreover that two or three children attracted by the appearance of a dress so nearly resembling that of a pilgrim joined in hooting and calling out upon the massmonger but one or two who nourished in their bosoms respect for the downfallen hierarchycasting first a timorous glance around to see that no one observed themhastily crossed themselvesbent their knee to sister magdalen by which name they saluted herkissed her hand or even the hem of her dalmatiquereceived with humility the benedicite with which she repaid their obeisance and then starting up and again looking timidly round to see that they had been unobserved hastily resumed their journey even while within sight of persons of the prevailing faith there were individuals bold enough by folding their arms and bending their head to give distant and silent intimation that they recognized sister magdalen and honoured alike her person and her purpose  she failed not to notice to her grandson these marks of honour and respect which from time to time she received you see she said my son that the enemies have been unable altogether to suppress the good spirit or to root out the true seed amid heretics and schismatics spoilers of the churchs lands and scoffers at saints and sacraments there is left a remnant  it is true my mother said roland graeme but methinks they are of a quality which can help us but little see you not all those who wear steel at their side and bear marks of better quality ruffle past us as they would past the meanest beggars for those who give us any marks of sympathy are the poorest of the poor and most outcast of the needy who have neither bread to share with us nor swords to defend us nor skill to use them if they had that poor wretch that last kneeled to you with such deep devotion and who seemed emaciated by the touch of some wasting disease within and the grasp of poverty withoutthat pale shivering miserable caitiff how can he aid the great schemes you meditate  much my son said the matron with more mildness than the page perhaps expected when that pious son of the church returns from the shrine of saint ringan whither he now travels by my counsel and by the aid of good catholicswhen he returns healed of his wasting malady high in health and strong in limb will not the glory of his faithfulness and its miraculous reward speak louder in the ears of this besotted people of scotland than the din which is weekly made in a thousand heretical pulpits  ay but mother i fear the saints hand is out it is long since we have heard of a miracle performed at st ringans  the matron made a dead pause and with a voice tremulous with emotion asked art thou so unhappy as to doubt the power of the blessed saint  nay mother the youth hastened to reply i believe as the holy church commands and doubt not saint ringans power of healing but be it said with reverence he hath not of late showed the inclination  and has this land deserved it said the catholic matron advancing hastily while she spoke until she attained the summit of a rising ground over which the path led and then standing again still here she said stood the cross the limits of the halidome of saint maryshereon this eminencefrom which the eye of the holy pilgrim might first catch a view of that ancient monastery the light of the land the abode of saints and the grave of monarchswhere is now that emblem of our faith it lies on the eartha shapeless block from which the broken fragments have been carried off for the meanest uses till now no semblance of its original form remains look towards the east my son where the sun was wont to glitter on stately spiresfrom which crosses and bells have now been hurled as if the land had been invaded once more by barbarous heathenslook at yonder battlements of which we can even at this distance descry the partial demolition and ask if this land can expect from the blessed saints whose shrines and whose images have been profaned any other miracles but those of vengeance how long she exclaimed looking upward how long shall it be delayed she paused and then resumed with enthusiastic rapidity yes my son all on earth is but for a periodjoy and grief triumph and desolation succeed each other like cloud and sunshinethe vineyard shall not be forever trodden down the gaps shall be amended and the fruitful branches once more dressed and trimmed even this dayay even this hour i trust to hear news of importance dally notlet us ontime is brief and judgment is certain  she resumed the path which led to the abbeya path which in ancient times was carefully marked out by posts and rails to assist the pilgrim in his journeythese were now torn up and destroyed a halfhours walk placed them in front of the once splendid monastery which although the church was as yet entire had not escaped the fury of the times the long range of cells and of apartments for the use of the brethren which occupied two sides of the great square were almost entirely ruinous the interior having been consumed by fire which only the massive architecture of the outward walls had enabled them to resist the abbots house which formed the third side of the square was though injured still inhabited and afforded refuge to the few brethren who yet rather by connivance than by actual authoritywere permitted to remain at kennaquhair their stately officestheir pleasant gardensthe magnificent cloisters constructed for their recreation were all dilapidated and ruinous and some of the building materials had apparently been put into requisition by persons in the village and in the vicinity who formerly vassals of the monastery had not hesitated to appropriate to themselves a part of the spoils roland saw fragments of gothic pillars richly carved occupying the place of doorposts to the meanest huts and here and there a mutilated statue inverted or laid on its side made the doorpost or threshold of a wretched cowhouse the church itself was less injured than the other buildings of the monastery but the images which had been placed in the numerous niches of its columns and buttresses having all fallen under the charge of idolatry to which the superstitious devotion of the papists had justly exposed them had been broken and thrown down without much regard to the preservation of the rich and airy canopies and pedestals on which they were placed nor if the devastation had stopped short at this point could we have considered the preservation of these monuments of antiquity as an object to be put in the balance with the introduction of the reformed worship  our pilgrims saw the demolition of these sacred and venerable representations of saints and angelsfor as sacred and venerable they had been taught to consider themwith very different feelings the antiquary may be permitted to regret the necessity of the action but to magdalen graeme it seemed a deed of impiety deserving the instant vengeance of heavena sentiment in which her relative joined for the moment as cordially as herself neither however gave vent to their feelings in words and uplifted hands and eyes formed their only mode of expressing them the page was about to approach the great eastern gate of the church but was prevented by his guide that gate she said has long been blockaded that the heretical rabble may not know there still exist among the brethren of saint marys men who dare worship where their predecessors prayed while alive and were interred when deadfollow me this way my son  roland graeme followed accordingly and magdalen casting a hasty glance to see whether they were observed for she had learned caution from the danger of the times commanded her grandson to knock at a little wicket which she pointed out to him but knock gently she added with a motion expressive of caution after a little space during which no answer was returned she signed to roland to repeat his summons for admission and the door at length partially opening discovered a glimpse of the thin and timid porter by whom the duty was performed skulking from the observation of those who stood without but endeavouring at the same time to gain a sight of them without being himself seen how different from the proud consciousness of dignity with which the porter of ancient days offered his important brow and his goodly person to the pilgrims who repaired to kennaquhair his solemn intrate mei filii was exchanged for a tremulous you cannot enter nowthe brethren are in their chambers but when magdalen graeme asked in an under tone of voice hast thou forgotten me my brother he changed his apologetic refusal to enter my honoured sister enter speedily for evil eyes are upon us  they entered accordingly and having waited until the porter had with jealous haste barred and bolted the wicket were conducted by him through several dark and winding passages as they walked slowly on he spoke to the matron in a subdued voice as if he feared to trust the very walls with the avowal which he communicated  our fathers are assembled in the chapterhouse worthy sisteryes in the chapterhousefor the election of an abbottah benedicite there must be no ringing of bellsno high massno opening of the great gates now that the people might see and venerate their spiritual father our fathers must hide themselves rather like robbers who choose a leader than godly priests who elect a mitred abbot  regard not that my brother answered magdalen graeme the first successors of saint peter himself were elected not in sunshine but in tempestsnot in the halls of the vatican but in the subterranean vaults and dungeons of heathen romethey were not gratulated with shouts and salvos of cannonshot and of musketry and the display of artificial fireno my brotherbut by the hoarse summons of lictors and praetors who came to drag the fathers of the church to martyrdom from such adversity was the church once raised and by such will it now be purifiedand mark me brother not in the proudest days of the mitred abbey was a superior ever chosen whom his office shall so much honour as he shall be honoured who now takes it upon him in these days of tribulation on whom my brother will the choice fall  on whom can it fallor alas who would dare to reply to the call save the worthy pupil of the sainted eustatiusthe good and valiant father ambrose  i know it said magdalen my heart told me long ere your lips had uttered his name stand forth courageous champion and man the fatal breachrise bold and experienced pilot and seize the helm while the tempest ragesturn back the battle brave raiser of the fallen standardwield crook and slang noble shepherd of a scattered flock  i pray you hush my sister said the porter opening a door which led into the great church the brethren will be presently here to celebrate their election with a solemn massi must marshal them the way to the high altarall the offices of this venerable house have now devolved on one poor decrepit old man  he left the church and magdalen and roland remained alone in that great vaulted space whose style of rich yet chaste architecture referred its origin to the early part of the fourteenth century the best period of gothic building but the niches were stripped of their images in the inside as well as the outside of the church and in the pellmell havoc the tombs of warriors and of princes had been included in the demolition of the idolatrous shrines lances and swords of antique size which had hung over the tombs of mighty warriors of former days lay now strewed among relics with which the devotion of pilgrims had graced those of their peculiar saints and the fragments of the knights and dames which had once lain recumbent or kneeled in an attitude of devotion where their mortal relics were reposed were mingled with those of the saints and angels of the gothic chisel which the hand of violence had sent headlong from their stations  the most fatal symptom of the whole appeared to be that though this violence had now been committed for many months the fathers had lost so totally all heart and resolution that they had not adventured even upon clearing away the rubbish or restoring the church to some decent degree of order this might have been done without much labour but terror had overpowered the scanty remains of a body once so powerful and sensible they were only suffered to remain in this ancient seat by connivance and from compassion they did not venture upon taking any step which might be construed into an assertion of their ancient rights contenting themselves with the secret and obscure exercise of their religious ceremonial in as unostentatious a manner as was possible  two or three of the more aged brethren had sunk under the pressure of the times and the ruins had been partly cleared away to permit their interment one stone had been laid over father nicholas which recorded of him in special that he had taken the vows during the incumbency of abbot ingelram the period to which his memory so frequently recurred another flagstone yet more recently deposited covered the body of philip the sacristan eminent for his aquatic excursion with the phantom of avenel and a third the most recent of all bore the outline of a mitre and the words hic jacet eustatius abbas for no one dared to add a word of commendation in favour of his learning and strenuous zeal for the roman catholic faith  magdalen graeme looked at and perused the brief records of these monuments successively and paused over that of father eustace in a good hour for thyself she said but oh in an evil hour for the church wert thou called from us let thy spirit be with us holy manencourage thy successor to tread in thy footstepsgive him thy bold and inventive capacity thy zeal and thy discretioneven thy piety exceeds not his as she spoke a side door which closed a passage from the abbots house into the church was thrown open that the fathers might enter the choir and conduct to the high altar the superior whom they had elected  in former times this was one of the most splendid of the many pageants which the hierarchy of rome had devised to attract the veneration of the faithful the period during which the abbacy remained vacant was a state of mourning or as their emblematical phrase expressed it of widowhood a melancholy term which was changed into rejoicing and triumph when a new superior was chosen when the folding doors were on such solemn occasions thrown open and the new abbot appeared on the threshold in fullblown dignity with ring and mitre and dalmatique and crosier his hoary standardbearers and his juvenile dispensers of incense preceding him and the venerable train of monks behind him with all besides which could announce the supreme authority to which he was now raised his appearance was a signal for the magnificent jubilate to rise from the organ and musicloft and to be joined by the corresponding bursts of alleluiah from the whole assembled congregation now all was changed  in the midst of rubbish and desolation seven or eight old men bent and shaken as much by grief and fear as by age shrouded hastily in the proscribed dress of their order wandered like a procession of spectres from the door which had been thrown open up through the encumbered passage to the high altar there to instal their elected superior a chief of ruins it was like a band of bewildered travellers choosing a chief in the wilderness of arabia or a shipwrecked crew electing a captain upon the barren island on which fate has thrown them  they who in peaceful times are most ambitious of authority among others shrink from the competition at such eventful periods when neither ease nor parade attend the possession of it and when it gives only a painful preeminence both in danger and in labour and exposes the illfated chieftain to the murmurs of his discontented associates as well as to the first assault of the common enemy but he on whom the office of the abbot of saint marys was now conferred had a mind fitted for the situation to which he was called bold and enthusiastic yet generous and forgivingwise and skilful yet zealous and prompthe wanted but a better cause than the support of a decaying superstition to have raised him to the rank of a truly great man but as the end crowns the work it also forms the rule by which it must be ultimately judged and those who with sincerity and generosity fight and fall in an evil cause posterity can only compassionate as victims of a generous but fatal error amongst these we must rank ambrosius the last abbot of kennaqubair whose designs must be condemned as their success would have riveted on scotland the chains of antiquated superstition and spiritual tyranny but whose talents commanded respect and whose virtues even from the enemies of his faith extorted esteem  the bearing of the new abbot served of itself to dignify a ceremonial which was deprived of all other attributes of grandeur conscious of the peril in which they stood and recalling doubtless the better days they had seen there hung over his brethren an appearance of mingled terror and grief and shame which induced them to hurry over the office in which they were engaged as something at once degrading and dangerous  but not so father ambrose his features indeed expressed a deep melancholy as he walked up the centre aisle amid the ruin of things which he considered as holy but his brow was undejected and his step firm and solemn he seemed to think that the dominion which he was about to receive depended in no sort upon the external circumstances under which it was conferred and if a mind so firm was accessible to sorrow or fear it was not on his own account but on that of the church to which he had devoted himself  at length he stood on the broken steps of the high altar barefooted as was the rule and holding in his hand his pastoral staff for the gemmed ring and jewelled mitre had become secular spoils no obedient vassals came man after man to make their homage and to offer the tribute which should provide their spiritual superior with palfrey and trappings no bishop assisted at the solemnity to receive into the higher ranks of the church nobility a dignitary whose voice in the legislature was as potential as his own with hasty and maimed rites the few remaining brethren stepped forward alternately to give their new abbot the kiss of peace in token of fraternal affection and spiritual homage mass was then hastily performed but in such precipitation as if it had been hurried over rather to satisfy the scruples of a few youths who were impatient to set out on a hunting party than as if it made the most solemn part of a solemn ordination the officiating priest faltered as he spoke the service and often looked around as if he expected to be interrupted in the midst of his office and the brethren listened to that which short as it was they wished yet more abridgedfootnote in catholic countries in order to reconcile the pleasures of the great with the observances of religion it was common when a party was bent for the chase to celebrate mass abridged and maimed of its rites called a huntingmass the brevity of which was designed to correspond with the impatience of the audience  these symptoms of alarm increased as the ceremony proceeded and as it seemed were not caused by mere apprehension alone for amid the pauses of the hymn there were heard without sounds of a very different sort beginning faintly and at a distance but at length approaching close to the exterior of the church and stunning with dissonant clamour those engaged in the service the winding of horns blown with no regard to harmony or concert the jangling of bells the thumping of drums the squeaking of bagpipes and the clash of cymbalsthe shouts of a multitude now as in laughter now as in angerthe shrill tones of female voices and of those of children mingling with the deeper clamour of men formed a babel of sounds which first drowned and then awed into utter silence the official hymns of the convent the cause and result of this extraordinary interruption will be explained in the next chapter     chapter the fourteenth     not the wild billow when it breaks its barrier   not the wild wind escaping from its cavern   not the wild fiend that mingles both together   and pours their rage upon the ripening harvest   can match the wild freaks of this mirthful meeting   comic yet fearfuldroll and yet destructive                               the conspiracy  the monks ceased their song which like that of the choristers in the legend of the witch of berkley died away in a quaver of consternation and like a flock of chickens disturbed by the presence of the kite they at first made a movement to disperse and fly in different directions and then with despair rather than hope huddled themselves around their new abbot who retaining the lofty and undismayed look which had dignified him through the whole ceremony stood on the higher step of the altar as if desirous to be the most conspicuous mark on which danger might discharge itself and to save his companions by his selfdevotion since he could afford them no other protection  involuntarily as it were magdalen graeme and the page stepped from the station which hitherto they had occupied unnoticed and approached to the altar as desirous of sharing the fate which approached the monks whatever that might be both bowed reverently low to the abbot and while magdalen seemed about to speak the youth looking towards the main entrance at which the noise now roared most loudly and which was at the same time assailed with much knocking laid his hand upon his dagger  the abbot motioned to both to forbear peace my sister he said in a low tone but which being in a different key from the tumultuary sounds without could be distinctly heard even amidst the tumultpeace he said my sister let the new superior of saint marys himself receive and reply to the grateful acclamations of the vassals who come to celebrate his installationand thou my son forbear i charge thee to touch thy earthly weaponif it is the pleasure of our protectress that her shrine be this day desecrated by deeds of violence and polluted by bloodshedding let it not i charge thee happen through the deed of a catholic son of the church  the noise and knocking at the outer gate became now every moment louder and voices were heard impatiently demanding admittance the abbot with dignity and with a step which even the emergency of danger rendered neither faltering nor precipitate moved towards the portal and demanded to know in a tone of authority who it was that disturbed their worship and what they desired  there was a moments silence and then a loud laugh from without at length a voice replied we desire entrance into the church and when the door is opened you will soon see who we are  by whose authority do you require entrance said the father  by authority of the right reverend lord abbot of unreason  footnote we learn from no less authority than that of napoleon bonaparte that there is but a single step between the sublime and ridiculous and it is a transition from one extreme to another so very easy that the vulgar of every degree are peculiarly captivated with it thus the inclination to laugh becomes uncontrollable when the solemnity and gravity of time place and circumstances render it peculiarly improper some species of general license like that which inspired the ancient saturnalia or the modern carnival has been commonly indulged to the people at all times and in almost all countries but it was i think peculiar to the roman catholic church that while they studied how to render their church rites imposing and magnificent by all that pomp music architecture and external display could add to them they nevertheless connived upon special occasions at the frolics of the rude vulgar who in almost all catholic countries enjoyed or at least assumed the privilege of making some lord of the revels who under the name of the abbot of unreason the boy bishop or the president of fools occupied the churches profaned the holy places by a mock imitation of the sacred rites and sung indecent parodies on hymns of the church the indifference of the clergy even when their power was greatest to the indecent exhibitions which they always tolerated and sometimes encouraged forms a strong contrast to the sensitiveness with which they regarded any serious attempt by preaching or writing to impeach any of the doctrines of the church it could only be compared to the singular apathy with which they endured and often admired the gross novels which chaucer dunbar boccacio bandello and others composed upon the bad morals of the clergy it seems as if the churchmen in both instances had endeavoured to compromise with the laity and allowed them occasionally to gratify their coarse humour by indecent satire provided they would abstain from any grave question concerning the foundation of the doctrines on which was erected such an immense fabric of ecclesiastical power  but the sports thus licensed assumed a very different appearance so soon as the protestant doctrines began to prevail and the license which their forefathers had exercised in mere gaiety of heart and without the least intention of dishonouring religion by their frolics were now persevered in by the common people as a mode of testifying their utter disregard for the roman priesthood and its ceremonies  i may observe for example the case of an apparitor sent to borthwick from the primate of saint andrews to cite the lord of that castle who was opposed by an abbot of unreason at whose command the officer of the spiritual court was appointed to be ducked in a milldam and obliged to eat up his parchment citation  the reader may be amused with the following whimsical details of this incident which took place in the castle of borthwick in the year 1517 it appears that in consequence of a process betwixt master george hay de minzeane and the lord borthwick letters of excommunication had passed against the latter on account of the contumacy of certain witnesses william langlands an apparitor or macer bacularius of the see of st andrews presented these letters to the curate of the church of borthwick requiring him to publish the same at the service of high mass it seems that the inhabitants of the castle were at this time engaged in the favourite sport of enacting the abbot of unreason a species of high jinks in which a mimic prelate was elected who like the lord of misrule in england turned all sort of lawful authority and particularly the church ritual into ridicule this frolicsome person with his retinue notwithstanding of the apparitors character entered the church seized upon the primates officer without hesitation and dragging him to the milldam on the south side of the castle compelled him to leap into the water not contented with this partial immersion the abbot of unreason pronounced that mr william langlands was not yet sufficiently bathed and therefore caused his assistants to lay him on his back in the stream and duck him in the most satisfactory and perfect manner the unfortunate apparitor was then conducted back to the church where for his refreshment after his bath the letters of excommunication were torn to pieces and steeped in a bowl of wine the mock abbot being probably of opinion that a tough parchment was but dry eating langlands was compelled to eat the letters and swallow the wine and dismissed by the abbot of unreason with the comfortable assurance that if any more such letters should arrive during the continuance of his office they should a gang the same gate i e go the same road  a similar scene occurs betwixt a sumner of the bishop of rochester and harpool the servant of lord cobham in the old play of sir john oldcastle when the former compels the churchofficer to eat his citation the dialogue which may be found in

in peace i speak this as having lawful authority to command here  open the door said another rude voice and we will try titles with you sir monk and show you a superior we must all obey  break open the doors if he dallies any longer said a third and down with the carrion monks who would bar us of our privilege a general shout followed ay ay our privilege our privilege down with the doors and with the lurdane monks if they make opposition  the knocking was now exchanged for blows with great hammers to which the doors strong as they were must soon have given way but the abbot who saw resistance would be in vain and who did not wish to incense the assailants by an attempt at offering it besought silence earnestly and with difficulty obtained a hearing my children said he i will

in hasty terror performed his office throwing open the great door the populace would have saved him the trouble the instant he had done so the affrighted janitor fled like one who has drawn the bolts of a floodgate and expects to be overwhelmed by the rushing inundation the monks with one consent had withdrawn themselves behind the abbot who alone kept his station about three yards from the entrance showing no signs of fear or perturbation his brethrenpartly encouraged by his devotion partly ashamed to desert him and partly animated by a sense of dutyremained huddled close together at the back of their superior there was a loud laugh and huzza when the doors were opened but contrary to what might have been expected no crowd of enraged assailants rushed into the church on the contrary there was a cry of a halta haltto order my masters and let the two reverend fathers greet each other as beseems them  the appearance of the crowd who were thus called to order was grotesque in the extreme it was composed of men women and children ludicrously disguised in various habits and presenting groups equally diversified and grotesque here one fellow with a horses head painted before him and a tail behind and the whole covered with a long footcloth which was supposed to hide the body of the animal ambled caracoled pranced and plunged as he performed the celebrated part of

dance with the hobbyhorse there was much difficulty and great variety in the motions which the hobbyhorse was expected to exhibit  the learned mr douce who has contributed so much to the illustration of our theatrical antiquities has given us a full account of this pageant and the burlesque horsemanship which it practised  the hobbyhorse says mr douce was represented by a man equipped with as much pasteboard as was sufficient to form the head and hinder parts of a horse the quadrupedal defects being concealed by a long mantle or footcloth that nearly touched the ground the former on this

snug the joiner for the decided preference which they gave to the use of their hind legs was sufficient without any formal annunciation to assure the most timorous spectators that they had to do with habitual bipeds there was a group of outlaws with robin hood and little john at their head  footnote the representation of robin hood was the darling maygame both in england and scotland and doubtless the favourite personification was often revived when the abbot of unreason or other pretences of frolic gave an unusual decree of license  the protestant clergy who had formerly reaped advantage from the opportunities which these sports afforded them of directing their own satire and the ridicule of the lower orders against the catholic church began to find that when these purposes were served their favourite pastimes deprived them of the wish to attend divine worship and disturbed the frame of mind in which it can be attended to advantage the celebrated bishop latimer gives a very naive account of the manner in which bishop as he was he found himself compelled to give place to robin hood and his followers  i came once myselfe riding on a journey homeward from london and i sent word over night into the towne that i would preach there in the morning because it was holiday and me thought it was a holidayes worke the church stood in my way and i took my horse and my company and went thither i thought i should have found a great company in the church and when i came there the church doore was fast locked i tarryed there halfe an houre and more at last the key was found and one of the parish comes to me and saidsir this is a busie day with us we cannot hear you it is robin hoods day the parish are gone abroad to gather for robin hood i pray you let them not i was faine there to give place to robin hood i thought my rochet should have been regarded though i were not but it would not serve it was faine to give place to robin hoods men it is no laughing matter my friends it is a weeping matter a heavie matter a heavie matter under the pretence for gathering for robin hood a traytour and a theif to put out a preacher to have his office lesse esteemed to preferre robin hood

wordbishop latimers sixth sermon before king edward  while the english protestants thus preferred the outlaws pageant to the preaching of their excellent bishop the scottish calvinistic clergy with the celebrated john knox at their head and backed by the authority of the magistrates of edinburgh who had of late been chosen exclusively from this party found it impossible to control the rage of the populace when they attempted to deprive them of the privilege of presenting their pageant of robin hood  note on old scottish spelling leading y  modern th leading v  modern u  561 vpon the xxi

assistance to put down the tumult they will be magistrates alone said the recusant deacons een let them rule the populace alone and accordingly they passed quietly to take their fourhours penny and left the magistrates to help themselves as they could many persons were excommunicated for this outrage and not admitted to church ordinances till they had made satisfaction  the best representation exhibited at the time and no great wonder since most of the actors were by profession the banished men and thieves whom they presented other masqueraders there were of a less marked description men were disguised as women and women as menchildren wore the dress of aged people and tottered with crutchsticks in their hands furred gowns on their little backs and caps on their round headswhile grandsires assumed the infantine tone as well as the dress of children besides these many had their faces painted and wore their shirts over the rest of their dress while coloured pasteboard and ribbons furnished out decorations for others those who wanted all these properties blacked their faces and turned their jackets inside out and thus the transmutation of the whole assembly into a set of mad grotesque mummers was at once completed  the pause which the masqueraders made waiting apparently for some person of the highest authority amongst them gave those within the abbey church full time to observe all these absurdities they were at no loss to comprehend their purpose and meaning  few readers can be ignorant that at an early period and during the plenitude of her power the church of rome not only connived at but even encouraged such saturnalian licenses as the inhabitants of kennaquhair and the neighbourhood had now in hand and that the vulgar on such occasions were not only permitted but encouraged by a number of gambols sometimes puerile and ludicrous sometimes immoral and profane to indemnify themselves for the privations and penances imposed on them at other seasons but of all other topics for burlesque and ridicule the rites and ceremonial of the church itself were most frequently resorted to and strange to say with the approbation of the clergy themselves  while the hierarchy flourished in full glory they do not appear to have dreaded the consequences of suffering the people to become so irreverently familiar with things sacred they then imagined the laity to be much in the condition of the labourers horse which does not submit to the bridle and the whip with greater reluctance because at rare intervals he is allowed to frolic at large in his pasture and fling out his heels in clumsy gambols at the master who usually drives him but when times changedwhen doubt of the roman catholic doctrine and hatred of their priesthood had possessed the reformed party the clergy discovered too late that no small inconvenience arose from the established practice of games and merrymakings in which they themselves and all they held most sacred were made the subject of ridicule it then became obvious to duller politicians than the romish churchmen that the same actions have a very different tendency when done in the spirit of sarcastic insolence and hatred than when acted merely in exuberance of rude and uncontrollable spirits they therefore though of the latest endeavoured where they had any remaining influence to discourage the renewal of these indecorous festivities in this particular the catholic clergy were joined by most of the reformed preachers who were more shocked at the profanity and immorality of many of these exhibitions than disposed to profit by the ridiculous light in which they placed the church of rome and her observances but it was long ere these scandalous and immoral sports could be abrogatedthe rude multitude continued attached to their favourite pastimes and both in england and scotland the mitre of the catholicthe rochet of the reformed bishopand the cloak and band of the calvinistic divinewere in turn compelled to give place to those jocular personages the pope of fools the boybishop and the abbot of unreason footnote from the interesting novel entitled anastasius it seems the same burlesque ceremonies were practised in the greek church   it was the latter personage who now in full costume made his approach to the great door of the church of st marys accoutred in such a manner as to form a caricature or practical parody on the costume and attendants of the real superior whom he came to beard on the very day of his installation in the presence of his clergy and in the chancel of his church the mock dignitary was a stoutmade undersized fellow whose thick squab form had been rendered grotesque by a supplemental paunch well stuffed he wore a mitre of leather with the front like a grenadiers cap adorned with mock embroidery and trinkets of tin this surmounted a visage the nose of which was the most prominent feature being of unusual size and at least as richly gemmed as his headgear his robe was of buckram and his cope of canvass curiously painted and cut into open work on one shoulder was fixed the painted figure of an owl and he bore in the right hand his pastoral staff and in the left a small mirror having a handle to it thus resembling a celebrated jester whose adventures translated into english were whilom extremely popular and which may still be procured in black letter for about one sterling pound per leaf  the attendants of this mock dignitary had their proper dresses and equipage bearing the same burlesque resemblance to the officers of the convent which their leader did to the superior they followed their leader in regular procession and the motley characters which had waited his arrival now crowded into the church in his train shouting as they camea hall a hall for the venerable father howleglas the learned monk of misrule and the right reverend abbot of unreason  the discordant minstrelsy of every kind renewed its din the boys shrieked and howled and the men laughed and hallooed and the women giggled and screamed and the beasts roared and the dragon wallopped and hissed and the hobbyhorse neighed pranced and capered and the rest frisked and frolicked clashing their hobnailed shoes against the pavement till it sparkled with the marks of their energetic caprioles  it was in fine a scene of ridiculous confusion that deafened the ear made the eyes giddy and must have altogether stunned any indifferent spectator the monks whom personal apprehension and a consciousness that much of the popular enjoyment arose from the ridicule being directed against them were moreover little comforted by the reflection that bold in their disguise the mummers who whooped and capered around them might on slight provocation turn their jest into earnest or at least proceed to those practical pleasantries which at all times arise so naturally out of the frolicsome and mischievous disposition of the populace they looked to their abbot amid the tumult with such looks as landsmen cast upon the pilot when the storm is at the highestlooks which express that they are devoid of all hope arising from their own exertions and not very confident in any success likely to attend those of their palinurus  the abbot himself seemed at a stand he felt no fear but he was sensible of the danger of expressing his rising indignation which he was scarcely able to suppress he made a gesture with his hand as if commanding silence which was at first only replied to by redoubled shouts and peals of wild laughter when however the same motion and as nearly in the same manner had been made by howleglas it was immediately obeyed by his riotous companions who expected fresh food for mirth in the conversation betwixt the real and mock abbot having no small confidence in the vulgar wit and impudence of their leader accordingly they began to shout to it fathersto it ifight monk fight madcapabbot against abbot is fair play and so is reason against unreason and malice against monkery  silence my mates said howleglas cannot two learned fathers of the church hold communion together but you must come here with your beargarden whoop and hollo as if you were hounding forth a mastiff upon a mad bull i say silence and let this learned father and me confer touching matters affecting our mutual state and authority  my childrensaid father ambrose  my children tooand happy children they are said his burlesque counterpart many a wise child knows not its own father and it is well they have two to choose betwixt  if thou hast aught in thee save scoffing and ribaldry said the real abbot permit me for thine own souls sake to speak a few words to these misguided men  aught in me but scoffing sayest thou retorted the abbot of unreason why reverend brother i have all that becomes mine office at this time adayi have beef ale and brandywine with other condiments not worth mentioning and for speaking manwhy speak away and we will have turn about like honest fellows  during this discussion the wrath of magdalen graeme had risen to the uttermost she approached the abbot and placing herself by his side said in a low and yet distinct tonewake and arouse thee fatherthe sword of saint peter is in thy handstrike and avenge saint peters patrimonybind them in the chains which being riveted by the church on earth are riveted in heaven  peace sister said the abbot let not their madness destroy our discretioni pray thee peace and let me do mine office it is the first peradventure it may be the last time i shall be called on to discharge it  nay my holy brother said howleglas i rede you take the holy sisters advicenever throve convent without womans counsel  peace vain man said the abbot and you my brethren  nay nay said the abbot of unreason no speaking to the lay people until you have conferred with your brother of the cowl i swear by bell book and candle that no one of my congregation shall listen to one word you have to say so you had as well address yourself to me who will  to escape a conference so ludicrous the abbot again attempted an appeal to what respectful feelings might yet remain amongst the inhabitants of the halidome once so devoted to their spiritual superiors alas the abbot of unreason had only to nourish his mock crosier and the whooping the hallooing and the dancing were renewed with a vehemence which would have defied the lungs of stentor  and now my mates said the abbot of unreason once again dight your gabs and be hushedlet us see if the cock of kennaquhair will fight or flee the pit  there was again a dead silence of expectation of which father ambrose availed himself to address his antagonist seeing plainly that he could gain an audience on no other terms wretched man said he hast thou no better employment for thy carnal wit than to employ it in leading these blind and helpless creatures into the pit of utter darkness  truly my brother replied howleglas i can see little difference betwixt your employment and mine save that you make a sermon of a jest and i make a jest of a sermon  unhappy being said the abbot who hast no better subject of pleasantry than that which should make thee trembleno sounder jest than thine own sins and no better objects for laughter than those who can absolve thee from the guilt of them  verily my reverend brother said the mock abbot what you say might be true if in laughing at hypocrites i meant to laugh at religionoh it is a precious thing to wear a long dress with a girdle and a cowlwe become a holy pillar of mother church and a boy must not play at ball against the walls for fear of breaking a painted window  and will you my friends said the abbot looking round and speaking with a vehemence which secured him a tranquil audience for some timewill you suffer a profane buffoon within the very church of god to insult his ministers many of youall of you perhapshave lived under my holy predecessors who were called upon to rule in this church where i am called upon to suffer if you have worldly goods they are their gift and when you scorned not to accept better giftsthe mercy and forgiveness of the churchwere they not ever at your commanddid we not pray while you were jovialwake while you slept  some of the good wives of the halidome were wont to say so said the abbot of unreason but his jest met in this instance but slight applause and father ambrose having gained a moments attention hastened to improve it  what said he and is this gratefulis it seemlyis it honestto assail with scorn a few old men from whose predecessors you hold all and whose only wish is to die in peace among these fragments of what was once the light of the land and whose daily prayer is that they may be removed ere that hour comes when the last spark shall be extinguished and the land left in the darkness which it has chosen rather than light we have not turned against you the edge of the spiritual sword to revenge our temporal persecution the tempest of your wrath hath despoiled us of land and deprived us almost of our daily food but we have not repaid it with the thunders of excommunicationwe only pray your leave to live and die within the church which is our own invoking god our lady and the holy saints to pardon your sins and our own undisturbed by scurril buffoonery and blasphemy  this speech so different in tone and termination from that which the crowd had expected produced an effect upon their feelings unfavourable to the prosecution of their frolic the morrisdancers stood stillthe hobbyhorse surceased his caperingpipe and tabor were mute and silence like a heavy cloud seemed to descend on the once noisy rabble several of the beasts were obviously moved to compunction the bear could not restrain his sobs and a huge fox was observed to wipe his eyes with his tail but in especial the dragon lately so formidably rampant now relaxed the terror of his claws uncoiled his tremendous rings and grumbled out of his fiery throat in a repentant tone by the mass i thought no harm in exercising our old pastime but an i had thought the good father would have taken it so to heart i would as soon have played your devil as your dragon  in this momentary pause the abbot stood amongst the miscellaneous and grotesque forms by which he was surrounded triumphant as saint anthony in callots temptations but howleglas would not so resign his purpose  and how now my masters said he is this fair play or no have you not chosen me abbot of unreason and is it lawful for any of you to listen to common sense today was i not formally elected by you in solemn chapter held in luckie martins changehouse and will you now desert me and give up your old pastime and privilege play out the playand he that speaks the next word of sense or reason or bids us think or consider or the like of that which befits not the day i will have him solemnly ducked in the milldam  the rabble mutable as usual huzzaed the pipe and tabor struck up the hobbyhorse pranced the beasts roared and even the repentant dragon began again to coil up his spires and prepare himself for fresh gambols but the abbot might still have overcome by his eloquence and his entreaties the malicious designs of the revellers had not dame magdalen graeme given loose to the indignation which she had long suppressed  scoffers she said and men of belialblasphemous heretics and truculent tyrants  your patience my sister i entreat and i command you said the abbot let me do my dutydisturb me not in mine office  but dame magdalen continued to thunder forth her threats in the name of popes and councils and in the name of every saint from st michael downward  my comrades said the abbot of unreason this good dame hath not spoken a single word of reason and therein may esteem herself free from the law but what she spoke was meant for reason and therefore unless she confesses and avouches all which she has said to be nonsense it shall pass for such so far as to incur our statutes wherefore holy dame pilgrim or abbess or whatever thou art be mute with thy mummery or beware the milldam we will have neither spiritual nor temporal scolds in our diocese of unreason  as he spoke thus he extended his hand towards the old woman while his followers shouted a dooma doom and prepared to second his purpose when lo it was suddenly frustrated roland graeme had witnessed with indignation the insults offered to his old spiritual preceptor but yet had wit enough to reflect he could render him no assistance but might well by ineffective interference make matters worse but when he saw his aged relative in danger of personal violence he gave way to the natural impetuosity of his temper and stepping forward struck his poniard into the body of the abbot of unreason whom the blow instantly prostrated on the pavement     chapter the fifteenth     as when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd   mad are their motions and their tongues are loud   and stones and brands in rattling furies fly   and all the rustic arms which fury can supply   then if some grave and pious man appear   they hush their noise and lend a listening ear                                   drydens virgil  a dreadful shout of vengeance was raised by the revellers whose sport was thus so fearfully interrupted but for an instant the want of weapons amongst the multitude as well as the inflamed features arid brandished poniard of roland graeme kept them at bay while the abbot horrorstruck at the violence implored with uplifted hands pardon for bloodshed committed within the sanctuary magdalen graeme alone expressed triumph in the blow her descendant had dealt to the scoffer mixed however with a wild and anxious expression of terror for her grandsons safety let him perish she said in his blasphemylet him die on the holy pavement which he has insulted  but the rage of the multitude the grief of the abbot the exultation of the enthusiastic magdalen were all mistimed and unnecessary howleglas mortally wounded as he was supposed to be sprung alertly up from the floor calling aloud a miracle a miracle my masters as brave a miracle as ever was wrought in the kirk of kennaquhair and i charge you my masters as your lawfully chosen abbot that you touch no one without my commandyou wolf and bear will guard this pragmatic youth but without hurting himand you reverend brother will with your comrades withdraw to your cells for our conference has ended like all conferences leaving each of his own mind as before and if we fight both you and your brethren and the kirk will have the worst ontwherefore pack up you pipes and begone  the hubbub was beginning again to awaken but still father ambrose hesitated as uncertain to what path his duty called him whether to face out the present storm or to reserve himself for a better moment his brother of unreason observed his difficulty and said in a tone more natural and less affected than that with which he had hitherto sustained his character we came hither my good sir more in mirth than in mischiefour bark is worse than our biteand especially we mean you no personal harmwherefore draw off while the play is good for it is ill whistling for a hawk when she is once on the soar and worse to snatch the quarry from the bandoglet these fellows once begin their brawl and it will be too much for madness itself let alone the abbot of unreason to bring them back to the lure  the brethren crowded around father ambrosius and joined in urging him to give place to the torrent the present revel was they said an ancient custom which his predecessors had permitted and old father nicholas himself had played the dragon in the days of the abbot ingelram  and we now reap the fruit of the seed which they have so unadvisedly sown said ambrosius they taught men to make a mock of what is holy what wonder that the descendants of scoffers become robbers and plunderers but be it as you list my brethrenmove towards the dortourand you dame i command you by the authority which i have over you and by your respect for that youths safety that you go with us without farther speechyet staywhat are your intentions towards that youth whom you detain prisonerwot ye he continued addressing howleglas in a stern tone of voice that he bears the livery of the house of avenel they who fear not the anger of heaven may at least dread the wrath of man  cumber not yourself concerning him answered howleglas we know right well who and what he is  let me pray said the abbot in a tone of entreaty that you do him no wrong for the rash deedwhich he attempted in his imprudent zeal  i say cumber not yourself about it father answered howleglas but move off with your train male and female or i will not undertake to save yonder shesaint from the duckingstooland as for bearing of malice my stomach has no room for it it is he added clapping his hand on his portly belly too well bumbasted out with straw and buckramgramercy to them boththey kept out that madcaps dagger as well as a milan corslet could have done  in fact the homedriven poniard of roland graeme had lighted upon the stuffing of the fictitious paunch which the abbot of unreason wore as a part of his characteristic dress and it was only the force of the blow which had prostrated that reverend person on the ground for a moment  satisfied in some degree by this mans assurances and compelledto give way to superior force the abbot ambrosius retired from the church at the head of the monks and left the court free for the revellers to work their will but wild and wilful as these rioters were they accompanied the retreat of the religionists with none of those shouts of contempt and derision with which they had at first hailed them the abbots discourse had affected some of them with remorse others with shame and all with a transient degree of respect they remained silent until the last monk had disappeared through the sidedoor which communicated with their dwellingplace and even then it cost some exhortations on the part of howleglas some caprioles of the hobbyhorse and some wallops of the dragon to rouse once more the rebuked spirit of revelry  and how now my masters said the abbot of unreason and wherefore look on me with such blank jackalent visages will you lose your old pastime for an old wifes tale of saints and purgatory why i thought you would have made all split long sincecome strike up tabor and harp strike up fiddle and rebeckdance and be merry today and let care come tomorrow bear and wolf look to your prisonerprance hobbyhiss dragon and halloo boyswe grow older every moment we stand idle and life is too short to be spent in playing mumchance  this pithy exhortation was attended with the effect desired they fumigated the church with burnt wool and feathers instead of incense put foul water into the holywater basins and celebrated a parody on the churchservice the mock abbot officiating at the altar they sung ludicrous and indecent parodies to the tunes of church hymns they violated whatever vestments or vessels belonging to the abbey they could lay their hands upon and playing every freak which the whim of the moment could suggest to their wild caprice at length they fell to more lasting deeds of demolition pulled down and destroyed some carved woodwork dashed out the painted windows which had escaped former violence and in their rigorous search after sculpture dedicated to idolatry began to destroy what ornaments yet remained entire upon the tombs and around the cornices of the pillars  the spirit of demolition like other tastes increases by indulgence from these lighter attempts at mischief the more tumultuous part of the meeting began to meditate destruction on a more extended scalelet us heave it down altogether the old crows nest became a general cry among them it has served the pope and his rooks too long and up they struck a ballad which was then popular among the lower classes footnote these rude rhymes are taken with some trifling alterations from a ballad called trimgotrix it occurs in a singular collection entitled a compendious book of godly and spiritual songs collected out of sundrie parts of the scripture with sundry of other ballatis changed out of prophane sanges for avoyding of sin and harlotrie with augmentation of sundrie gude and godly ballates edinburgh printed by andro hart this curious collection has been reprinted in mr john grahame dalyells scottish poems of the 16th century edin 1801 2 vols    the paip

poet the followers of the abbot of unreason were turning every moment more tumultuous and getting beyond the management even of that reverend prelate himself when a knight in full armour followed by two or three menatarms entered the church and in a stern voice commanded them to forbear their riotous mummery  his visor was up but if it had been lowered the cognizance of the hollybranch sufficiently distinguished sir halbert glendinning who on his homeward road was passing through the village of kennaquhair and moved perhaps by anxiety for his brothers safety had come directly to the church on hearing of the uproar  what is the meaning of this he said my masters are ye christian men and the kings subjects and yet waste and destroy church and chancel like so many heathens  all stood silent though doubtless there were several disappointed and surprised at receiving chiding instead of thanks from so zealous a protestant  the dragon indeed did at length take upon him to be spokesman and growled from the depth of his painted maw that they did but sweep popery out of the church with the besom of destruction  what my friends replied sir halbert glendinning think you this mumming and masking has not more of popery in it than have these stone walls take the leprosy out of your flesh before you speak of purifying stone wallsabate your insolent license which leads but to idle vanity and sinful excess and know that what you now practise is one of the profane and unseemly sports introduced by the priests of rome themselves to mislead and to brutify the souls which fell into their net  marry come upare you there with your bears muttered the dragon with a draconic sullenness which was in good keeping with his character we had as good have been romans still if we are to have no freedom in our pastimes  dost thou reply to me so said halbert glendinning or is there any pastime in grovelling on the ground there like a gigantic kailwormget out of thy painted case or by my knighthood i will treat you like the beast and reptile you have made yourself  beast and reptile retorted the offended dragon setting aside your knighthood i hold myself as well a born man as thyself  the knight made no answer in words but bestowed two such blows with the butt of his lance on the petulant dragon that had not the hoops which constituted the ribs of the machine been pretty strong they would hardly have saved those of the actor from being broken in all haste the masker crept out of his disguise unwilling to abide a third buffet from the lance of the enraged knight and when the exdragon stood on the floor of the church he presented to halbert glendinning the wellknown countenance of dan of the howlethirst an ancient comrade of his own ere fate had raised him so high above the rank to which he was born the clown looked sulkily upon the knight as if to upbraid him for his violence towards an old acquaintance and glendinnings own goodnature reproached him for the violence he had acted upon him  i did wrong to strike thee he said dan but in truth i knew thee notthou wert ever a mad fellowcome to avenel castle and we shall see how my hawks fly  and if we show him not falcons that will mount as merrily as rockets said the abbot of unreason i would your honour laid as hard on my bones as you did on his even now  how now sir knave said the knight and what has brought you hither  the abbot hastily ridding himself of the false nose which mystified his physiognomy and the supplementary belly which made up his disguise stood before his master in his real character of adam woodcock the falconer of avenel  how varlet said the knight hast thou dared to come here and disturb the very house my brother was dwelling in  and it was even for that reason craving your honours pardon that i came hitherfor i heard the country was to be up to choose an abbot of unreason and sure thought i i that can sing dance leap backwards over a broadsword and am as good a fool as ever sought promotion have all chance of carrying the office and if i gain my election i may stand his honours brother in some stead supposing things fall roughly out at the kirk of saint marys  thou art but a cogging knave said sir halbert and well i wot that love of ale and brandy besides the humour of riot and frolic would draw thee a mile when love of my house would not bring thee a yard but go tocarry thy roisterers elsewhereto the alehouse if they list and there are crowns to pay your chargesmake out the days madness without doing more mischief and be wise men tomorrowand hereafter learn to serve a good cause better than by acting like buffoons or ruffians  obedient to his masters mandate the falconer was collecting his discouraged followers and whispering into their earsaway awaytace is latin for a candlenever mind the good knights puritanismwe will play the frolic out over a stand of double ale in dame martin the brewsters barnyarddraw off harp and

would have made my fathers old fox footnote fox an oldfashioned broadsword was often so called fly about his ears  hush hush man replied adam woodcock not a word that way as you value the safety of your boneswhat man we must take a clink as it passes so it is not bestowed in downright illwill  but i will take no such thing said dan of the howlethirst suddenly resisting the efforts of woodcock who was dragging him out of the church when the quick military eye of sir halbert glendinning detecting roland graeme betwixt his two guards the knight exclaimed so ho falconerwoodcockknave hast thou brought my ladys page in mine own livery to assist at this hopeful revel of thine with your wolves and bears since you were at such mummings you might if you would have at least saved the credit of my household by dressing him up as a jackanapesbring him hither fellows  adam woodcock was too honest and downright to permit blame to light upon the youth when it was undeserved i swear he said by saint martin of bullions footnote the saint swithin or weeping saint of scotland if his festival fourth july prove wet forty days of rain are expected  and what hast thou to do with saint martin  nay little enough sir unless when he sends such rainy days that we cannot fly a hawkbut i say to your worshipful knighthood that as i am a true man  as you are a false varlet had been the better obtestation  nay if your knighthood allows me not to speak said adam i can hold my tonguebut the boy came not hither by my bidding for all that  but to gratify his own malapert pleasure i warrant me said sir halbert glendinningcome hither young springald and tell me whether you have your mistresss license to be so far absent from the castle or to dishonour my livery by mingling in such a maygame  sir halbert glendinning answered roland graeme with steadiness i have obtained the permission or rather the commands of your lady to dispose of my time hereafter according to my own pleasure i have been a most unwilling spectator of this maygame since it is your pleasure so to call it and i only wear your livery until i can obtain clothes which bear no such badge of servitude  how am i to understand this young man said sir halbert glendinning speak plainly for i am no reader of riddlesthat my lady favoured thee i know what hast thou done to disoblige her and occasion thy dismissal  nothing to speak of said adam woodcock answering for the boya foolish quarrel with me which was more foolishly told over again to my honoured lady cost the poor boy his place for my part i will say freely that i was wrong from beginning to end except about the washing of the eyass meat there i stand to it that i was right  with that the goodnatured falconer repeated to his master the whole history of the squabble which had brought roland graeme into disgrace with his mistress but in a manner so favourable for the page that sir halbert could not but suspect his generous motive  thou art a goodnatured fellow he said adam woodcock  as ever had falcon upon fist said adam and for that matter so is master roland but being half a gentleman by his office his blood is soon up and so is mine  well said sir halbert be it as it will my lady has acted hastily for this was no great matter of offence to discard the lad whom she had trained up for years but he i doubt not made it worse by his pratingit jumps well with a purpose however which i had in my mind draw off these people woodcockand you roland graeme attend me  the page followed him in silence into the abbots house where stepping into the first apartment which he found open he commanded one of his attendants to let his brother master edward glendinning know that he desired to speak with him the menatarms went gladly off to join their comrade adam woodcock and the jolly crew whom he had assembled at dame martins the hostlers wife and the page and knight were left alone in the apartment sir halbert glendinning paced the floor for a moment in silence and then thus addressed his attendant  thou mayest have remarked stripling that i have but seldom distinguished thee by much noticei see thy colour rises but do not speak till thou nearest me out i say i have never much distinguished thee not because i did not see that in thee which i might well have praised but because i saw something blameable which such praises might have made worse thy mistress dealing according to her pleasure in her own household as no one had better reason or title had picked thee from the rest and treated thee more like a relation than a domestic and if thou didst show some vanity and petulance under such distinction it were injustice not to say that thou hast profited both in thy exercises and in thy breeding and hast shown many sparkles of a gentle and manly spirit moreover it were ungenerous having bred thee up freakish and fiery to dismiss thee to want or wandering for showing that very peevishness and impatience of discipline which arose from thy too delicate nurture therefore and for the credit of my own household i am determined to retain thee in my train until i can honourably dispose of thee elsewhere with a fair prospect of thy going through the world with credit to the house that brought thee up  if there was something in sir halbert glendinnings speech which flattered rolands pride there was also much that according to his mode of thinking was an alloy to the compliment and yet his conscience instantly told him that he ought to accept with grateful deference the offer which was made him by the husband of his kind protectress and his prudence however slender could not but admit he should enter the world under very different auspices as a retainer of sir halbert glendinning so famed for wisdom courage and influence from those under which he might partake the wanderings and become an agent in the visionary schemes for such they appeared to him of magdalen his relative still a strong reluctance to reenter a service from which he had been dismissed with contempt almost counterbalanced these considerations  sir halbert looked on the youth with surprise and resumedyou seem to hesitate young man are your own prospects so inviting that you should pause ere you accept those which i should offer to you or must i remind you that although you have offended your benefactress even to the point of her dismissing you yet i am convinced the knowledge that you have gone unguided on your own wild way into a world so disturbed as ours of scotland cannot in the upshot but give her sorrow and pain from which it is in gratitude your duty to preserve her no less than it is in common wisdom your duty to accept my offered protection for your own sake where body and soul are alike endangered should you refuse it  roland graeme replied in a respectful tone but at the same time with some spirit i am not ungrateful for such countenance as has been afforded me by the lord of avenel and i am glad to learn for the first time that i have not had the misfortune to be utterly beneath his observation as i had thoughtand it is only needful to show me how i can testify my duty and my gratitude towards my early and constant benefactress with my lifes hazard and i will gladly peril it he stopped  these are but words young man answered glendinning large protestations are often used to supply the place of effectual service i know nothing in which the peril of your life can serve the lady of avenel i can only say she will be pleased to learn you have adopted some course which may ensure the safety of your person and the weal of your soulwhat ails you that you accept not that safety when it is offered you  my only relative who is alive answered roland at least the only relative whom i have ever seen has rejoined me since i was dismissed from the castle of avenel and i must consult with her whether i can adopt the line to which you now call me or whether her increasing infirmities or the authority which she is entitled to exercise over me may not require me to abide with her  where is this relation said sir halbert glendinning  in this house answered the page  go then and seek her out said the knight of avenel more than meet it is that thou shouldst have her approbation yet worse than foolish would she show herself in denying it  roland left the apartment to seek for his grandmother and as he retreated the abbot entered  the two brothers met as brothers who loved each other fondly yet meet rarely together such indeed was the case their mutual affection attached them to each other but in every pursuit habit or sentiment connected with the discords of the times the friend and counsellor of murray stood opposed to the roman catholic priest nor indeed could they have held very much society together without giving cause of offence and suspicion to their confederates on each side after a close embrace on the part of both and a welcome on that of the abbot sir halbert glendinning expressed his satisfaction that he had come in time to appease the riot raised by howleglas and his tumultuous followers  and yet he said when i look on your garments brother edward i cannot help thinking there still remains an abbot of unreason within the bounds of the monastery  and wherefore carp at my garments brother halbert said the abbot it is the spiritual armour of my calling and as such beseems me as well as breastplate and baldric becomes your own bosom  ay but there were small wisdom methinks in putting on armour where we have no power to fight it is but a dangerous temerity to defy the foe whom we cannot resist  for that my brother no one can answer said the abbot until the battle be fought and were it even as you say methinks a brave man though desperate of victory would rather desire to fight and fall than to resign sword and shield on some mean and dishonourable composition with his insulting antagonist but let not you and i make discord of a theme on which we cannot agree but rather stay and partake though a heretic of my admission feast you need not fear my brother that your zeal for restoring the primitive discipline of the church will on this occasion be offended with the rich profusion of a conventual banquet the days of our old friend abbot boniface are over and the superior of saint marys has neither forests nor fishings woods nor pastures nor cornfieldsneither flocks nor herds bucks nor wildfowlgranaries of wheat nor storehouses of oil and wine of ale and of mead the refectioners office is ended and such a meal as a hermit in romance can offer to a wandering knight is all we have to set before you but if you will share it with us we shall eat it with a cheerful heart and thank you my brother for your timely protection against these rude scoffers  my dearest brother said the knight it grieves me deeply i cannot abide with you but it would sound ill for us both were one of the reformed congregation to sit down at your admission feast and if i can ever have the satisfaction of affording you effectual protection it will be much owing to my remaining unsuspected of countenancing or approving your religious rites and ceremonies it will demand whatever consideration i can acquire among my own friends to shelter the bold man who contrary to law and the edicts of parliament has dared to take up the office of abbot of saint marys  trouble not yourself with the task my brother replied father ambrosius i would lay down my dearest blood to know that you defended the church for the churchs sake but while you remain unhappily her enemy i would not that you endangered your own safety or diminished your own comforts for the sake of my individual protectionbut who comes hither to disturb the few minutes of fraternal communication which our evil fate allows us  the door of the apartment opened as the abbot spoke and dame magdalen entered  who is this woman said sir halbert glendinning somewhat sternly and what does she want  that you know me not said the matron signifies little i come by your own order to give my free consent that the stripling roland graeme return to your service and having said so i cumber you no longer with my presence peace be with you she turned to go away but was stopped by inquiries of sir halbert glendinning  who are youwhat are youand why do you not await to make me answer  i was she replied while yet i belonged to the world a matron of no vulgar name now i am magdalen a poor pilgrimer for the sake of holy kirk  yea said sir halbert art thou a catholic i thought my dame said that roland graeme came of reformed kin  his father said the matron was a heretic or rather one who regarded neither orthodoxy or heresyneither the temple of the church or of antichrist i too for the sins of the times make sinners have seemed to conform to your unhallowed ritesbut i had my dispensation and my absolution  you see brother said sir halbert with a smile of meaning towards his brother that we accuse you not altogether without grounds of mental equivocation  my brother you do us injustice replied the abbot this woman as her bearing may of itself warrant you is not in her perfect mind thanks i must needs say to the persecution of your marauding barons and of your latitudinarian clergy  i will not dispute the point said sir halbert the evils of the time are unhappily so numerous that both churches may divide them and have enow to spare so saying he leaned from the window of the apartment and winded his bugle  why do you sound your horn my brother said the abbot we have spent but few minutes together  alas said the elder brother and even these few have been sullied by disagreement i sound to horse my brotherthe rather that to avert the consequences of this days rashness on your part requires hasty efforts on minedame you will oblige me by letting your young relative know that we mount instantly i intend not that he shall return to avenel with meit would lead to new quarrels betwixt him and my household at least to taunts which his proud heart could ill brook and my wish is to do him kindness he shall therefore go forward to edinburgh with one of my retinue whom i shall send back to say what has chanced hereyou seem rejoiced at this he added fixing his eyes keenly on magdalen graeme who returned his gaze with calm indifference  i would rather she said that roland a poor and friendless orphan were the jest of the world at large than of the menials at avenel  fear not damehe shall be scorned by neither answered the knight  it may be she repliedit may well bebut i will trust more to his own bearing than to your countenance she left the room as she spoke  the knight looked after her as she departed but turned instantly to his brother and expressing in the most affectionate terms his wishes for his welfare and happiness craved his leave to depart my knaves he said are too busy at the alestand to leave their revelry for the empty breath of a buglehorn  you have freed them from higher restraint halbert answered the abbot and therein taught them to rebel against your own  fear not that edward exclaimed halbert who never gave his brother his monastic name of ambrosius none obey the command of real duty so well as those who are free from the observance of slavish bondage  he was turning to depart when the abbot saidlet us not yet part my brotherhere comes some light refreshment leave not the house which i must now call mine till force expel me from it until you have at least broken bread with me  the poor lay brother the same who acted as porter now entered the apartment bearing some simple refreshment and a flask of wine he had found it he said with officious humility by rummaging through every nook of the cellar  the knight filled a small silver cup and quaffing it off asked his brother to pledge him observing the wine was bacharac of the first vintage and great age  ay said the poor lay brother it came out of the nook which old brother nicholas may his soul be happy was wont to call abbot ingelrams corner and abbot ingelram was bred at the convent of wurtzburg which i understand to be near where that choice wine grows  true my reverend sir said sir halbert and therefore i entreat my brother and you to pledge me in a cup of this orthodox vintage  the thin old porter looked with a wishful glance towards the abbot do veniam said his superior and the old man seized with a trembling hand a beverage to which he had been long unaccustomed drained the cup with protracted delight as if dwelling on the flavour and perfume and set it down with a melancholy smile and shake of the head as if bidding adieu in future to such delicious potations the brothers smiled but when sir halbert motioned to the abbot to take up his cup and do him reason the abbot in turn shook his head and repliedthis is no day for the abbot of saint marys to eat the fat and drink the sweat in water from our ladys well he added filling a cup with the limpid element i wish you brother all happiness and above all a true sight of your spiritual errors  and to you my beloved edward replied glendinning i wish the free exercise of your own free reason and the discharge of more important duties than are connected with the idle name which you have so rashly assumed  the brothers parted with deep regret and yet each confident in his opinion felt somewhat relieved by the absence of one whom he respected so much and with whom he could agree so little  soon afterwards the sound of the knight of avenels trumpets was heard and the abbot went to the top of the tower from whose dismantled battlements he could soon see the horsemen ascending the rising ground in the direction of the drawbridge as he gazed magdalen graeme came to his side  thou art come he said to catch the last glimpse of thy grandson my sister yonder he wends under the charge of the best knight in scotland his faith ever excepted  thou canst bear witness my father that it was no wish either of mine or of rolands replied the matron which induced the knight of avenel as he is called again to entertain my grandson in his householdheaven which confounds the wise with their own wisdom and the wicked with their own policy hath placed him where for the services of the church i would most wish him to be  i know not what you mean my sister said the abbot  reverend father replied magdalen hast thou never heard that there are spirits powerful to rend the walls of a castle asunder when once admitted which yet cannot enter the house unless they are invited nay dragged over the threshold  footnote there is a popular belief respecting evil spirits that they cannot enter an inhabited house unless invited nay dragged over the threshold there is an instance of the same superstition in the tales of the genii where an enchanter is supposed to have intruded himself into the divan of the sultan  thus said the illustrious misnar let the enemies of mahomet be dismayed but inform me o ye sages under the semblance of which of your brethren did that foul enchanter gain admittance heremay the lord of my heart answered balihu the hermit of the faithful from queda triumph over all his foes as i travelled on the mountains from queda and saw neither the footsteps of beasts nor the flight of birds behold i chanced to pass through a cavern in whose hollow sides i found this accursed sage to whom i unfolded the invitation of the sultan of india and we joining journeyed towards the divan but ere we entered he said unto me put thy hand forth and pull me towards thee into the divan calling on the name of mahomet for the evil spirits are on me and vex me  i have understood that many parts of these fine tales and in particular that of the sultan misnar were taken from genuine oriental sources by the editor mr james ridley  but the most picturesque use of this popular belief occurs in coleridges beautiful and tantalizing fragment of christabel has not our own imaginative poet cause to fear that future ages will desire to summon him from his place of rest as milton longed    to call him up who left half told    the story of cambuscan bold  the verses i refer to are when christabel conducts into her fathers castle a mysterious and malevolent being under the guise of a distressed female stranger     they crossd the moat and christabel   took the key that fitted well   a little door she opend straight   all in the middle of the gate   the gate that was irond within and without   where an army in battle array had marchd out    the lady sank belike through pain   and christabel with might and main   lifted her up a weary weight   over the threshold of the gate   then the lady rose again   and moved as she were not in pain    so free from danger free from fear   they crossd the courtright glad they were   and christabel devoutly cried   to the lady by her side   praise we the virgin all divine     who hath rescued thee from this distress   alas alas said geraldine   i cannot speak from weariness   so free from danger free from fear   they crossd the court right glad they were   twice hath roland graeme been thus drawn into the household of avenel by those who now hold the title let them look to the issue  so saying she left the turret and the abbot after pausing a moment on her words which he imputed to the unsettled state of her mind followed down the winding stair to celebrate his admission to his high office by fast and prayer instead of revelling and thanksgiving     chapter the sixteenth     youth thou wearst to manhood now   darker lip and darker brow   statelier step more pensive mien   in thy face and gate are seen   thou must now brook midnight watches   take thy food and sport by snatches   for the gambol and the jest   thou wert wont to love the best   graver follies must thou follow   but as senseless false and hollow                         life a poem  young roland graeme now trotted gaily forward in the train of sir halbert glendinning he was relieved from his most galling apprehensionthe encounter of the scorn and taunt which might possibly hail his immediate return to the castle of avenel there will be a change ere they see me again he thought to himself i shall wear the coat of plate instead of the green jerkin and the steel morion for the bonnet and feather they will be bold that may venture to break a gibe on the manatarms for the follies of the page and i trust that ere we return i shall have done something more worthy of note than hallooing a hound after a deer or scrambling a crag for a kites nest he could not indeed help marvelling that his grandmother with all her religious prejudices leaning it would seem to the other side had consented so readily to his reentering the service of the house of avenel and yet more at the mysterious joy with which she took leave of him at the abbey  heaven said the dame as she kissed her young relation and bade him farewell works its own work even by the hands of those of our enemies who think themselves the strongest and the wisest thou my child be ready to act upon the call of thy religion and country and remember each earthly bond which thou canst form is compared to the ties which bind thee to them like the loose flax to the twisted cable thou hast not forgot the face or form of the damsel catherine seyton  roland would have replied in the negative but the word seemed to stick in his throat and magdalen continued her exhortations  thou must not forget her my son and here i intrust thee with a token which i trust thou wilt speedily find an opportunity of delivering with care and secrecy into her own hand  she put here into rolands hand a very small packet of which she again enjoined him to take the strictest care and to suffer it to be seen by no one save catherine seyton who she again very unnecessarily reminded him was the young lady he had met on the preceding day she then bestowed on him her solemn benediction and bade god speed him  there was something in her manner and her conduct which implied mystery but roland graeme was not of an age or temper to waste much time in endeavoring to decipher her meaning all that was obvious to his perception in the present journey promised pleasure and novelty he rejoiced that he was travelling towards edinburgh in order to assume the character of a man and lay aside that of a boy he was delighted to think that he would have an opportunity of rejoining catherine seyton whose bright eyes and lively manners had made so favourable an impression on his imagination and as an experienced yet highspirited youth entering for the first time upon active life his heart bounded at the thought that he was about to see all those scenes of courtly splendour and warlike adventures of which the followers of sir halbert used to boast on their occasional visits to avenel to the wonderment and envy of those who like roland knew courts and camps only by hearsay and were condemned to the solitary sports and almost monastic seclusion of avenel surrounded by its lonely lake and embossed among its pathless mountains they shall mention my name he said to himself if the risk of my life can purchase me opportunities of distinction and catherine seytons saucy eye shall rest with more respect on the distinguished soldier than that with which she laughed to scorn the raw and inexperienced pagethere was wanting but one accessary to complete the sense of rapturous excitation and he possessed it by being once more mounted on the back of a fiery and active horse instead of plodding along on foot as had been the case during the preceding days  impelled by the liveliness of his own spirits which so many circumstances tended naturally to exalt roland graemes voice and his laughter were soon distinguished amid the trampling of the horses of the retinue and more than once attracted the attention of the leader who remarked with satisfaction that the youth replied with goodhumoured raillery to such of the train as jested with him on his dismissal and return to the service of the house of avenel  i thought the hollybranch in your bonnet had been blighted master roland said one of the menatarms  only pinched with half an hours frost you see it flourishes as green as ever  it is too grave a plant to flourish on so hot a soil as that headpiece of thine master roland graeme retorted the other who was an old equerry of sir halbert glendinning  if it will not flourish alone said roland i will mix it with the laurel and the myrtleand i will carry them so near the sky that it shall make amends for their stinted growth  thus speaking he dashed his spurs into his horses sides and checking him at the same time compelled him to execute a lofty caracole sir halbert glendinning looked at the demeanour of his new attendant with that sort of melancholy pleasure with which those who have long followed the pursuits of life and are sensible of their vanity regard the gay young and buoyant spirits to whom existence as yet is only hope and promise  in the meanwhile adam woodcock the falconer stripped of his masquing habit and attired according to his rank and calling in a green jerkin with a hawkingbag on the one side and a short hanger on the other a glove on his left hand which reached half way up his arm and a bonnet and feather upon his head came after the party as fast as his active little gallowaynag could trot and immediately entered into parley with roland graeme  so my youngster you are once more under shadow of the hollybranch  and in case to repay you my good friend answered roland your ten groats of silver  which but an hour since said the falconer you had nearly paid me with ten inches of steel on my faith it is written in the book of our destiny that i must brook your dagger after all  nay speak not of that my good friend said the youth i would rather have broached my own bosom than yours but who could have known you in the mumming dress you wore  yes the falconer resumedfor both as a poet and actor he had his own professional share of selfconceiti think i was as good a howleglas as ever played part at a shrovetide revelry and not a much worse abbot of unreason i defy the old enemy to unmask me when i choose to keep my vizard on what the devil brought the knight on us before we had the game out you would have heard me hollo my own new ballad with a voice should have reached to berwick but i pray you master roland be less free of cold steel on slight occasions since but for the stuffing of my reverend doublet i had only left the kirk to take my place in the kirkyard  nay spare me that feud said roland graeme we shall have no time to fight it out for by our lords command i am bound for edinburgh  i know it said adam woodcock and even therefore we shall have time to solder up this rent by the way for sir halbert has appointed me your companion and guide  ay and with what purpose said the page  that said the falconer is a question i cannot answer but i know that be the food of the eyases washed or unwashed and indeed whatever becomes of perch and mew i am to go with you to edinburgh and see you safely delivered to the regent at holyrood  how to the regent said roland in surprise  ay by my faith to the regent replied woodcock i promise you that if you are not to enter his service at least you are to wait upon him in the character of a retainer of our knight of avenel  i know no right said the youth which the knight of avenel hath to transfer my service supposing that i owe it to himself  hush hush said the falconer that is a question i advise no one to stir in until he has the mountain or the lake or the march of another kingdom which is better than either betwixt him and his feudal superior  but sir halbert glendinning said the youth is not my feudal superior nor has he aught of authority  i pray you my son to rein your tongue answered adam woodcock my lords displeasure if you provoke it will be worse to appease than my ladys the touch of his least finger were heavier than her hardest blow and by my faith he is a man of steel as true and as pure but as hard and as pitiless you remember the cock of capperlaw whom he hanged over his gate for a mere mistakea poor yoke of oxen taken in scotland when he thought he was taking them in english land i loved the cock of capperlaw the kerrs had not an honester man in their clan and they have had men that might have been a pattern to the bordermen that would not have lifted under twenty cows at once and would have held themselves dishonoured if they had taken a drift of sheep or the like but always managed their raids in full credit and honourbut see his worship halts and we are close by the bridge ride upride upwe must have his last instructions  it was as adam woodcock said in the hollow way descending towards the bridge which was still in the guardianship of peter bridgeward as he was called though he was now very old sir halbert glendinning halted his retinue and beckoned to woodcock and graeme to advance to the head of the train  woodcock said he thou knowest to whom thou art to conduct this youth and thou young man obey discreetly and with diligence the orders that shall be given thee curb thy vain and peevish temper be just true and faithful and there is in thee that which may raise thee many a degree above thy present station neither shalt thoualways supposing thine efforts to be fair and honestwant the protection and countenance of avenel  leaving them in front of the bridge the centre tower of which now began to cast a prolonged shade upon the river the knight of avenel turned to the left without crossing the river and pursued his way towards the chain of hills within whose recesses are situated the lake and castle of avenel there remained behind the falconer roland graeme and a domestic of the knight of inferior rank who was left with them to look after their horses while on the road to carry their baggage and to attend to their convenience  so soon as the more numerous body of riders had turned off to pursue their journey westward those whose route lay across the river and was directed towards the north summoned the bridgeward and demanded a free passage  i will not lower the bridge answered peter in a voice querulous with age and illhumourcome papist come protestant ye are all the same the papist threatened us with purgatory and fleeched us with pardonsthe protestant mints at us with his sword and cuttles us with the liberty of conscience but never a one of either says peter there is your penny i am well tired of all this and for no man shall the bridge fall that pays me not ready money and i would have you know i care as little for geneva as for romeas little for homilies as for pardons and the silver pennies are the only passports i will hear of  here is a proper old chuff said woodcock to his companion then raising his voice he exclaimed hark thee dogbridgeward villain dost thou think we have refused thy namesake peters pence to rome to pay thine at the bridge of kennaquhair let thy bridge down instantly to the followers of the house of avenel or by the hand of my father and that handled many a bridle rein for he was a bluff yorkshiremani say by my fathers hand our knight will blow thee out of thy solangooses nest there in the middle of the water with the light falconet which we are bringing southward from edinburgh tomorrow  the bridgeward heard and muttered a plague on falcon and falconet on cannon and demicannon and all the barking bulldogs whom they halloo against stone and lime in these our days it was a merry time when there was little besides handy blows and it may be a flight of arrows that harmed an ashler wall as little as so many hailstones but we must jouk and let the jaw gang by comforting himself in his state of diminished consequence with this pithy old proverb peter bridgeward lowered the drawbridge and permitted them to pass over at the sight of his white hair albeit it discovered a visage equally peevish through age and misfortune roland was inclined to give him an alms but adam woodcock prevented him een let him pay the penalty of his former churlishness and greed he said the wolf when he has lost his teeth should be treated no better than a cur  leaving the bridgeward to lament the alteration of times which sent domineering soldiers and feudal retainers to his place of passage instead of peaceful pilgrims and reduced him to become the oppressed instead of playing the extortioner the travellers turned them northward and adam woodcock well acquainted with that part of the country proposed to cut short a considerable portion of the road by traversing the little vale of glendearg so famous for the adventures which befell therein during the earlier part of the benedictines manuscript with these and with the thousand commentaries representations and misrepresentations to which they had given rise roland graeme was of course well acquainted for in the castle of avenel as well as in other great establishments the inmates talked of nothing so often or with such pleasure as of the private affairs of their lord and lady but while roland was viewing with interest these haunted scenes in which things were said to have passed beyond the ordinary laws of nature adam woodcock was still regretting in his secret soul the unfinished revel and the unsung ballad and kept every now and then breaking out with some such verses as these      the friars of fail drank berrybrown ale        the best that eer was tasted      the monks of melrose made gude kale        on fridays when they fasted           saint monance sister           the gray priest kist her            fiend save the company           sing hay trix trimgotrix             under the greenwood tree  by my hand friend woodcock said the page though i know you for a hardy gospeller that fear neither saint nor devil yet if i were you i would not sing your profane songs in this valley of glendearg considering what has happened here before our time  a straw for your wandering spirits said adam woodcock i mind them no more than an earn cares for a string of wildgeesethey have all fled since the pulpits were filled with honest men and the peoples ears with sound doctrine nay i have a touch at them in my ballad an i had but had the good luck to have it sung to end and again he set off in the same key    from haunted spring and grassy ring     troop goblin elf and fairy   and the kelpie must flit from the black bogpit     and the brownie must not tarry        to limbolake        their way they take          with scarce the pith to flee        sing hay trix trimgotrix          under the greenwood tree  i think he added that could sir halberts patience have stretched till we came that length he would have had a hearty laugh and that is what he seldom enjoys  if it be all true that men tell of his early life said roland he has less right to laugh at goblins than most men  ay if it be all true answered adam woodcock but who can ensure us of that moreover these were but tales the monks used to gull us simple laymen withal they knew that fairies and hobgoblins brought aves and paternosters into repute but now we have given up worship of images in wood and stone methinks it were no time to be afraid of bubbles in the water or shadows in the air  however said roland graeme as the catholics say they do not worship wood or stone but only as emblems of the holy saints and not as things holy in themselves  pshaw pshaw answered the falconer a rush for their prating they told us another story when these baptized idols of theirs brought pikestaves and sandalled shoon from all the four winds and whillied the old women out of their corn and their candle ends and their butter bacon wool and cheese and when not so much as a gray groat escaped tithing  roland graeme had been long taught by necessity to consider his form of religion as a profound secret and to say nothing whatever in its defence when assailed lest he should draw on himself the suspicion of belonging to the unpopular and exploded church he therefore suffered adam woodcock to triumph without farther opposition marvelling in his own mind whether any of the goblins formerly such active agents would avenge his rude raillery before they left the valley of glendearg but no such consequences followed they passed the night quietly in a cottage in the glen and the next day resumed their route to edinburgh     chapter the seventeenth   edina scotias darling seat   all hail thy palaces and towers where once beneath a monarchs feet   sate legislations sovereign powers                           burns  this then is edinburgh said the youth as the fellowtravellers arrived at one of the heights to the southward which commanded a view of the great northern capitalthis is that edinburgh of which we have heard so much  even so said the falconer yonder stands auld reekieyou may see the smoke hover over her at twenty miles distance as the gosshawk hangs over a plump of young wildducksay yonder is the heart of scotland and each throb that she gives is felt from the edge of solway to duncansbayhead see yonder is the old castle and see to the right on yon rising ground that is the castle of craigmillar which i have known a merry place in my time  was it not there said the page in a low voice that the queen held her court  ay ay replied the falconer queen she was then though you must not call her so now well they may say what they willmany a true heart will be sad for mary stewart een if all be true men say of her for look you master rolandshe was the loveliest creature to look upon that i ever saw with eye and no lady in the land liked better the fair flight of a falcon i was at the great match on roslin moor betwixt bothwellhe was a black sight to her that bothwelland the baron of roslin who could judge a hawks flight as well as any man in scotlanda butt of rhenish and a ring of gold was the wager and it was flown as fairly for as ever was red gold and bright wine and to see her there on her white palfrey that flew as if it scorned to touch more than the heather blossom and to hear her voice as clear and sweet as the maviss whistle mix among our jolly whooping and whistling and to mark all the nobles dashing round her happiest he who got a word or a looktearing through moss and hagg and venturing neck and limb to gain the praise of a bold rider and the blink of a bonny queens bright eyeshe will see little hawking where she lies noway ay pomp and pleasure pass away as speedily as the wap of a falcons wing  and where is this poor queen now confined said roland graeme interested in the fate of a woman whose beauty and grace had made so strong an impression even on the blunt and careless character of adam woodcock  where is she now imprisoned said honest adam why in some castle in the north they sayi know not where for my part nor is it worth while to vex ones sell anent what cannot be mendedan she had guided her power well whilst she had it she had not come to so evil a pass men say she must resign her crown to this little baby of a prince for that they will trust her with it no longer our master has been as busy as his neighbours in all this work if the queen should come to her own again avenel castle is like to smoke for it unless he makes his bargain all the better in a castle in the north queen mary is confined said the page why aythey say so at leastin a castle beyond that great river which comes down yonder and looks like a river but it is a branch of the sea and as bitter as brine  and amongst all her subjects said the page with some emotion is there none that will adventure anything for her relief  that is a kittle question said the falconer and if you ask it often master roland i am fain to tell you that you will be mewed up yourself in some of those castles if they do not prefer twisting your head off to save farther trouble with youadventure any thing lord why murray has the wind in his poop now man and flies so high and strong that the devil a wing of them can match himno no there she is and there she must lie till heaven send her deliverance or till her son has the management of allbut murray will never let her loose again he knows her too welland hark thee we are now bound for holyrood where thou wilt find plenty of news and of courtiers to tell itbut take my counsel and keep a calm sough as the scots sayhear every mans counsel and keep your own and if you hap to learn any news you like leap not up as if you were to put on armour direct in the causeour old mr wingate saysand he knows courtcattle wellthat if you are told old king coul is come alive again you should turn it off with and is he in truthi heard not of it and should seem no more moved than if one told you by way of novelty that old king coul was dead and buried wherefore look well to your bearing master roland for i promise you you come among a generation that are keen as a hungry hawkand never be dagger out of sheath at every wry word you hear spoken for you will find as hot blades as yourself and then will be letting of blood without advice either of leech or almanack  you shall see how staid i will be and how cautious my good friend said graeme but blessed lady what goodly house is that which is lying all in ruins so close to the city have they been playing at the abbot of unreason here and ended the gambol by burning the church  there again now replied his companion you go down the wind like a wild haggard that minds neither lure nor beckthat is a question you should have asked in as low a tone as i shall answer it  if i stay here long said roland graeme it is like i shall lose the natural use of my voicebut what are the ruins then  the kirk of field said the falconer in a low and impressive whisper laying at the same time his finger on his lip ask no more about itsomebody got foul play and somebody got the blame of it and the game began there which perhaps may not be played out in our timepoor henry darnley to be an ass he understood somewhat of a hawk but they sent him on the wing through the air himself one bright moonlight night  the memory of this catastrophe was so recent that the page averted his eyes with horror from the scathed ruins in which it had taken place and the accusations against the queen to which it had given rise came over his mind with such strength as to balance the compassion he had begun to entertain for her present forlorn situation  it was indeed with that agitating state of mind which arises partly from horror but more from anxious interest and curiosity that young graeme found himself actually traversing the scene of those tremendous events the report of which had disturbed the most distant solitudes in scotland like the echoes of distant thunder rolling among the mountains  now he thought now or never shall i become a man and bear my part in those deeds which the simple inhabitants of our hamlets repeat to each other as if they were wrought by beings of a superior order to their own i will know now wherefore the knight of avenel carries his crest so much above those of the neighbouring baronage and how it is that men by valour and wisdom work their way from the hoddingray coat to the cloak of scarlet and gold men say i have not much wisdom to recommend me and if that be true courage must do it for i will be a man amongst living men or a dead corpse amongst the dead  from these dreams of ambition he turned his thoughts to those of pleasure and began to form many conjectures when and where he should see catherine seyton and in what manner their acquaintance was to be renewed with such conjectures he was amusing himself when he found that they had entered the city and all other feelings were suspended in the sensation of giddy astonishment with which an inhabitant of the country is affected when for the first time he finds himself in the streets of a large and populous city a unit in the midst of thousands  the principal street of edinburgh was then as now one of the most spacious in europe the extreme height of the houses and the variety of gothic gables and battlements and balconies by which the skyline on each side was crowned and terminated together with the width of the street itself might have struck with surprise a more practised eye than that of young graeme the population close packed within the walls of the city and at this time increased by the number of the lords of the kings party who had thronged to edinburgh to wait upon the regent murray absolutely swarmed like bees on the wide and stately street instead of the shopwindows which are now calculated for the display of goods the traders had their open booths projecting on the street in which as in the fashion of the modern bazaars all was exposed which they had upon sale and though the commodities were not of the richest kinds yet graeme thought he beheld the wealth of the whole world in the various bales of flanders cloths and the specimens of tapestry and at other places the display of domestic utensils and pieces of plate struck him with wonder the sight of cutlers booths furnished with swords and poniards which were manufactured in scotland and with pieces of defensive armour imported from flanders added to his surprise and at every step he found so much to admire and gaze upon that adam woodcock had no little difficulty in prevailing on him to advance through such a scene of enchantment  the sight of the crowds which filled the streets was equally a subject of wonder here a gay lady in her muffler or silken veil traced her way delicately a gentlemanusher making way for her a page bearing up her train and a waiting gentlewoman carrying her bible thus intimating that her purpose was towards the churchthere he might see a group of citizens bending the same way with their short flemish cloaks wide trowsers and highcaped doublets a fashion to which as well as to their bonnet and feather the scots were long faithful then again came the clergyman himself in his black geneva cloak and band lending a grave and attentive ear to the discourse of several persons who accompanied him and who were doubtless holding serious converse on the religious subject he was about to treat of nor did there lack passengers of a different class and appearance  at every turn roland graeme might see a gallant ruffle along in the newer or french mode his doublet slashed and his points of the same colours with the lining his long sword on one side and his poniard on the other behind him a body of stout serving men proportioned to his estate and quality all of whom walked with the air of military retainers and were armed with sword and buckler the latter being a small round shield not unlike the highland target having a steel spike in the centre two of these parties each headed by a person of importance chanced to meet in the very centre of the street or as it was called the crown of the causeway a post of honour as tenaciously asserted in scotland as that of giving or taking the wall used to be in the more southern part of the island the two leaders being of equal rank and most probably either animated by political dislike or by recollection of some feudal enmity marched close up to each other without yielding an inch to the right or the left and neither showing the least purpose of giving way they stopped for an instant and then drew their swords their followers imitated their example about a score of weapons at once flashed in the sun and there was an immediate clatter of swords and bucklers while the followers on either side cried their masters name the one shouting help a leslie a leslie while the others answered with shouts of seyton  seyton with the additional punning slogan set on set onbear the knaves to the ground  if the falconer found difficulty in getting the page to go forward before it was now perfectly impossible he reined up his horse clapped his hands and delighted with the fray cried and shouted as fast as any of those who were actually engaged in it  the noise and cries thus arising on the highgate as it was called drew into the quarrel two or three other parties of gentlemen and their servants besides some single passengers who hearing a fray betwixt these two distinguished names took part in it either for love or hatred  the combat became now very sharp and although the swordandbuckler men made more clatter and noise than they did real damage yet several good cuts were dealt among them and those who wore rapiers a more formidable weapon than the ordinary scottish swords gave and received dangerous wounds two men were already stretched on the causeway and the party of seyton began to give ground being much inferior in number to the other with which several of the citizens had united themselves when young roland graeme beholding their leader a noble gentleman fighting bravely and hard pressed with numbers could withhold no longer adam woodcock he said an you be a man draw and let us take part with the seyton and without waiting a reply or listening to the falconers earnest entreaty that he would leave alone a strife in which he had no concern the fiery youth sprung from his horse drew his short sword and shouting like the rest a seyton a seyton set on set on thrust forward into the throng and struck down one of those who was pressing hardest upon the gentleman whose cause he espoused this sudden reinforcement gave spirit to the weaker party who began to renew the combat with much alacrity when four of the magistrates of the city distinguished by their velvet cloaks and gold chains came up with a guard of halberdiers and citizens armed with long weapons and well accustomed to such service thrust boldly forward and compelled the swordsmen to separate who immediately retreated in different directions leaving such of the wounded on both sides as had been disabled in the fray lying on the street  the falconer who had been tearing his beard for anger at his comrades rashness now rode up to him with the horse which he had caught by the bridle and accosted him with master rolandmaster goosemaster madcapwill it please you to get on horse and budge or will you remain here to be carried to prison and made to answer for this pretty days work  the page who had begun his retreat along with the seytons just as if he had been one of their natural allies was by this unceremonious application made sensible that he was acting a foolish part and obeying adam woodcock with some sense of shame he sprung actively on horseback and upsetting with the shoulder of the animal a cityofficer who was making towards him he began to ride smartly down the street along with his companion and was quickly out of the reach of the hue and cry in fact rencounters of the kind were so common in edinburgh at that period that the disturbance seldom excited much attention after the affray was over unless some person of consequence chanced to have fallen an incident which imposed on his friends the duty of avenging his death on the first convenient opportunity so feeble indeed was the arm of the police that it was not unusual for such skirmishes to last for hours where the parties were numerous and well matched but at this time the regent a man of great strength of character aware of the mischief which usually arose from such acts of violence had prevailed with the magistrates to keep a constant guard on foot for preventing or separating such affrays as had happened in the present case  the falconer and his young companion were now riding down the canongate and had slackened their pace to avoid attracting attention the rather that there seemed to be no appearance of pursuit roland hung his head as one who was conscious his conduct had been none of the wisest whilst his companion thus addressed him  will you be pleased to tell me one thing master roland graeme and that is whether there be a devil incarnate in you or no  truly master adam woodcock answered the page i would fain hope there is not  then said adam i would fain know by what other influence or instigation you are perpetually at one end or the other of some bloody brawl  what i pray had you to do with these seytons and leslies that you never heard the names of in your life before  you are out there my friend said roland graeme i have my own reasons for being a friend to the seytons  they must have been very secret reasons then answered adam woodcock for i think i could have wagered you had never known one of the name and i am apt to believe still that it was your unhallowed passion for that clashing of cold iron which has as much charm for you as the clatter of a brass pan hath for a hive of bees rather than any care either for seyton or for leslie that persuaded you to thrust your fools head into a quarrel that no ways concerned you but take this for a warning my young master that if you are to draw sword with every man who draws sword on the highgate here it will be scarce worth your while to sheathe bilbo again for the rest of your life since if i guess rightly it will scarce endure on such terms for many hoursall which i leave to your serious consideration  by my word adam i honour your advice and i promise you that i will practise by it as faithfully as if i were sworn apprentice to you to the trade and mystery of bearing myself with all wisdom and safety through the new paths of life that i am about to be engaged in  and therein you will do well said the falconer and i do not quarrel with you master roland for having a grain over much spirit because i know one may bring to the hand a wild hawk which one never can a dunghill henand so betwixt two faults you have the best ont but besides your peculiar genius for quarrelling and lugging out your side companion my dear master roland you have also the gift of peering under every womans muffler and screen as if you expected to find an old acquaintance though were you to spy one i should be as much surprised at it well wotting how few you have seen of these same wildfowl as i was at your taking so deep an interest even now in the seyton  tush man nonsense and folly answered roland graeme i but sought to see what eyes these gentle hawks have got under their hood  ay but its a dangerous subject of inquiry said the falconer you had better hold out your bare wrist for an eagle to perch uponlook you master roland these pretty wildgeese cannot be hawked at without riskthey have as many divings boltings and volleyings as the most gamesome quarry that falcon ever flew atand besides every woman of them is manned with her husband or her kind friend or her brother or her cousin or her sworn servant at the leastbut you heed me not master roland though i know the game so wellyour eye is all on that pretty damsel who trips down the gate before usby my certes i will warrant her a blithe dancer either in reel or revela pair of silver morisco bells would become these pretty ankles as well as the jesses would suit the fairest norway hawk  thou art a fool adam said the page and i care not a button about the girl or her anklesbut what the foul fiend one must look at something  very true master roland graeme said his guide but let me pray you to choose your objects better look you there is scarce a woman walks this highgate with a silk screen or a pearlin muffler but as i said before she has either gentlemanusher before her or kinsman or lover or husband at her elbow or it may be a brace of stout fellows with sword and buckler not so far behind but what they can follow closebut you heed me no more than a gosshawk minds a yellow yoldring  o yes i doi do mind you indeed said roland graeme but hold my nag a biti will be with you in the exchange of a whistle so saying and ere adam woodcock could finish the sermon which was dying on his tongue roland graeme to the falconers utter astonishment threw him the bridle of his jennet jumped off horseback and pursued down one of the closes or narrow lanes which opening under a vault terminate upon the mainstreet the very maiden to whom his friend had accused him of showing so much attention and who had turned down the pass in question  saint mary saint magdalen saint benedict saint barnabas said the poor falconer when he found himself thus suddenly brought to a pause in the midst of the canongate and saw his young charge start off like a madman in quest of a damsel whom he had never as adam supposed seen in his life beforesaint satan and saint beelzebubfor this would make one swear saint and devilwhat can have come over the lad with a wanion and what shall i do the whilsthe will have his throat cut the poor lad as sure as i was born at the foot of roseberrytopping could i find some one to hold the horses but they are as sharp here northaway as in canny yorkshire herself and quit bridle quit titt as we say an i could but see one of our folks now a hollysprig were worth a gold tassel or could i but see one of the regents menbut to leave the horses to a stranger that i cannotand to leave the place while the lad is in jeopardy that i wonot  we must leave the falconer however in the midst of his distress and follow the hotheaded youth who was the cause of his perplexity  the latter part of adam woodcocks sage remonstrance had been in a great measure lost upon roland for whose benefit it was intended because in one of the female forms which tripped along the street muffled in a veil of striped silk like the women of brussels at this day his eye had discerned something which closely resembled the exquisite shape and spirited bearing of catherine seytonduring all the grave advice which the falconer was dinning in his ears his eye continued intent upon so interesting an object of observation and at length as the damsel just about to dive under one of the arched passages which afforded an outlet to the canongate from the houses beneath a passage graced by a projecting shield of arms supported by two huge foxes of stone had lifted her veil for the purpose perhaps of descrying who the horseman was who for some time had eyed her so closely young roland saw under the shade of the silken plaid enough of the bright azure eyes fair locks and blithe features to induce him like an inexperienced and rash madcap whose wilful ways never had been traversed by contradiction nor much subjected to consideration to throw the bridle of his horse into adam woodcocks hand and leave him to play the waiting gentleman while he dashed down the paved court after catherine seytonall as aforesaid  womens wits are proverbially quick but apparently those of catherine suggested no better expedient than fairly to betake herself to speed of foot in hopes of baffling the pages vivacity by getting safely lodged before he could discover where but a youth of eighteen in pursuit of a mistress is not so easily outstripped catherine fled across a paved court decorated with large formal vases of stone in which yews cypresses and other evergreens vegetated in sombre sullenness and gave a correspondent degree of solemnity to the high and heavy building in front of which they were placed as ornaments aspiring towards a square portion of the blue hemisphere corresponding exactly in extent to the quadrangle in which they were stationed and all around which rose huge black walls exhibiting windows in rows of five stories with heavy architraves over each bearing armorial and religious devices  through this court catherine seyton flashed like a hunted doe making the best use of those pretty legs which had attracted the commendation even of the reflective and cautious adam woodcock she hastened towards a large door in the centre of the lower front of the court pulled the bobbin till the latch flew up and ensconced herself in the ancient mansion but if she fled like a doe roland graeme followed with the speed and ardour of a youthful staghound loosed for the first time on his prey he kept her in view in spite of her efforts for it is remarkable what an advantage in such a race the gallant who desires to see possesses over the maiden who wishes not to be seenan advantage which i have known counterbalance a great start in point of distance in short he saw the waving of her screen or veil at one corner heard the tap of her foot light as that was as it crossed the court and caught a glimpse of her figure just as she entered the door of the mansion  roland graeme inconsiderate and headlong as we have described him having no knowledge of real life but from the romances which he had read and not an idea of checking himself in the midst of any eager impulse possessed besides of much courage and readiness never hesitated for a moment to approach the door through which the object of his search had disappeared he too pulled the bobbin and the latch though heavy and massive answered to the summons and arose the page entered with the same precipitation which had marked his whole proceeding and found himself in a large hall or vestibule dimly enlightened by latticed casements of painted glass and rendered yet dimmer through the exclusion of the sunbeams owing to the height of the walls of those buildings by which the courtyard was enclosed the walls of the hall were surrounded with suits of ancient and rusted armour interchanged with huge and massive stone scutcheons bearing double tressures fleured and counterfleured wheatsheaves coronets and so forth things to which roland graeme gave not a moments attention  in fact he only deigned to observe the figure of catherine seyton who deeming herself safe in the hall had stopped to take breath after her course and was reposing herself for a moment on a large oaken settle which stood at the upper end of the hall the noise of rolands entrance at once disturbed her she started up with a faint scream of surprise and escaped through one of the several foldingdoors which opened into this apartment as a common centre this door which roland graeme instantly approached opened on a large and welllighted gallery at the upper end of which he could hear several voices and the noise of hasty steps approaching towards the hall or vestibule a little recalled to sober thought by an appearance of serious danger he was deliberating whether he should stand fast or retire when catherine seyton reentered from a side door running towards him with as much speed as a few minutes since she had fled from him  oh what mischief brought you hither she said flyfly or you are a dead manor staythey comeflight is impossiblesay you came to ask for lord seyton  she sprung from him and disappeared through the door by which she had made her second appearance and at the same instant a pair of large foldingdoors at the upper end of the gallery flew open with vehemence and six or seven young gentlemen richly dressed pressed forward into the apartment having for the greater part their swords drawn  who is it said one dare intrude on us in our own mansion  cut him to pieces said another let him pay for this days insolence and violencehe is some follower of the rothes  no by saint mary said another he is a follower of the archfiend and ennobled clown halbert glendinning who takes the style of avenelonce a churchvassal now a pillager of the church  it is so said a fourth i know him by the hollysprig which is their cognizance secure the door he must answer for this insolence  two of the gallants hastily drawing their weapons passed on to the door by which roland had entered the hall and stationed themselves there as if to prevent his escape the others advanced on graeme who had just sense enough to perceive that any attempt at resistance would be alike fruitless and imprudent at once and by various voices none of which sounded amicably the page was required to say who he was whence he came his name his errand and who sent him hither the number of the questions demanded of him at once afforded a momentary apology for his remaining silent and ere that brief truce had elapsed a personage entered the hall at whose appearance those who had gathered fiercely around roland fell back with respect  this was a tall man whose dark hair was already grizzled though his high and haughty features retained all the animation of youth the upper part of his person was undressed to his holland shirt whose ample folds were stained with blood but he wore a mantle of crimson lined with rich fur cast around him which supplied the deficiency of his dress on his head he had a crimson velvet bonnet looped up on one side with a small golden chain of many links which going thrice around the hat was fastened by a medal agreeable to the fashion amongst the grandees of the time  whom have you here sons and kinsmen said he around whom you crowd thus roughlyknow you not that the shelter of this roof should secure every one fair treatment who shall come hither either in fair peace or in open and manly hostility  but here my lord answered one of the youths is a knave who comes on treacherous espial  i deny the charge said roland graeme boldly i came to inquire after my lord seyton  a likely tale answered his accusers in the mouth of a follower of glendinning  stay young men said the lord seyton for it was that nobleman himself let me look at this youthby heaven it is the very same who came so boldly to my side not very many minutes since when some of my own knaves bore themselves with more respect to their own worshipful safety than to mine stand back from him for he well deserves honour and a friendly welcome at your hands instead of this rough treatment  they fell back on all sides obedient to lord seytons commands who taking roland graeme by the hand thanked him for his prompt and gallant assistance adding that he nothing doubted the same interest which he had taken in his cause in the affray brought him hither to inquire after his hurt  roland bowed low in acquiescence  or is there any thing in which i can serve you to show my sense of your ready gallantry  but the page thinking it best to abide by the apology for his visit which the lord seyton had so aptly himself suggested replied that to be assured of his lordships safety had been the only cause of his intrusion he judged he added he had seen him receive some hurt in the affray  a trifle said lord seyton i had but stripped my doublet that the chirurgeon might put some dressing on the paltry scratch when these rash boys interrupted us with their clamour  roland graeme making a low obeisance was now about to depart for relieved from the danger of being treated as a spy he began next to fear that his companion adam woodcock whom he had so unceremoniously quitted would either bring him into some farther dilemma by venturing into the hotel in quest of him or ride off and leave him behind altogether but lord seyton did not permit him to escape so easily tarry he said young man and let me know thy rank and name the seyton has of late been more wont to see friends and followers shrink from his side than to receive aid from strangersbut a new world may come around in which he may have the chance of rewarding his wellwishers  my name is roland graeme my lord answered the youth a page who for the present is in the service of sir halbert glendinning  i said so from the first said one of the young men my life i will wager that this is a shaft out of the heretics quivera stratagem from first to last to injeer into your confidence some espial of his own they know how to teach both boys and women to play the intelligencers  that is false if it be spoken of me said roland no man in scotland should teach me such a foul part  i believe thee boy said lord seyton for thy strokes were too fair to be dealt upon an understanding with those that were to receive them credit me however i little expected to have help at need from one of your masters household and i would know what moved thee in my quarrel to thine own endangering  so please you my lord said roland i think my master himself would not have stood by and seen an honourable man borne to earth by odds if his single arm could help him such at least is the lesson we were taught in chivalry at the castle of avenel  the good seed hath fallen into good ground young man said seyton but alas if thou practise such honourable war in these dishonourable days when right is every where borne down by mastery thy life my poor boy will be but a short one  let it be short so it be honourable said roland graeme and permit me now my lord to commend me to your grace and to take my leave a comrade waits with my horse in the street  take this however young man said lord seyton  footnote george fifth lord seton was immovably faithful to queen mary during all the mutabilities of her fortune he was grand master of the household in which capacity he had a picture painted of himself with his official baton and the following motto    in adversitate patiens   in prosperitate benevolus   hazard yet forward  on various parts of his castle he inscribed as expressing his religious and political creed the legend    un dieu un foy un roy un loy  he declined to be promoted to an earldom which queen mary offered him at the same time when she advanced her natural brother to be earl of mar and afterwards of murray  on his refusing this honour mary wrote or caused to be written the following lines in latin and french    sunt comites ducesque alii sunt denique reges   sethom dominum sit satis esse mihi    il y a des comptes des roys des ducs ainsi   cest assez pour moy destre seigneur de seton  which may be thus rendered    earl duke or king be thou that list to be   seton thy lordship is enough for me  this distich reminds us of the pride which aped humility in the motto of the house of couci    je suis ni roy ni prince aussi   je suis le seigneur de coucy  after the battle of langside lord seton was obliged to retire abroad for safety and was an exile for two years during which he was reduced to the necessity of driving a waggon in flanders for his subsistence he rose to favour in james vis reign and assuming his paternal property had himself painted in his waggoners dress and in the act of driving a wain with four horses on the north end of a stately gallery at seton castle  undoing from his bonnet the golden chain and medal and wear it for my sake  with no little pride roland graeme accepted the gift which he hastily fastened around his bonnet as he had seen gallants wear such an ornament and renewing his obeisance to the baron left the hall traversed the court and appeared in the street just as adam woodcock vexed and anxious at his delay had determined to leave the horses to their fate and go in quest of his youthful comrade whose barn hast thou broken next he exclaimed greatly relieved by his appearance although his countenance indicated that he had passed through an agitating scene  ask me no questions said roland leaping gaily on his horse but see how short time it takes to win a chain of gold pointing to that which he now wore  now god forbid that thou hast either stolen it or reft it by violence said the falconer for otherwise i wot not how the devil thou couldst compass it i have been often here ay for months at an end and no one gave me either chain or medal  thou seest i have got one on shorter acquaintance with the city answered the page but set thine honest heart at rest that which is fairly won and freely given is neither reft nor stolen  marry hang thee with thy fanfarona footnote a name given to the gold chains worn by the military men of the period it is of spanish origin for the fashion of wearing these costly ornaments was much followed amongst the conquerors of the new world about thy neck said the falconer i think water will not drown nor hemp strangle thee thou hast been discarded as my ladys page to come in again as my lords squire and for following a noble young damsel into some great household thou gettest a chain and medal where another would have had the baton across his shoulders if he missed having the dirk in his body but here we come in front of the old abbey bear thy good luck with you when you cross these paved stones and by our lady you may brag scotland  as he spoke they checked their horses where the huge old vaulted entrance to the abbey or palace of holyrood crossed the termination of the street down which they had proceeded the courtyard of the palace opened within this gloomy porch showing the front of an irregular pile of monastic buildings one wing of which is still extant forming a part of the modern palace erected in the days of charles i  at the gate of the porch the falconer and page resigned their horses to the servingman in attendance the falconer commanding him with an air of authority to carry them safely to the stables we follow he said the knight of avenelwe must bear ourselves for what we are here said he in a whisper to roland for every one here is looked on as they demean themselves and he that is too modest must to the wall as the proverb says therefore cock thy bonnet man and let us brook the causeway bravely  assuming therefore an air of consequence corresponding to what he supposed to be his masters importance and quality adam woodcock led the way into the courtyard of the palace of holyrood  he appears to have been fond of the arts for there exists a beautiful familypiece of him in the centre of his family mr pinkerton in his scottish iconographia published an engraving of this curious portrait the original is the property of lord somerville nearly connected with the seton family and is at present at his lordships fishing villa of the pavilion near melrose     chapter the eighteenth     the sky is clouded gaspard   and the vexed ocean sleeps a troubled sleep   beneath a lurid gleam of parting sunshine   such slumber hangs oer discontented lands   while factions doubt as yet if they have strength   to front the open battle                              albiona poem  the youthful page paused on the entrance of the courtyard and implored his guide to give him a moments breathing space let me but look around me man said he you consider not i have never seen such a scene as this beforeand this is holyroodthe resort of the gallant and gay and the fair and the wise and the powerful  ay marry is it said woodcock but i wish i could hood thee as they do the hawks for thou starest as wildly as if you sought another fray or another fanfarona i would i had thee safely housed for thou lookest wild as a gosshawk  it was indeed no common sight to roland the vestibule of a palace traversed by its various groupssome radiant with gaietysome pensive and apparently weighed down by affairs concerning the state or concerning themselves here the hoary statesman with his cautious yet commanding look his furred cloak and sable pantoufles there the soldier in buff and steel his long sword jarring against the pavement and his whiskered upper lip and frowning brow looking an habitual defiance of danger which perhaps was not always made good there again passed my lords servingman high of heart and bloody of hand humble to his master and his masters equals insolent to all others to these might be added the poor suitor with his anxious look and depressed mienthe officer full of his brief authority elbowing his betters and possibly his benefactors out of the roadthe proud priest who sought a better beneficethe proud baron who sought a grant of church landsthe robber chief who came to solicit a pardon for the injuries he had inflicted on his neighborsthe plundered franklin who came to seek vengeance for that which he had himself received besides there was the mustering and disposition of guards and soldiersthe despatching of messengers and the receiving themthe trampling and neighing of horses without the gatethe flashing of arms and rustling of plumes and jingling of spurs within it in short it was that gay and splendid confusion in which the eye of youth sees all that is brave and brilliant and that of experience much that is doubtful deceitful false and hollowhopes that will never be gratifiedpromises which will never be fulfilledpride in the disguise of humilityand insolence in that of frank and generous bounty  as tired of the eager and enraptured attention which the page gave to a scene so new to him adam woodcock endeavoured to get him to move forward before his exuberance of astonishment should attract the observation of the sharpwitted denizens of the court the falconer himself became an object of attention to a gay menial in a darkgreen bonnet and feather with a cloak of a corresponding colour laid down as the phrase then went by six broad bars of silver lace and welted with violet and silver the words of recognition burst from both at once what adam woodcock at court and what michael wingthewindand how runs the hackit greyhound bitch now  the waur for the wear like ourselves adameight years this grass no four legs will carry a dog forever but we keep her for the breed and so she scapes border doombut why stand you gazing there i promise you my lord has wished for you and asked for you  my lord of murray asked for me and he regent of the kingdom too said adam i hunger and thirst to pay my duty to my good lordbut i fancy his good lordship remembers the days sport on carnwathmoor and my drummelzier falcon that beat the hawks from the isle of man and won his lordship a hundred crowns from the southern baron whom they called stanley  nay not to flatter thee adam said his courtfriend he remembers nought of thee or of thy falcon either he hath flown many a higher flight since that and struck his quarry too but come come hither away i trust we are to be good comrades on the old score  what said adam you would have me crush a pot with you but i must first dispose of my eyas where he will neither have girl to chase nor lad to draw sword upon  is the youngster such a one said michael  ay by my hood he flies at all game replied woodcock  then had he better come with us said michael wingthewind for we cannot have a proper carouse just now only i would wet my lips and so must you i want to hear the news from saint marys before you see my lord and i will let you know how the wind sits up yonder  while he thus spoke he led the way to a side door which opened into the court and threading several dark passages with the air of one who knew the most secret recesses of the palace conducted them to a small matted chamber where he placed bread and cheese and a foaming flagon of ale before the falconer and his young companion who immediately did justice to the latter in a hearty draught which nearly emptied the measure having drawn his breath and dashed the froth from his whiskers he observed that his anxiety for the boy had made him deadly dry  mend your draught said his hospitable friend again supplying the flagon from a pitcher which stood beside i know the way to the butterybar and now mind what i saythis morning the earl of morton came to my lord in a mighty chafe  what they keep the old friendship then said woodcock  ay ay man what else said michael one hand must scratch the other but in a mighty chafe was my lord of morton who to say truth looketh on such occasions altogether uncanny and as it were fiendish and he says to my lordfor i was in the chamber taking orders about a cast of hawks that are to be fetched from darnowaythey match your longwinged falcons friend adam  i will believe that when i see them fly as high a pitch replied woodcock this professional observation forming a sort of parenthesis  however said michael pursuing his tale my lord of morton in a mighty chafe asked my lord regent whether he was well dealt withfor my brother said he should have had a gift to be commendator of kennaqubair and to have all the temporalities erected into a lordship of regality for his benefit and here said he the false monks have had the insolence to choose a new abbot to put his claim in my brothers way and moreover the rascality of the neighbourhood have burnt and plundered all that was left in the abbey so that my brother will not have a house to dwell in when he hath ousted the lazy hounds of priests and my lord seeing him chafed said mildly to him these are shrewd tidings douglas but i trust they be not true for halbert glendinning went southward yesterday with a band of spears and assuredly had either of these chances happened that the monks had presumed to choose an abbot or that the abbey had been burnt as you say he had taken order on the spot for the punishment of such insolence and had despatched us a messenger and the earl of morton repliednow i pray you adam to notice that i say this out of love to you and your lord and also for old comradeship and also because sir halbert hath done me good and may againand also because i love not the earl of morton as indeed more fear than like himso then it were a foul deed in you to betray mebut said the earl to the regent take heed my lord you trust not this glendinning too farhe comes of churls blood which was never true to the noblesby saint andrew these were his very wordsand besides he said he hath a brother a monk in saint marys and walks all by his guidance and is making friends on the border with buccleuch and with ferniehirst footnote both these border chieftains were great friends of queen mary and will join hand with them were there likelihood of a new world and my lord answered like a free noble lord as he is tush my lord of morton i will be warrant for glendinnings faith and for his brother he is a dreamer that thinks of nought but book and breviaryand if such hap have chanced as you tell of i look to receive from glendinning the cowl of a hanged monk and the head of a riotous churl by way of sharp and sudden justiceand my lord of morton left the place and as it seemed to me somewhat malecontent but since that time my lord has asked me more than once whether there has arrived no messenger from the knight of avenel and all this i have told you that you may frame your discourse to the best purpose for it seems to me that my lord will not be wellpleased if aught has happened like what my lord of morton said and if your lord hath not taen strict orders with it  there was something in this communication which fairly blanked the bold visage of adam woodcock in spite of the reinforcement which his natural hardihood had received from the berrybrown ale of holyrood  what was it he said about a churls head that grim lord of morton said the discontented falconer to his friend  nay it was my lord regent who said that he expected if the abbey was injured your knight would send him the head of the ringleader among the rioters  nay but is this done like a good protestant said adam woodcock or a true lord of the congregation we used to be their whiteboys and darlings when we pulled down the convents in fife and perthshire ay but that said michael was when old mother rome held her own and our great folks were determined she should have no shelter for her head in scotland but now that the priests are fled in all quarters and their houses and lands are given to our grandees they cannot see that we are working the work of reformation in destroying the palaces of zealous protestants  but i tell you saint marys is not destroyed said woodcock in increasing agitation some trash of painted windows there were brokenthings that no nobleman could have brooked in his housesome stone saints were brought on their marrowbones like old widdrington at chevychase but as for fireraising there was not so much as a lighted lunt amongst us save the match which the dragon had to light the burning tow withal which he was to spit against saint george nay i had caution of that  how adam woodcock said his comrade i trust thou hadst no hand in such a fair work look you adam i were loth to terrify you and you just come from a journey but i promise you earl morton hath brought you down a maiden from halifax you never saw the like of herand shell clasp you round the neck and your head will remain in her arms  pshaw answered adam i am too old to have my head turned by any maiden of them all i know my lord of morton will go as far for a buxom lass as anyone but what the devil took him to halifax all the way  and if he has got a gamester there what hath she to do with my head  much much answered michael herods daughter who did such execution with her foot and ankle danced not mens heads off more cleanly than this maiden of morton footnote maiden of mortona species of guillotine which the regent morton brought down from halifax certainly at a period considerably later than intimated in the tale he was himself the first who suffered by the engine tis an axe manan axe which falls of itself like a sash window and never gives the headsmen the trouble to wield it  by my faith a shrewd device said woodcock heaven keep us free ont  the page seeing no end to the conversation betwixt these two old comrades and anxious from what he had heard concerning the fate of the abbot now interrupted their conference  methinks he said adam woodcock thou hadst better deliver thy masters letter to the regent questionless he hath therein stated what has chanced at kennaquhair in the way most advantageous for all concerned  the boy is right said michael wingthewind my lord will be very impatient  the child hath wit enough to keep himself warm said adam woodcock producing from his hawkingbag his lords letter addressed to the earl of murray and for that matter so have i so master roland you will een please to present this yourself to the lord regent his presence will be better graced by a young page than by an old falconer  well said canny yorkshire replied his friend and but now you were so earnest to see our good lordwhy wouldst thou put the lad into the noose that thou mayst slip tether thyselfor dost thou think the maiden will clasp his fair young neck more willingly than thy old sunburnt weasand  go to answered the falconer thy wit towers high an it could strike the quarry i tell thee the youth has nought to fearhe had nothing to do with the gambola rare gambol it was michael as madcaps ever played and i had made as rare a ballad if we had had the luck to get it sung to an end but mum for thattace as i said before is latin for a candle carry the youth to the presence and i will remain here with bridle in hand ready to strike the spurs up to the rowelheads in case the hawk flies my wayi will soon put soltraedge i trow betwixt the regent and me if he means me less than fair play  come on then my lad said michael since thou must needs take the spring before canny yorkshire so saying he led the way through winding passages closely followed by roland graeme until they arrived at a large winding stone stair the steps of which were so long and broad and at the same time so low as to render the ascent uncommonly easy when they had ascended about the height of one story the guide stepped aside and pushed open the door of a dark and gloomy antechamber so dark indeed that his youthful companion stumbled and nearly fell down upon a low step which was awkwardly placed on the very threshold  take heed said michael wingthewind in a very low tone of voice and first glancing cautiously round to see if any one listenedtake heed my young friend for those who fall on these boards seldom rise againseest thou that he added in a still lower voice pointing to some dark crimson stains on the floor on which a ray of light shot through a small aperture and traversing the general gloom of the apartment fell with mottled radianceseest thou that youthwalk warily for men have fallen here before you  what mean you said the page his flesh creeping though he scarce knew why is it blood  ay ay said the domestic in the same whispering tone and dragging the youth on by the armblood it isbut this is no time to question or even to look at it blood it is foully and fearfully shed as foully and fearfully avenged the blood he added in a still more cautious tone of seignior david  roland graemes heart throbbed when he found himself so unexpectedly in the scene of rizzios slaughter a catastrophe which had chilled with horror all even in that rude age which had been the theme of wonder and pity through every cottage and castle in scotland and had not escaped that of avenel but his guide hurried him forward permitting no farther question and with the manner of one who has already tampered too much with a dangerous subject a tap which he made at a low door at one end of the vestibule was answered by a huissier or usher who opening it cautiously received michaels intimation that a page waited the regents leisure who brought letters from the knight of avenel  the council is breaking up said the usher but give me the packet his grace the regent will presently see the messenger  the packet replied the page must be delivered into the regents own hands such were the orders of my master  the usher looked at him from head to foot as if surprised at his boldness and then replied with some asperity say you so my young master thou crowest loudly to be but a chicken and from a country barnyard too  were it a time or place said roland thou shouldst see i can do more than crow but do your duty and let the regent know i wait his pleasure  thou art but a pert knave to tell me of my duty said the courtier in office but i will find a time to show you you are out of yours meanwhile wait there till you are wanted so saying he shut the door in rolands face  michael wingthewind who had shrunk from his youthful companion during this altercation according to the established maxim of courtiers of all ranks and in all ages now transgressed their prudential line of conduct so far as to come up to him once more thou art a hopeful young springald said he and i see right well old yorkshire had reason in his caution thou hast been five minutes in the court and hast employed thy time so well as to make a powerful and a mortal enemy out of the usher of the councilchamber why man you might almost as well have offended the deputy butler  i care not what he is said roland graeme i will teach whomever i speak with to speak civilly to me in return i did not come from avenel to be browbeaten in holyrood  bravo my lad said michael it is a fine spirit if you can but hold itbut see the door opens  the usher appeared and in a more civil tone of voice and manner said that his grace the regent would receive the knight of avenels message and accordingly marshalled roland graeme the way into the apartment from which the council had been just dismissed after finishing their consultations there was in the room a long oaken table surrounded by stools of the same wood with a large elbow chair covered with crimson velvet at the head writing materials and papers were lying there in apparent disorder and one or two of the privy counsellors who had lingered behind assuming their cloaks bonnets and swords and bidding farewell to the regent were departing slowly by a large door on the opposite side to that through which the page entered apparently the earl of murray had made some jest for the smiling countenances of the statesmen expressed that sort of cordial reception which is paid by courtiers to the condescending pleasantries of a prince  the regent himself was laughing heartily as he said farewell my lords and hold me remembered to the cock of the north  he then turned slowly round towards roland graeme and the marks of gaiety real or assumed disappeared from his countenance as completely as the passing bubbles leave the dark mirror of a still profound lake into which a traveller has cast a stone in the course of a minute his noble features had assumed their natural expression of deep and even melancholy gravity  this distinguished statesman for as such his worst enemies acknowledged him possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed and had he succeeded to the throne as his legitimate inheritance it is probable he would have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kings but that he held his authority by the deposition and imprisonment of his sister and benefactress was a crime which those only can excuse who think ambition an apology for ingratitude he was dressed plainly in black velvet after the flemish fashion and wore in his highcrowned hat a jewelled clasp which looped it up on one side and formed the only ornament of his apparel he had his poniard by his side and his sword lay on the council table  such was the personage before whom roland graeme now presented himself with a feeling of breathless awe very different from the usual boldness and vivacity of his temper in fact he was from education and nature forward but not impudent and was much more easily controlled by the moral superiority arising from the elevated talents and renown of those with whom he conversed than by pretensions founded only on rank or external show he might have braved with indifference the presence of an earl merely distinguished by his belt and coronet but he felt overawed in that of the eminent soldier and statesman the wielder of a nations power and the leader of her armiesthe greatest and wisest are flattered by the deference of youthso graceful and becoming in itself and murray took with much courtesy the letter from the hands of the abashed and blushing page and answered with complaisance to the imperfect and halfmuttered greeting which he endeavoured to deliver to him on the part of sir halbert of avenel he even paused a moment ere he broke the silk with which the letter was secured to ask the page his nameso much he was struck with his very handsome features and form  roland graeme he said repeating the words after the hesitating page  what of the grahams of the lennox  no my lord replied roland my parents dwelt in the debateable land  murray made no further inquiry but proceeded to read his dispatches during the perusal of which his brow began to assume a stern expression of displeasure as that of one who found something which at once surprised and disturbed him he sat down on the nearest seat frowned till his eyebrows almost met together read the letter twice over and was then silent for several minutes at length raising his head his eye encountered that of the usher who in vain endeavoured to exchange the look of eager and curious observation with which he had been perusing the regents features for that open and unnoticing expression of countenance which in looking at all seems as if it saw and marked nothinga cast of look which may be practised with advantage by all those of whatever degree who are admitted to witness the familiar and unguarded hours of their superiors great men are as jealous of their thoughts as the wife of king candaules was of her charms and will as readily punish those who have however involuntarily beheld them in mental deshabille and exposure  leave the apartment hyndman said the regent sternly and carry your observation elsewhere you are too knowing sir for your post which by special order is destined for men of blunter capacity so now you look more like a fool than you didfor hyndman as may easily be supposed was not a little disconcerted by this rebukekeep that confused stare and it may keep your office begone sir  the usher departed in dismay not forgetting to register amongst his other causes of dislike to roland graeme that he had been the witness of this disgraceful chiding when he had left the apartment the regent again addressed the page  your name you say is armstrong  no replied roland my name is graeme so please youroland graeme whose forbears were designated of heathergill in the debateable land  ay i knew it was a name from the debateable land hast thou any acquaintance in edinburgh  my lord replied roland willing rather to evade this question than to answer it directly for the prudence of being silent with respect to lord seytons adventure immediately struck him i have been in edinburgh scarce an hour and that for the first time in my life  what and thou sir halbert glendinnings page said the regent  i was brought up as my ladys page said the youth and left avenel castle for the first time in my lifeat least since my childhoodonly three days since  my ladys page repeated the earl of murray as if speaking to himself it was strange to send his ladys page on a matter of such deep concernmentmorton will say it is of a piece with the nomination of his brother to be abbot and yet in some sort an inexperienced youth will best serve the turnwhat hast thou been taught young man in thy doughty apprenticeship  to hunt my lord and to hawk said roland graeme  to hunt coneys and to hawk at ouzels said the regent smiling for such are the sports of ladies and their followers  graemes cheek reddened deeply as he replied not without some emphasis to hunt reddeer of the first head and to strike down herons of the highest soar my lord which in lothian speech may be termed for aught i know coneys and ouzelsalso i can wield a brand and couch a lance according to our border meaning in inland speech these may be termed waterflags and bulrushes  thy speech rings like metal said the regent and i pardon the sharpness of it for the truththou knowest then what belongs to the duty of a manatarms  so far as exercise can teachit without real service in the field answered roland graeme but our knight permitted none of his household to make raids and i never had the good fortune to see a stricken field  the good fortune repeated the regent smiling somewhat sorrowfully take my word young man war is the only game from which both parties rise losers  not always my lord answered the page with his characteristic audacity if fame speaks truth  how sir said the regent colouring in his turn and perhaps suspecting an indiscreet allusion to the height which he himself had attained by the hap of civil war  because my lord said roland graeme without change of tone he who fights well must have fame in life or honour in death and so war is a game from which no one can rise a loser  the regent smiled and shook his head when at that moment the door opened and the earl of morton presented himself  i come somewhat hastily he said and i enter unannounced because my news are of weightit is as i said edward glendinning is named abbot and  hush my lord said the regent i know it but  and perhaps you knew it before i did my lord of murray answered morton his dark red brow growing darker and redder as he spoke  morton said murray suspect me nottouch not mine honouri have to suffer enough from the calumnies of foes let me not have to contend with the unjust suspicions of my friendswe are not alone said he recollecting himself or i could tell you more  he led morton into one of the deep embrasures which the windows formed in the massive wall and which afforded a retiring place for their conversing apart in this recess roland observed them speak together with much earnestness murray appearing to be grave and earnest and morton having a jealous and offended air which seemed gradually to give way to the assurances of the regent  as their conversation grew more earnest they became gradually louder in speech having perhaps forgotten the presence of the page the more readily as his position in the apartment placed him put of sight so that he found himself unwillingly privy to more of their discourse than he cared to hear for page though he was a mean curiosity after the secrets of others had never been numbered amongst rolands failings and moreover with all his natural rashness he could not but doubt the safety of becoming privy to the secret discourse of these powerful and dreaded men still he could neither stop his ears nor with propriety leave the apartment and while he thought of some means of signifying his presence he had already heard so much that to have produced himself suddenly would have been as awkward and perhaps as dangerous as in quiet to abide the end of their conference what he overheard however was but an imperfect part of their communication and although an expert politician acquainted with the circumstances of the times would have had little difficulty in tracing the meaning yet roland graeme could only form very general and vague conjectures as to the import of their discourse  all is prepared said murray and lindsay is setting forwardshe must hesitate no longerthou seest i act by thy counsel and harden myself against softer considerations  true my lord replied morton in what is necessary to gain power you do not hesitate but go boldly to the mark but are you as careful to defend and preserve what you have wonwhy this establishment of domestics around herhas not your sister men and maidens enough to tend her but you must consent to this superfluous and dangerous retinue  for shame mortona princess and my sister could i do less than allow her due attendance  ay replied morton even thus fly all your shaftssmartly enough loosened from the bow and not unskilfully aimedbut a breath of foolish affection ever crosses in the mid volley and sways the arrow from the mark  say not so morton replied murray i have both dared and done  yes enough to gain but not enough to keepreckon not that she will think and act thusyou have wounded her deeply both in pride and in powerit signifies nought that you would tent now the wound with unavailing salvesas matters stand with you you must forfeit the title of an affectionate brother to hold that of a bold and determined statesman  morton said murray with some impatience i brook not these tauntswhat i have done i have donewhat i must farther do i must and willbut i am not made of iron like thee and i cannot but rememberenough of thismy purpose holds  and i warrant me said morton the choice of these domestic consolations will rest with  here he whispered names which escaped roland graemes ear murray replied in a similar tone but so much raised towards the conclusion of the sentence that the page heard these wordsand of him i hold myself secure by glendinnings recommendation  ay which may be as much trustworthy as his late conduct at the abbey of saint marysyou have heard that his brothers election has taken place your favourite sir halbert my lord of murray has as much fraternal affection as yourself  by heaven morton that taunt demanded an unfriendly answer but i pardon it for your brother also is concerned but this election shall be annulled i tell you earl of morton while i hold the sword of state in my royal nephews name neither lord nor knight in scotland shall dispute my authority and if i bearwith insults from my friends it is only while i know them to be such and forgive their follies for their faithfulness  morton muttered what seemed to be some excuse and the regent answered him in a milder tone and then subjoined besides i have another pledge than glendinnings recommendation for this youths fidelityhis nearest relative has placed herself in my hands as his security to be dealt withal as his doings shall deserve  that is something replied morton but yet in fair love and goodwill i must still pray you to keep on your guard the foes are stirring again as horseflies and hornets become busy so soon as the stormblast is over george of seyton was crossing the causeway this morning with a score of men at his back and had a ruffle with my friends of the house of lesliethey met at the tron and were fighting hard when the provost with his guard of partisans came in thirdsman and staved them asunder with their halberds as men part dog and bear  he hath my order for such interference said the regenthas any one been hurt  george of seyton himself by black ralph lesliethe devil take the rapier that ran not through from side to side ralph has a bloody coxcomb by a blow from a messanpage whom nobody knewdick seyton of windygowl is run through the arm and two gallants of the leslies have suffered phlebotomy this is all the gentle blood which has been spilled in the revel but a yeoman or two on both sides have had bones broken and ears chopped the ostlerewives who are like to be the only losers by their miscarriage have dragged the knaves off the street and are crying a drunken coronach over them  you take it lightly douglas said the regent these broils and feuds would shame the capital of the great turk let alone that of a christian and reformed state but if i live this gear shall be amended and men shall say when they read my story that if it were my cruel hap to rise to power by the dethronement of a sister i employed it when gained for the benefit of the commonweal  and of your friends replied morton wherefore i trust for your instant order annulling the election of this lurdane abbot edward glendinning  you shall be presently satisfied said the regent and stepping forward he began to call so ho hyndman when suddenly his eye lighted on roland graemeby my faith douglas said he turning to his friend here have been three at counsel  ay but only two can keep counsel said morton the galliard must be disposed of  for shame mortonan orphan boyhearken thee my childthou hast told me some of thy accomplishmentscanst thou speak truth ay my lord when it serves my turn replied graeme  it shall serve thy turn now said the regent and falsehood shall be thy destruction how much hast thou heard or understood of what we two have spoken together  but little my lord replied roland graeme boldly which met my apprehension saving that it seemed to me as if in something you doubted the faith of the knight of avenel under whose roof i was nurtured  and what hast thou to say on that point young man continued the regent bending his eyes upon him with a keen and strong expression of observation  that said the page depends on the quality of those who speak against his honour whose bread i have long eaten if they be my inferiors i say they lie and will maintain what i say with my baton if my equals still i say they lie and will do battle in the quarrel if they list with my sword if my superiorshe paused  proceed boldly said the regentwhat if thy superiors said aught that nearly touched your masters honour  i would say replied graeme that he did ill to slander the absent and that my master was a man who could render an account of his actions to any one who should manfully demand it of him to his face  and it were manfully said replied the regentwhat thinkest thou my lord of morton  i think replied morton that if the young galliard resemble a certain ancient friend of ours as much in the craft of his disposition as he does in eye and in brow there may be a wide difference betwixt what he means and what he speaks  and whom meanest thou that he resembles so closely said murray  even the true and trusty julian avenel replied morton  but this youth belongs to the debateable land said murray  it may be so but julian was an outlaying striker of venison and made many a far cast when he had a fair doe in chase  pshaw said the regent this is but idle talkhere thou hyndmanthou curiosity calling to the usher who now enteredconduct this youth to his companionyou will both he said to graeme keep yourselves in readiness to travel on short noticeand then motioning to him courteously to withdraw he broke up the interview     chapter the nineteenth     it is and is nottis the thing i sought for   have kneeld for prayd for riskd my fame and life for   and yet it is notno more than the shadow   upon the hard cold flat and polished mirror   is the warm graceful rounded living substance   which it presents in form and lineament                                      old play  the usher with gravity which ill concealed a jealous scowl conducted roland graeme to a lower apartment where he found his comrade the falconer the man of office then briefly acquainted them that this would be their residence till his graces farther orders that they were to go to the pantry to the buttery to the cellar and to the kitchen at the usual hours to receive the allowances becoming their stationinstructions which adam woodcocks old familiarity with the court made him perfectly understandfor your beds he said you must go to the hostelry of saint michaels in respect the palace is now full of the domestics of the greater nobles  no sooner was the ushers back turned than adam exclaimed with all the glee of eager curiosity and now master roland the newsthe newscome unbutton thy pouch and give us thy tidingswhat says the regent  asks he for adam woodcockand is all soldered up or must the abbot of unreason strap for it  all is well in that quarter said the page and for the restbut heyday what have you taken the chain and medal off from my bonnet  and meet time it was when yon usher vinegarfaced rogue that he is began to inquire what popish trangam you were wearingby the mass the metal would have been confiscated for consciencesake like your other rattletrap yonder at avenel which mistress lilias bears about on her shoes in the guise of a pair of shoebucklesthis comes of carrying popish nicknackets about you  the jade exclaimed roland graeme has she melted down my rosary into buckles for her clumsy hoofs which will set off such a garnish nearly as well as a cows mightbut hang her let her keep themmany a dogs trick have i played old lilias for want of having something better to do and the buckles will serve for a remembrance do you remember the verjuice i put into the comfits when old wingate and she were to breakfast together on easter morning  in troth do i master rolandthe majordomos mouth was as crooked as a hawks beak for the whole morning afterwards and any other page in your room would have tasted the discipline of the porters lodge for it  but my ladys favour stood between your skin and many a jerkinglord send you may be the better for her protection in such matters  i am least grateful for it adam and i am glad you put me in mind of it  well but the news my young master said woodcock spell me the tidingswhat are we to fly at nextwhat did the regent say to you  nothing that i am to repeat again said roland graeme shaking his head  why heyday said adam how prudent we are become all of a sudden you have advanced rarely in brief space master roland you have well nigh had your head broken and you have gained your gold chain and you have made an enemy master usher to wit with his two legs like hawks perches and you have had audience of the first man in the realm and bear as much mystery in your brow as if you had flown in the courtsky ever since you were hatched i believe in my soul you would run with a piece of the eggshell on your head like the curlews which i would we were after them again we used to call whaups in the halidome and its neighbourhood but sit thee down boy adam woodcock was never the lad to seek to enter into forbidden secretssit thee down and i will go and fetch the viversi know the butler and the pantler of old  the goodnatured falconer set forth upon his errand busying himself about procuring their refreshment and during his absence roland graeme abandoned himself to the strange complicated and yet heartstirring reflections to which the events of the morning had given rise yesterday he was of neither mark nor likelihood a vagrant boy the attendant on a relative of whose sane judgment he himself had not the highest opinion but now he had become he knew not why or wherefore or to what extent the custodier as the scottish phrase went of some important state secret in the safe keeping of which the regent himself was concerned it did not diminish from but rather added to the interest of a situation so unexpected that roland himself did not perfectly understand wherein he stood committed by the state secrets in which he had unwittingly become participator on the contrary he felt like one who looks on a romantic landscape of which he sees the features for the first time and then obscured with mist and driving tempest the imperfect glimpse which the eye catches of rocks trees and other objects around him adds double dignity to these shrouded mountains and darkened abysses of which the height depth and extent are left to imagination  but mortals especially at the wellappetized age which precedes twenty years are seldom so much engaged either by real or conjectural subjects of speculation but that their earthly wants claim their hour of attention and with many a smile did our hero so the reader may term him if he will hail the reappearance of his friend adam woodcock bearing on one platter a tremendous portion of boiled beef and on another a plentiful allowance of greens or rather what the scotch call langkale a groom followed with bread salt and the other means of setting forth a meal and when they had both placed on the oaken table what they bore in their hands the falconer observed that since he knew the court it had got harder and harder every day to the poor gentlemen and yeoman retainers but that now it was an absolute flaying of a flea for the hide and tallow such thronging to the wicket and such churlish answers and such bare beefbones such a shouldering at the butteryhatch and cellarage and nought to be gained beyond small insufficient single ale or at best with a single straike of malt to counterbalance a double allowance of waterby the mass though my young friend said he while he saw the food disappearing fast under rolands active exertions it is not so to well to lament for former times as to take the advantage of the present else we are like to lose on both sides  so saying adam woodcock drew his chair towards the table unsheathed his knife for every one carried that minister of festive distribution for himself and imitated his young companions example who for the moment had lost his anxiety for the future in the eager satisfaction of an appetite sharpened by youth and abstinence  in truth they made though the materials were sufficiently simple a very respectable meal at the expense of the royal allowance and adam woodcock notwithstanding the deliberate censure which he had passed on the household beer of the palace had taken the fourth deep draught of the black jack ere he remembered him that he had spoken in its dispraise flinging himself jollily and luxuriously back in an old danske elbowchair and looking with careless glee towards the page extending at the same time his right leg and stretching the other easily over it he reminded his companion that he had not yet heard the ballad which he had made for the abbot of unreasons revel and accordingly he struck merrily up with    the pope that pagan full of pride    has blinded us full lang  roland graeme who felt no great delight as may be supposed in the falconers satire considering its subject began to snatch up his mantle and fling it around his shoulders an action which instantly interrupted the ditty of adam woodcock  where the vengeance are you going now he said thou restless boythou hast quicksilver in the veins of thee to a certainty and canst no more abide any douce and sensible communing than a hoodless hawk would keep perched on my wrist  why adam replied the page if you must needs know i am about to take a walk and look at this fair city one may as well be still mewed up in the old castle of the lake if one is to sit the livelong night between four walls and hearken to old ballads  it is a new balladthe lord help thee replied adam and that one of the best that ever was matched with a rousing chorus  be it so said the page i will hear it another day when the rain is dashing against the windows and there is neither steed stamping nor spur jingling nor feather waving in the neighbourhood to mar my marking it well but even now i want to be in the world and to look about me  but the never a stride shall you go without me said the falconer until the regent shall take you whole and sound off my hand and so if you will we may go to the hostelrie of saint michaels and there you will see company enough but through the casement mark you me for as to rambling through the street to seek seytons and leslies and having a dozen holes drilled in your new jacket with rapier and poniard i will yield no way to it  to the hostelrie of saint michaels then with all my heart said the page and they left the palace accordingly rendered to the sentinels at the gate who had now taken their posts for the evening a strict account of their names and business were dismissed through a small wicket of the closebarred portal and soon reached the inn or hostelrie of saint michael which stood in a large courtyard off the main street close under the descent of the caltonhill the place wide waste and uncomfortable resembled rather an eastern caravansary where men found shelter indeed but were obliged to supply themselves with every thing else than one of our modern inns    where not one comfort shall to those be lost   who never ask or never feel the cost  but still to the inexperienced eye of roland graeme the bustle and confusion of this place of public resort furnished excitement and amusement in the large room into which they had rather found their own way than been ushered by mine host travellers and natives of the city entered and departed met and greeted gamed or drank together forming the strongest contrast to the stern and monotonous order and silence with which matters were conducted in the wellordered household of the knight of avenel altercation of every kind from brawling to jesting was going on amongst the groups around them and yet the noise and mingled voices seemed to disturb no one and indeed to be noticed by no others than by those who composed the group to which the speaker belonged  the falconer passed through the apartment to a projecting latticed window which formed a sort of recess from the room itself and having here ensconced himself and his companion he called for some refreshments and a tapster after he had shouted for the twentieth time accommodated him with the remains of a cold capon and a neats tongue together with a pewter stoup of weak french vindepays fetch a stoup of brandywine thou knavewe will be jolly tonight master roland said he when he saw himself thus accommodated and let care come tomorrow  but roland had eaten too lately to enjoy the good cheer and feeling his curiosity much sharper than his appetite he made it his choice to look out of the lattice which overhung a large yard surrounded by the stables of the hostelrie and fed his eyes on the busy sight beneath while adam woodcock after he had compared his companion to the laird of macfarlanes geese who liked their play better than their meat disposed of his time with the aid of cup and trencher occasionally humming the burden of his birthstrangled ballad and beating time to it with his fingers on the little round table in this exercise he was frequently interrupted by the exclamations of his companion as he saw something new in the yard beneath to attract and interest him  it was a busy scene for the number of gentlemen and nobles who were now crowded into the city had filled all spare stables and places of public reception with their horses and military attendants there were some score of yeomen dressing their own or their masters horses in the yard whistling singing laughing and upbraiding each other in a style of wit which the good order of avenel castle rendered strange to roland graemes ears others were busy repairing their own arms or cleaning those of their masters one fellow having just bought a bundle of twenty spears was sitting in a corner employed in painting the white staves of the weapons with yellow and vermillion other lacqueys led large staghounds or wolfdogs of noble race carefully muzzled to prevent accidents to passengers all came and went mixed together and separated under the delighted eye of the page whose imagination had not even conceived a scene so gaily diversified with the objects he had most pleasure in beholding so that he was perpetually breaking the quiet reverie of honest woodcock and the mental progress which he was making in his ditty by exclaiming look here adamlook at the bonny bay horsesaint anthony what a gallant forehand he hath gotand see the goodly gray which yonder fellow in the friezejacket is dressing as awkwardly as if he had never touched aught but a cowi would i were nigh him to teach him his tradeand lo you adam the gay milan armour that the yeoman is scouring all steel and silver like our knights prime suit of which old wingate makes such accountand see to yonder pretty wench adam who comes tripping through them all with her milkpaili warrant me she has had a long walk from the loaning she has a stammel waistcoat like your favourite cicely sunderland master adam  by my hood lad answered the falconer it is well for thee thou wert brought up where grace grew even in the castle of avenel thou wert a wildblood enough but hadst thou been nurtured here within a flightshot of the court thou hadst been the veriest crackhemp of a page that ever wore feather in thy bonnet or steel by thy side truly i wish it may end well with thee  nay but leave thy senseless humming and drumming old adam and come to the window ere thou hast drenched thy senses in the pintpot there see here comes a merry minstrel with his crowd and a wench with him that dances with bells at her ankles and see the yeomen and pages leave their horses and the armour they were cleaning and gather round as is very natural to hear the music come old adam we will thither too  you shall call me cutt if i do go down said adam you are near as good minstrelsy as the stroller can make if you had but the grace to listen to it  but the wench in the stammel waistcoat is stopping too adamby heaven they are going to dance friezejacket wants to dance with stammel waistcoat but she is coy and recusant  then suddenly changing his tone of levity into one of deep interest and surprise he exclaimed queen of heaven what is it that i see and then remained silent  the sage adam woodcock who was in a sort of languid degree amused with the pages exclamations even while he professed to despise them became at length rather desirous to set his tongue once more agoing that he might enjoy the superiority afforded by his own intimate familiarity with all the circumstances which excited in his young companions mind so much wonderment  well then he said at last what is it you do see master roland that you have become mute all of a sudden  roland returned no answer  i say master roland graeme said the falconer it is manners in my country for a man to speak when he is spoken to  roland graeme remained silent  the murrain is in the boy said adam woodcock he has stared out his eyes and talked his tongue to pieces i think  the falconer hastily drank off his can of wine and came to roland who stood like a statue with his eyes eagerly bent on the courtyard though adam woodcock was unable to detect amongst the joyous scenes which it exhibited aught that could deserve such devoted attention  the lad is mazed said the falconer to himself  but roland graeme had good reasons for his surprise though they were not such as he could communicate to his companion  the touch of the old minstrels instrument for he had already begun to play had drawn in several auditors from the street when one entered the gate of the yard whose appearance exclusively arrested the attention of roland graeme he was of his own age or a good deal younger and from his dress and bearing might be of the same rank and calling having all the air of coxcombry and pretension which accorded with a handsome though slight and low figure and an elegant dress in part hid by a large purple cloak as he entered he cast a glance up towards the windows and to his extreme astonishment under the purple velvet bonnet and white feather roland recognized the features so deeply impressed on his memory the bright and clustered tresses the laughing full blue eyes the wellformed eyebrows the nose with the slightest possible inclination to be aquiline the ruby lip of which an arch and halfsuppressed smile seemed the habitual expressionin short the form and face of catherine seyton in mans attire however and mimicking as it seemed not unsuccessfully the bearing of a youthful but forward page  saint george and saint andrew exclaimed the amazed roland graeme to himself was there ever such an audacious queanshe seems a little ashamed of her mummery too for she holds the lap of her cloak to her face and her colour is heightenedbut santa maria how she threads the throng with as firm and bold a step as if she had never tied petticoat round her waistholy saints she holds up her ridingrod as if she would lay it about some of their ears that stand most in her wayby the hand of my father  she bears herself like the very model of pagehoodhey what sure she will not strike friezejacket in earnest but he was not long left in doubt for the lout whom he had before repeatedly noticed standing in the way of the bustling page and maintaining his place with clownish obstinacy or stupidity the advanced ridingrod was without a moments hesitation sharply applied to his shoulders in a manner which made him spring aside rubbing the part of the body which had received so unceremonious a hint that it was in the way of his betters the party injured growled forth an oath or two of indignation and roland graeme began to think of flying down stairs to the assistance of the translated catherine but the laugh of the yard was against friezejacket which indeed had in those days small chance of fair play in a quarrel with velvet and embroidery so that the fellow who was menial in the inn slunk back to finish his task of dressing the bonny gray laughed at by all but most by the wench in the stammel waistcoat his fellowservant who to crown his disgrace had the cruelty to cast an applauding smile upon the author of the injury while with a freedom more like the milkmaid of the town than she of the plains she accosted him withis there any one you want here my pretty gentleman that you seem in such haste  i seek a sprig of a lad said the seeming gallant with a sprig of holly in his cap black hair and black eyes green jacket and the air of a country coxcombi have sought him through every close and alley in the canongate the fiend gore him  why godamercy nun muttered roland graeme much bewildered  i will inquire him presently out for your fair young worship said the wench of the inn  do said the gallant squire and if you bring me to him you shall have a groat tonight and a kiss on sunday when you have on a cleaner kirtle  why godamercy nun again muttered roland this is a note above e la  in a moment after the servant entered the room and ushered in the object of his surprise  while the disguised vestal looked with unabashed brow and bold and rapid glance of her eye through the various parties in the large old room roland graeme who felt an internal awkward sense of bashful confusion which he deemed altogether unworthy of the bold and dashing character to which he aspired determined not to be browbeaten and put down by this singular female but to meet her with a glance of recognition so sly so penetrating so expressively humorous as should show her at once he was in possession of her secret and master of her fate and should compel her to humble herself towards him at least into the look and manner of respectful and deprecating observance  this was extremely well planned but just as roland had called up the knowing glance the suppressed smile the shrewd intelligent look which was to ensure his triumph he encountered the bold firm and steady gaze of his brother or sisterpage who casting on him a falcon glance and recognizing him at once as the object of his search walked up with the most unconcerned look the most free and undaunted composure and hailed him with you sir hollytop i would speak with you  the steady coolness and assurance with which these words were uttered although the voice was the very voice he had heard at the old convent and although the features more nearly resembled those of catharine when seen close than when viewed from a distance produced nevertheless such a confusion in rolands mind that he became uncertain whether he was not still under a mistake from the beginning the knowing shrewdness which should have animated his visage faded into a sheepish bashfulness and the halfsuppressed but most intelligible smile became the senseless giggle of one who laughs to cover his own disorder of ideas  do they understand a scotch tongue in thy country hollytop said this marvellous specimen of metamorphosis i said i would speak with thee  what is your business with my comrade my young chick of the game said adam woodcock willing to step in to his companions assistance though totally at a loss to account for the sudden disappearance of all rolands usual smartness and presence of mind  nothing to you my old cock of the perch replied the gallant go mind your hawks castings i guess by your bag and your gauntlet that you are squire of the body to a sort of kites  he laughed as he spoke and the laugh reminded roland so irresistibly of the hearty fit of risibility in which catherine had indulged at his expense when they first met in the old nunnery that he could scarce help exclaiming catherine seyton by heavenshe checked the exclamation however and only said i think sir we two are not totally strangers to each other  we must have met in our dreams then said the youth and my days are too busy to remember what i think on at nights  or apparently to remember upon one day those whom you may have seen on the preceding eve said roland graeme  the youth in his turn cast on him a look of some surprise as he replied i know no more of what you mean than does the horse i ride onif there be offence in your words you shall find me ready to take it as any lad in lothian  you know well said roland though it pleases you to use the language of a stranger that with you i have no purpose to quarrel  let me do mine errand then and be rid of you said the page step hither this way out of that old leathern fists hearing  they walked into the recess of the window which roland had left upon the youths entrance into the apartment the messenger then turned his back on the company after casting a hasty and sharp glance around to see if they were observed roland did the same and the page in the purple mantle thus addressed him taking at the same time from under his cloak a short but beautifully wrought sword with the hilt and ornaments upon the sheath of silver massively chased and overgildedi bring you this weapon from a friend who gives it you under the solemn condition that you will not unsheath it until you are commanded by your rightful sovereign for your warmth of temper is known and the presumption with which you intrude yourself into the quarrels of others and therefore this is laid upon you as a penance by those who wish you well and whose hand will influence your destiny for good or for evil  this is what i was charged to tell you so if you will give a fair word for a fair sword and pledge your promise with hand and glove good and well and if not i will carry back caliburn to those who sent it  and may i not ask who these are said roland graeme admiring at the same time the beauty of the weapon thus offered him  my commission in no way leads me to answer such a question said he of the purple mantle  but if i am offended said roland may i not draw to defend myself  not this weapon answered the swordbearer but you have your own at command and besides for what do you wear your poniard  for no good said adam woodcock who had now approached close to them and that i can witness as well as any one  stand back fellow said the messenger thou hast an intrusive curious face that will come by a buffet if it is found where it has no concern  a buffet my young master malapert said adam drawing back however best keep down fist or by our lady buffet will beget buffet  be patient adam woodcock said roland graeme and let me pray you fair sir since by such addition you choose for the present to be addressed may i not barely unsheathe this fair weapon in pure simplicity of desire to know whether so fair a hilt and scabbard are matched with a befitting blade  by no manner of means said the messenger at a word you must take it under the promise that you never draw it until you receive the commands of your lawful sovereign or you must leave it alone  under that condition and coming from your friendly hand i accept of the sword said roland taking it from his hand but credit me if we are to work together in any weighty emprise as i am induced to believe some confidence and openness on your part will be necessary to give the right impulse to my zeali press for no more at present it is enough that you understand me  i understand you said the page exhibiting the appearance of unfeigned surprise in his turnrenounce me if i dohere you stand jiggeting and sniggling and looking cunning as if there were some mighty matter of intrigue and common understanding betwixt you and me whom you never set your eyes on before  what said roland graeme will you deny that we have met before  marry that i will in any christian court said the other page  and will you also deny said roland that it was recommended to us to study each others features well that in whatever disguise the time might impose upon us each should recognize in the other the secret agent of a mighty work do not you remember that sister magdalen and dame bridget  the messenger here interrupted him shrugging up his shoulders with a look of compassion bridget and magdalen why this is madness and dreaming hark ye master hollytop your wits are gone on woolgathering comfort yourself with a caudle and thatch your brainsick noddle with a woollen nightcap and so god be with you  as he concluded this polite parting address adam woodcock who was again seated by the table on which stood the now empty can said to him will you drink a cup young man in the way of courtesy now you have done your errand and listen to a good song and without waiting for an answer he commenced his ditty    the pope that pagan full of pride   hath blinded us full lang  it is probable that the good wine had made some innovation in the falconers brain otherwise he would have recollected the danger of introducing any thing like political or polemical pleasantry into a public assemblage at a time when mens minds were in a state of great irritability to do him justice he perceived his error and stopped short so soon as he saw that the word pope had at once interrupted the separate conversations of the various parties which were assembled in the apartment and that many began to draw themselves up bridle look big and prepare to take part in the impending brawl while others more decent and cautious persons hastily paid down their lawing and prepared to leave the place ere bad should come to worse  and to worse it was soon likely to come for no sooner did woodcocks ditty reach the ear of the stranger page than uplifting his ridingrod he exclaimed he who speaks irreverently of the holy father of the church in my presence is the cub of a heretic wolfbitch and i will switch him as i would a mongrelcur  and i will break thy young pate said adam if thou darest to lift a finger to me and then in defiance of the young drawcansirs threats with a stout heart and dauntless accent he again uplifted the stave    the pope that pagan full of pride   hath blinded  but adam was able to proceed no farther being himself unfortunately blinded by a stroke of the impatient youths switch across his eyes enraged at once by the smart and the indignity the falconer started up and darkling as he was for his eyes watered too fast to permit his seeing any thing he would soon have been at close grips with his insolent adversary had not roland graeme contrary to his nature played for once the prudent man and the peacemaker and thrown himself betwixt them imploring woodcocks patience you know not he said with whom you have to doand thou addressing the messenger who stood scornfully laughing at adams rage get thee gone whoever thou art if thou best what i guess thee thou well knowest there are earnest reasons why thou shouldst  thou hast hit it right for once hollytop said the gallant though i guess you drew your bow at a venturehere host let this yeoman have a bottle of wine to wash the smart out of his eyesand there is a french crown for him so saying he threw the piece of money on the table and left the apartment with a quick yet steady pace looking firmly at right and left as if to defy interruption and snapping his fingers at two or three respectable burghers who declaring it was a shame that any one should be suffered to rant and ruffle in defence of the pope were labouring to find the hilts of their swords which had got for the present unhappily entangled in the folds of their cloaks but as the adversary was gone ere any of them had reached his weapon they did not think it necessary to unsheath cold iron but merely observed to each other this is more than masterful violence to see a poor man stricken in the face just for singing a ballad against the whore of babylon if the popes champions are to be bangsters in our very changehouses we shall soon have the old shavelings back again  the provost should look to it said another and have some five or six armed with partisans to come in upon the first whistle to teach these gallants their lesson for look you neighbour lugleather it is not for decent householders like ourselves to be brawling with the godless grooms and pert pages of the nobles that are bred up to little else save bloodshed and blasphemy  for all that neighbour said lugleather i would have curried that youngster as properly as ever i curried a lambs hide had not the hilt of my bilbo been for the instant beyond my grasp and before i could turn my girdle gone was my master  ay said the others the devil go with him and peace abide with usi give my rede neighbours that we pay the lawing and be stepping homeward like brother and brother for old saint giless is tolling curfew and the street grows dangerous at night  with that the good burghers adjusted their cloaks and prepared for their departure while he that seemed the briskest of the three laying his hand on his andrea ferrara observed that they that spoke in the praise of the pope on the highgate of edinburgh had best bring the sword of saint peter to defend them  while the illhumour excited by the insolence of the young aristocrat was thus evaporating in empty menace roland graeme had to control the far more serious indignation of adam woodcock why man it was but a switch across the mazzardblow your nose dry your eyes and you will see all the better for it  by this light which i cannot see said adam woodcock thou hast been a false friend to me young manneither taking up my rightful quarrel nor letting me fight it out myself  fy for shame adam woodcock replied the youth determined to turn the tables on him and become in turn the counsellor of good order and peaceable demeanouri say fy for shamealas that you will speak thus here are you sent with me to prevent my innocent youth getting into snares  i wish your innocent youth were cut short with a halter with all my heart said adam who began to see which way the admonition tended  and instead of setting before me continued roland an example of patience and sobriety becoming the falconer of sir halbert glendinning you quaff me off i know not how many flagons of ale besides a gallon of wine and a full measure of strong waters  it was but one small pottle said poor adam whom consciousness of his own indiscretion now reduced to a merely defensive warfare  it was enough to pottle you handsomely however said the pageand then instead of going to bed to sleep off your liquor must you sit singing your roistering songs about popes and pagans till you have got your eyes almost switched out of your head and but for my interference whom your drunken ingratitude accuses of deserting you yon galliard would have cut your throat for he was whipping out a whinger as broad as my hand and as sharp as a razorand these are lessons for an inexperienced youthoh adam out upon you out upon you  marry amen and with all my heart said adam out upon my folly for expecting any thing but impertinent raillery from a page like thee that if he saw his father in a scrape would laugh at him instead of lending him aid  nay but i will lend you aid said the page still laughing that is i will lend thee aid to thy chamber good adam where thou shalt sleep off wine and ale ire and indignation and awake the next morning with as much fair wit as nature has blessed thee withal only one thing i will warn thee good adam that henceforth and for ever when thou railest at me for being somewhat hot at hand and rather too prompt to out with poniard or so thy admonition shall serve as a prologue to the memorable adventure of the switching of saint michaels  with such condoling expressions he got the crestfallen falconer to his bed and then retired to his own pallet where it was some time ere he could fall asleep if the messenger whom he had seen were really catherine seyton what a masculine virago and termagant must she be and stored with what an inimitable command of insolence and assurancethe brass on her brow would furbish the front of twenty pages and i should know thought roland what that amounts toand yet her features her look her light gait her laughing eye the art with which she disposed the mantle to show no more of her limbs than needs must be seeni am glad she had at least that grace leftthe voice the smileit must have been catherine seyton or the devil in her likeness one thing is good i have silenced the eternal predications of that ass adam woodcock who has set up for being a preacher and a governor over me so soon as he has left the hawks mew behind him  and with this comfortable reflection joined to the happy indifference which youth hath for the events of the morrow roland graeme fell fast asleep     chapter the twentieth     now have you reft me from my staff my guide   who taught my youth as men teach untamed falcons   to use my strength discreetlyi am reft   of comrade and of counsel                                         old play  in the gray of the next mornings dawn there was a loud knocking at the gate of the hostelrie and those without proclaiming that they came in the name of the regent were instantly admitted a moment or two afterwards michael wingthewind stood by the bedside of our travellers  up up he said there is no slumber where murray hath work ado  both sleepers sprung up and began to dress themselves  you old friend said wingthewind to adam woodcock must to horse instantly with this packet to the monks of kennaquhair and with this delivering them as he spoke to the knight of avenel  as much as commanding the monks to annul their election ill warrant me of an abbot quoth adam woodcock as he put the packets into his bag and charging my master to see it doneto hawk at one brother with another is less than fair play methinks  fash not thy beard about it old boy said michael but betake thee to the saddle presently for if these orders are not obeyed there will be bare walls at the kirk of saint marys and it may be at the castle of avenel to boot for i heard my lord of morton loud with the regent and we are at a pass that we cannot stand with him anent trifles  but said adam touching the abbot of unreasonwhat say they to that outbreakan they be shrewishly disposed i were better pitch the packets to satan and take the other side of the border for my bield  oh that was passed over as a jest since there was little harm donebut hark thee adam continued his comrade if there was a dozen vacant abbacies in your road whether of jest or earnest reason or unreason draw thou never one of their mitres over thy browsthe time is not fitting manbesides our maiden longs to clip the neck of a fat churchman  she shall never sheer mine in that capacity said the falconer while he knotted the kerchief in two or three double folds around his sunburnt bullneck calling out at the same time master roland master roland make haste we must back to perch and mew and thank heaven more than our own wit with our bones whole and without a stab in the stomach  nay but said wingthewind the page goes not back with you the regent has other employment for him  saints and sorrows exclaimed the falconermaster roland graeme to remain here and i to return to avenelwhy it cannot bethe child cannot manage himself in this wide world without me and i question if he will stoop to any other whistle than mine own there are times i myself can hardly bring him to my lure  it was at rolands tongues end to say something concerning the occasion they had for using mutually each others prudence but the real anxiety which adam evinced at parting with him took away his disposition to such ungracious raillery the falconer did not altogether escape however for in turning his face towards the lattice his friend michael caught a glimpse of it and exclaimed i prithee adam woodcock what hast thou been doing with these eyes of thine they are swelled to the starting from the socket  nought in the world said he after casting a deprecating glance at roland graeme but the effect of sleeping in this dned truckle without a pillow  why adam woodcock thou must be grown strangely dainty said his old companion i have known thee sleep all night with no better pillow than a bush of ling and start up with the sun as glegg as a falcon and now thine eyes resemble  tush man what signifies how mine eyes look now said adamlet us but roast a crabapple pour a pottle of ale on it and bathe our throats withal thou shalt see a change in me  and thou wilt be in heart to sing thy jolly ballad about the pope said his comrade  ay that i will replied the falconer that is when we have left this quiet town five miles behind us if you will take your hobby and ride so far on my way  nay that i may not said michaeli can but stop to partake your morning draught and see you fairly to horsei will see that they saddle them and toast the crab for thee without loss of time  during his absence the falconer took the page by the handmay i never hood hawk again said the goodnatured fellow if i am not as sorry to part with you as if you were a child of mine own craving pardon for the freedomi cannot tell what makes me love you so much unless it be for the reason that i loved the vicious devil of a brown galloway nag whom my master the knight called satan till master warden changed his name to seyton for he said it was over boldness to call a beast after the king of darkness  and said the page it was over boldness in him i trow to call a vicious brute after a noble family  well proceeded adam seyton or satan i loved that nag over every other horse in the stablethere was no sleeping on his backhe was for ever fidgeting bolting rearing biting kicking and giving you work to do and maybe the measure of your back on the heather to the boot of it all and i think i love you better than any lad in the castle for the selfsame qualities  thanks thanks kind adam i regard myself bound to you for the good estimation in which you hold me  nay interrupt me not said the falconersatan was a good nag but i say i think i shall call the two eyases after you the one roland and the other graeme and while adam woodcock lives be sure you have a friendhere is to thee my dear son  roland most heartily returned the grasp of the hand and woodcock having taken a deep draught continued his farewell speech  there are three things i warn you against roland now that you art to tread this weary world without my experience to assist you in the first place never draw dagger on slight occasionevery mans doublet is not so well stuffed as a certain abbots that you wot of secondly fly not at every pretty girl like a merlin at a thrushyou will not always win a gold chain for your labourand by the way here i return to you your fanfaronakeep it close it is weighty and may benefit you at a pinch more ways than one thirdly and to conclude as our worthy preacher says beware of the pottlepotit has drenched the judgment of wiser men than you i could bring some instances of it but i dare say it needeth not for if you should forget your own mishaps you will scarce fail to remember mineand so farewell my dear son  roland returned his good wishes and failed not to send his humble duty to his kind lady charging the falconer at the same time to express his regret that he should have offended her and his determination so to bear him in the world that she would not be ashamed of the generous protection she had afforded him  the falconer embraced his young friend mounted his stout roundmade trottingnag which the servingman who had attended him held ready at the door and took the road to the southward a sullen and heavy sound echoed from the horses feet as if indicating the sorrow of the goodnatured rider every hooftread seemed to tap upon rolands heart as he heard his comrade withdraw with so little of his usual alert activity and felt that he was once more alone in the world  he was roused from his reverie by michael wingthewind who reminded him that it was necessary they should instantly return to the palace as my lord regent went to the sessions early in the morning they went thither accordingly and wingthewind a favourite old domestic who was admitted nearer to the regents person and privacy than many whose posts were more ostensible soon introduced graeme into a small matted chamber where he had an audience of the present head of the troubled state of scotland the earl of murray was clad in a sadcoloured morninggown with a cap and slippers of the same cloth but even in this easy deshabillé held his sheathed rapier in his hand a precaution which he adopted when receiving strangers rather in compliance with the earnest remonstrances of his friends and partisans than from any personal apprehensions of his own he answered with a silent nod the respectful obeisance of the page and took one or two turns through the small apartment in silence fixing his keen eye on roland as if he wished to penetrate into his very soul at length he broke silence  your name is i think julian graeme  roland graeme my lord not julian replied the page  righti was misled by some trick of my memoryroland graeme from the debateable landroland thou knowest the duties which belong to a ladys service  i should know them my lord replied roland having been bred so near the person of my lady of avenel but i trust never more to practise them as the knight hath promised  be silent young man said the regent i am to speak and you to hear and obey it is necessary that for some space at least you shall again enter into the service of a lady who in rank hath no equal in scotland and this service accomplished i give thee my word as knight and prince that it shall open to you a course of ambition such as may well gratify the aspiring wishes of one whom circumstances entitle to entertain much higher views than thou i will take thee into my household and near to my person or at your own choice i will give you the command of a footcompanyeither is a preferment which the proudest laird in the land might be glad to ensure for a second son  may i presume to ask my lord said roland observing the earl paused for a reply to whom my poor services are in the first place destined  you will be told hereafter said the regent and then as if overcoming some internal reluctance to speak farther himself he added or why should i not myself tell you that you are about to enter into the service of a most illustriousmost unhappy lady into the service of mary of scotland  of the queen my lord said the page unable to suppress his surprise  of her who was the queen said murray with a singular mixture of displeasure and embarrassment in his tone of voice you must be aware young man that her son reigns in her stead  he sighed from an emotion partly natural perhaps and partly assumed  and am i to attend upon her grace in her place of imprisonment my lord again demanded the page with a straightforward and hardy simplicity which somewhat disconcerted the sage and powerful statesman  she is not imprisoned answered murray angrily god forbid she shouldshe is only sequestered from state affairs and from the business of the public until the world be so effectually settled that she may enjoy her natural and uncontrolled freedom without her royal disposition being  exposed to the practices of wicked and designing men it is for this purpose he added that while she is to be furnished as right is with such attendance as may befit her present secluded state it becomes necessary that those placed around her are persons on whose prudence i can have reliance you see therefore you are at once called on to discharge an office most honourable in itself and so to discharge it that you may make a friend of the regent of scotland thou art i have been told a singularly apprehensive youth and i perceive by thy look that thou dost already understand what i would say on this matter in this schedule your particular points of duty are set down at lengthbut the sum required of you is fidelityi mean fidelity to myself and to the state you are therefore to watch every attempt which is made or inclination displayed to open any communication with any of the lords who have become banders in the westwith hamilton seyton with fleming or the like it is true that my gracious sister reflecting upon the ill chances that have happened to the state of this poor kingdom from evil counsellors who have abused her royal nature in time past hath determined to sequestrate herself from state affairs in future but it is our duty as acting for and in the name of our infant nephew to guard against the evils which may arise from any mutation or vacillation in her royal resolutions wherefore it will be thy duty to watch and report to our lady mother whose guest our sister is for the present whatever may infer a disposition to withdraw her person from the place of security in which she is lodged or to open communication with those without if however your observation should detect any thing of weight and which may exceed mere suspicion fail not to send notice by an especial messenger to me directly and this ring shall be thy warrant to order horse and men on such serviceand now begone if there be half the wit in thy head that there is apprehension in thy look thou fully comprehendest all that i would sayserve me faithfully and sure as i am belted earl thy reward shall be great  roland graeme made an obeisance and was about to depart  the earl signed to him to remain i have trusted thee deeply he said young man for thou art the only one of her suite who has been sent to her by my own recommendation her gentlewomen are of her own nominationit were too hard to have barred her that privilege though some there were who reckoned it inconsistent with sure policy  thou art young and handsome mingle in their follies and see they cover not deeper designs under the appearance of female levityif they do mine do thou countermine for the rest bear all decorum and respect to the person of thy mistressshe is a princess though a most unhappy one and hath been a queen though now alas no longer such pay therefore to her all honour and respect consistent with thy fidelity to the king and meand now farewellyet stayyou travel with lord lindesay a man of the old world rough and honest though untaught see that thou offend him not for he is not patient of raillery and thou i have heard art a crackhalter this he said with a smile then added i could have wished the lord lindesays mission had been intrusted to some other and more gentle noble  and wherefore should you wish that my lord said morton who even then entered the apartment the council have decided for the bestwe have had but too many proofs of this ladys stubbornness of mind and the oak that resists the sharp steel axe must be riven with the rugged iron wedgeand this is to be her pagemy lord regent hath doubtless instructed you young man how you shall guide yourself in these matters i will add but a little hint on my part you are going to the castle of a douglas where treachery never thrivesthe first moment of suspicion will be the last of your life my kinsman william douglas understands no raillery and if he once have cause to think you false you will waver in the wind from the castle battlements ere the sun set upon his angerand is the lady to have an almoner withal  occasionally douglas said the regent it were hard to deny the spiritual consolation which she thinks essential to her salvation  you are ever too soft hearted my lordwhat a false priest to communicate her lamentations not only to our unfriends in scotland but to the guises to rome to spain and i know not where  fear not said the regent we will take such order that no treachery shall happen  look to it then said morton you know my mind respecting the wench you have consented she shall receive as a waitingwomanone of a family which of all others has ever been devoted to her and inimical to us had we not been wary she would have been purveyed of a page as much to her purpose as her waitingdamsel i hear a rumour that an old mad romish pilgrimer who passes for at least half a saint among them was employed to find a fit subject  we have escaped that danger at least said murray and converted it into a point of advantage by sending this boy of glendinningsand for her waitingdamsel you cannot grudge her one poor maiden instead of her four noble marys and all their silken train  i care not so much for the waitingmaiden said morton but i cannot brook the almoneri think priests of all persuasions are much like each otherhere is john knox who made such a noble pullerdown is ambitious of becoming a setterup and a founder of schools and colleges out of the abbey lands and bishops rents and other spoils of rome which the nobility of scotland have won with their sword and bow and with which he would endow new hives to sing the old drone  john is a man of god said the regent and his scheme is a devout imagination  the sedate smile with which this was spoken left it impossible to conjecture whether the words were meant in approbation or in derision of the plan of the scottish reformer turning then to roland graeme as if he thought he had been long enough a witness of this conversation he bade him get him presently to horse since my lord of lindesay was already mounted the page made his reverence and left the apartment  guided by michael wingthewind he found his horse ready saddled and prepared for the journey in front of the palace porch where hovered about a score of menatarms whose leader showed no small symptoms of surly impatience  is this the jackanape page for whom we have waited thus long said he to wingthewindand my lord ruthven will reach the castle long before us  michael assented and added that the boy had been detained by the regent to receive some parting instructions the leader made an inarticulate sound in his throat expressive of sullen acquiescence and calling to one of his domestic attendants edward said he take the gallant into your charge and let him speak with no one else  he then addressed by the title of sir robert an elderly and respectablelooking gentleman the only one of the party who seemed above the rank of a retainer or domestic and observed that they must get to horse with all speed  during this discourse and while they were riding slowly along the street of the suburb roland had time to examine more accurately the looks and figure of the baron who was at their head  lord lindesay of the byres was rather touched than stricken with years his upright stature and strong limbs still showed him fully equal to all the exertions and fatigues of war his thick eyebrows now partially grizzled lowered over large eyes full of dark fire which seemed yet darker from the uncommon depth at which they were set in his head his features naturally strong and harsh had their sternness exaggerated by one or two scars received in battle these features naturally calculated to express the harsher passions were shaded by an open steel cap with a projecting front but having no visor over the gorget of which fell the black and grizzled beard of the grim old baron and totally hid the lower part of his face the rest of his dress was a loose buffcoat which had once been lined with silk and adorned with embroidery but which seemed much stained with travel and damaged with cuts received probably in battle it covered a corslet which had once been of polished steel fairly gilded but was now somewhat injured with rust a sword of antique make and uncommon size framed to be wielded with both hands a kind of weapon which was then beginning to go out of use hung from his neck in a baldrick and was so disposed as to traverse his whole person the huge hilt appearing over his left shoulder and the point reaching wellnigh to the right heel and jarring against his spur as he walked this unwieldy weapon could only be unsheathed by pulling the handle over the left shoulderfor no human arm was long enough to draw it in the usual manner the whole equipment was that of a rude warrior negligent of his exterior even to misanthropical sullenness and the short harsh haughty tone which he used towards his attendants belonged to the same unpolished character  the personage who rode with lord lindesay at the head of the party was an absolute contrast to him in manner form and features his thin and silky hair was already white though he seemed not above fortyfive or fifty years old his tone of voice was soft and insinuatinghis form thin spare and bent by an habitual stoop his pale cheek was expressive of shrewdness and intelligencehis eye was quick though placid and his whole demeanour mild and conciliatory he rode an ambling nag such as were used by ladies clergymen or others of peaceful professionswore a riding habit of black velvet with a cap and feather of the same hue fastened up by a golden medaland for show and as a mark of rank rather than for use carried a walkingsword as the short light rapiers were called without any other arms offensive or defensive  the party had now quitted the town and proceeded at a steady trot towards the westas they prosecuted their journey roland graeme would gladly have learned something of its purpose and tendency but the countenance of the personage next to whom he had been placed in the train discouraged all approach to familiarity the baron himself did not look more grim and inaccessible than his feudal retainer whose grisly beard fell over his mouth like the portcullis before the gate of a castle as if for the purpose of preventing the escape of any word of which absolute necessity did not demand the utterance the rest of the train seemed under the same taciturn influence and journeyed on without a word being exchanged amongst themmore like a troop of carthusian friars than a party of military retainers roland graeme was surprised at this extremity of discipline for even in the household of the knight of avenel though somewhat distinguished for the accuracy with which decorum was enforced a journey was a period of license during which jest and song and every thing within the limits of becoming mirth and pastime were freely permitted this unusual silence was however so far acceptable that it gave him time to bring any shadow of judgment which he possessed to council on his own situation and prospects which would have appeared to any reasonable person in the highest degree dangerous and perplexing  it was quite evident that he had through various circumstances not under his own control formed contradictory connexions with both the contending factions by whose strife the kingdom was distracted without being properly an adherent of either it seemed also clear that the same situation in the household of the deposed queen to which he was now promoted by the influence of the regent had been destined to him by his enthusiastic grandmother magdalen graeme for on this subject the words which morton had dropped had been a ray of light yet it was no less clear that these two persons the one the declared enemy the other the enthusiastic votary of the catholic religionthe one at the head of the kings new government the other who regarded that government as a criminal usurpationmust have required and expected very different services from the individual whom they had thus united in recommending it required very little reflection to foresee that these contradictory claims on his services might speedily place him in a situation where his honour as well as his life might be endangered but it was not in roland graemes nature to anticipate evil before it came or to prepare to combat difficulties before they arrived i will see this beautiful and unfortunate mary stewart said he of whom we have heard so much and then there will be time enough to determine whether i will be kingsman or queensman none of them can say i have given word or promise to either of their factions for they have led me up and down like a blind billy without giving me any light into what i was to do but it was lucky that grim douglas came into the regents closet this morning otherwise i had never got free of him without plighting my troth to do all the earl would have me which seemed after all but foul play to the poor imprisoned lady to place her page as an espial on her  skipping thus lightly over a matter of such consequence the thoughts of the harebrained boy went a woolgathering after more agreeable topics now he admired the gothic towers of barnbougle rising from the seabeaten rock and overlooking one of the most glorious landscapes in scotlandand now he began to consider what notable sport for the hounds and the hawks must be afforded by the variegated ground over which they travelledand now he compared the steady and dull trot at which they were then prosecuting their journey with the delight of sweeping over hill and dale in pursuit of his favourite sports as under the influence of these joyous recollections he gave his horse the spur and made him execute a gambade he instantly incurred the censure of his grave neighbour who hinted to him to keep the pace and move quietly and in order unless he wished such notice to be taken of his eccentric movements as was likely to be very displeasing to him  the rebuke and the restraint under which the youth now found himself brought back to his recollection his late goodhumoured and accommodating associate and guide adam woodcock and from that topic his imagination made a short flight to avenel castle to the quiet and unconfined life of its inhabitants the goodness of his early protectress not forgetting the denizens of its stables kennels and hawkmews in a brief space all these subjects of meditation gave way to the resemblance of that riddle of womankind catherine seyton who appeared before the eye of his mindnow in her female form now in her male attirenow in both at oncelike some strange dream which presents to us the same individual under two different characters at the same instant her mysterious present also recurred to his recollectionthe sword which he now wore at his side and which he was not to draw save by command of his legitimate sovereign  but the key of this mystery he judged he was likely to find in the issue of his present journey  with such thoughts passing through his mind roland graeme accompanied the party of lord lindesay to the queensferry which they passed in vessels that lay in readiness for them they encountered no adventure whatever in their passage excepting one horse being lamed in getting into the boat an accident very common on such occasions until a few years ago when the ferry was completely regulated what was more peculiarly characteristic of the olden age was the discharge of a culverin at the party from the battlements of the old castle of rosythe on the north side of the ferry the lord of which happened to have some public or private quarrel with the lord lindesay and took this mode of expressing his resentment the insult however as it was harmless remained unnoticed and unavenged nor did any thing else occur worth notice until the band had come where lochleven spread its magnificent sheet of waters to the beams of a bright summers sun  the ancient castle which occupies an island nearly in the centre of the lake recalled to the page that of avenel in which he had been nurtured but the lake was much larger and adorned with several islets besides that on which the fortress was situated and instead of being embosomed in hills like that of avenel had upon the southern side only a splendid mountainous screen being the descent of one of the lomond hills and on the other was surrounded by the extensive and fertile plain of kinross roland graeme looked with some degree of dismay on the watergirdled fortress which then as now consisted only of one large donjonkeep surrounded with a courtyard with two round flankingtowers at the angles which contained within its circuit some other buildings of inferior importance a few old trees clustered together near the castle gave some relief to the air of desolate seclusion but yet the page while he gazed upon a building so sequestrated could not but feel for the situation of a captive princess doomed to dwell there as well as for his own i must have been born he thought under the star that presides over ladies and lakes of water for i cannot by any means escape from the service of the one or from dwelling in the other but if they allow me not the fair freedom of my sport and exercise they shall find it as hard to confine a wilddrake as a youth who can swim like one  the band had now reached the edge of the water and one of the party advancing displayed lord lindesays pennon waving it repeatedly to and fro while that baron himself blew a clamorous blast on his bugle a banner was presently displayed from the roof of the castle in reply to these signals and one or two figures were seen busied as if unmooring a boat which lay close to the islet  it will be some time ere they can reach us with the boat said the companion of lord lindesay should we not do well to proceed to the town and array ourselves in some better order ere we appear before  you may do as you list sir robert replied lindesay i have neither time nor temper to waste on such vanities she has cost me many a hard ride and must not now take offence at the threadbare cloak and soiled doublet that i am arrayed in it is the livery to which she has brought all scotland  do not speak so harshly said sir robert if she hath done wrong she hath dearly abied it and in losing all real power one would not deprive her of the little external homage due at once to a lady and a princess  i say to you once more sir robert melville replied lindesay do as you willfor me i am now too old to dink myself as a gallant to grace the bower of dames  the bower of dames my lord said melville looking at the rude old toweris it yon dark and grated castle the prison of a captive queen to which you give so gay a name  name it as you list replied lindesay had the regent desired to send an envoy capable to speak to a captive queen there are many gallants in his court who would have courted the occasion to make speeches out of amadis of gaul or the mirror of knighthood but when he sent blunt old lindesay he knew he would speak to a misguided woman as her former misdoings and her present state render necessary i sought not this employmentit has been thrust upon me and i will not cumber myself with more form in the discharge of it than needs must be tacked to such an occupation  so saying lord lindesay threw himself from horseback and wrapping his ridingcloak around him lay down at lazy length upon the sward to await the arrival of the boat which was now seen rowing from the castle towards the shore sir robert melville who had also dismounted walked at short turns to and fro upon the bank his arms crossed on his breast often looking to the castle and displaying in his countenance a mixture of sorrow and of anxiety the rest of the party sate like statues on horseback without moving so much as the points of their lances which they held upright in the air  as soon as the boat approached a rude quay or landingplace near to which they had stationed themselves lord lindesay started up from his recumbent posture and asked the person who steered why he had not brought a larger boat with him to transport his retinue  so please you replied the boatman because it is the order of our lady that we bring not to the castle more than four persons  thy lady is a wise woman said lindesay to suspect me of treacheryor had i intended it what was to hinder us from throwing you and your comrades into the lake and filling the boat with my own fellows  the steersman on hearing this made a hasty signal to his men to back their oars and hold off from the shore which they were approaching  why thou ass said lindesay thou didst not think that i meant thy fools head serious harm hark thee friendwith fewer than three servants i will go no whithersir robert melville will require at least the attendance of one domestic and it will be at your peril and your ladys to refuse us admission come hither as we are on matters of great national concern  the steersman answered with firmness but with great civility of expression that his orders were positive to bring no more than four into the island but he offered to row back to obtain a revisal of his orders  do so my friend said sir robert melville after he had in vain endeavoured to persuade his stubborn companion to consent to a temporary abatement of his train row back to the castle sith it will be no better and obtain thy ladys orders to transport the lord lindesay myself and our retinue hither  and hearken said lord lindesay take with you this page who comes as an attendant on your ladys guestdismount sirrah said he addressing roland and embark with them in that boat  and what is to become of my horse said graeme i am answerable for him to my master  i will relieve you of the charge said lindesay thou wilt have little enough to do with horse saddle or bridle for ten years to comethou mayst take the halter an thou wiltit may stand thee in a turn  if i thought so said rolandbut he was interrupted by sir robert melville who said to him goodhumouredly dispute it not young friendresistance can do no good but may well run thee into danger  roland graeme felt the justice of what he said and though neither delighted with the matter or manner of lindesays address deemed it best to submit to necessity and to embark without farther remonstrance the men plied their oars the quay with the party of horse stationed near it receded from the pages eyesthe castle and the islet seemed to draw near in the same proportion and in a brief space he landed under the shadow of a huge old tree which overhung the landing place the steersman and graeme leaped ashore the boatmen remained lying on their oars ready for farther service     chapter the twentyfirst     could valour aught avail or peoples love     france had not wept navarres brave henry slain   if wit or beauty could compassion move     the rose of scotland had not wept in vain            elegy in a royal mausoleum lewis  at the gate of the courtyard of lochleven appeared the stately form of the lady lochleven a female whose early charms had captivated james v by whom she became mother of the celebrated regent murray as she was of noble birth being a daughter of the house of mar and of great beauty her intimacy with james did not prevent her being afterwards sought in honourable marriage by many gallants of the time among whom she had preferred sir william douglas of lochleven but well has it been said    our pleasant vices   are made the whips to scourge us  the station which the lady of lochleven now held as the wife of a man of high rank and interest and the mother of a lawful family did not prevent her nourishing a painful sense of degradation even while she was proud of the talents the power and the station of her son now prime ruler of the state but still a pledge of her illicit intercourse had james done to her she said in her secret heart the justice he owed her she had seen in her son as a source of unmixed delight and of unchastened pride the lawful monarch of scotland and one of the ablest who ever swayed the sceptre the house of mar not inferior in antiquity or grandeur to that of drummond would then have also boasted a queen among its daughters and escaped the stain attached to female frailty even when it has a royal lover for its apology while such feelings preyed on a bosom naturally proud and severe they had a corresponding effect on her countenance where with the remains of great beauty were mingled traits of inward discontent and peevish melancholy it perhaps contributed to increase this habitual temperament that the lady lochleven had adopted uncommonly rigid and severe views of religion imitating in her ideas of reformed faith the very worst errors of the catholics in limiting the benefit of the gospel to those who profess their own speculative tenets  in every respect the unfortunate queen mary now the compulsory guest or rather prisoner of this sullen lady was obnoxious to her hostess lady lochleven disliked her as the daughter of mary of guise the legal possessor of those rights over jamess heart and hand of which she conceived herself to have been injuriously deprived and yet more so as the professor of a religion which she detested worse than paganism  such was the dame who with stately mien and sharp yet handsome features shrouded by her black velvet coif interrogated the domestic who steered her barge to the shore what had become of lindesay and sir robert melville the man related what had passed and she smiled scornfully as she replied fools must be flattered not foughten withrow backmake thy excuse as thou canstsay lord ruthven hath already reached this castle and that he is impatient for lord lindesays presence away with thee randalyet staywhat galopin is that thou hast brought hither  so please you my lady he is the page who is to wait upon  ay the new male minion said the lady lochleven the female attendant arrived yesterday i shall have a wellordered house with this lady and her retinue but i trust they will soon find some others to undertake such a charge begone randaland you to roland graeme follow me to the garden  she led the way with a slow and stately step to the small garden which enclosed by a stone wall ornamented with statues and an artificial fountain in the centre extended its dull parterres on the side of the courtyard with which it communicated by a low and arched portal within the narrow circuit of its formal and limited walks mary stewart was now learning to perform the weary part of a prisoner which with little interval she was doomed to sustain during the remainder of her life she was followed in her slow and melancholy exercise by two female attendants but in the first glance which roland graeme bestowed upon one so illustrious by birth so distinguished by her beauty accomplishments and misfortunes he was sensible of the presence of no other than the unhappy queen of scotland  her face her form have been so deeply impressed upon the imagination that even at the distance of nearly three centuries it is unnecessary to remind the most ignorant and uninformed reader of the striking traits which characterize that remarkable countenance which seems at once to combine our ideas of the majestic the pleasing and the brilliant leaving us to doubt whether they express most happily the queen the beauty or the accomplished woman who is there that at the very mention of mary stewarts name has not her countenance before him familiar as that of the mistress of his youth or the favourite daughter of his advanced age  even those who feel themselves compelled to believe all or much of what her enemies laid to her charge cannot think without a sigh upon a countenance expressive of anything rather than the foul crimes with which she was charged when living and which still continue to shade if not to blacken her memory that brow so truly open and regalthose eyebrows so regularly graceful which yet were saved from the charge of regular insipidity by the beautiful effect of the hazel eyes which they overarched and which seem to utter a thousand historiesthe nose with all its grecian precision of outlinethe mouth so well proportioned so sweetly formed as if designed to speak nothing but what was delightful to hearthe dimpled chinthe stately swanlike neck form a countenance the like of which we know not to have existed in any other character moving in that class of life where the actresses as well as the actors command general and undivided attention it is in vain to say that the portraits which exist of this remarkable woman are not like each other for amidst their discrepancy each possesses general features which the eye at once acknowledges as peculiar to the vision which our imagination has raised while we read her history for the first time and which has been impressed upon it by the numerous prints and pictures which we have seen indeed we cannot look on the worst of them however deficient in point of execution without saying that it is meant for queen mary and no small instance it is of the power of beauty that her charms should have remained the subject not merely of admiration but of warm and chivalrous interest after the lapse of such a length of time we know that by far the most acute of those who in latter days have adopted the unfavourable view of marys character longed like the executioner before his dreadful task was performed to kiss the fair hand of her on whom he was about to perform so horrible a duty  dressed then in a deep mourning robe and with all those charms of face shape and manner with which faithful tradition has made each reader familiar mary stewart advanced to meet the lady of lochleven who on her part endeavoured to conceal dislike and apprehension under the appearance of respectful indifference the truth was that she had experienced repeatedly the queens superiority in that species of disguised yet cutting sarcasm with which women can successfully avenge themselves for real and substantial injuries it may be well doubted whether this talent was not as fatal to its possessor as the many others enjoyed by that highly gifted but most unhappy female for while it often afforded her a momentary triumph over her keepers it failed not to exasperate their resentment and the satire and sarcasm in which she had indulged were frequently retaliated by the deep and bitter hardships which they had the power of inflicting it is well known that her death was at length hastened by a letter which she wrote to queen elizabeth in which she treated her jealous rival and the countess of shrewsbury with the keenest irony and ridicule  as the ladies met together the queen said bending her head at the same time in return to the obeisance of the lady lochleven we are this day fortunatewe enjoy the company of our amiable hostess at an unusual hour and during a period which we have hitherto been permitted to give to our private exercise but our good hostess knows well she has at all times access to our presence and need not observe the useless ceremony of requiring our permission  i am sorry my presence is deemed an intrusion by your grace said the lady of lochleven i came but to announce the arrival of an addition to your train motioning with her hand towards roland graeme a circumstance to which ladies are seldom indifferent  oh i crave your ladyships pardon and am bent to the earth with obligations for the kindness of my noblesor my sovereigns shall i call themwho have permitted me such a respectable addition to my personal retinue  they have indeed studied madam said the lady of lochleven to show their kindness towards your gracesomething at the risk perhaps of sound policy and i trust their doings will not be misconstrued  impossible said the queen the bounty which permits the daughter of so many kings and who yet is queen of the realm the attendance of two waitingwomen and a boy is a grace which mary stewart can never sufficiently acknowledge why my train will be equal to that of any country dame in this your kingdom of fife saving but the lack of a gentlemanusher and a pair or two of bluecoated servingmen but i must not forget in my selfish joy the additional trouble and charges to which this magnificent augmentation of our train will put our kind hostess and the whole house of lochleven it is this prudent anxiety i am aware which clouds your brows my worthy lady but be of good cheer the crown of scotland has many a fair manor and your affectionate son and my no less affectionate brother will endow the good knight your husband with the best of them ere mary should be dismissed from this hospitable castle from your ladyships lack of means to support the charges  the douglasses of lochleven madam answered the lady have known for ages how to discharge their duty to the state without looking for reward even when the task was both irksome and dangerous  nay but my dear lochleven said the queen you are over scrupulousi pray you accept of a goodly manor what should support the queen of scotland in this her princely court saving her own crownlandsand who should minister to the wants of a mother save an affectionate son like the earl of murray who possesses so wonderfully both the power and inclinationor said you it was the danger of the task which clouded your smooth and hospitable browno doubt a page is a formidable addition to my bodyguard of females and i bethink me it must have been for that reason that my lord of lindesay refused even now to venture within the reach of a force so formidable without being attended by a competent retinue  the lady lochleven started and looked something surprised and mary suddenly changing her manner from the smooth ironical affectation of mildness to an accent of austere command and drawing up at the same time her fine person said with the full majesty of her rank yes lady of lochleven i know that ruthven is already in the castle and that lindesay waits on the bank the return of your barge to bring him hither along with sir robert melville for what purpose do these nobles comeand why am i not in ordinary decency apprised of their arrival  their purpose madam replied the lady of lochleven they must themselves explainbut a formal annunciation were needless where your grace hath attendants who can play the espial so well  alas poor fleming said the queen turning to the elder of the female attendants thou wilt be tried condemned and gibbeted for a spy in the garrison because thou didst chance to cross the great hall while my good lady of lochleven was parleying at the full pitch of her voice with her pilot randal put black wool in thy ears girl as you value the wearing of them longer remember in the castle of lochleven ears and tongues are matters not of use but for show merely our good hostess can hear as well as speak for us all we excuse your farther attendance my lady hostess she said once more addressing the object of her resentment and retire to prepare for an interview with our rebel lords we will use the antechamber of our sleeping apartment as our hall of audience you young man she proceeded addressing roland graeme and at once softening the ironical sharpness of her manner into goodhumoured raillery you who are all our male attendance from our lord high chamberlain down to our least galopin follow us to prepare our court  she turned and walked slowly towards the castle the lady of lochleven folded her arms and smiled in bitter resentment as she watched her retiring steps  the whole male attendance she muttered repeating the queens last words and well for thee had it been had thy train never been larger then turning to roland in whose way she had stood while making this pause she made room for him to pass saying at the same time art thou already eavesdropping follow thy mistress minion and if thou wilt tell her what i have now said  roland graeme hastened after his royal mistress and her attendants who had just entered a posterngate communicating betwixt the castle and the small garden they ascended a windingstair as high as the second story which was in a great measure occupied by a suite of three rooms opening into each other and assigned as the dwelling of the captive princess  the outermost was a small hall or anteroom within which opened a large parlour and from that again the queens bedroom another small apartment which opened into the same parlour contained the beds of the gentlewomen in waiting  roland graeme stopped as became his station in the outermost of these apartments there to await such orders as might be communicated to him from the grated window of the room he saw lindesay melville and their followers disembark and observed that they were met at the castle gate by a third noble to whom lindesay exclaimed in his loud harsh voice my lord of ruthven you have the start of us  at this instant the pages attention was called to a burst of hysterical sobs from the inner apartment and to the hurried ejaculations of the terrified females which led him almost instantly to hasten to their assistance when he entered he saw that the queen had thrown herself into the large chair which stood nearest the door and was sobbing for breath in a strong fit of hysterical affection the elder female supported her in her arms while the younger bathed her face with water and with tears alternately  hasten young man said the elder lady in alarm flycall in assistanceshe is swooning  but the queen ejaculated in a faint and broken voice stir not i charge youcall no one to witnessi am betteri shall recover instantly and indeed with an effort which seemed like that of one struggling for life she sate up in her chair and endeavoured to resume her composure while her features yet trembled with the violent emotion of body and mind which she had undergone i am ashamed of my weakness girls she said taking the hands of her attendants but it is overand i am mary stewart once more the savage tone of that mans voicemy knowledge of his insolence the name which he namedthe purpose for which they comemay excuse a moments weakness and it shall be a moments only she snatched from her head the curch or cap which had been disordered during her hysterical agony shook down the thick clustered tresses of dark brown which had been before veiled under itand drawing her slender fingers across the labyrinth which they formed she arose from the chair and stood like the inspired image of a grecian prophetess in a mood which partook at once of sorrow and pride of smiles and of tears we are ill appointed she said to meet our rebel subjects but as far as we may we will strive to present ourselves as becomes their queen follow me my maidens she said what says thy favourite song my fleming    my maids come to my dressingbower   and deck my nutbrown hair   whereer ye laid a plait before   look ye lay ten times mair  alas she added when she had repeated with a smile these lines of an old ballad violence has already robbed me of the ordinary decorations of my rank and the few that nature gave me have been destroyed by sorrow and by fear yet while she spoke thus she again let her slender fingers stray through the wilderness of the beautiful tresses which veiled her kingly neck and swelling bosom as if in her agony of mind she had not altogether lost the consciousness of her unrivalled charms roland graeme on whose youth inexperience and ardent sense of what was dignified and lovely the demeanour of so fair and highborn a lady wrought like the charm of a magician stood rooted to the spot with surprise and interest longing to hazard his life in a quarrel so fair as that which mary stewarts must needs be she had been bred in franceshe was possessed of the most distinguished beautyshe had reigned a queen and a scottish queen to whom knowledge of character was as essential as the use of vital air in all these capacities mary was of all women on the earth most alert at perceiving and using the advantages which her charms gave her over almost all who came within the sphere of their influence she cast on roland a glance which might have melted a heart of stone my poor boy she said with a feeling partly real partly politic thou art a stranger to ussent to this doleful captivity from the society of some tender mother or sister or maiden with whom you had freedom to tread a gay measure round the maypole i grieve for you but you are the only male in my limited householdwilt thou obey my orders  to the death madam said graeme in a determined tone  then keep the door of mine apartment said the queen keep it till they offer actual violence or till we shall be fitly arrayed to receive these intrusive visiters  i will defend it till they pass over my body said roland graeme any hesitation which he had felt concerning the line of conduct he ought to pursue being completely swept away by the impulse of the moment  not so my good youth answered mary not so i command if i have one faithful subject beside me much need god wot i have to care for his safety resist them but till they are put to the shame of using actual violence and then give way i charge you remember my commands and with a smile expressive at once of favour and of authority she turned from him and followed by her attendants entered the bedroom  the youngest paused for half a second ere she followed her companion and made a signal to roland graeme with her hand he had been already long aware that this was catherine seytona circumstance which could not much surprise a youth of quick intellects who recollected the sort of mysterious discourse which had passed betwixt the two matrons at the deserted nunnery and on which his meeting with catherine in this place seemed to cast so much light yet such was the engrossing effect of marys presence that it surmounted for the moment even the feelings of a youthful lover and it was not until catherine seyton had disappeared that roland began to consider in what relation they were to stand to each other she held up her hand to me in a commanding manner he thought perhaps she wanted to confirm my purpose for the execution of the queens commands for i think she could scarce purpose to scare me with the sort of discipline which she administered to the groom in the friezejacket and to poor adam woodcock but we will see to that anon meantime let us do justice to the trust reposed in us by this unhappy queen i think my lord of murray will himself own that it is the duty of a faithful page to defend his lady against intrusion on her privacy  accordingly he stepped to the little vestibule made fast with lock and bar the door which opened from thence to the large staircase and then sat himself down to attend the result he had not long to waita rude and strong hand first essayed to lift the latch then pushed and shook the door with violence and when it resisted his attempt to open it exclaimed undo the door there you within  why and at whose command said the page am i to undo the door of the apartments of the queen of scotland  another vain attempt which made hinge and bolt jingle showed that the impatient applicant without would willingly have entered altogether regardless of his challenge but at length an answer was returned  undo the door on your perilthe lord lindesay comes to speak with the lady mary of scotland  the lord lindesay as a scottish noble answered the page must await his sovereigns leisure  an earnest altercation ensued amongst those without in which roland distinguished the remarkable harsh voice of lindesay in reply to sir robert melville who appeared to have been using some soothing languageno  no no i tell thee no i will place a petard against the door rather than be baulked by a profligate woman and bearded by an insolent footboy  yet at least said melville let me try fair means in the first instance violence to a lady would stain your scutcheon for ever or await till my lord ruthven comes  i will await no longer said lindesay it is high time the business were done and we on our return to the council but thou mayest try thy fair play as thou callest it while i cause my train to prepare the petard i came hither provided with as good gunpowder as blew up the kirk of field  for gods sake be patient said melville and approaching the door he said as speaking to those within let the queen know that i her faithful servant robert melville do entreat her for her own sake and to prevent worse consequences that she will undo the door and admit lord lindesay who brings a mission from the council of state  i will do your errand to the queen said the page and report to you her answer  he went to the door of the bedchamber and tapping against it gently it was opened by the elderly lady to whom he communicated his errand and returned with directions from the queen to admit sir robert melville and lord lindesay roland graeme returned to the vestibule and opened the door accordingly into which the lord lindesay strode with the air of a soldier who has fought his way into a conquered fortress while melville deeply dejected followed him more slowly  i draw you to witness and to record said the page to this last that save for the especial commands of the queen i would have made good the entrance with my best strength and my best blood against all scotland  be silent young man said melville in a tone of grave rebuke add not brands to firethis is no time to make a flourish of thy boyish chivalry  she has not appeared even yet said lindesay who had now reached the midst of the parlour or audienceroom how call you this trifling  patience my lord replied sir robert time presses notand lord ruthven hath not as yet descended  at this moment the door of the inner apartment opened and queen mary presented herself advancing with an air of peculiar grace and majesty and seeming totally unruffled either by the visit or by the rude manner in which it had been enforced her dress was a robe of black velvet a small ruff open in front gave a full view of her beautifully formed chin and neck but veiled the bosom on her head she wore a small cap of lace and a transparent white veil hung from her shoulders over the long black robe in large loose folds so that it could be drawn at pleasure over the face and person she wore a cross of gold around her neck and had her rosary of gold and ebony hanging from her girdle she was closely followed by her two ladies who remained standing behind her during the conference even lord lindesay though the rudest noble of that rude age was surprised into something like respect by the unconcerned and majestic mien of her whom he had expected to find frantic with impotent passion or dissolved in useless and vain sorrow or overwhelmed with the fears likely in such a situation to assail fallen royalty  we fear we have detained you my lord of lindesay said the queen while she curtsied with dignity in answer to his reluctant obeisance but a female does not willingly receive her visiters without some minutes spent at the toilette men my lord are less dependant on such ceremonies  lord lindesay casting his eye down on his own travelstained and disordered dress muttered something of a hasty journey and the queen paid her greeting to sir robert melville with courtesy and even as it seemed with kindness there was then a dead pause during which lindesay looked towards the door as if expecting with impatience the colleague of their embassy the queen alone was entirely unembarrassed and as if to break the silence she addressed lord lindesay with a glance at the large and cumbrous sword which he wore as already mentioned hanging from his neck  you have there a trusty and a weighty travelling companion my lord i trust you expected to meet with no enemy here against whom such a formidable weapon could be necessary it is methinks somewhat a singular ornament for a court though i am as i well need to be too much of a stuart to fear a sword  it is not the first time madam replied lindesay bringing round the weapon so as to rest its point on the ground and leaning one hand on the huge crosshandle it is not the first time that this weapon has intruded itself into the presence of the house of stewart  possibly my lord replied the queen it may have done service to my ancestorsyour ancestors were men of loyalty  ay madam replied he service it hath done but such as kings love neither to acknowledge nor to reward it was the service which the knife renders to the tree when trimming it to the quick and depriving it of the superfluous growth of rank and unfruitful suckers which rob it of nourishment  you talk riddles my lord said mary i will hope the explanation carries nothing insulting with it  you shall judge madam answered lindesay with this good sword was archibald douglas earl of angus girded on the memorable day when he acquired the name of bellthecat for dragging from the presence of your great grandfather the third james of the race a crew of minions flatterers and favourites whom he hanged over the bridge of lauder as a warning to such reptiles how they approach a scottish throne with this same weapon the same inflexible champion of scottish honour and nobility slew at one blow spens of kilspindie a courtier of your grandfather james the fourth who had dared to speak lightly of him in the royal presence they fought near the brook of fala and bellthecat with this blade sheared through the thigh of his opponent and lopped the limb as easily as a shepherds boy slices a twig from a sapling  my lord replied the queen reddening my nerves are too good to be alarmed even by this terrible historymay i ask how a blade so illustrious passed from the house of douglas to that of lindesaymethinks it should have been preserved as a consecrated relic by a family who have held all that they could do against their king to be done in favour of their country  nay madam said melville anxiously interfering ask not that question of lord lindesayand you my lord for shamefor decency forbear to reply to it  it is time that this lady should hear the truth replied lindesay  and be assured said the queen that she will be moved to anger by none that you can tell her my lord there are cases in which just scorn has always the mastery over just anger  then know said lindesay that upon the field of carberryhill when that false and infamous traitor and murderer james sometime earl of bothwell and nicknamed duke of orkney offered to do personal battle with any of the associated nobles who came to drag him to justice i accepted his challenge and was by the noble earl of morton gifted with his good sword that i might therewith fight it outah so help me heaven had his presumption been one grain more or his cowardice one grain less i should have done such work with this good steel on his traitorous corpse that the hounds and carrioncrows should have found their morsels daintily carved to their use   the queens courage wellnigh gave way at the mention of bothwells namea name connected with such a train of guilt shame and disaster but the prolonged boast of lindesay gave her time to rally herself and to answer with an appearance of cold contemptit is easy to slay an enemy who enters not the lists but had mary stewart inherited her fathers sword as well as his sceptre the boldest of her rebels should not upon that day have complained that they had no one to cope withal your lordship will forgive me if i abridge this conference a brief description of a bloody fight is long enough to satisfy a ladys curiosity and unless my lord of lindesay has something more important to tell us than of the deeds which old bellthecat achieved and how he would himself have emulated them had time and tide permitted we will retire to our private apartment and you fleming shall finish reading to us yonder little treatise des rodomontades espagnolles  tarry madam said lindesay his complexion reddening in his turn i know your quick wit too well of old to have sought an interview that you might sharpen its edge at the expense of my honour lord ruthven and myself with sir robert melville as a concurrent come to your grace on the part of the secret council to tender to you what much concerns the safety of your own life and the welfare of the state  the secret council said the queen by what powers can it subsist or act while i from whom it holds its character am here detained under unjust restraint but it matters notwhat concerns the welfare of scotland shall be acceptable to mary stewart come from whatever quarter it willand for what concerns her own life she has lived long enough to be weary of it even at the age of twentyfivewhere is your colleague my lordwhy tarries he  he comes madam said melville and lord ruthven entered at the instant holding in his hand a packet as the queen returned his salutation she became deadly pale but instantly recovered herself by dint of strong and sudden resolution just as the noble whose appearance seemed to excite such emotions in her bosom entered the apartment in company with george douglas the youngest son of the knight of lochleven who during the absence of his father and brethren acted as seneschal of the castle under the direction of the elder lady lochleven his fathers mother     chapter the twentysecond     i give this heavy weight from off my head   and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand   with mine own tears i wash away my balm   with mine own hand i give away my crown   with mine own tongue deny my sacred state   with mine own breath release all duteous oaths                                    richard ii  lord ruthven had the look and bearing which became a soldier and a statesman and the martial cast of his form and features procured him the popular epithet of greysteil by which he was distinguished by his intimates after the hero of a metrical romance then generally known his dress which was a buffcoat embroidered had a halfmilitary character but exhibited nothing of the sordid negligence which distinguished that of lindesay but the son of an illfated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his look that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death  the terror which the presence of this nobleman impressed on the queens mind arose from the active share he had borne in the slaughter of david rizzio his father having presided at the perpetration of that abominable crime although so weak from long and wasting illness that he could not endure the weight of his armour having arisen from a sickbed to commit a murder in the presence of his sovereign on that occasion his son also had attended and taken an active part it was little to be wondered at that the queen considering her condition when such a deed of horror was acted in her presence should retain an instinctive terror for the principal actors in the murder she returned however with grace the salutation of lord ruthven and extended her hand to george douglas who kneeled and kissed it with respect the first mark of a subjects homage which roland graeme had seen any of them render to the captive sovereign she returned his greeting in silence and there was a brief pause during which the steward of the castle a man of a sad brow and a severe eye placed under george douglass directions a table and writing materials and the page obedient to his mistresss dumb signal advanced a large chair to the side on which the queen stood the table thus forming a sort of bar which divided the queen and her personal followers from her unwelcome visitors the steward then withdrew after a low reverence when he had closed the door behind him the queen broke silencewith your favour my lords i will sitmy walks are not indeed extensive enough at present to fatigue me greatly yet i find repose something more necessary than usual  she sat down accordingly and shading her cheek with her beautiful hand looked keenly and impressively at each of the nobles in turn mary fleming applied her kerchief to her eyes and catherine seyton and roland graeme exchanged a glance which showed that both were too deeply engrossed with sentiments of interest and commiseration for their royal mistress to think of any thing which regarded themselves  i wait the purpose of your mission my lords said the queen after she had been seated for about a minute without a wordbeing spokeni wait your message from those you call the secret councili trust it is a petition of pardon and a desire that i will resume my rightful throne without using with due severity my right of punishing those who have dispossessed me of it  madam replied ruthven it is painful for us to speak harsh truths to a princess who has long ruled us but we come to offer not to implore pardon in a word madam we have to propose to you on the part of the secret council that you sign these deeds which will contribute greatly to the pacification of the state the advancement of gods word and the welfare of your own future life  am i expected to take these fair words on trust my lord or may i hear the contents of these reconciling papers ere i am asked to sign them  unquestionably madam it is our purpose and wish you should read what you are required to sign replied ruthven  required replied the queen with some emphasis but the phrase suits well the matterread my lord  the lord ruthven proceeded to read a formal instrument running in the queens name and setting forth that she had been called at an early age to the administration of the crown and realm of scotland and had toiled diligently therein until she was in body and spirit so wearied out and disgusted that she was unable any longer to endure the travail and pain of state affairs and that since god had blessed her with a fair and hopeful son she was desirous to ensure to him even while she yet lived his succession to the crown which was his by right of hereditary descent wherefore the instrument proceeded we of the motherly affection we bear to our said son have renounced and demitted and by these our letters of free goodwill renounce and demit the crown government and guiding of the realm of scotland in favour of our said son that he may succeed to us as native prince thereof as much as if we had been removed by disease and not by our own proper act and that this demission of our royal authority may have the more full and solemn effect and none pretend ignorance we give grant and commit fall and free and plain power to our trusty cousins lord lindesay of the byres and william lord ruthven to appear in our name before as many of the nobility clergy and burgesses as may be assembled at stirling and there in our name and behalf publicly and in their presence to renounce the crown guidance and government of this our kingdom of scotland  the queen here broke in with an air of extreme surprise how is this my lords she said are my ears turned rebels that they deceive me with sounds so extraordinaryand yet it is no wonder that having conversed so long with rebellion they should now force its language upon my understanding say i am mistaken my lordssay for the honour of yourselves and the scottish nobility that my right trusty cousins of lindesay and ruthven two barons of warlike fame and ancient line have not sought the prisonhouse of their kind mistress for such a purpose as these words seem to imply say for the sake of honour and loyalty that my ears have deceived me  no madam said ruthven gravely your ears do not deceive youthey deceived you when they were closed against the preachers of the evangele and the honest advice of your faithful subjects and when they were ever open to flattery of pickthanks and traitors foreign cubiculars and domestic minions the land may no longer brook the rule of one who cannot rule herself wherefore i pray you to comply with the last remaining wish of your subjects and counsellors and spare yourself and us the farther agitation of matter so painful  and is this all my loving subjects require of me my lord said mary in a tone of bitter irony do they really stint themselves to the easy boon that i should yield up the crown which is mine by birthright to an infant which is scarcely more than a year oldfling down my sceptre and take up a distaffoh no it is too little for them to askthat other roll of parchment contains something harder to be complied with and which may more highly task my readiness to comply with the petitions of my lieges  this parchment answered ruthven in the same tone of inflexible gravity and unfolding the instrument as he spoke is one by which your grace constitutes your nearest in blood and the most honourable and trustworthy of your subjects james earl of murray regent of the kingdom during the minority of the young king he already holds the appointment from the secret council  the queen gave a sort of shriek and clapping her hands together exclaimed comes the arrow out of his quiverout of my brothers bowalas i looked for his return from france as my sole at least my readiest chance of deliveranceand yet when i heard he had assumed the government i guessed he would shame to wield it in my name  i must pray your answer madam said lord ruthven to the demand of the council  the demand of the council said the queen say rather the demand of a set of robbers impatient to divide the spoil they have seized to such a demand and sent by the mouth of a traitor whose scalp but for my womanish mercy should long since have stood on the city gates mary of scotland has no answer  i trust madam said lord ruthven my being unacceptable to your presence will not add to your obduracy of resolution it may become you to remember that the death of the minion rizzio cost the house of ruthven its head and leader my father more worthy than a whole province of such vile sycophants died in exile and brokenhearted  the queen clasped her hands on her face and resting her arms on the table stooped down her head and wept so bitterly that the tears were seen to find their way in streams between the white and slender fingers with which she endeavoured to conceal them  my lords said sir robert melville this is too much rigour under your lordships favour we came hither not to revive old griefs but to find the mode of avoiding new ones  sir robert melville said ruthven we best know for what purpose we were delegated hither and wherefore you were somewhat unnecessarily sent to attend us  nay by my hand said lord lindesay i know not why we were cumbered with the good knight unless he comes in place of the lump of sugar which pothicars put into their wholesome but bitter medicaments to please a froward childa needless labour methinks where men have the means to make them swallow the physic otherwise  nay my lords said melville ye best know your own secret instructions i conceive i shall best obey mine in striving to mediate between her grace and you  be silent sir robert melville said the queen arising and her face still glowing with agitation as she spoke my kerchief flemingi shame that traitors should have power to move me thustell me proud lords she added wiping away the tears as she spoke by what earthly warrant can liege subjects pretend to challenge the rights of an anointed sovereignto throw off the allegiance they have vowed and to take away the crown from the head on which divine warrant hath placed it  madam said ruthven i will deal plainly with you your reign from the dismal field of pinkiecleugh when you were a babe in the cradle till now that ye stand a grown dame before us hath been such a tragedy of losses disasters civil dissensions and foreign wars that the like is not to be found in our chronicles the french and english have with one consent made scotland the battlefield on which to fight out their own ancient quarrelfor ourselves every mans hand hath been against his brother nor hath a year passed over without rebellion and slaughter exile of nobles and oppressing of the commons we may endure it no longer and therefore as a prince to whom god hath refused the gift of hearkening to wise counsel and on whose dealings and projects no blessing hath ever descended we pray you to give way to other rule and governance of the land that a remnant may yet be saved to this distracted realm  my lord said mary it seems to me that you fling on my unhappy and devoted head those evils which with far more justice i may impute to your own turbulent wild and untameable dispositionsthe frantic violence with which you the magnates of scotland enter into feuds against each other sticking at no cruelty to gratify your wrath taking deep revenge for the slightest offences and setting at defiance those wise laws which your ancestors made for stanching of such cruelty rebelling against the lawful authority and bearing yourselves as if there were no king in the land or rather as if each were king in his own premises and now you throw the blame on meon me whose life has been embitteredwhose sleep has been brokenwhose happiness has been wrecked by your dissensions have i not myself been obliged to traverse wilds and mountains at the head of a few faithful followers to maintain peace and put down oppression  have i not worn harness on my person and carried pistols at my saddle fain to lay aside the softness of a woman and the dignity of a queen that i might show an example to my followers  we grant madam said lindesay that the affrays occasioned by your misgovernment may sometimes have startled you in the midst of a masque or galliard or it may be that such may have interrupted the idolatry of the mass or the jesuitical counsels of some french ambassador but the longest and severest journey which your grace has taken in my memory was from hawick to hermitage castle and whether it was for the weal of the state or for your own honour rests with your graces conscience  the queen turned to him with inexpressible sweetness of tone and manner and that engaging look which heaven had assigned her as if to show that the choicest arts to win mens affections may be given in vain lindesay she said you spoke not to me in this stern tone and with such scurril taunt yon fair summer evening when you and i shot at the butts against the earl of mar and mary livingstone and won of them the evenings collation in the privy garden of saint andrews the master of lindesay was then my friend and vowed to be my soldier how i have offended the lord of lindesay i know not unless honours have changed manners  hardhearted as he was lindesay seemed struck with this unexpected appeal but almost instantly replied madam it is well known that your grace could in those days make fools of whomever approached you i pretend not to have been wiser than others but gayer men and better courtiers soon jostled aside my rude homage and i think your grace cannot but remember times when my awkward attempts to take the manners that pleased you were the sport of the courtpopinjays the marys and the frenchwomen  my lord i grieve if i have offended you through idle gaiety said the queen and can but say it was most unwittingly done you are fully revenged for through gaiety she said with a sigh will i never offend any one more  our time is wasting madam said lord ruthven i must pray your decision on this weighty matter which i have submitted to you  what my lord said the queen upon the instant and without a moments time to deliberatecan the council as they term themselves expect this of me  madam replied ruthven the council hold the opinion that since the fatal term which passed betwixt the night of king henrys murder and the day of carberryhill your grace should have held you prepared for the measure now proposed as the easiest escape from your numerous dangers and difficulties  great god exclaimed the queen and is it as a boon that you propose to me what every christian king ought to regard as a loss of honour equal to the loss of lifeyou take from me my crown my power my subjects my wealth my state what in the name of every saint can you offer or do you offer in requital of my compliance  we give you pardon answered ruthven sternlywe give you space and means to spend your remaining life in penitence and seclusionwe give you time to make your peace with heaven and to receive the pure gospel which you have ever rejected and persecuted  the queen turned pale at the menace which this speech as well as the rough and inflexible tones of the speaker seemed distinctly to inferand if i do not comply with your request so fiercely urged my lord what then follows  she said this in a voice in which female and natural fear was contending with the feelings of insulted dignitythere was a pause as if no one cared to return to the question a distinct answer at length ruthven spoke there is little need to tell to your grace who are well read both in the laws and in the chronicles of the realm that murder and adultery are crimes for which ere now queens themselves have suffered death  and where my lord or how found you an accusation so horrible against her who stands before you said queen mary the foul and odious calumnies which have poisoned the general mind of scotland and have placed me a helpless prisoner in your hands are surely no proof of guilt  we need look for no farther proof replied the stern lord ruthven than the shameless marriage betwixt the widow of the murdered and the leader of the band of murderersthey that joined hands in the fated month of may had already united hearts and counsel in the deed which preceded that marriage but a few brief weeks  my lord my lord said the queen eagerly remember well there were more consents than mine to that fatal union that most unhappy act of a most unhappy life the evil steps adopted by sovereigns are often the suggestion of bad counsellors but these counsellors are worse than fiends who tempt and betray if they themselves are the first to call their unfortunate princes to answer for the consequences of their own adviceheard ye never of a bond by the nobles my lords recommending that illfated union to the illfated mary methinks were it carefully examined we should see that the names of morton and of lindesay and of ruthven may be found in that bond which pressed me to marry that unhappy manah stout and loyal lord herries who never knew guile or dishonour you bent your noble knee to me in vain to warn me of my danger and wert yet the first to draw thy good sword in my cause when i suffered for neglecting thy counsel faithful knight and true noble what a difference betwixt thee and those counsellors of evil who now threaten my life for having fallen into the snares they spread for me  madam said ruthven we know that you are an orator and perhaps for that reason the council has sent hither men whose converse hath been more with the wars than with the language of the schools or the cabals of state we but desire to know if on assurance of life and honour ye will demit the rule of this kingdom of scotland  and what warrant have i said the queen that ye will keep treaty with me if i should barter my kingly estate for seclusion and leave to weep in secret  our honour and our word madam answered ruthven  they are too slight and unsolid pledges my lord said the queen add at least a handful of thistledown to give them weight in the balance  away ruthven said lindesay she was ever deaf to counsel save of slaves and sycophants let her remain by her refusal and abide by it  stay my lord said sir robert melville or rather permit me to have but a few minutes private audience with her grace if my presence with you could avail aught it must be as a mediatordo not i conjure you leave the castle or break off the conference until i bring you word how her grace shall finally stand disposed  we will remain in the hall said lindesay for half an hours space but in despising our words and our pledge of honour she has touched the honour of my namelet her look herself to the course she has to pursue  if the half hour should pass away without her determining to comply with the demands of the nation her career will be brief enough  with little ceremony the two nobles left the apartment traversed the vestibule and descended the windingstairs the clash of lindesays huge sword being heard as it rang against each step in his descent george douglas followed them after exchanging with melville a gesture of surprise and sympathy  as soon as they were gone the queen giving way to grief fear and agitation threw herself into the seat wrung her hands and seemed to abandon herself to despair her female attendants weeping themselves endeavoured yet to pray her to be composed and sir robert melville kneeling at her feet made the same entreaty after giving way to a passionate burst of sorrow she at length said to melville kneel not to me melvillemock me not with the homage of the person when the heart is far awaywhy stay you behind with the deposed the condemned her who has but few hours perchance to live you have been favoured as well as the rest why do you continue the empty show of gratitude and thankfulness any longer than they  madam said sir robert melville so help me heaven at my need my heart is as true to you as when you were in your highest place  true to me true to me repeated the queen with some scorn tush melville what signifies the truth which walks hand in hand with my enemies falsehoodthy hand and thy sword have never been so well acquainted that i can trust thee in aught where manhood is requiredoh seyton for thy bold father who is both wise true and valiant  roland graeme could withstand no longer his earnest desire to offer his services to a princess so distressed and so beautiful if one sword he said madam can do any thing to back the wisdom of this grave counsellor or to defend your rightful cause here is my weapon and here is my hand ready to draw and use it and raising his sword with one hand he laid the other upon the hilt  as he thus held up the weapon catherine seyton exclaimed methinks i see a token from my father madam and immediately crossing the apartment she took roland graeme by the skirt of the cloak and asked him earnestly whence he had that sword  the page answered with surprise methinks this is no presence in which to jestsurely damsel you yourself best know whence and how i obtained the weapon  is this a time for folly said catherine seyton unsheathe the sword instantly  if the queen commands me said the youth looking towards his royal mistress  for shame maiden said the queen wouldst thou instigate the poor boy to enter into useless strife with the two most approved soldiers in scotland  in your graces cause replied the page i will venture my life upon them and as he spoke he drew his weapon partly from the sheath and a piece of parchment rolled around the blade fell out and dropped on the floor catherine seyton caught it up with eager haste  it is my fathers handwriting she said and doubtless conveys his best duteous advice to your majesty i know that it was prepared to be sent in this weapon but i expected another messenger  by my faith fair one thought roland and if you knew not that i had such a secret missive about me i was yet more ignorant  the queen cast her eye upon the scroll and remained a few minutes wrapped in deep thought sir robert melville she at length said this scroll advises me to submit myself to necessity and to subscribe the deeds these hard men have brought with them as one who gives way to the natural fear inspired by the threats of rebels and murderers you sir robert are a wise man and seyton is both sagacious and brave neither i think would mislead me in this matter  madam said melville if i have not the strength of body of the lord herries or seyton i will yield to neither in zeal for your majestys service i cannot fight for you like these lords but neither of them is more willing to die for your service  i believe it my old and faithful counsellor said the queen and believe me melville i did thee but a moments injustice read what my lord seyton hath written to us and give us thy best counsel  he glanced over the parchment and instantly repliedoh my dear and royal mistress only treason itself could give you other advice than lord seyton has here expressed he herries huntly the english ambassador throgmorton and others your friends are all alike of opinion that whatever deeds or instruments you execute within these walls must lose all force and effect as extorted from your grace by duresse by sufferance of present evil and fear of men and harm to ensue on your refusal yield therefore to the tide and be assured that in subscribing what parchments they present to you you bind yourself to nothing since your act of signature wants that which alone can make it valid the free will of the granter  ay so says my lord seyton replied mary yet methinks for the daughter of so long a line of sovereigns to resign her birthright because rebels press upon her with threats argues little of royalty and will read ill for the fame of mary in future chronicles tush sir robert melville the traitors may use black threats and bold words but they will not dare to put their hands forth on our person  alas madam they have already dared so far and incurred such peril by the lengths which they have gone that they are but one step from the worst and uttermost  surely said the queen her fears again predominating scottish nobles would not lend themselves to assassinate a helpless woman  bethink you madam he replied what horrid spectacles have been seen in our day and what act is so dark that some scottish hand has not been found to dare it lord lindesay besides his natural sullenness and hardness of temper is the near kinsman of henry darnley and ruthven has his own deep and dangerous plans the council besides speak of proofs by writ and word of a casket with lettersof i know not what  ah good melville answered the queen were i as sure of the evenhanded integrity of my judges as of my own innocenceand yet  oh pause madam said melville even innocence must sometimes for a season stoop to injurious blame besides you are here  he looked round and paused  speak out melville said the queen never one approached my person who wished to work me evil and even this poor page whom i have today seen for the first time in my life i can trust safely with your communication  nay madam answered melville in such emergence and he being the bearer of lord seytons message i will venture to say before him and these fair ladies whose truth and fidelity i dispute noti say i will venture to say that there are other modes besides that of open trial by which deposed sovereigns often die and that as machiavel saith there is but one step betwixt a kings prison and his grave  oh i were it but swift and easy for the body said the unfortunate princess were it but a safe and happy change for the soul the woman lives not that would take the step so soon as ibut alas melville when we think of death a thousand sins which we have trod as worms beneath our feet rise up against us as flaming serpents most injuriously do they accuse me of aiding darnleys death yet blessed lady i afforded too open occasion for the suspicioni espoused bothwell  think not of that now madam said melville think rather of the immediate mode of saving yourself and son comply with the present unreasonable demands and trust that better times will shortly arrive  madam said roland graeme if it pleases you that i should do so i will presently swim through the lake if they refuse me other conveyance to the shore i will go to the courts successively of england france and spain and will show you have subscribed these vile instruments from no stronger impulse than the fear of death and i will do battle against them that say otherwise  the queen turned her round and with one of those sweet smiles which during the era of lifes romance overpay every risk held her hand towards roland but without speaking a word he kneeled reverently and kissed it and melville again resumed his plea  madam he said time presses and you must not let those boats which i see they are even now preparing put forth on the lake here are enough of witnessesyour ladiesthis bold youthmyself when it can serve your cause effectually for i would not hastily stand committed in this matterbut even without me here is evidence enough to show that you have yielded to the demands of the council through force and fear but from no sincere and unconstrained assent their boats are already manned for their returnoh permit your old servant to recall them  melville said the queen thou art an ancient courtierwhen didst thou ever know a sovereign prince recall to his presence subjects who had parted from him on such terms as those on which these envoys of the council left us and who yet were recalled without submission or apologylet it cost me both life and crown i will not again command them to my presence  alas madam that empty form should make a barrier if i rightly understand you are not unwilling to listen to real and advantageous counselbut your scruple is savedi hear them returning to ask your final resolution oh take the advice of the noble seyton and you may once more command those who now usurp a triumph over you but hush i hear them in the vestibule  as he concluded speaking george douglas opened the door of the apartment and marshalled in the two noble envoys  we come madam said the lord ruthven to request your answer to the proposal of the council  your final answer said lord lindesay for with a refusal you must couple the certainty that you have precipitated your fate and renounced the last opportunity of making peace with god and ensuring your longer abode in the world  my lords said mary with inexpressible grace and dignity the evils we cannot resist we must submit toi will subscribe these parchments with such liberty of choice as my condition permits me were i on yonder shore with a fleet jennet and ten good and loyal knights around me i would subscribe my sentence of eternal condemnation as soon as the resignation of my throne but here in the castle of lochleven with deep water around meand you my lords beside mei have no freedom of choicegive me the pen melville and bear witness to what i do and why i do it  it is our hope your grace will not suppose yourself compelled by any apprehensions from us said the lord ruthven to execute what must be your own voluntary deed  the queen had already stooped towards the table and placed the parchment before her with the pen between her fingers ready for the important act of signature but when lord ruthven had done speaking she looked up stopped short and threw down the pen if she said i am expected to declare i give away my crown of free will or otherwise than because i am compelled to renounce it by the threat of worse evils to myself and my subjects i will not put my name to such an untruthnot to gain full possession of england france and scotlandall once my own in possession or by right  beware madam said lindesay and snatching hold of the queens arm with his own gauntleted hand he pressed it in the rudeness of his passion more closely perhaps than he was himself aware ofbeware how you contend with those who are the stronger and have the mastery of your fate  he held his grasp on her arm bending his eyes on her with a stern and intimidating look till both ruthven and melville cried shame and douglas who had hitherto remained in a state of apparent apathy had made a stride from the door as if to interfere the rude baron then quitted his hold disguising the confusion which he really felt at having indulged his passion to such extent under a sullen and contemptuous smile  the queen immediately began with an expression of pain to bare the arm which he had grasped by drawing up the sleeve of her gown and it appeared that his gripe had left the purple marks of his iron fingers upon her fleshmy lord she said as a knight and gentleman you might have spared my frail arm so severe a proof that you have the greater strength on your side and are resolved to use itbut i thank you for itit is the most decisive token of the terms on which this days business is to resti draw you to witness both lords and ladies she said showing the marks of the grasp on her arm that i subscribe these instruments in obedience to the sign manual of my lord of lindesay which you may see imprinted on mine arm  footnote the details of this remarkable event are as given in the preceding chapter imaginary but the outline of the events is historical sir robert lindesay brother to the author of the memoirs was at first intrusted with the delicate commission of persuading the imprisoned queen to resign her crown as he flatly refused to interfere they determined to send the lord lindesay one of the rudest and most violent of their own faction with instructions first to use fair persuasions and if these did not succeed to enter into harder terms knox associates lord ruthven with lindesay in this alarming commission he was the son of that lord ruthven who was prime agent in the murder of rizzio and little mercy was to be expected from his conjunction with lindesay  the employment of such rude tools argued a resolution on the part of those who had the queens person in their power to proceed to the utmost extremities should they find mary obstinate to avoid this pressing danger sir robert melville was despatched by them to lochleven carrying with him concealed in the scabbard of his sword letters to the queen from the earl of athole maitland of lethington and even from throgmorton the english ambassador who was then favourable to the unfortunate mary conjuring her to yield to the necessity of the times and to subscribe such deeds as lindesay should lay before her without being startled by their tenor and assuring her that her doing so in the state of captivity under which she was placed would neither in law honour nor conscience be binding upon her when she should obtain her liberty submitting by the advice of one part of her subjects to the menace of the others and learning that lindesay was arrived in a boasting that is threatening humour the queen with some reluctancy and with tears saith knox subscribed one deed resigning her crown to her infant son and another establishing the earl of murray regent it seems agreed by historians that lindesay behaved with great brutality on the occasion the deeds were signed 24th july 1567  lindesay would have spoken but was restrained by his colleague ruthven who said to him peace my lord let the lady mary of scotland ascribe her signature to what she will it is our business to procure it and carry it to the council should there be debate hereafter on the manner in which it was adhibited there will be time enough for it  lindesay was silent accordingly only muttering within his beard i meant not to hurt her but i think womens flesh be as tender as newfallen snow  the queen meanwhile subscribed the rolls of parchment with a hasty indifference as if they had been matters of slight consequence or of mere formality when she had performed this painful task she arose and having curtsied to the lords was about to withdraw to her chamber ruthven and sir robert melville made the first a formal reverence the second an obeisance in which his desire to acknowledge his sympathy was obviously checked by the fear of appearing in the eyes of his colleagues too partial to his former mistress but lindesay stood motionless even when they were preparing to withdraw at length as if moved by a sudden impulse he walked round the table which had hitherto been betwixt them and the queen kneeled on one knee took her hand kissed it let it fall and aroselady he said thou art a noble creature even though thou hast abused gods choicest gifts i pay that devotion to thy manliness of spirit which i would not have paid to the power thou hast long undeservedly wieldedi kneel to mary stewart not to the queen  the queen and mary stewart pity thee alike lindesay said mary alike thee pity and they forgive thee an honoured soldier hadst thou been by a kings sideleagued with rebels what art thou but a good blade in the hands of a ruffianfarewell my lord ruthven the smoother but the deeper traitorfarewell melvillemayest thou find masters that can understand state policy better and have the means to reward it more richly than mary stewartfarewell george of douglasmake your respected granddame comprehend that we would be alone for the remainder of the daygod wot we have need to collect our thoughts  all bowed and withdrew but scarce had they entered the vestibule ere ruthven and lindesay were at variance chide not with me ruthven lindesay was heard to say in answer to something more indistinctly urged by his colleaguechide not with me for i will not brook it you put the hangmans office on me in this matter and even the very hangman hath leave to ask some pardon of those on whom he does his office i would i had as deep cause to be this ladys friend as i have to be her enemythou shouldst see if i spared limb and life in her quarrel  thou art a sweet minion said ruthven to fight a ladys quarrel and all for a brent brow and a tear in the eye such toys have been out of thy thoughts this many a year  do me right ruthven said lindesay you are like a polished corslet of steel it shines more gaudily but it is not a whit softernay it is five times harder than a glasgow breastplate of hammered iron enough we know each other  they descended the stairs were heard to summon their boats and the queen signed to roland graeme to retire to the vestibule and leave her with her female attendants     chapter the twentythird     give me a morsel on the greensward rather   coarse as you will the cookinglet the fresh spring   bubble beside my napkinand the free birds   twittering and chirping hop from bough to bough   to claim the crumbs i leave for perquisites   your prison feasts i like not                            the woodsman a drama  a recess in the vestibule was enlightened by a small window at which roland graeme stationed himself to mark the departure of the lords he could see their followers mustering on horseback under their respective bannersthe western sun glancing on their corslets and steelcaps as they moved to and fro mounted or dismounted at intervals on the narrow space betwixt the castle and the water the lords ruthven and lindesay were already moving slowly to their boats accompanied by the lady of lochleven her grandson and their principal attendants they took a ceremonious leave of each other as roland could discern by their gestures and the boats put oft from their landingplace the boatmen stretched to their oars and they speedily diminished upon the eye of the idle gazer who had no better employment than to watch their motions such seemed also the occupation of the lady lochleven and george douglas who returning from the landingplace looked frequently back to the boats and at length stopped as if to observe their progress under the window at which roland graeme was stationedas they gazed on the lake he could hear the lady distinctly say and she has bent her mind to save her life at the expense of her kingdom  her life madam replied her son i know not who would dare to attempt it in the castle of my father had i dreamt that it was with such purpose that lindesay insisted on bringing his followers hither neither he nor they should have passed the iron gate of lochleven castle  i speak not of private slaughter my son but of open trial condemnation and execution for with such she has been threatened and to such threats she has given way had she not more of the false gusian blood than of the royal race of scotland in her veins she had bidden them defiance to their teethbut it is all of the same complexion and meanness is the natural companion of profligacyi am discharged forsooth from intruding on her gracious presence this evening go thou my son and render the usual service of the meal to this unqueened queen  so please you lady mother said douglas i care not greatly to approach her presence  thou art right my son and therefore i trust thy prudence even because i have noted thy caution she is like an isle on the ocean surrounded with shelves and quicksands its verdure fair and inviting to the eye but the wreck of many a goodly vessel which hath approached it too rashly but for thee my son i fear nought and we may not with our honour suffer her to eat without the attendance of one of us she may die by the judgment of heaven or the fiend may have power over her in her despair and then we would be touched in honour to show that in our house and at our table she had had all fair play and fitting usage  here roland was interrupted by a smart tap on the shoulders reminding him sharply of adam woodcocks adventure of the preceding evening he turned round almost expecting to see the page of saint michaels hostelry he saw indeed catherine seyton but she was in female attire differing no doubt a great deal in shape and materials from that which she had worn when they first met and becoming her birth as the daughter of a great baron and her rank as the attendant on a princess so fair page said she eavesdropping is one of your pagelike qualities i presume  fair sister answered roland in the same tone if some friends of mine be as well acquainted with the rest of our mystery as they are with the arts of swearing swaggering and switching they need ask no page in christendom for farther insight into his vocation  unless that pretty speech infer that you have yourself had the discipline of the switch since we last met the probability whereof i nothing doubt i profess fair page i am at a loss to conjecture your meaning but there is no time to debate it nowthey come with the evening meal be pleased sir page to do your duty  four servants entered bearing dishes preceded by the same stern old steward whom roland had already seen and followed by george douglas already mentioned as the grandson of the lady of lochleven and who acting as seneschal represented upon this occasion his father the lord of the castle he entered with his arms folded on his bosom and his looks bent on the ground with the assistance of roland graeme a table was suitably covered in the next or middle apartment on which the domestics placed their burdens with great reverence the steward and douglas bending low when they had seen the table properly adorned as if their royal prisoner had sat at the board in question the door opened and douglas raising his eyes hastily cast them again on the earth when he perceived it was only the lady mary fleming who entered  her grace she said will not eat tonight  let us hope she may be otherwise persuaded said douglas meanwhile madam please to see our duty performed  a servant presented bread and salt on a silver plate and the old steward carved for douglas a small morsel in succession from each of the dishes presented which he tasted as was then the custom at the tables of princes to which death was often suspected to find its way in the disguise of food  the queen will not then come forth tonight said douglas  she has so determined replied the lady  our farther attendance then is unnecessarywe leave you to your supper fair ladies and wish you good even  he retired slowly as he came and with the same air of deep dejection and was followed by the attendants belonging to the castle the two ladies sate down to their meal and roland graeme with ready alacrity prepared to wait upon them catherine seyton whispered to her companion who replied with the question spoken in a low tone but looking at the pageis he of gentle blood and well nurtured  the answer which she received seemed satisfactory for she said to roland sit down young gentleman and eat with your sisters in captivity  permit me rather to perform my duty in attending them said roland anxious to show he was possessed of the high tone of deference prescribed by the rules of chivalry towards the fair sex and especially to dames and maidens of quality  you will find sir page said catherine you will have little time allowed you for your meal waste it not in ceremony or you may rue your politeness ere tomorrow morning  your speech is too free maiden said the elder lady the modesty of the youth may teach you more fitting fashions towards one whom today you have seen for the first time  catherine seyton cast down her eyes but not till she had given a single glance of inexpressible archness towards roland whom her more grave companion now addressed in a tone of protection  regard her not young gentlemanshe knows little of the world save the forms of a country nunnerytake thy place at the boardend and refresh thyself after thy journey  roland graeme obeyed willingly as it was the first food he had that day tasted for lindesay and his followers seemed regardless of human wants yet notwithstanding the sharpness of his appetite a natural gallantry of disposition the desire of showing himself a wellnurtured gentleman in all courtesies towards the fair sex and for aught i know the pleasure of assisting catherine seyton kept his attention awake during the meal to all those nameless acts of duty and service which gallants of that age were accustomed to render he carved with neatness and decorum and selected duly whatever was most delicate to place before the ladies ere they could form a wish he sprung from the table ready to comply with itpoured winetempered it with waterremoved the exchanged trenchers and performed the whole honours of the table with an air at once of cheerful diligence profound respect and graceful promptitude  when he observed that they had finished eating he hastened to offer to the elder lady the silver ewer basin and napkin with the ceremony and gravity which he would have used towards mary herself he next with the same decorum having supplied the basin with fair water presented it to catherine seyton apparently she was determined to disturb his selfpossession if possible for while in the act of bathing her hands she contrived as it were by accident to flirt some drops of water upon the face of the assiduous assistant but if such was her mischievous purpose she was completely disappointed for roland graeme internally piquing himself on his selfcommand neither laughed nor was discomposed and all that the maiden gained by her frolic was a severe rebuke from her companion taxing her with maladdress and indecorum catherine replied not but sat pouting something in the humour of a spoilt child who watches the opportunity of wreaking upon some one or other its resentment for a deserved reprimand  the lady mary fleming in the meanwhile was naturally well pleased with the exact and reverent observance of the page and said to catherine after a favourable glance at roland graemeyou might well say catherine our companion in captivity was well born and gentle nurtured i would not make him vain by my praise but his services enable us to dispense with those which george douglas condescends not to afford us save when the queen is herself in presence  umph i think hardly answered catherine george douglas is one of the most handsome gallants in scotland and tis pleasure to see him even still when the gloom of lochleven castle has shed the same melancholy over him that it has done over every thing else when he was at holyrood who would have said the young sprightly george douglas would have been contented to play the locksman here in lochleven with no gayer amusement than that of turning the key on two or three helpless womena strange office for a knight of the bleeding heartwhy does he not leave it to his father or his brothers  perhaps like us he has no choice answered the lady fleming but catherine thou hast used thy brief space at court well to remember what george douglas was then  i used mine eyes which i suppose was what i was designed to do and they were worth using there when i was at the nunnery they were very useless appurtenances and now i am at lochleven they are good for nothing save to look over that eternal work of embroidery  you speak thus when you have been but a few brief hours amongst us was this the maiden who would live and die in a dungeon might she but have permission to wait on her gracious queen  nay if you chide in earnest my jest is ended said catherine seyton  i would not yield in attachment to my poor godmother to the gravest dame that ever had wise saws upon her tongue and a doublestarched ruff around her throatyou know i would not dame mary fleming and it is putting shame on me to say otherwise  she will challenge the other court lady thought roland graeme she will to a certainty fling down her glove and if dame mary fleming hath but the soul to lift it we may have a combat in the listsbut the answer of lady mary fleming was such as turns away wrath  thou art a good child she said my catherine and a faithful but heaven pity him who shall have one day a creature so beautiful to delight him and a thing so mischievous to torment himthou art fit to drive twenty husbands stark mad  nay said catherine resuming the full career of her careless goodhumour he must be halfwitted beforehand that gives me such an opportunity but i am glad you are not angry with me in sincerity casting herself as she spoke into the arms of her friend and continuing with a tone of apologetic fondness while she kissed her on either side of the face you know my dear fleming that i have to contend with both my fathers lofty pride and with my mothers high spiritgod bless them they have left me these good qualities having small portion to give besides as times goand so i am wilful and saucy but let me remain only a week in this castle and oh my dear fleming my spirit will be as chastised and humble as thine own  dame mary flemings sense of dignity and love of form could not resist this affectionate appeal she kissed catherine seyton in her turn affectionately while answering the last part of her speech she said now our lady forbid dear catherine that you should lose aught that is beseeming of what becomes so well your light heart and lively humour keep but your sharp wit on this side of madness and it cannot but be a blessing to us but let me go mad wenchi hear her grace touch her silver call and extricating herself from catherines grasp she went towards the door of queen marys apartment from which was heard the low tone of a silver whistle which now only used by the boatswains in the navy was then for want of bells the ordinary mode by which ladies even of the very highest rank summoned their domestics when she had made two or three steps towards the door however she turned back and advancing to the young couple whom she left together she said in a very serious though a low tone i trust it is impossible that we can any of us or in any circumstances forget that few as we are we form the household of the queen of scotland and that in her calamity all boyish mirth and childish jesting can only serve to give a great triumph to her enemies who have already found their account in objecting to her the lightness of every idle folly that the young and the gay practised in her court so saying she left the apartment  catherine seyton seemed much struck with this remonstranceshe suffered herself to drop into the seat which she had quitted when she went to embrace dame mary fleming and for some time rested her brow upon her hands while roland graeme looked at her earnestly with a mixture of emotions which perhaps he himself could neither have analysed nor explained as she raised her face slowly from the posture to which a momentary feeling of selfrebuke had depressed it her eyes encountered those of roland and became gradually animated with their usual spirit of malicious drollery which not unnaturally excited a similar expression in those of the equally volatile page they sat for the space of two minutes each looking at the other with great seriousness on their features and much mirth in their eyes until at length catherine was the first to break silence  may i pray you fair sir she began very demurely to tell me what you see in my face to arouse looks so extremely sagacious and knowing as those with which it is your worships pleasure to honour me it would seem as if there were some wonderful confidence and intimacy betwixt us fair sir if one is to judge from your extremely cunning looks and so help me our lady as i never saw you but twice in my life before  and where were those happy occasions said roland if i may be bold enough to ask the question  at the nunnery of st catherines said the damsel in the first instance and in the second during five minutes of a certain raid or foray which it was your pleasure to make into the lodging of my lord and father lord seyton from which to my surprise as probably to your own you returned with a token of friendship and favour instead of broken bones which were the more probable reward of your intrusion considering the prompt ire of the house of seyton i am deeply mortified she added ironically that your recollection should require refreshment on a subject so important and that my memory should be stronger than yours on such an occasion is truly humiliating  your own memory is not so exactly correct fair mistress answered the page seeing you have forgotten meeting the third in the hostelrie of st michaels when it pleased you to lay your switch across the face of my comrade in order i warrant to show that in the house of seyton neither the prompt ire of its descendants nor the use of the doublet and hose are subject to salique law or confined to the use of the males  fair sir answered catherine looking at him with great steadiness and some surprise unless your fair wits have forsaken you i am at a loss what to conjecture of your meaning  by my troth fair mistress answered roland and were i as wise a warlock as michael scott i could scarce riddle the dream you read me did i not see you last night in the hostelrie of st michaelsdid you not bring me this sword with command not to draw it save at the command of my native and rightful sovereign and have i not done as you required me or is the sword a piece of lathmy word a bulrushmy memory a dreamand my eyes good for noughtespials which corbies might pick out of my head  and if your eyes serve you not more truly on other occasions than in your vision of st michael said catherine i know not the pain apart that the corbies would do you any great injury in the deprivationbut hark the bellhush for gods sake we are interrupted  the damsel was right for no sooner had the dull toll of the castle bell begun to resound through the vaulted apartment than the door of the vestibule flew open and the steward with his severe countenance his gold chain and his white rod entered the apartment followed by the same train of domestics who had placed the dinner on the table and who now with the same ceremonious formality began to remove it  the steward remained motionless as some old picture while the domestics did their office and when it was accomplished every thing removed from the table and the board itself taken from its tressels and disposed against the wall he said aloud without addressing any one in particular and somewhat in the tone of a herald reading a proclamation my noble lady dame margaret erskine by marriage douglas lets the lady mary of scotland and her attendants to wit that a servant of the true evangele her reverend chaplain will tonight as usual expound lecture and catechise according to the forms of the congregation of gospellers  hark you my friend mr dryfesdale said catherine i understand this announcement is a nightly form of yours now i pray you to remark that the lady fleming and ifor i trust your insolent invitation concerns us onlyhave chosen saint peters pathway to heaven so i see no one whom your godly exhortation catechise or lecture can benefit excepting this poor page who being in satans hand as well as yourself had better worship with you than remain to cumber our betteradvised devotions  the page was wellnigh giving a round denial to the assertions which this speech implied when remembering what had passed betwixt him and the regent and seeing catherines finger raised in a monitory fashion he felt himself as on former occasions at the castle of avenel obliged to submit to the task of dissimulation and followed dryfesdale down to the castle chapel where he assisted in the devotions of the evening  the chaplain was named elias henderson he was a man in the prime of life and possessed of good natural parts carefully improved by the best education which those times afforded to these qualities were added a faculty of close and terse reasoning and at intervals a flow of happy illustration and natural eloquence the religious faith of roland graeme as we have already had opportunity to observe rested on no secure basis but was entertained rather in obedience to his grandmothers behests and his secret desire to contradict the chaplain of avenel castle than from any fixed or steady reliance which he placed on the romish creed his ideas had been of late considerably enlarged by the scenes he had passed through and feeling that there was shame in not understanding something of those political disputes betwixt the professors of the ancient and the reformed faith he listened with more attention than it had hitherto been in his nature to yield on such occasions to an animated discussion of some of the principal points of difference betwixt the churches so passed away the first day in the castle of lochleven and those which followed it were for some time of a very monotonous and uniform tenor     chapter the twentyfourth     tis a weary life this   vaults overhead and grates and bars around me   and my sad hours spent with as sad companions   whose thoughts are brooding oer their own mischances   far far too deeply to take part in mine                                       the woodsman  the course of life to which mary and her little retinue were doomed was in the last degree secluded and lonely varied only as the weather permitted or rendered impossible the queens usual walk in the garden or on the battlements the greater part of the morning she wrought with her ladies at those pieces of needlework many of which still remain proofs of her indefatigable application at such hours the page was permitted the freedom of the castle and islet nay he was sometimes invited to attend george douglas when he went asporting upon the lake or on its margin opportunities of diversion which were only clouded by the remarkable melancholy which always seemed to brood on that gentlemans brow and to mark his whole demeanoura sadness so profound that roland never observed him to smile or to speak any word unconnected with the immediate object of their exercise  the most pleasant part of rolands day was the occasional space which he was permitted to pass in personal attendance on the queen and her ladies together with the regular dinnertime which he always spent with dame mary fleming and catharine seyton at these periods he had frequent occasion to admire the lively spirit and inventive imagination of the latter damsel who was unwearied in her contrivances to amuse her mistress and to banish for a time at least the melancholy which preyed on her bosom she danced she sung she recited tales of ancient and modern times with that heartfelt exertion of talent of which the pleasure lies not in the vanity of displaying it to others but in the enthusiastic consciousness that we possess it ourselves and yet these high accomplishments were mixed with an air of rusticity and harebrained vivacity which seemed rather to belong to some village maid the coquette of the ring around the maypole than to the highbred descendant of an ancient baron a touch of audacity altogether short of effrontery and far less approaching to vulgarity gave as it were a wildness to all that she did and mary while defending her from some of the occasional censures of her grave companion compared her to a trained singingbird escaped from a cage which practises in all the luxuriance of freedom and in full possession of the greenwood bough the airs which it had learned during its earlier captivity  the moments which the page was permitted to pass in the presence of this fascinating creature danced so rapidly away that brief as they were they compensated the weary dulness of all the rest of the day the space of indulgence however was always brief nor were any private interviews betwixt him and catharine permitted or even possible whether it were some special precaution respecting the queens household or whether it were her general ideas of propriety dame fleming seemed particularly attentive to prevent the young people from holding any separate correspondence together and bestowed for catharines sole benefit in this matter the full stock of prudence and experience which she had acquired when mother of the queens maidens of honour and by which she had gained their hearty hatred casual meetings however could not be prevented unless catherine had been more desirous of shunning or roland graeme less anxious in watching for them a smile a gibe a sarcasm disarmed of its severity by the arch look with which it was accompanied was all that time permitted to pass between them on such occasions but such passing interviews neither afforded means nor opportunity to renew the discussion of the circumstances attending their earlier acquaintance nor to permit roland to investigate more accurately the mysterious apparition of the page in the purple velvet cloak at the hostelrie of saint michaels  the winter months slipped heavily away and spring was already advanced when roland graeme observed a gradual change in the manners of his fellowprisoners having no business of his own to attend to and being like those of his age education and degree sufficiently curious concerning what passed around he began by degrees to suspect and finally to be convinced that there was something in agitation among his companions in captivity to which they did not desire that he should be privy nay he became almost certain that by some means unintelligible to him queen mary held correspondence beyond the walls and waters which surrounded her prisonhouse and that she nourished some secret hope of deliverance or escape in the conversations betwixt her and her attendants at which he was necessarily present the queen could not always avoid showing that she was acquainted with the events which were passing abroad in the world and which he only heard through her report he observed that she wrote more and worked less than had been her former custom and that as if desirous to lull suspicion asleep she changed her manner towards the lady lochleven into one more gracious and which seemed to express a resigned submission to her lot they think i am blind he said to himself and that i am unfit to be trusted because i am so young or it may be because i was sent hither by the regent wellbe it sothey may be glad to confide in me in the long run and catherine seyton for as saucy as she is may find me as safe a confidant as that sullen douglas whom she is always running after it may be they are angry with me for listening to master elias henderson but it was their own fault for sending me there and if the man speaks truth and good sense and preaches only the word of god he is as likely to be right as either pope or councils  it is probable that in this last conjecture roland graeme had hit upon the real cause why the ladies had not intrusted him with their councils he had of late had several conferences with henderson on the subject of religion and had given him to understand that he stood in need of his instructions although he had not thought there was either prudence or necessity for confessing that hitherto he had held the tenets of the church of rome  elias henderson a keen propagator of the reformed faith had sought the seclusion of lochleven castle with the express purpose and expectation of making converts from rome amongst the domestics of the dethroned queen and confirming the faith of those who already held the protestant doctrines perhaps his hopes soared a little higher and he might nourish some expectation of a proselyte more distinguished in the person of the deposed queen but the pertinacity with which she and her female attendants refused to see or listen to him rendered such hope if he nourished it altogether abortive  the opportunity therefore of enlarging the religious information of roland graeme and bringing him to a more due sense of his duties to heaven was hailed by the good man as a door opened by providence for the salvation of a sinner he dreamed not indeed that he was converting a papist but such was the ignorance which roland displayed upon some material points of the reformed doctrine that master henderson while praising his docility to the lady lochleven and her grandson seldom failed to add that his venerable brother henry warden must be now decayed in strength and in mind since he found a catechumen of his flock so illgrounded in the principles of his belief for this indeed roland graeme thought it was unnecessary to assign the true reason which was his having made it a point of honour to forget all that henry warden taught him as soon as he was no longer compelled to read it over as a lesson acquired by rote the lessons of his new instructor if not more impressively delivered were received by a more willing ear and a more awakened understanding and the solitude of lochleven castle was favourable to graver thoughts than the page had hitherto entertained he wavered yet indeed as one who was almost persuaded but his attention to the chaplains instructions procured him favour even with the stern old dame herself and he was once or twice but under great precaution permitted to go to the neighbouring village of kinross situated on the mainland to execute some ordinary commission of his unfortunate mistress  for some time roland graeme might be considered as standing neuter betwixt the two parties who inhabited the watergirdled tower of lochleven but as he rose in the opinion of the lady of the castle and her chaplain he perceived with great grief that he lost ground in that of mary and her female allies  he came gradually to be sensible that he was regarded as a spy upon their discourse and that instead of the ease with which they had formerly conversed in his presence without suppressing any of the natural feelings of anger of sorrow or mirth which the chance topic of the moment happened to call forth their talk was now guardedly restricted to the most indifferent subjects and a studied reserve observed even in their mode of treating these this obvious want of confidence was accompanied with a correspondent change in their personal demeanor towards the unfortunate page the queen who had at first treated him with marked courtesy now scarce spoke to him save to convey some necessary command for her service the lady fleming restricted her notice to the most dry and distant expressions of civility and catherine seyton became bitter in her pleasantries and shy cross and pettish in any intercourse they had together what was yet more provoking he saw or thought he saw marks of intelligence betwixt george douglas and the beautiful catherine seyton and sharpened by jealousy he wrought himself almost into a certainty that the looks which they exchanged conveyed matters of deep and serious import no wonder he thought if courted by the son of a proud and powerful baron she can no longer spare a word or look to the poor fortuneless page  in a word roland graemes situation became truly disagreeable and his heart naturally enough rebelled against the injustice of this treatment which deprived him of the only comfort which he had received for submitting to a confinement in other respects irksome he accused queen mary and catherine seyton for concerning the opinion of dame fleming he was indifferent of inconsistency in being displeased with him on account of the natural consequences of an order of their own why did they send him to hear this overpowering preacher the abbot ambrosius he recollected understood the weakness of their popish cause better when he enjoined him to repeat within his own mind aves and credos and paters all the while old henry warden preached or lectured that so he might secure himself against lending even a momentary ear to his heretical doctrine but i will endure this life no longer said he to himself manfully do they suppose i would betray my mistress because i see cause to doubt of her religionthat would be a serving as they say the devil for gods sake i will forth into the worldhe that serves fair ladies may at least expect kind looks and kind words and i bear not the mind of a gentleman to submit to cold treatment and suspicion and a lifelong captivity besides i will speak to george douglas tomorrow when we go out afishing  a sleepless night was spent in agitating this magnanimous resolution and he arose in the morning not perfectly decided in his own mind whether he should abide by it or not it happened that he was summoned by the queen at an unusual hour and just as he was about to go out with george douglas he went to attend her commands in the garden but as he had his anglingrod in his hand the circumstance announced his previous intention and the queen turning to the lady fleming said catherine must devise some other amusement for us ma bonnie amie our discreet page has already made his party for the days pleasure  i said from the beginning answered the lady fleming that your grace ought not to rely on being favoured with the company of a youth who has so many huguenot acquaintances and has the means of amusing himself far more agreeably than with us  i wish said catherine her animated features reddening with mortification that his friends would sail away with him for good and bring us in return a page if such a thing can be found faithful to his queen and to his religion  one part of your wishes may be granted madam said roland graeme unable any longer to restrain his sense of the treatment which he received on all sides and he was about to add i heartily wish you a companion in my room if such can be found who is capable of enduring womens caprices without going distracted luckily he recollected the remorse which he had felt at having given way to the vivacity of his temper upon a similar occasion and closing his lips imprisoned until it died on his tongue a reproach so misbecoming the presence of majesty  why do you remain there said the queen as if you were rooted to the parterre  i but attend your graces commands said the page  i have none to give youbegone sir  as he left the garden to go to the boat he distinctly heard mary upbraid one of her attendants in these wordsyou see to what you have exposed us  this brief scene at once determined roland graemes resolution to quit the castle if it were possible and to impart his resolution to george douglas without loss of time that gentleman in his usual mood of silence sate in the stern of the little skiff which they used on such occasions trimming his fishingtackle and from time to time indicating by signs to graeme who pulled the oars which way he should row when they were a furlong or two from the castle roland rested on the oars and addressed his companion somewhat abruptlyi have something of importance to say to you under your pleasure fair sir  the pensive melancholy of douglass countenance at once gave way to the eager keen and startled look of one who expects to hear something of deep and alarming import  i am wearied to the very death of this castle of lochleven continued roland  is that all said douglas i know none of its inhabitants who are much better pleased with it  ay but i am neither a native of the house nor a prisoner in it and so i may reasonably desire to leave it  you might desire to quit it with equal reason answered douglas if you were both the one and the other  but said roland graeme i am not only tired of living in lochleven castle but i am determined to quit it  that is a resolution more easily taken than executed replied douglas  not if yourself sir and your lady mother choose to consent answered the page  you mistake the matter roland said douglas you will find that the consent of two other persons is equally essentialthat of the lady mary your mistress and that of my uncle the regent who placed you about her person and who will not think it proper that she should change her attendants so soon  and must i then remain whether i will or no demanded the page somewhat appalled at a view of the subject which would have occurred sooner to a person of more experience  at least said george douglas you must will to remain till my uncle consents to dismiss you  frankly said the page and speaking to you as a gentleman who is incapable of betraying me i will confess that if i thought myself a prisoner here neither walls nor water should confine me long  frankly said douglas i could not much blame you for the attempt yet for all that my father or uncle or the earl or any of my brothers or in short any of the kings lords into whose hands you fell would in such a case hang you like a dog or like a sentinel who deserts his post and i promise you that you will hardly escape them but row towards saint serfs islandthere is a breeze from the west and we shall have sport keeping to windward of the isle where the ripple is strongest  we will speak more of what you have mentioned when we have had an hours sport  their fishing was successful though never did two anglers pursue even that silent and unsocial pleasure with less of verbal intercourse  when their time was expired douglas took the oars in his turn and by his order roland graeme steered the boat directing her course upon the landingplace at the castle but he also stopped in the midst of his course and looking around him said to graeme there is a thing which i could mention to thee but it is so deep a secret that even here surrounded as we are by sea and sky without the possibility of a listener i cannot prevail on myself to speak it out  better leave it unspoken sir answered roland graeme if you doubt the honour of him who alone can hear it  i doubt not your honour replied george douglas but you are young imprudent and changeful  young said roland i am and it may be imprudentbut who hath informed you that i am changeful  one that knows you perhaps better than you know yourself replied douglas  i suppose you mean catherine seyton said the page his heart rising as he spoke but she is herself fifty times more variable in her humour than the very water which we are floating upon  my young acquaintance said douglas i pray you to remember that catherine seyton is a lady of blood and birth and must not be lightly spoken of  master george of douglas said graeme as that speech seemed to be made under the warrant of something like a threat i pray you to observe that i value not the threat at the estimation of a fin of one of these dead trouts and moreover i would have you to know that the champion who undertakes the defence of every lady of blood and birth whom men accuse of change of faith and of fashion is like to have enough of work on his hands  go to said the seneschal but in a tone of goodhumour thou art a foolish boy unfit to deal with any matter more serious than the casting of a net or the flying of a hawk  if your secret concern catherine seyton said the page i care not for it and so you may tell her if you will i wot she can shape you opportunity to speak with her as she has ere now  the flush which passed over douglass face made the page aware that he had alighted on a truth when he was in fact speaking at random and the feeling that he had done so was like striking a dagger into his own heart his companion without farther answer resumed the oars and pulled lustily till they arrived at the island and the castle the servants received the produce of their spoil and the two fishers turning from each other in silence went each to his several apartment  roland graeme had spent about an hour in grumbling against catherine seyton the queen the regent and the whole house of lochleven with george douglas at the head of it when the time approached that his duty called him to attend the meal of queen mary as he arranged his dress for this purpose he grudged the trouble which on similar occasions he used with boyish foppery to consider as one of the most important duties of his day and when he went to take his place behind the chair of the queen it was with an air of offended dignity which could not escape her observation and probably appeared to her ridiculous enough for she whispered something in french to her ladies at which the lady fleming laughed and catherine appeared half diverted and half disconcerted this pleasantry of which the subject was concealed from him the unfortunate page received of course as a new offence and called an additional degree of sullen dignity into his mien which might have exposed him to farther raillery but that mary appeared disposed to make allowance for and compassionate his feelings  with the peculiar tact and delicacy which no woman possessed in greater perfection she began to soothe by degrees the vexed spirit of her magnanimous attendant the excellence of the fish which he had taken in his expedition the high flavour and beautiful red colour of the trouts which have long given distinction to the lake led her first to express her thanks to her attendant for so agreeable an addition to her table especially upon a jour de jeune and then brought on inquiries into the place where the fish had been taken their size their peculiarities the times when they were in season and a comparison between the lochleven trouts and those which are found in the lakes and rivers of the south of scotland the ill humour of roland graeme was never of an obstinate character it rolled away like mist before the sun and he was easily engaged in a keen and animated dissertation about lochleven trout and sea trout and river trout and bull trout and char which never rise to a fly and par which some suppose infant salmon and herlings which frequent the nith and vendisses which are only found in the castleloch of lochmaben and he was hurrying on with the eager impetuosity and enthusiasm of a young sportsman when he observed that the smile with which the queen at first listened to him died languidly away and that in spite of her efforts to suppress them tears rose to her eyes he stopped suddenly short and distressed in his turn asked if he had the misfortune unwittingly to give displeasure to her grace  no my poor boy replied the queen but as you numbered up the lakes and rivers of my kingdom imagination cheated me as it will do and snatched me from these dreary walls away to the romantic streams of nithsdale and the royal towers of lochmabeno land which my fathers have so long ruled of the pleasures which you extend so freely your queen is now deprived and the poorest beggar who may wander free from one landward town to another would scorn to change fates with mary of scotland  your highness said the lady fleming will do well to withdraw  come with me then fleming said the queen i would not burden hearts so young as these are with the sight of my sorrows  she accompanied these words with a look of melancholy compassion towards roland and catherine who were now left alone together in the apartment  the page found his situation not a little embarrassing for as every reader has experienced who may have chanced to be in such a situation it is extremely difficult to maintain the full dignity of an offended person in the presence of a beautiful girl whatever reason we may have for being angry with her catherine seyton on her part sate still like a lingering ghost which conscious of the awe which its presence imposes is charitably disposed to give the poor confused mortal whom it visits time to recover his senses and comply with the grand rule of demonology by speaking first but as roland seemed in no hurry to avail himself of her condescension she carried it a step farther and herself opened the conversation  i pray you fair sir if it may be permitted me to disturb your august reverie by a question so simplewhat may have become of your rosary  it is lost madamlost some time since said roland partly embarrassed and partly indignant  and may i ask farther sir said catherine why you have not replaced it with anotheri have half a mind she said taking from her pocket a string of ebony beads adorned with gold to bestow one upon yon to keep for my sake just to remind you of former acquaintance  there was a little tremulous accent in the tone with which these words were delivered which at once put to flight roland graemes resentment and brought him to catherines side but she instantly resumed the bold and firm accent which was more familiar to her i did not bid you she said come and sit so close by me for the acquaintance that i spoke of has been stiff and cold dead and buried for this many a day  now heaven forbid said the page it has only slept and now that you desire it should awake fair catherine believe me that a pledge of your returning favour  nay nay said catherine withholding the rosary towards which as he spoke he extended his hand i have changed my mind on better reflection what should a heretic do with these holy beads that have been blessed by the father of the church himself  roland winced grievously for he saw plainly which way the discourse was now likely to tend and felt that it must at all events be embarrassing nay but he said it was as a token of your own regard that you offered them  ay fair sir but that regard attended the faithful subject the loyal and pious catholic the individual who was so solemnly devoted at the same time with myself to the same grand duty which you must now understand was to serve the church and queen to such a person if you ever heard of him was my regard due and not to him who associates with heretics and is about to become a renegado  i should scarce believe fair mistress said roland indignantly that the vane of your favour turned only to a catholic wind considering that it points so plainly to george douglas who i think is both kingsman and protestant  think better of george douglas said catherine than to believe and then checking herself as if she had spoken too much she went on i assure you fair master roland that all who wish you well are sorry for you  their number is very few i believe answered roland and their sorrow if they feel any not deeper than ten minutes time will cure  they are more numerous and think more deeply concerning you than you seem to be aware answered catherine but perhaps they think wrongyou are the best judge in your own affairs and if you prefer gold and churchlands to honour and loyalty and the faith of your fathers why should you be hampered in conscience more than others  may heaven bear witness for me said roland that if i entertain any difference of opinionthat is if i nourish any doubts in point of religion they have been adopted on the conviction of my own mind and the suggestion of my own conscience  ay ay your conscienceyour conscience repeated she with satiric emphasis your conscience is the scapegoat i warrant it an able oneit will bear the burden of one of the best manors of the abbey of saint mary of kennaquhair lately forfeited to our noble lord the king by the abbot and community thereof for the high crime of fidelity to their religious vows and now to be granted by the high and mighty traitor and so forth james earl of murray to the good squire of dames roland graeme for his loyal and faithful service as underespial and deputyturnkey for securing the person of his lawful sovereign queen mary  you misconstrue me cruelly said the page yes catherine most cruellygod knows i would protect this poor lady at the risk of my life or with my life but what can i dowhat can any one do for her  much may be doneenough may be doneall may be doneif men will be but true and honourable as scottish men were in the days of bruce and wallace oh roland from what an enterprise you are now withdrawing your heart and hand through mere fickleness and coldness of spirit  how can i withdraw said roland from an enterprise which has never been communicated to mehas the queen or have you or has any one communicated with me upon any thing for her service which i have refused or have you not all of you held me at such distance from your counsels as if i were the most faithless spy since the days of ganelon footnote gan gano or ganelon of mayence is in the romances on the subject of charlemagne and his paladins always represented as the traitor by whom the christian champions are betrayed  and who said catherine seyton would trust the sworn friend and pupil and companion of the heretic preacher henderson aya proper tutor you have chosen instead of the excellent ambrosius who is now turned out of house and homestead if indeed he is not languishing in a dungeon for withstanding the tyranny of morton to whose brother the temporalities of that noble house of god have been gifted away by the regent  is it possible said the page and is the excellent father ambrose in such distress  he would account the news of your falling away from the faith of your fathers answered catherine a worse mishap than aught that tyranny can inflict on himself  but why said roland very much moved why should you suppose thatthatthat it is with me as you say  do you yourself deny it replied catherine do you not admit that you have drunk the poison which you should have dashed from your lips do you deny that it now ferments in your veins if it has not altogether corrupted the springs of lifedo you deny that you have your doubts as you proudly term them respecting what popes and councils have declared it unlawful to doubt ofis not your faith wavering if not overthrowndoes not the heretic preacher boast his conquestdoes not the heretic woman of this prisonhouse hold up thy example to othersdo not the queen and the lady fleming believe in thy falling awayand is there any except oneyes i will speak it out and think as lightly as you please of my goodwillis there one except myself that holds even a lingering hope that you may yet prove what we once all believed of you  i know not said our poor page much embarrassed by the view which was thus presented to him of the conduct he was expected to pursue and by a person in whom he was not the less interested that though long a resident in lochleven castle with no object so likely to attract his undivided attention no lengthened interview had taken place since they had first meti know not what you expect of me or fear from me i was sent hither to attend queen mary and to her i acknowledge the duty of a servant through life and death if any one had expected service of another kind i was not the party to render it i neither avow nor disclaim the doctrines of the reformed churchwill you have the truthit seems to me that the profligacy of the catholic clergy has brought this judgment on their own heads and for aught i know it may be for their reformation but for betraying this unhappy queen god knows i am guiltless of the thought did i even believe worse of her than as her servant i wishas her subject i dare to doi would not betray herfar from iti would aid her in aught which could tend to a fair trial of her cause  enough enough answered catherine clasping her hands together then thou wilt not desert us if any means are presented by which placing our royal mistress at freedom this case may be honestly tried betwixt her and her rebellious subjects  naybut fair catherine replied the page hear but what the lord of murray said when he sent me hither  hear but what the devil said replied the maiden rather than what a false subject a false brother a false counsellor a false friend said a man raised from a petty pensioner on the crowns bounty to be the counsellor of majesty and the prime distributor of the bounties of the stateone with whom rank fortune title consequence and power all grew up like a mushroom by the mere warm goodwill of the sister whom in requital he hath mewed up in this place of melancholy seclusionwhom in farther requital he has deposed and whom if he dared he would murder  i think not so ill of the earl of murray said roland graeme and sooth to speak he added with a smile it would require some bribe to make me embrace with firm and desperate resolution either one side or the other  nay if that is all replied catherine seyton in a tone of enthusiasm you shall be guerdoned with prayers from oppressed subjectsfrom dispossessed clergyfrom insulted nobleswith immortal praise by future ageswith eager gratitude by the presentwith fame on earth and with felicity in heaven your country will thank youyour queen will be debtor to youyou will achieve at once the highest from the lowest degree in chivalryall men will honour all women will love youand i sworn with you so early to the accomplishment of queen marys freedom willyes i willlove you better thanever sister loved brother say onsay on whispered roland kneeling on one knee and taking her hand which in the warmth of exhortation catherine held towards him  nay said she pausing i have already said too muchfar too much if i prevail not with youfar too little if i do but i prevail she continued seeing that the countenance of the youth she addressed returned the enthusiasm of her owni prevail or rather the good cause prevails through its own strengththus i devote thee to it and as she spoke she approached her finger to the brow of the astonished youth and without touching it signed the cross over his foreheadstooped her face towards him and seemed to kiss the empty space in which she had traced the symbol then starting up and extricating herself from his grasp darted into the queens apartment  roland graeme remained as the enthusiastic maiden had left him kneeling on one knee with breath withheld and with eyes fixed upon the space which the fairy form of catherine seyton had so lately occupied if his thoughts were not of unmixed delight they at least partook of that thrilling and intoxicating though mingled sense of pain and pleasure the most overpowering which life offers in its blended cup he rose and retired slowly and although the chaplain mr henderson preached on that evening his best sermon against the errors of popery i would not engage that he was followed accurately through the train of his reasoning by the young proselyte with a view to whose especial benefit he had handled the subject     chapter the twentyfifth     and when loves torch hath set the heart in flame   comes seignor reason with his saws and cautions   giving such aid as the old graybeard sexton   who from the churchvault drags the crazy engine   to ply its dribbling ineffectual streamlet   against a conflagration                                 old play  in a musing mood roland graeme upon the ensuing morning betook himself to the battlements of the castle as a spot where he might indulge the course of his thickcoming fancies with least chance of interruption  but his place of retirement was in the present case ill chosen for he was presently joined by mr elias henderson  i sought you young man said the preacher having to speak of something which concerns you nearly  the page had no pretence for avoiding the conference which the chaplain thus offered though he felt that it might prove an embarrassing one  in teaching thee as far as my feeble knowledge hath permitted thy duty towards god said the chaplain there are particulars of your duty towards man upon which i was unwilling long or much to insist you are here in the service of a lady honourable as touching her birth deserving of all compassion as respects her misfortunes and garnished with even but too many of those outward qualities which win mens regard and affection have you ever considered your regard to this lady mary of scotland in its true light and bearing  i trust reverend sir replied roland graeme that i am well aware of the duties a servant in my condition owes to his royal mistress especially in her lowly and distressed condition  true answered the preacher but it is even that honest feeling which may in the lady marys case carry thee into great crime and treachery  how so reverend sir replied the page i profess i understand you not  i speak to you not of the crimes of this illadvised lady said the preacher they are not subjects for the ears of her sworn servant but it is enough to say that this unhappy person hath rejected more offers of grace and more hopes of glory than ever were held out to earthly princes and that she is now her day of favour being passed sequestered in this lonely castle for the common weal of the people of scotland and it may be for the benefit of her own soul  reverend sir said roland somewhat impatiently i am but too well aware that my unfortunate mistress is imprisoned since i have the misfortune to share in her restraint myselfof which to speak sooth i am heartily weary  it is even of that which i am about to speak said the chaplain mildly but first my good roland look forth on the pleasant prospect of yonder cultivated plain you see where the smoke arises yonder village standing half hidden by the trees and you know it to be the dwellingplace of peace and industry from space to space each by the side of its own stream you see the gray towers of barons with cottages interspersed and you know that they also with their household are now living in unity the lance hung upon the wall and the sword resting in its sheath you see too more than one fair church where the pure waters of life are offered to the thirsty and where the hungry are refreshed with spiritual foodwhat would he deserve who should bring fire and slaughter into so fair and happy a scenewho should bare the swords of the gentry and turn them against each otherwho should give tower and cottage to the flames and slake the embers with the blood of the indwellerswhat would he deserve who should lift up again that ancient dagon of superstition whom the worthies of the time have beaten down and who should once more make the churches of god the high places of baal  you have limned a frightful picture reverend sir said roland graeme yet i guess not whom you would charge with the purpose of effecting a change so horrible  god forbid replied the preacher that i should say to thee thou art the manyet beware roland graeme that thou in serving thy mistress hold fast the still higher service which thou owest to the peace of thy country and the prosperity of her inhabitants else roland graeme thou mayest be the very man upon whose head will fall the curses and assured punishment due to such work if thou art won by the song of these sirens to aid that unhappy ladys escape from this place of penitence and security it is over with the peace of scotlands cottages and with the prosperity of her palacesand the babe unborn shall curse the name of the man who gave inlet to the disorder which will follow the war betwixt the mother and the son  i know of no such plan reverend sir answered the page and therefore can aid none suchmy duty towards the queen has been simply that of an attendant it is a task of which at times i would willingly have been freed nevertheless  it is to prepare thee for the enjoyment of something more of liberty said the preacher that i have endeavoured to impress upon you the deep responsibility under which your office must be discharged george douglas hath told the lady lochleven that you are weary of this service and my intercession hath partly determined her good ladyship that as your discharge cannot be granted you shall instead be employed in certain commissions on the mainland which have hitherto been discharged by other persons of confidence wherefore come with me to the lady for even today such duty will be imposed on you  i trust you will hold me excused reverend sir said the page who felt that an increase of confidence on the part of the lady of the castle and her family would render his situation in a moral view doubly embarrassing one cannot serve two mastersand i much fear that my mistress will not hold me excused for taking employment under another  fear not that said the preacher her consent shall be asked and obtained i fear she will yield it but too easily as hoping to avail herself of your agency to maintain correspondence with her friends as those falsely call themselves who would make her name the watchword for civil war  and thus said the page i shall be exposed to suspicion on all sides for my mistress will consider me as a spy placed on her by her enemies seeing me so far trusted by them and the lady lochleven will never cease to suspect the possibility of my betraying her because circumstances put it into my power to do soi would rather remain as i am  there followed a pause of one or two minutes during which henderson looked steadily in rolands countenance as if desirous to ascertain whether there was not more in the answer than the precise words seemed to imply he failed in this point however for roland bred a page from childhood knew how to assume a sullen pettish cast of countenance well enough calculated to hide all internal emotions  i understand thee not roland said the preacher or rather thou thinkest on this matter more deeply than i apprehended to be in thy nature methought the delight of going on shore with thy bow or thy gun or thy anglingrod would have borne away all other feelings  and so it would replied roland who perceived the danger of suffering hendersons halfraised suspicions to become fully awakei would have thought of nothing but the gun and the oar and the wild waterfowl that tempt me by sailing among the sedges yonder so far out of flightshot had you not spoken of my going on shore as what was to occasion burning of town and tower the downfall of the evangele and the upsetting of the mass  follow me then said henderson and we will seek the lady lochleven  they found her at breakfast with her grandson george douglaspeace be with your ladyship said the preacher bowing to his patroness roland graeme awaits your order  young man said the lady our chaplain hath warranted for thy fidelity and we are determined to give you certain errands to do for us in our town of kinross  not by my advice said douglas coldly  i said not that it was answered the lady something sharply the mother of thy father may i should think be old enough to judge for herself in a matter so simplethou wilt take the skiff roland and two of my people whom dryfesdale or randal will order out and fetch off certain stuff of plate and hangings which should last night be lodged at kinross by the wains from edinburgh  and give this packet said george douglas to a servant of ours whom you will find in waiting thereit is the report to my father he added looking towards his grandmother who acquiesced by bending her head  i have already mentioned to master henderson said roland graeme that as my duty requires my attendance on the queen her graces permission for my journey ought to be obtained before i can undertake your commission  look to it my son said the old lady the scruple of the youth is honourable  craving your pardon madam i have no wish to force myself on her presence thus early said douglas in an indifferent tone it might displease her and were no way agreeable to me  and i said the lady lochleven although her temper hath been more gentle of late have no will to undergo without necessity the rancour of her wit  under your permission madam said the chaplain i will myself render your request to the queen during my long residence in this house she hath not deigned to see me in private or to hear my doctrine yet so may heaven prosper my labours as love for her soul and desire to bring her into the right path was my chief desire for coming hither  take care master henderson said douglas in a tone which seemed almost sarcastic lest you rush hastily on an adventure to which you have no vocationyou are learned and know the adage ne accesseris in consilium nisi vocatuswho hath required this at your hand  the master to whose service i am called answered the preacher looking upwardhe who hath commanded me to be earnest in season and out of season  your acquaintance hath not been much i think with courts or princes continued the young esquire  no sir replied henderson but like my master knox i see nothing frightful in the fair face of a pretty lady  my son said the lady of lochleven quench not the good mans zeal let him do the errand to this unhappy princess  with more willingness than i would do it myself said george douglas  yet something in his manner appeared to contradict his words  the minister went accordingly followed by roland graeme and demanding an audience of the imprisoned princess was admitted he found her with her ladies engaged in the daily task of embroidery the queen received him with that courtesy which in ordinary cases she used towards all who approached her and the clergyman in opening his commission was obviously somewhat more embarrassed than he had expected to bethe good lady of lochlevenmay it please your grace  he made a short pause during which mary said with a smile my grace would in truth be well pleased were the lady lochleven our good ladybut go onwhat is the will of the good lady of lochleven  she desires madam said the chaplain that your grace will permit this young gentleman your page roland graeme to pass to kinross to look after some household stuff and hangings sent hither for the better furnishing your graces apartments  the lady of lochleven said the queen uses needless ceremony in requesting our permission for that which stands within her own pleasure  we well know that this young gentlemans attendance on us had not been so long permitted were he not thought to be more at the command of that good lady than at oursbut we cheerfully yield consent that he shall go on her errandwith our will we would doom no living creature to the captivity which we ourselves must suffer  ay madam answered the preacher and it is doubtless natural for humanity to quarrel with its prisonhouse yet there have been those who have found that time spent in the house of temporal captivity may be so employed as to redeem us from spiritual slavery  i apprehend your meaning sir replied the queen but i have heard your apostlei have heard master john knox and were i to be perverted i would willingly resign to the ablest and most powerful of heresiarchs the poor honour he might acquire by overcoming my faith and my hope  madam said the preacher it is not to the talents or skill of the husbandman that god gives the increasethe words which were offered in vain by him whom you justly call our apostle during the bustle and gaiety of a court may yet find better acceptance during the leisure for reflection which this place affords god knows lady that i speak in singleness of heart as one who would as soon compare himself to the immortal angels as to the holy man whom you have named yet would you but condescend to apply to their noblest use those talents and that learning which all allow you to be possessed ofwould you afford us but the slightest hope that you would hear and regard what can be urged against the blinded superstition and idolatry in which you are brought up sure am i that the most powerfullygifted of my brethren that even john knox himself would hasten hither and account the rescue of your single soul from the nets of romish error  i am obliged to you and to them for their charity said mary but as i have at present but one presencechamber i would reluctantly see it converted into a huguenot synod  at least madam be not thus obstinately blinded in your errors hear one who has hungered and thirsted watched and prayed to undertake the good work of your conversion and who would be content to die the instant that a work so advantageous for yourself and so beneficial to scotland were accomplishedyes lady could i but shake the remaining pillar of the heathen temple in this landand that permit me to term your faith in the delusions of romei could be content to die overwhelmed in the ruins  i will not insult your zeal sir replied mary by saying you are more likely to make sport for the philistines than to overwhelm themyour charity claims my thanks for it is warmly expressed and may be truly purposedbut believe as well of me as i am willing to do of you and think that i may be as anxious to recall you to the ancient and only road as you are to teach me your new byways to paradise  then madam if such be your generous purpose said henderson eagerly what hinders that we should dedicate some part of that time unhappily now too much at your graces disposal to discuss a question so weighty you by report of all men are both learned and witty and i though without such advantages am strong in my cause as in a tower of defence why should we not spend some space in endeavouring to discover which of us hath the wrong side in this important matter  nay said queen mary i never alleged my force was strong enough to accept of a combat en champ clos with a scholar and a polemic besides the match is not equal you sir might retire when you felt the battle go against you while i am tied to the stake and have no permission to say the debate wearies mei would be alone  she curtsied low to him as she uttered these words and henderson whose zeal was indeed ardent but did not extend to the neglect of delicacy bowed in return and prepared to withdraw  i would he said that my earnest wish my most zealous prayer could procure to your grace any blessing or comfort but especially that in which alone blessing or comfort is as easily as the slightest intimation of your wish will remove me from your presence  he was in the act of departing when mary said to him with much courtesy do me no injury in your thoughts good sir it may be that if my time here be protracted longeras surely i hope it will not trusting that either my rebel subjects will repent of their disloyalty or that my faithful lieges will obtain the upper handbut if my time be here protracted it may be i shall have no displeasure in hearing one who seems so reasonable and compassionate as yourself and i may hazard your contempt by endeavouring to recollect and repeat the reasons which schoolmen and councils give for the faith that is in mealthough i fear that god help me my latin has deserted me with my other possessions this must however be for another day meanwhile sir let the lady of lochleven employ my page as she listsi will not afford suspicion by speaking a word to him before he goesroland graeme my friend lose not an opportunity of amusing thyselfdance sing run and leapall may be done merrily on the mainland but he must have more than quicksilver in his veins who would frolic here  alas madam said the preacher to what is it you exhort the youth while time passes and eternity summons can our salvation be insured by idle mirth or our good work wrought out without fear and trembling  i cannot fear or tremble replied the queen to mary stewart such emotions are unknown but if weeping and sorrow on my part will atone for the boys enjoying an hour of boyish pleasure be assured the penance shall be duly paid  nay but gracious lady said the preacher in this you greatly errour tears and our sorrows are all too little for our own faults and follies nor can we transfer them as your church falsely teaches to the benefit of others  may i pray you sir answered the queen with as little offence as such a prayer may import to transfer yourself elsewhere we are sick at heart and may not now be disposed with farther controversyand thou roland take this little purse then turning to the divine she said showing its contents look reverend sirit contains only these two or three gold testoons a coin which though bearing my own poor features i have ever found more active against me than on my side just as my subjects take arms against me with my own name for their summons and signaltake this purse that thou mayest want no means of amusement fail notfail not to bring met back news from kinross only let it be such as without suspicion or offence may be told in the presence of this reverend gentleman or of the good lady lochleven herself  the last hint was too irresistible to be withstood and henderson withdrew half mortified half pleased with his reception for mary from long habit and the address which was natural to her had learned in an extraordinary degree the art of evading discourse which was disagreeable to her feelings or prejudices without affronting those by whom it was proffered  roland graeme retired with the chaplain at a signal from his lady but it did not escape him that as he left the room stepping backwards and making the deep obeisance due to royalty catherine seyton held up her slender forefinger with a gesture which he alone could witness and which seemed to say remember what has passed betwixt us  the young page had now his last charge from the lady of lochleven there are revels she said this day at the villagemy sons authority is as yet unable to prevent these continued workings of the ancient leaven of folly which the romish priests have kneaded into the very souls of the scottish peasantry i do not command thee to abstain from themthat would be only to lay a snare for thy folly or to teach thee falsehood but enjoy these vanities with moderation and mark them as something thou must soon learn to renounce and contemn our chamberlain at kinross luke lundindoctor as he foolishly calleth himselfwill acquaint thee what is to be done in the matter about which thou goest remember thou art trustedshow thyself therefore worthy of trust  when we recollect that roland graeme was not yet nineteen and that he had spent his whole life in the solitary castle of avenel excepting the few hours he had passed in edinburgh and his late residence at lochleven the latter period having very little served to enlarge his acquaintance with the gay world we cannot wonder that his heart beat high with hope and curiosity at the prospect of partaking the sport even of a country wake he hastened to his little cabin and turned over the wardrobe with which in every respect becoming his station he had been supplied from edinburgh probably by order of the earl of murray by the queens command he had hitherto waited upon her in mourning or at least in sadcoloured raiment her condition she said admitted of nothing more gay but now he selected the gayest dress his wardrobe afforded composed of scarlet slashed with black satin the royal colours of scotlandcombed his long curled hair disposed his chain and medal round a beaver hat of the newest block and with the gay falchion which had reached him in so mysterious a manner hung by his side in an embroidered belt his apparel added to his natural frank mien and handsome figure formed a most commendable and pleasing specimen of the young gallant of the period he sought to make his parting reverence to the queen and her ladies but old dryfesdale hurried him to the boat  we will have no private audiences he said my master since you are to be trusted with somewhat we will try at least to save thee from the temptation of opportunity god help thee child he added with a glance of contempt at his gay clothes an the bearward be yonder from saint andrews have a care thou go not near him  and wherefore i pray you said roland  lest he take thee for one of his runaway jackanapes answered the steward smiling sourly  i wear not my clothes at thy cost said roland indignantly  nor at thine own either my son replied the steward else would thy garb more nearly resemble thy merit and thy station  roland graeme suppressed with difficulty the repartee which arose to his lips and wrapping his scarlet mantle around him threw himself into the boat which two rowers themselves urged by curiosity to see the revels pulled stoutly towards the west end of the lake as they put off roland thought he could discover the face of catherine seyton though carefully withdrawn from observation peeping from a loophole to view his departure he pulled off his hat and held it up as a token that he saw and wished her adieu a white kerchief waved for a second across the window and for the rest of the little voyage the thoughts of catherine seyton disputed ground in his breast with the expectations excited by the approaching revel as they drew nearer and nearer the shore the sounds of mirth and music the laugh the halloo and the shout came thicker upon the ear and in a trice the boat was moored and roland graeme hastened in quest of the chamberlain that being informed what time he had at his own disposal he might lay it out to the best advantage     chapter the twentysixth     room for the master of the ring ye swains   divide your crowded ranksbefore him march   the rural minstrelsy the rattling drum   the clamorous warpipe and farechoing horn                rural sportssomerville  no long space intervened ere roland graeme was able to discover among the crowd of revellers who gambolled upon the open space which extends betwixt the village and the lake a person of so great importance as dr luke lundin upon whom devolved officially the charge of representing the lord of the land and who was attended for support of his authority by a piper a drummer and four sturdy clowns armed with rusty halberds garnished with partycoloured ribbons myrmidons who early as the day was had already broken more than one head in the awful names of the laird of lochleven and his chamberlain  footnote at scottish fairs the bailie or magistrate deputed by the lord in whose name the meeting is held attends the fair with his guard decides trifling disputes and punishes on the spot any petty delinquencies his attendants are usually armed with halberds and sometimes at least escorted by music thus in the life and death of habbie simpson we are told of that famous minstrel     at fairs he playd before the spearmen    and gaily graithed in their gearmen    steel bonnets jacks and swords shone clear then         like ony bead    now wha shall play before sic weirmen         since habbies dead   as soon as this dignitary was informed that the castle skiff had arrived with a gallant dressed like a lords son at the least who desired presently to speak to him he adjusted his ruff and his black coat turned round his girdle till the garnished hilt of his long rapier became visible and walked with due solemnity towards the beach solemn indeed he was entitled to be even on less important occasions for he had been bred to the venerable study of medicine as those acquainted with the science very soon discovered from the aphorisms which ornamented his discourse his success had not been equal to his pretensions but as he was a native of the neighbouring kingdom of fife and bore distant relation to or dependence upon the ancient family of lundin of that ilk who were bound in close friendship with the house of lochleven he had through their interest got planted comfortably enough in his present station upon the banks of that beautiful lake the profits of his chamberlainship being moderate especially in those unsettled times he had eked it out a little with some practice in his original profession and it was said that the inhabitants of the village and barony of kinross were not more effectually thirled which may be translated enthralled to the barons mill than they were to the medical monopoly of the chamberlain wo betide the family of the rich boor who presumed to depart this life without a passport from dr luke lundin for if his representatives had aught to settle with the baron as it seldom happened otherwise they were sure to find a cold friend in the chamberlain he was considerate enough however gratuitously to help the poor out of their ailments and sometimes out of all their other distresses at the same time  formal in a double proportion both as a physician and as a person in office and proud of the scraps of learning which rendered his language almost universally unintelligible dr luke lundin approached the beach and hailed the page as he advanced towards himthe freshness of the morning upon you fair siryou are sent i warrant me to see if we observe here the regimen which her good ladyship hath prescribed for eschewing all superstitious observances and idle anilities in these our revels i am aware that her good ladyship would

did not think it necessary to expound to this learned theban whether he understood him or no but leaving that matter uncertain he told him he came in quest of certain packages which should have

season meantime it will please you to look upon the sports but first to enter my poor lodging and take your mornings cup for what saith the school of salerno    poculum mane haustum   restaurat

antipestilential draught and to speak truth the pestilential miasmata are now very rife in the atmosphere we live in a happy time young man continued he in a tone of grave irony and have many blessings unknown to our fathershere are two sovereigns in the land a regnant and a claimantthat is enough of one good thingbut if any one wants more he may find a king in every peelhouse in the

desire to wrestle fence or so forth with some expert adversary and for my part i love to match myself for life or death against that same plague  as they proceeded up the street of the little village towards the doctors lodgings his attention was successively occupied by the various personages whom he met and pointed out to the notice of his companion  do you see that fellow with the red bonnet the blue jerkin and the great rough baton in his handi believe that clown hath the strength of a towerhe has lived fifty years in the world and never encouraged the liberal sciences by buying one pennyworth of medicamentsbut see you that man with the facies hippocratica said he pointing out a thin peasant with swelled legs and a most cadaverous countenance that i call one of the worthiest men in the baronyhe breakfasts luncheons dines and sups by my advice and not without my medicine and for his own single part will go farther to clear out a moderate stock of pharmaceutics than half the country besideshow do you my honest friend said he to the party in question with a tone of condolence  very weakly sir since i took the electuary answered the patient it neighboured ill with the two spoonfuls of peaseporridge and the kirnmilk  peaseporridge and kirnmilk have you been under medicine these ten years and keep your diet so illthe next morning take the electuary by itself and touch nothing for six hoursthe poor object bowed and limped off  the next whom the doctor deigned to take notice of was a lame fellow by whom the honour was altogether undeserved for at sight of the mediciner he began to shuffle away in the crowd as fast as his infirmities would permit  there is an ungrateful hound for you said doctor lundin i cured him of the gout in his feet and now he talks of the chargeableness of medicine and makes the first use of his restored legs to fly from his physician his podagra hath become a chiragra as honest martial hath itthe gout has got into his fingers and he cannot draw his purse old saying and true    praemia cum poscit medicus sathan est  we are angels when we come to curedevils when we ask paymentbut i will administer a purgation to his purse i warrant him there is his brother too a sordid chuffso ho there saunders darlet you have been ill i hear  just got the turn as i was thinking to send to your honour and i am brawly now againit was nae great thing that ailed me  hark you sirrah said the doctor i trust you remember you are owing to the laird four stones of barleymeal and a bow of oats and i would have you send no more such kainfowls as you sent last season that looked as wretchedly as patients just dismissed from a plaguehospital and there is hard money owing besides  i was thinking sir said the man more scotico that is returning no direct answer on the subject on which he was addressed my best way would be to come down to your honour and take your advice yet in case my trouble should come back  do so then knave replied lundin and remember what ecclesiasticus saithgive place to the physicianlet him not go from thee for thou hast need of him  his exhortation was interrupted by an apparition which seemed to strike the doctor with as much horror and surprise as his own visage inflicted upon sundry of those persons whom he had addressed  the figure which produced this effect on the esculapius of the village was that of a tall old woman who wore a highcrowned hat and muffler the first of these habiliments added apparently to her stature and the other served to conceal the lower part of her face and as the hat itself was slouched little could be seen besides two brown cheekbones and the eyes of swarthy fire that gleamed from under two shaggy gray eyebrows she was dressed in a long darkcoloured robe of unusual fashion bordered at the skirts and on the stomacher with a sort of white trimming resembling the jewish phylacteries on which were wrought the characters of some unknown language she held in her hand a walking staff of black ebony  by the soul of celsus said doctor luke lundin it is old mother nicneven herselfshe hath come to beard me within mine own bounds and in the very execution of mine office have at thy coat old woman as the song sayshob anster let her presently be seized and committed to the tolbooth and if there are any zealous brethren here who would give the hag her deserts and duck her as a witch in the loch i pray let them in no way be hindered  but the myrmidons of dr lundin showed in this case no alacrity to do his bidding hob anster even ventured to remonstrate in the name of himself and his brethren to be sure he was to do his honours bidding and for a that folks said about the skill and witcheries of mother nicneven he would put his trust in god and his hand on her collar without dreadour but she was no common spaewife this mother nicneven like jean jopp that lived in the bricriebaulk she had lords and lairds that would ruffle for her there was moncrieff of tippermalloch that was popish and the laird of carslogie a kend queens man were in the fair with wha kend how mony swords and bucklers at their back and they would be sure to make a breakout if the officers meddled with the auld popish witchwife who was sae weel friended mair especially as the lairds best men such as were not in the castle were in edinburgh with him and he doubted his honour the doctor would find ower few to make a good backing if blades were bare  the doctor listened unwillingly to this prudential counsel and was only comforted by the faithful promise of his satellite that the old woman should as he expressed it be taen canny the next time she trespassed on the bounds  and in that event said the doctor to his companion fire and fagot shall be the best of her welcome  this he spoke in hearing of the dame herself who even then and in passing the doctor shot towards him from under her gray eyebrows a look of the most insulting and contemptuous superiority  this way continued the physician this way marshalling his guest into his lodgingtake care you stumble not over a retort for it is hazardous for the ignorant to walk in the ways of art  the page found all reason for the caution for besides stuffed birds and lizards and snakes bottled up and bundles of simples made up and other parcels spread out to dry and all the confusion not to mention the mingled and sickening smells incidental to a druggists stock in trade he had also to avoid heaps of charcoal crucibles boltheads stoves and the other furniture of a chemical laboratory  amongst his other philosophical qualities doctor lundin failed not to be a confused sloven and his old dame housekeeper whose life as she said was spent in redding him up had trotted off to the mart of gaiety with other and younger folks much chattering and jangling therefore there was among jars and bottles and vials ere the doctor produced the salutiferous potion which he recommended so strongly and a search equally long and noisy followed among broken cans and cracked pipkins ere he could bring forth a cup out of which to drink it both matters being at length achieved the doctor set the example to his guest by quaffing off a cup of the cordial and smacking his lips with approbation as it descended his gulletroland in turn submitted to swallow the potion which his host so earnestly recommended but which he found so insufferably bitter that he became eager to escape from the laboratory in search of a draught of fair water to expel the taste in spite of his efforts he was nevertheless detained by the garrulity of his host till he gave him some account of mother nicneven  i care not to speak of her said the doctor in the open air and among the throng of people not for fright like yon cowardly dog anster but because i would give no occasion for a fray having no leisure to look to stabs slashes and broken bones men call the old hag a prophetessi do scarce believe she could foretell when a brood of chickens will chip the shellmen say she reads the heavensmy black bitch knows as much of them when she sits baying the moonmen pretend the ancient wretch is a sorceress a witch and what notinter nos i will never contradict a rumour which may bring her to the stake which she so justly deserves but neither will i believe that the tales of witches which they din into our ears are aught but knavery cozenage and old womens fables  in the name of heaven what is she then said the page that you make such a stir about her  she is one of those cursed old women replied the doctor who take currently and impudently upon themselves to act as advisers and curers of the sick on the strength of some trash of herbs some rhyme of spells some julap or diet drink or cordial  nay go no farther said the page if they brew cordials evil be their lot and all their partakers  you say well young man said dr lundin for mine own part i know no such pests to the commonwealth as these old incarnate devils who haunt the chambers of the brainsick patients that are mad enough to suffer them to interfere with disturb and let the regular process of a learned and artificial cure with their sirups and their julaps and diascordium and mithridate and my lady whatshallcallums powder and worthy dame trashems pill and thus make widows and orphans and cheat the regular and wellstudied physician in order to get the name of wise women and skeely neighbours and so forth but no more ontmother nicneven footnote this was the name given to the grand mother witch the very hecate of scottish popular superstition her name was bestowed in one or two instances upon sorceresses who were held to resemble her by their superior skill in hells black grammar and i will meet one day and she shall know there is danger in dealing with the doctor  it is a true word and many have found it said the page but under your favour i would fain walk abroad for a little and see these sports  it is well moved said the doctor and i too should be showing myself abroad moreover the play waits us young mantoday totus mundus agit histrionemand they sallied forth accordingly into the mirthful scene     chapter the twentyseventh     see on yon verdant lawn the gathering crowd   thickens amain the buxom nymphs advance   usherd by jolly clowns distinctions cease   lost in the common joy and the bold slave   leans on his wealthy master unreproved               rural gamessomervillle  the reappearance of the dignified chamberlain on the street of the village was eagerly hailed by the revellers as a pledge that the play or dramatic representation which had been postponed owing to his absence was now full surely to commence any thing like an approach to this most interesting of all amusements was of recent origin in scotland and engaged public attention in proportion all other sports were discontinued the dance around the maypole was arrestedthe ring broken up and dispersed while the dancers each leading his partner by the hand tripped off to the silvan theatre a truce was in like manner achieved betwixt a huge brown bear and certain mastiffs who were tugging and pulling at his shaggy coat under the mediation of the bearward and half a dozen butchers and yeomen who by dint of staving and tailing as it was technically termed separated the unfortunate animals whose fury had for an hour past been their chief amusement the itinerant minstrel found himself deserted by the audience he had collected even in the most interesting passage of the romance which he recited and just as he was sending about his boy with bonnet in hand to collect their oblations he indignantly stopped short in the midst of rosewal and lilian and replacing his threestringed fiddle or rebeck in its leathern case followed the crowd with no goodwill to the exhibition which had superseded his own the juggler had ceased his exertions of emitting flame and smoke and was content to respire in the manner of ordinary mortals rather than to play gratuitously the part of a fiery dragon in short all other sports were suspended so eagerly did the revellers throng towards the place of representation  they would err greatly who should regulate their ideas of this dramatic exhibition upon those derived from a modern theatre for the rude shows of thespis were far less different from those exhibited by euripides on the stage of athens with all its magnificent decorations and pomp of dresses and of scenery in the present case there were no scenes no stage no machinery no pit box and gallery no boxlobby and what might in poor scotland be some consolation for other negations there was no taking of money at the door as in the devices of the magnanimous bottom the actors had a greensward plot for a stage and a hawthorn bush for a greenroom and tiringhouse the spectators being accommodated with seats on the artificial bank which had been raised around threefourths of the playground the remainder being left open for the entrance and exit of the performers here sate the uncritical audience the chamberlain in the centre as the person highest in office all alive to enjoyment and admiration and all therefore dead to criticism  the characters which appeared and disappeared before the amused and interested audience were those which fill the earlier stage in all nationsold men cheated by their wives and daughters pillaged by their sons and imposed on by their domestics a braggadocia captain a knavish pardoner or quaestionary a country bumpkin and a wanton city dame amid all these and more acceptable than almost the whole put together was the alllicensed fool the gracioso of the spanish drama who with his cap fashioned into the resemblance of a coxcomb and his bauble a truncheon terminated by a carved figure wearing a fools cap in his hand went came and returned mingling in every scene of the piece and interrupting the business without having any share himself in the action and ever and anon transferring his gibes from the actors on the stage to the audience who sate around prompt to applaud the whole  the wit of the piece which was not of the most polished kind was chiefly directed against the superstitious practices of the catholic religion and the stage artillery had on this occasion been levelled by no less a person than doctor lundin who had not only commanded the manager of the entertainment to select one of the numerous satires which had been written against the papists several of which were cast in a dramatic form but had even like the prince of denmark caused them to insert or according to his own phrase to infuse here and there a few pleasantries of his own penning on the same inexhaustible subject hoping thereby to mollify the rigour of the lady of lochleven towards pastimes of this description he failed not to jog rolands elbow who was sitting in state behind him and recommend to his particular attention those favourite passages as for the page to whom the very idea of such an exhibition simple as it was was entirely new he beheld it with the undiminished and ecstatic delight with which men of all ranks look for the first time on dramatic representation and laughed shouted and clapped his hands as the performance proceeded an incident at length took place which effectually broke off his interest in the business of the scene  one of the principal personages in the comic part of the drama was as we have already said a quaestionary or pardoner one of those itinerants who hawked about from place to place relics real or pretended with which he excited the devotion at once and the charity of the populace and generally deceived both the one and the other the hypocrisy impudence and profligacy of these clerical wanderers had made them the subject of satire from the time of chaucer down to that of heywood their present representative failed not to follow the same line of humour exhibiting pigs bones for relics and boasting the virtues of small tin crosses which had been shaken in the holy porringer at loretto and of cockleshells which had been brought from the shrine of saint james of compostella all which he disposed of to the devout catholics at nearly as high a price as antiquaries are now willing to pay for baubles of similar intrinsic value at length the pardoner pulled from his scrip a small phial of clear water of which he vaunted the quality in the following verses    listneth gode people everiche one   for in the londe of babylone   far eastward i wot it lyeth   and is the first londe the sonne espieth   ther as he cometh fro out the sé   in this ilk londe as thinketh me   right as holie legendes tell   snottreth from a roke a well   and falleth into ane bath of ston   where chaste susanne in times long gon    wax wont to wash her bodie and lim   mickle vertue hath that streme   as ye shall se er that ye pas   ensample by this little glas   through nightés cold and dayés hote   hiderward i have it brought   hath a wife made slip or side   or a maiden steppd aside   putteth this water under her nese   wold she nold she she shall snese  the jest as the reader skilful in the antique language of the drama must at once perceive turned on the same pivot as in the old minstrel tales of the drinking horn of king arthur and the mantle made amiss but the audience were neither learned nor critical enough to challenge its want of originality the potent relic was after such grimace and buffoonery as befitted the subject presented successively to each of the female personages of the drama not one of whom sustained the supposed test of discretion but to the infinite delight of the audience sneezed much louder and longer than perhaps they themselves had counted on the jest seemed at last worn threadbare and the pardoner was passing on to some new pleasantry when the jester or clown of the drama possessing himself secretly of the phial which contained the wondrous liquor applied it suddenly to the nose of a young woman who with her black silk muffler or screen drawn over her face was sitting in the foremost rank of the spectators intent apparently upon the business of the stage the contents of the phial well calculated to sustain the credit of the pardoners legend set the damsel asneezing violently an admission of frailty which was received with shouts of rapture by the audience these were soon however renewed at the expense of the jester himself when the insulted maiden extricated ere the paroxysm was well over one hand from the folds of her mantle and bestowed on the wag a buffet which made him reel fully his own length from the pardoner and then acknowledge the favour by instant prostration  no one pities a jester overcome in his vocation and the clown met with little sympathy when rising from the ground and whimpering forth his complaints of harsh treatment he invoked the assistance and sympathy of the audience but the chamberlain feeling his own dignity insulted ordered two of his halberdiers to bring the culprit before him when these official persons first approached the virago she threw herself into an attitude of firm defiance as if determined to resist their authority and from the sample of strength and spirit which she had already displayed they showed no alacrity at executing their commission but on half a minutes reflection the damsel changed totally her attitude and manner folded her cloak around her arms in modest and maidenlike fashion and walked of her own accord to the presence of the great man followed and guarded by the two manful satellites as she moved across the vacant space and more especially as she stood at the footstool of the doctors judgmentseat the maiden discovered that lightness and elasticity of step and natural grace of manner which connoisseurs in female beauty know to be seldom divided from it moreover her neat russetcoloured jacket and short petticoat of the same colour displayed a handsome form and a pretty leg her features were concealed by the screen but the doctor whose gravity did not prevent his pretensions to be a connoisseur of the school we have hinted at saw enough to judge favourably of the piece by the sample  he began however with considerable austerity of mannerand how now saucy quean said the medical man of office what have you to say why i should not order you to be ducked in the loch for lifting your hand to the man in my presence  marry replied the culprit because i judge that your honour will not think the cold bath necessary for my complaints  a pestilent jade said the doctor whispering to roland graeme and ill warrant her a good oneher voice is as sweet as sirupbut my pretty maiden said he you show us wonderful little of that countenance of yoursbe pleased to throw aside your muffler  i trust your honour will excuse me till we are more private answered the maiden for i have acquaintance and i should like ill to be known in the country as the poor girl whom that scurvy knave put his jest upon  fear nothing for thy good name my sweet little modicum of candied manna replied the doctor for i protest to you as i am chamberlain of lochleven kinross and so forth that the chaste susanna herself could not have snuffed that elixir without sternutation being in truth a curious distillation of rectified acetum or vinegar of the sun prepared by mine own handswherefore as thou sayest thou wilt come to me in private and express thy contrition for the offence whereof thou hast been guilty i command that all for the present go forward as if no such interruption of the prescribed course had taken place  the damsel curtsied and tripped back to her place the play proceeded but it no longer attracted the attention of roland graeme  the voice the figure and what the veil permitted to be seen of the neck and tresses of the village damsel bore so strong a resemblance to those of catherine seyton that he felt like one bewildered in the mazes of a changeful and stupifying dream the memorable scene of the hostelrie rushed on his recollection with all its doubtful and marvellous circumstances were the tales of enchantment which he had read in romances realized in this extraordinary girl could she transport herself from the walled and guarded castle of lochleven moated with its broad lake towards which he cast back a look as if to ascertain it was still in existence and watched with such scrupulous care as the safety of a nation demandedcould she surmount all these obstacles and make such careless and dangerous use of her liberty as to engage herself publicly in a quarrel in a village fair  roland was unable to determine whether the exertions which it must have cost her to gain her freedom or the use to which she had put it rendered her the most unaccountable creature  lost in these meditations he kept his gaze fixed on the subject of them and in every casual motion discovered or thought he discovered something which reminded him still more strongly of catherine seyton it occurred to him more than once indeed that he might be deceiving himself by exaggerating some casual likeness into absolute identity but then the meeting at the hostelrie of saint michaels returned to his mind and it seemed in the highest degree improbable that under such various circumstances mere imagination should twice have found opportunity to play him the selfsame trick this time however he determined to have his doubts resolved and for this purpose he sate during the rest of the play like a greyhound in the slip ready to spring upon the hare the instant that she was started the damsel whom he watched attentively lest she should escape in the crowd when the spectacle was closed sate as if perfectly unconscious that she was observed but the worthy doctor marked the direction of his eyes and magnanimously suppressed his own inclination to become the theseus to this hippolyta in deference to the rights of hospitality which enjoined him to forbear interference with the pleasurable pursuits of his young friend he passed one or two formal gibes upon the fixed attention which the page paid to the unknown and upon his own jealousy adding however that if both were to be presented to the patient at once he had little doubt she would think the younger man the sounder prescription i fear me he added we shall have no news of the knave auchtermuchty for some time since the vermin whom i sent after him seem to have proved corbiemessengers so you have an hour or two on your hands master page and as the minstrels are beginning to strike up now the play is ended why an you incline for a dance yonder is the green and there sits your partneri trust you will hold me perfect in my diagnostics since i see with half an eye what disease you are sick of and have administered a pleasing remedy    discernit sapiens res as chambers hath it quas     confundit asellus  the page hardly heard the end of the learned adage or the charge which the chamberlain gave him to be within reach in case of the wains arriving suddenly and sooner than expectedso eager he was at once to shake himself free of his learned associate and to satisfy his curiosity regarding the unknown damsel yet in the haste with which he made towards her he found time to reflect that in order to secure an opportunity of conversing with her in private he must not alarm her at first accosting her he therefore composed his manner and gait and advancing with becoming selfconfidence before three or four countryfellows who were intent on the same design but knew not so well how to put their request into shape he acquainted her that he as the deputy of the venerable chamberlain requested the honour of her hand as a partner  the venerable chamberlain said the damsel frankly reaching the page her hand does very well to exercise this part of his privilege by deputy and i suppose the laws of the revels leave me no choice but to accept of his faithful delegate  provided fair damsel said the page his choice of a delegate is not altogether distasteful to you  of that fair sir replied the maiden i will tell you more when we have danced the first measure  catherine seyton had admirable skill in gestic lore and was sometimes called on to dance for the amusement of her royal mistress roland graeme had often been a spectator of her skill and sometimes at the queens command catherines partner on such occasions he was therefore perfectly acquainted with catherines mode of dancing and observed that his present partner in grace in agility in quickness of ear and precision of execution exactly resembled her save that the scottish jig which he now danced with her required a more violent and rapid motion and more rustic agility than the stately pavens lavoltas and courantoes which he had seen her execute in the chamber of queen mary the active duties of the dance left him little time for reflection and none for conversation but when their pas de deux was finished amidst the acclamations of the villagers who had seldom witnessed such an exhibition he took an opportunity when they yielded up the green to another couple to use the privilege of a partner and enter into conversation with the mysterious maiden whom he still held by the hand  fair partner may i not crave the name of her who has graced me thus far  you may said the maiden but it is a question whether i shall answer you  and why asked roland  because nobody gives anything for nothingand you can tell me nothing in return which i care to hear  could i not tell you my name and lineage in exchange for yours returned roland  no answered the maiden for you know little of either  how said the page somewhat angrily  wrath you not for the matter said the damsel i will show you in an instant that i know more of you than you do of yourself  indeed answered graeme for whom then do you take me  for the wild falcon answered she whom a dog brought in his mouth to a certain castle when he was but an unfledged eyasfor the hawk whom men dare not fly lest he should check at game and pounce on carrionwhom folk must keep hooded till he has the proper light of his eyes and can discover good from evil  wellbe it so replied roland graeme i guess at a part of your parable fair mistress mineand perhaps i know as much of you as you do of me and can well dispense with the information which you are so niggard in giving  prove that said the maiden and i will give you credit for more penetration than i judged you to be gifted withal  it shall be proved instantly said roland graeme the first letter of your name is s and the last n  admirable said his partner guess on  it pleases you today continued roland to wear the snood and kirtle and perhaps you may be seen tomorrow in hat and feather hose and doublet  in the clout in the clout you have hit the very white said the damsel suppressing a great inclination to laugh  you can switch mens eyes out of their heads as well as the heart out of their bosoms  these last words were uttered in a low and tender tone which to rolands great mortification and somewhat to his displeasure was so far from allaying that it greatly increased his partners disposition to laughter she could scarce compose herself while she replied if you had thought my hand so formidable extricating it from his hold you would not have grasped it so hard but i perceive you know me so fully that there is no occasion to show you my face  fair catherine said the page he were unworthy ever to have seen you far less to have dwelt so long in the same service and under the same roof with you who could mistake your air your gesture your step in walking or in dancing the turn of your neck the symmetry of your formnone could be so dull as not to recognize you by so many proofs but for me i could swear even to that tress of hair that escapes from under your muffler  and to the face of course which that muffler covers said the maiden removing her veil and in an instant endeavouring to replace it she showed the features of catherine but an unusual degree of petulant impatience inflamed them when from some awkwardness in her management of the muffler she was unable again to adjust it with that dexterity which was a principal accomplishment of the coquettes of the time  the fiend rive the rag to tatters said the damsel as the veil fluttered about her shoulders with an accent so earnest and decided that it made the page start he looked again at the damsels face but the information which his eyes received was to the same purport as before he assisted her to adjust her muffler and both were for an instant silent the damsel spoke first for roland graeme was overwhelmed with surprise at the contrarieties which catherine seyton seemed to include in her person and character  you are surprised said the damsel to him at what you see and hear but the times which make females men are least of all fitted for men to become women yet you yourself are in danger of such a change  i in danger of becoming effeminate said the page  yes you for all the boldness of your reply said the damsel when you should hold fast your religion because it is assailed on all sides by rebels traitors and heretics you let it glide out of your breast like water grasped in the hand if you are driven from the faith of your fathers from fear of a traitor is not that womanishif you are cajoled by the cunning arguments of a trumpeter of heresy or the praises of a puritanic old woman is not that womanishif you are bribed by the hope of spoil and preferment is not that womanishand when you wonder at my venting a threat or an execration should you not wonder at yourself who pretending to a gentle name and aspiring to knighthood can be at the same time cowardly silly and selfinterested  i would that a man would bring such a charge said the page he should see ere his life was a minute older whether he had cause to term me coward or no  beware of such big words answered the maiden you said but anon that i sometimes wear hose and doublet  but remain still catharine seyton wear what you list said the page endeavouring again to possess himself of her hand  you indeed are pleased to call me so replied the maiden evading his intention but i have many other names besides  and will you not reply to that said the page by which you are distinguished beyond every other maiden in scotland  the damsel unallured by his praises still kept aloof and sung with gaiety a verse from an old ballad    oh some do call me jack sweet love     and some do call me gill   but when i ride to holyrood     my name is wilful will  wilful will exclaimed the page impatiently say rather will o the wispjack with the lanternfor never was such a deceitful or wandering meteor  if i be such replied the maiden i ask no fools to follow meif they do so it is at their own pleasure and must be on their own proper peril  nay but dearest catherine said roland graeme be for one instant serious  if you will call me your dearest catherine when i have given you so many names to choose upon replied the damsel i would ask you how supposing me for two or three hours of my life escaped from yonder tower you have the cruelty to ask me to be serious during the only merry moments i have seen perhaps for months  ay but fair catherine there are moments of deep and true feeling which are worth ten thousand years of the liveliest mirth and such was that of yesterday when you so nearly  so nearly what demanded the damsel hastily  when you approached your lips so near to the sign you had traced on my forehead  mother of heaven exclaimed she in a yet fiercer tone and with a more masculine manner than she had yet exhibitedcatherine seyton approach her lips to a mans brow and thou that manvassal thou liest  the page stood astonished but conceiving he had alarmed the damsels delicacy by alluding to the enthusiasm of a moment and the manner in which she had expressed it he endeavoured to falter forth an apology his excuses though he was unable to give them any regular shape were accepted by his companion who had indeed suppressed her indignation after its first explosionspeak no more ont she said and now let us part our conversation may attract more notice than is convenient for either of us  nay but allow me at least to follow you to some sequestered place  you dare not replied the maiden  how said the youth dare not where is it you dare go where i dare not follow  you fear a will o the wisp said the damsel how would you face a fiery dragon with an enchantress mounted on its back  like sir eger sir grime or sir greysteil said the page but be there such toys to be seen here  i go to mother nicnevens answered the maid and she is witch enough to rein the horned devil with a red silk thread for a bridle and a rowantree switch for a whip  i will follow you said the page  let it be at some distance said the maiden  and wrapping her mantle round her with more success than on her former attempt she mingled with the throng and walked towards the village heedfully followed by roland graeme at some distance and under every precaution which he could use to prevent his purpose from being observed     chapter the twentyeighth     yes it is he whose eyes lookd on thy childhood   and watchd with trembling hope thy dawn of youth   that now with these same eyeballs dimmd with age   and dimmer yet with tears sees thy dishonour                                 old play  at the entrance of the principal or indeed so to speak the only street in kinross the damsel whose steps were pursued by roland graeme cast a glance behind her as if to be certain he had not lost trace of her and then plunged down a very narrow lane which ran betwixt two rows of poor and ruinous cottages she paused for a second at the door of one of those miserable tenements again cast her eye up the lane towards roland then lifted the latch opened the door and disappeared from his view  with whatever haste the page followed her example the difficulty which he found in discovering the trick of the latch which did not work quite in the usual manner and in pushing open the door which did not yield to his first effort delayed for a minute or two his entrance into the cottage a dark and smoky passage led as usual betwixt the exterior wall of the house and the hallan or clay wall which served as a partition betwixt it and the interior at the end of this passage and through the partition was a door leading into the ben or inner chamber of the cottage and when roland graemes hand was upon the latch of this door a female voice pronounced benedictus qui veniat in nomine domini damnandus qui in nomine inimici on entering the apartment he perceived the figure which the chamberlain had pointed out to him as mother nicneven seated beside the lowly hearth but there was no other person in the room roland graeme gazed around in surprise at the disappearance of catherine seyton without paying much regard to the supposed sorceress until she attracted and riveted his regard by the tone in which she asked himwhat seekest thou here  i seek said the page with much embarrassment i seek  but his answer was cut short when the old woman drawing her huge gray eyebrows sternly together with a frown which knitted her brow into a thousand wrinkles arose and erecting herself up to her full natural size tore the kerchief from her head and seizing roland by the arm made two strides across the floor of the apartment to a small window through which the light fell full on her face and showed the astonished youth the countenance of magdalen graemeyes roland she said thine eyes deceive thee not they show thee truly the features of her whom thou hast thyself deceived whose wine thou hast turned into gall her bread of joyfulness into bitter poison her hope into the blackest despairit is she who now demands of thee what seekest thou hereshe whose heaviest sin towards heaven hath been that she loved thee even better than the weal of the whole church and could not without reluctance surrender thee even in the cause of godshe now asks you what seekest thou here  while she spoke she kept her broad black eye riveted on the youths face with the expression with which the eagle regards his prey ere he tears it to pieces roland felt himself at the moment incapable either of reply or evasion this extraordinary enthusiast had preserved over him in some measure the ascendency which she had acquired during his childhood and besides he knew the violence of her passions and her impatience of contradiction and was sensible that almost any reply which he could make was likely to throw her into an ecstasy of rage he was therefore silent and magdalen graeme proceeded with increasing enthusiasm in her apostropheonce more what seekst thou false boyseekst thou the honour thou hast renounced the faith thou hast abandoned the hopes thou hast destroyedor didst thou seek me the sole protectress of thy youth the only parent whom thou hast known that thou mayest trample on my gray hairs even as thou hast already trampled on the best wishes of my heart  pardon me mother said roland graeme but in truth and reason i deserve not your blame i have been treated amongst youeven by yourself my revered parent as well as by othersas one who lacked the common attributes of freewill and human reason or was at least deemed unfit to exercise them a land of enchantment have i been led into and spells have been cast around meevery one has met me in disguiseevery one has spoken to me in parablesi have been like one who walks in a weary and bewildering dream and now you blame me that i have not the sense and judgment and steadiness of a waking and a disenchanted and a reasonable man who knows what he is doing and wherefore he does it if one must walk with masks and spectres who waft themselves from place to place as it were in vision rather than reality it might shake the soundest faith and turn the wisest head i sought since i must needs avow my folly the same catherine seyton with whom you made me first acquainted and whom i most strangely find in this village of kinross gayest among the revellers when i had but just left her in the wellguarded castle of lochleven the sad attendant of an imprisoned queeni sought her and in her place i find you my mother more strangely disguised than even she is  and what hadst thou to do with catherine seyton said the matron sternly is this a time or a world to follow maidens or to dance around a maypole when the trumpet summons every truehearted scotsman around the standard of the true sovereign shalt thou be found loitering in a ladys bower  no by heaven nor imprisoned in the rugged walls of an island castle answered roland graeme i would the blast were to sound even now for i fear that nothing less loud will dispel the chimerical visions by which i am surrounded  doubt not that it will be winded said the matron and that so fearfully loud that scotland will never hear the like until the last and loudest blast of all shall announce to mountain and to valley that time is no more meanwhile be thou but brave and constantserve god and honour thy sovereignabide by thy religioni cannoti will noti dare not ask thee the truth of the terrible surmises i have heard touching thy falling awayperfect not that accursed sacrificeand yet even at this late hour thou mayest be what i have hoped for the son of my dearest hopewhat say i the son of my hopethou shalt be the hope of scotland her boast and her honoureven thy wildest and most foolish wishes may perchance be fulfilledi might blush to mingle meaner motives with the noble guerdon i hold out to theeit shames me being such as i am to mention the idle passions of youth save with contempt and the purpose of censure but we must bribe children to wholesome medicine by the offer of cates and youth to honourable achievement with the promise of pleasure mark me therefore roland the love of catherine seyton will follow him only who shall achieve the freedom of her mistress and believe it may be one day in thine own power to be that happy lover cast therefore away doubt and fear and prepare to do what religion calls for what thy country demands of thee what thy duty as a subject and as a servant alike require at your hand and be assured even the idlest or wildest wishes of thy heart will be most readily attained by following the call of thy duty  as she ceased speaking a double knock was heard against the inner door the matron hastily adjusting her muffler and resuming her chair by the hearth demanded who was there  salve in nomine sancto was answered from without  salvete et vos answered magdalen graeme  and a man entered in the ordinary dress of a noblemans retainer wearing at his girdle a sword and buckleri sought you said he my mother and him whom i see with you then addressing himself to roland graeme he said to him hast thou not a packet from george douglas  i have said the page suddenly recollecting that which had been committed to his charge in the morning but i may not deliver it to any one without some token that they have a right to ask it  you say well replied the servingman and whispered into his ear the packet which i ask is the report to his fatherwill this token suffice  it will replied the page and taking the packet from his bosom gave it to the man  i will return presently said the servingman and left the cottage  roland had now sufficiently recovered his surprise to accost his relative in turn and request to know the reason why he found her in so precarious a disguise and a place so dangerousyou cannot be ignorant he said of the hatred that the lady of lochleven bears to those of yourthat is of our religionyour present disguise lays you open to suspicion of a different kind but inferring no less hazard and whether as a catholic or as a sorceress or as a friend to the unfortunate queen you are in equal danger if apprehended within the bounds of the douglas and in the chamberlain who administers their authority you have for his own reasons an enemy and a bitter one  i know it said the matron her eyes kindling with triumph i know that vain of his schoolcraft and carnal wisdom luke lundin views with jealousy and hatred the blessings which the saints have conferred on my prayers and on the holy relics before the touch nay before the bare presence of which disease and death have so often been known to retreati know he would rend and tear me but there is a chain and a muzzle on the ban dog that shall restrain his fury and the masters servant shall not be offended by him until the masters work is wrought when that hour comes let the shadows of the evening descend on me in thunder and in tempest the time shall be welcome that relieves my eyes from seeing guilt and my ears from listening to blasphemy do thou but be constantplay thy part as i have played and will play mine and my release shall be like that of a blessed martyr whose ascent to heaven angels hail with psalm and song while earth pursues him with hiss and with execration  as she concluded the servingman again entered the cottage and said all is well the time holds for tomorrow night  what time what holds exclaimed roland graeme i trust i have given the douglass packet to no wrong  content yourself young man answered the servingman thou hast my word and token  i know not if the token be right said the page and i care not much for the word of a stranger  what said the matron although thou mayest have given a packet delivered to thy charge by one of the queens rebels into the hand of a loyal subjectthere were no great mistake in that thou hotbrained boy  by saint andrew there were foul mistake though answered the page it is the very spirit of my duty in this first stage of chivalry to be faithful to my trust and had the devil given me a message to discharge i would not so i had plighted my faith to the contrary betray his counsel to an angel of light  now by the love i once bore thee said the matron i could slay thee with mine own hand when i hear thee talk of a dearer faith being due to rebels and heretics than thou owest to thy church and thy prince  be patient my good sister said the servingman i will give him such reasons as shall counterbalance the scruples which beset himthe spirit is honourable though now it may be mistimed and misplacedfollow me young man  ere i go to call this stranger to a reckoning said the page to the matron is there nothing i can do for your comfort and safety  nothing she replied nothing save what will lead more to thine own honourthe saints who have protected me thus far will lend me succour as i need it tread the path of glory that is before thee and only think of me as the creature on earth who will be most delighted to hear of thy famefollow the strangerhe hath tidings for you that you little expect  the stranger remained on the threshold as if waiting for roland and as soon as he saw him put himself in motion he moved on before at a quick pace diving still deeper down the lane roland perceived that it was now bordered by buildings upon the one side only and that the other was fenced by a high old wall over which some trees extended their branches descending a good way farther they came to a small door in the wall rolands guide paused looked around an instant to see if any one were within sight then taking a key from his pocket opened the door and entered making a sign to roland graeme to follow him he did so and the stranger locked the door carefully on the inside  during this operation the page had a moment to look around and perceived that he was in a small orchard very trimly kept  the stranger led him through an alley or two shaded by trees loaded with summerfruit into a pleached arbour where taking the turfseat which was on the one side he motioned to roland to occupy that which was opposite to him and after a momentary silence opened the conversation as follows you have asked a better warrant than the word of a mere stranger to satisfy you that i have the authority of george of douglas for possessing myself of the packet intrusted to your charge  it is precisely the point on which i demand reckoning of you said roland i fear i have acted hastily if so i must redeem my error as i best may  you hold me then as a perfect stranger said the man look at my face more attentively and see if the features do not resemble those of a man much known to you formerly  roland gazed attentively but the ideas recalled to his mind were so inconsistent with the mean and servile dress of the person before him that he did not venture to express the opinion which he was irresistibly induced to form  yes my son said the stranger observing his embarrassment you do indeed see before you the unfortunate father ambrosius who once accounted his ministry crowned in your preservation from the snares of heresy but who is now condemned to lament thee as a castaway  roland graemes kindness of heart was at least equal to his vivacity of temperhe could not bear to see his ancient and honoured master and spiritual guide in a situation which inferred a change of fortune so melancholy but throwing himself at his feet grasped his knees and wept aloud  what mean these tears my son said the abbot if they are shed for your own sins and follies surely they are gracious showers and may avail thee muchbut weep not if they fall on my account you indeed see the superior of the community of saint marys in the dress of a poor sworder who gives his master the use of his blade and buckler and if needful of his life for a coarse livery coat and four marks by the year but such a garb suits the time and in the period of the church militant as well becomes her prelates as staff mitre and crosier in the days of the churchs triumph  by what fate said the pageand yet why added he checking himself need i ask catherine seyton in some sort prepared me for this but that the change should be so absolutethe destruction so complete  yes my son said the abbot ambrosius thine own eyes beheld in my unworthy elevation to the abbots stall the last especial act of holy solemnity which shall be seen in the church of saint marys until it shall please heaven to turn back the captivity of the church for the present the shepherd is smittenay wellnigh to the earththe flock are scattered and the shrines of saints and martyrs and pious benefactors to the church are given to the owls of night and the satyrs of the desert  and your brother the knight of avenelcould he do nothing for your protection  he himself hath fallen under the suspicion of the ruling powers said the abbot who are as unjust to their friends as they are cruel to their enemies i could not grieve at it did i hope it might estrange him from his cause but i know the soul of halbert and i rather fear it will drive him to prove his fidelity to their unhappy cause by some deed which may be yet more destructive to the church and more offensive to heaven enough of this and now to the business of our meetingi trust you will hold it sufficient if i pass my word to you that the packet of which you were lately the bearer was designed for my hands by george of douglas  then said the page is george of douglas  a true friend to his queen roland and will soon i trust have his eyes opened to the errors of his miscalled church  but what is he to his father and what to the lady of lochleven who has been as a mother to him said the page impatiently  the best friend to both in time and through eternity said the abbot if he shall prove the happy instrument for redeeming the evil they have wrought and are still working  still said the page i like not that good service which begins in breach of trust  i blame not thy scruples my son said the abbot but the time which has wrenched asunder the allegiance of christians to the church and of subjects to their king has dissolved all the lesser bonds of society and in such days mere human ties must no more restrain our progress than the brambles and briers which catch hold of his garments should delay the path of a pilgrim who travels to pay his vows  but my fathersaid the youth and then stopt short in a hesitating manner  speak on my son said the abbot speak without fear  let me not offend you then said roland when i say that it is even this which our adversaries charge against us when they say that shaping the means according to the end we are willing to commit great moral evil in order that we may work out eventual good  the heretics have played their usual arts on you my son said the abbot they would willingly deprive us of the power of acting wisely and secretly though their possession of superior force forbids our contending with them on terms of equality they have reduced us to a state of exhausted weakness and now would fain proscribe the means by which weakness through all the range of nature supplies the lack of strength and defends itself against its potent enemies as well might the hound say to the hare use not these wily turns to escape me but contend with me in pitched battle as the armed and powerful heretic demand of the downtrodden and oppressed catholic to lay aside the wisdom of the serpent by which alone they may again hope to raise up the jerusalem over which they weep and which it is their duty to rebuildbut more of this hereafter and now my son i command thee on thy faith to tell me truly and particularly what has chanced to thee since we parted and what is the present state of thy conscience thy relation our sister magdalen is a woman of excellent gifts blessed with a zeal which neither doubt nor danger can quench but yet it is not a zeal altogether according to knowledge wherefore my son i would willingly be myself thy interrogator and thy counsellor in these days of darkness and stratagem  with the respect which he owed to his first instructor roland graeme went rapidly through the events which the reader is acquainted with and while he disguised not from the prelate the impression which had been made on his mind by the arguments of the preacher henderson he accidentally and almost involuntarily gave his father confessor to understand the influence which catherine seyton had acquired over his mind  it is with joy i discover my dearest son replied the abbot that i have arrived in time to arrest thee on the verge of the precipice to which thou wert approaching these doubts of which you complain are the weeds which naturally grow up in a strong soil and require the careful hand of the husbandman to eradicate them thou must study a little volume which i will impart to thee in fitting time in which by our ladys grace i have placed in somewhat a clearer light than heretofore the points debated betwixt us and these heretics who sow among the wheat the same tares which were formerly privily mingled with the good seed by the albigenses and the lollards but it is not by reason alone that you must hope to conquer these insinuations of the enemy it is sometimes by timely resistance but oftener by timely flight you must shut your ears against the arguments of the heresiarch when circumstances permit you not to withdraw the foot from his company anchor your thoughts upon the service of our lady while he is expending in vain his heretical sophistry are you unable to maintain your attention on heavenly objectsthink rather on thine own earthly pleasures than tempt providence and the saints by giving an attentive ear to the erring doctrinethink of thy hawk thy hound thine angling rod thy sword and bucklerthink even of catherine seyton rather than give thy soul to the lessons of the tempter alas my son believe not that worn out with woes and bent more by affliction than by years i have forgotten the effect of beauty over the heart of youth even in the watches of the night broken by thoughts of an imprisoned queen a distracted kingdom a church laid waste and ruinous come other thoughts than these suggest and feelings which belonged to an earlier and happier course of life be it sowe must bear our load as we may and not in vain are these passions implanted in our breast since as now in thy case they may come in aid of resolutions founded upon higher grounds yet beware my sonthis catherine seyton is the daughter of one of scotlands proudest as well as most worthy barons and thy state may not suffer thee as yet to aspire so high but thus it isheaven works its purposes through human folly and douglass ambitious affection as well as thine shall contribute alike to the desired end  how my father said the page my suspicions are then truedouglas loves  he does and with a love as much misplaced as thine own but beware of himcross him notthwart him not  let him not cross or thwart me said the page for i will not yield him an inch of way had he in his body the soul of every douglas that has lived since the time of the dark gray man footnote by an ancient though improbable tradition the douglasses are said to have derived their name from a champion who had greatly distinguished himself in an action when the king demanded by whom the battle had been won the attendants are said to have answered sholto douglas sir which is said to mean yonder dark gray man but the name is undoubtedly territorial and taken from douglas river and vale  nay have patience idle boy and reflect that your suit can never interfere with hisbut a truce with these vanities and let us better employ the little space which still remains to us to spend together to thy knees my son and resume the longinterrupted duty of confession that happen what may the hour may find in thee a faithful catholic relieved from the guilt of his sins by authority of the holy church could i but tell thee roland the joy with which i see thee once more put thy knee to its best and fittest use quid dicis mi fili  culpas meas answered the youth and according to the ritual of the catholic church he confessed and received absolution to which was annexed the condition of performing certain enjoined penances  when this religious ceremony was ended an old man in the dress of a peasant of the better order approached the arbour and greeted the abboti have waited the conclusion of your devotions he said to tell you the youth is sought after by the chamberlain and it were well he should appear without delay holy saint francis if the halberdiers were to seek him here they might sorely wrong my gardenplotthey are in office and reck not where they tread were each step on jessamine and clovegillyflowers  we will speed him forth my brother said the abbot but alas is it possible that such trifles should live in your mind at a crisis so awful as that which is now impending  reverend father answered the proprietor of the garden for such he was how oft shall i pray you to keep your high counsel for high minds like your own what have you required of me that i have not granted unresistingly though with an aching heart  i would require of you to be yourself my brother said the abbot ambrosius to remember what you were and to what your early vows have bound you  i tell thee father ambrosius replied the gardener the patience of the best saint that ever said paternoster would be exhausted by the trials to which you have put minewhat i have been it skills not to speak at presentno one knows better than yourself father what i renounced in hopes to find ease and quiet during the remainder of my daysand no one better knows how my retreat has been invaded my fruittrees broken my flowerbeds trodden down my quiet frightened away and my very sleep driven from my bed since ever this poor queen god bless her hath been sent to lochleveni blame her not being a prisoner it is natural she should wish to get out from so vile a hold where there is scarcely any place even for a tolerable garden and where the watermists as i am told blight all the early blossomsi say i cannot blame her for endeavouring for her freedom but why i should be drawn into the schemewhy my harmless arbours that i planted with my own hands should become places of privy conspiracywhy my little quay which i built for my own fishing boat should have become a haven for secret embarkationsin short why i should be dragged into matters where both heading and hanging are like to be the issue i profess to you reverend father i am totally ignorant  my brother answered the abbot you are wise and ought to know  i am noti am noti am not wise replied the horticulturist pettishly and stopping his ears with his fingersi was never called wise but when men wanted to engage me in some action of notorious folly  but my good brother said the abbot  i am not good neither said the peevish gardener i am neither good nor wisehad i been wise you would not have been admitted here and were i good methinks i should send you elsewhere to hatch plots for destroying the quiet of the country what signifies disputing about queen or kingwhen men may sit at peacesub umbra vitis sui and so would i do after the precept of holy writ were i as you term me wise or good but such as i am my neck is in the yoke and you make me draw what weight you listfollow me youngster this reverend father who makes in his jackmans dress nearly as reverend a figure as i myself will agree with me in one thing at least and that is that you have been long enough here  follow the good father roland said the abbot and remember my wordsa day is approaching that will try the temper of all true scotsmenmay thy heart prove faithful as the steel of thy blade  the page bowed in silence and they parted the gardener notwithstanding his advanced age walking on before him very briskly and muttering as he went partly to himself partly to his companion after the manner of old men of weakened intellectswhen i was great thus ran his maundering and had my mule and my ambling palfrey at command i warrant you i could have as well flown through the air as have walked at this pace i had my gout and my rheumatics and an hundred things besides that hung fetters on my heels and now thanks to our lady and honest labour i can walk with any good man of my age in the kingdom of fifefy upon it that experience should be so long in coming  as he was thus muttering his eye fell upon the branch of a peartree which drooped down for want of support and at once forgetting his haste the old man stopped and set seriously about binding it up roland graeme had both readiness neatness of hand and good nature in abundance he immediately lent his aid and in a minute or two the bough was supported and tied up in a way perfectly satisfactory to the old man who looked at it with great complaisance they are bergamots he said and if you will come ashore in autumn you shall taste of themthe like are not in lochleven castlethe garden there is a poor pinfold and the gardener hugh houkham hath little skill of his craftso come ashore master page in autumn when you would eat pears but what am i thinking ofere that time come they may have given thee sour pears for plums take an old mans advice youth one who hath seen many days and sat in higher places than thou canst hope forbend thy sword into a pruninghook and make a dibble of thy daggerthy days shall be the longer and thy health the better for itand come to aid me in my garden and i will teach thee the real french fashion of imping which the southron call graffing do this and do it without loss of time for there is a whirlwind coming over the land and only those shall escape who lie too much beneath the storm to have their boughs broken by it  so saying he dismissed roland graeme through a different door from that by which he had entered signed a cross and pronounced a benedicite as they parted and then still muttering to himself retired into the garden and locked the door on the inside     chapter the twentyninth     pray god she prove not masculine ere long                         king henry vi  dismissed from the old mans garden roland graeme found that a grassy paddock in which sauntered two cows the property of the gardener still separated him from the village he paced through it lost in meditation upon the words of the abbot father ambrosius had with success enough exerted over him that powerful influence which the guardians and instructors of our childhood possess over our more mature youth and yet when roland looked back upon what the father had said he could not but suspect that he had rather sought to evade entering into the controversy betwixt the churches than to repel the objections and satisfy the doubts which the lectures of henderson had excited for this he had no time said the page to himself neither have i now calmness and learning sufficient to judge upon points of such magnitude besides it were base to quit my faith while the wind of fortune sets against it unless i were so placed that my conversion should it take place were free as light from the imputation of selfinterest i was bred a catholicbred in the faith of bruce and wallacei will hold that faith till time and reason shall convince me that it errs i will serve this poor queen as a subject should serve an imprisoned and wronged sovereignthey who placed me in her service have to blame themselveswho sent me hither a gentleman trained in the paths of loyalty and honour when they should have sought out some truckling cogging doubledealing knave who would have been at once the observant page of the queen and the obsequious spy of her enemies since i must choose betwixt aiding and betraying her i will decide as becomes her servant and her subject but catherine seytoncatherine seyton beloved by douglas and holding me on or off as the intervals of her leisure or caprice will permithow shall i deal with the coquetteby heaven when i next have an opportunity she shall render me some reason for her conduct or i will break with her for ever  as he formed this doughty resolution he crossed the stile which led out of the little enclosure and was almost immediately greeted by dr luke lundin  ha my most excellent young friend said the doctor from whence come youbut i note the placeyes neighbour blinkhoolies garden is a pleasant rendezvous and you are of the age when lads look after a bonny lass with one eye and a dainty plum with another but hey you look subtriste and melancholici fear the maiden has proved cruel or the plums unripe and surely i think neighbour blinkhoolies damsons can scarcely have been well preserved throughout the winterhe spares the saccharine juice on his confects but courage man there are more kates in kinross and for the immature fruit a glass of my double distilled aqua mirabilisprobatum est  the page darted an ireful glance at the facetious physician but presently recollecting that the name kate which had provoked his displeasure was probably but introduced for the sake of alliteration he suppressed his wrath and only asked if the wains had been heard of  why i have been seeking for you this hour to tell you that the stuff is in your boat and that the boat waits your pleasure auchtermuchty had only fallen into company with an idle knave like himself and a stoup of aquavitae between them your boatmen lie on their oars and there have already been made two wefts from the warders turret to intimate that those in the castle are impatient for your return yet there is time for you to take a slight repast and as your friend and physician i hold it unfit you should face the waterbreeze with an empty stomach  roland graeme had nothing for it but to return with such cheer as he might to the place where his boat was moored on the beach and resisted all offer of refreshment although the doctor promised that he should prelude the collation with a gentle appetizera decoction of herbs gathered and distilled by himself indeed as roland had not forgotten the contents of his morning cup it is possible that the recollection induced him to stand firm in his refusal of all food to which such an unpalatable preface was the preliminary as they passed towards the boat for the ceremonious politeness of the worthy chamberlain would not permit the page to go thither without attendance roland graeme amidst a group who seemed to be assembled around a party of wandering musicians distinguished as he thought the dress of catherine seyton he shook himself clear from his attendant and at one spring was in the midst of the crowd and at the side of the damsel catherine he whispered is it well for you to be still herewill you not return to the castle  to the devil with your catherines and your castles answered the maiden snappishly have you not had time enough already to get rid of your follies begone i desire not your farther company and there will be danger in thrusting it upon me  naybut if there be danger fairest catherine replied roland why will you not allow me to stay and share it with you  intruding fool said the maiden the danger is all on thine own sidethe risk in in plain terms that i strike thee on the mouth with the hilt of my dagger so saying she turned haughtily from him and moved through the crowd who gave way in some astonishment at the masculine activity with which she forced her way among them  as roland though much irritated prepared to follow he was grappled on the other side by doctor luke lundin who reminded him of the loaded boat of the two wefts or signals with the flag which had been made from the tower of the danger of the cold breeze to an empty stomach and of the vanity of spending more time upon coy wenches and sour plums roland was thus in a manner dragged back to his boat and obliged to launch her forth upon his return to lochleven castle  that little voyage was speedily accomplished and the page was greeted at the landingplace by the severe and caustic welcome of old dryfesdale so young gallant you are come at last after a delay of six hours and after two signals from the castle but i warrant some idle junketing hath occupied you too deeply to think of your service or your duty where is the note of the plate and household stuffpray heaven it hath not been diminished under the sleeveless care of so young a gadabout  diminished under my care sir steward retorted the page angrily say so in earnest and by heaven your gray hair shall hardly protect your saucy tongue  a truce with your swaggering young esquire returned the steward we have bolts and dungeons for brawlers go to my lady and swagger before her if thou darestshe will give thee proper cause of offence for she has waited for thee long and impatiently  and where then is the lady of lochleven said the page for i conceive it is of her thou speakest  ayof whom else replied dryfesdale or who besides the lady of lochleven hath a right to command in this castle  the lady of lochleven is thy mistress said roland graeme but mine is the queen of scotland  the steward looked at him fixedly for a moment with an air in which suspicion and dislike were ill concealed by an affectation of contempt the bragging cockchicken he said will betray himself by his rash crowing i have marked thy altered manner in the chapel of lateay and your changing of glances at mealtime with a certain idle damsel who like thyself laughs at all gravity and goodness there is something about you my master which should be looked to but if you would know whether the lady of lochleven or that other lady hath a right to command thy service thou wilt find them together in the lady marys anteroom  roland hastened thither not unwilling to escape from the illnatured penetration of the old man and marvelling at the same time what peculiarity could have occasioned the lady of lochlevens being in the queens apartment at this time of the afternoon so much contrary to her usual wont his acuteness instantly penetrated the meaning she wishes he concluded to see the meeting betwixt the queen and me on my return that she may form a guess whether there is any private intelligence or understanding betwixt usi must be guarded  with this resolution he entered the parlour where the queen seated in her chair with the lady fleming leaning upon the back of it had already kept the lady of lochleven standing in her presence for the space of nearly an hour to the manifest increase of her very visible bad humour roland graeme on entering the apartment made a deep obeisance to the queen and another to the lady and then stood still as if to await their farther question speaking almost together the lady lochleven said so young man you are returned at length  and then stopped indignantly short while the queen went on without regarding herroland you are welcome home to usyou have proved the true dove and not the ravenyet i am sure i could have forgiven you if once dismissed from this watercircled ark of ours you had never again returned to us i trust you have brought back an olivebranch for our kind and worthy hostess has chafed herself much on account of your long absence and we never needed more some symbol of peace and reconciliation  i grieve i should have been detained madam answered the page but from the delay of the person intrusted with the matters for which i was sent i did not receive them till late in the day  see you there now said the queen to the lady lochleven we could not persuade you our dearest hostess that your household goods were in all safe keeping and surety true it is that we can excuse your anxiety considering that these august apartments are so scantily furnished that we have not been able to offer you even the relief of a stool during the long time you have afforded us the pleasure of your society  the will madam said the lady the will to offer such accommodation was more wanting than the means  what said the queen looking round and affecting surprise there are then stools in this apartmentone twono less than four including the broken onea royal garniturewe observed them notwill it please your ladyship to sit  no madam i will soon relieve you of my presence replied the lady lochleven and while with you my aged limbs can still better brook fatigue than my mind stoop to accept of constrained courtesy  nay lady of lochleven if you take it so deeply said the queen rising and motioning to her own vacant chair i would rather you assumed my seatyou are not the first of your family who has done so  the lady of lochleven curtsied a negative but seemed with much difficulty to suppress the angry answer which rose to her lips  during this sharp conversation the pages attention had been almost entirely occupied by the entrance of catherine seyton who came from the inner apartment in the usual dress in which she attended upon the queen and with nothing in her manner which marked either the hurry or confusion incident to a hasty change of disguise or the conscious fear of detection in a perilous enterprise roland graeme ventured to make her an obeisance as she entered but she returned it with an air of the utmost indifference which in his opinion was extremely inconsistent with the circumstances in which they stood towards each othersurely he thought she cannot in reason expect to bully me out of the belief due to mine own eyes as she tried to do concerning the apparition in the hostelry of saint michaelsi will try if i cannot make her feel that this will be but a vain task and that confidence in me is the wiser and safer course to pursue  these thoughts had passed rapidly through his mind when the queen having finished her altercation with the lady of the castle again addressed himwhat of the revels at kinross roland graeme methought they were gay if i may judge from some faint sounds of mirth and distant music which found their way so far as these grated windows and died when they entered them as all that is mirthful mustbut thou lookest as sad as if thou hadst come from a conventicle of the huguenots  and so perchance he hath madam replied the lady of lochleven at whom this sideshaft was lanched i trust amid yonder idle fooleries there wanted not some pouring forth of doctrine to a better purpose than that vain mirth which blazing and vanishing like the crackling of dry thorns leaves to the fools who love it nothing but dust and ashes  mary fleming said the queen turning round and drawing her mantle about her i would that we had the chimneygrate supplied with a fagot or two of these same thorns which the lady of lochleven describes so well methinks the damp air from the lake which stagnates in these vaulted rooms renders them deadly cold  your graces pleasure shall be obeyed said the lady of lochleven yet may i presume to remind you that we are now in summer  i thank you for the information my good lady said the queen for prisoners better learn their calender from the mouth of their jailor than from any change they themselves feel in the seasonsonce more roland graeme what of the revels  they were gay madam said the page but of the usual sort and little worth your highnesss ear  oh you know not said the queen how very indulgent my ear has become to all that speaks of freedom and the pleasures of the free methinks i would rather have seen the gay villagers dance their ring round the maypole than have witnessed the most stately masques within the precincts of a palace the absence of stonewallthe sense that the green turf is under the foot which may tread it free and unrestrained is worth all that art or splendour can add to more courtly revels  i trust said the lady lochleven addressing the page in her turn there were amongst these follies none of the riots or disturbances to which they so naturally lead  roland gave a slight glance to catherine seyton as if to bespeak her attention as he repliedi witnessed no offence madam worthy of markingnone indeed of any kind save that a bold damsel made her hand somewhat too familiar with the cheek of a playerman and ran some hazard of being ducked in the lake  as he uttered these words he cast a hasty glance at catherine but she sustained with the utmost serenity of manner and countenance the hint which he had deemed could not have been thrown out before her without exciting some fear and confusion  i will cumber your grace no longer with my presence said the lady lochleven unless you have aught to command me  nought our good hostess answered the queen unless it be to pray you that on another occasion you deem it not needful to postpone your better employment to wait so long upon us  may it please you added the lady lochleven to command this your gentleman to attend us that i may receive some account of these matters which have been sent hither for your graces use  we may not refuse what you are pleased to require madam answered the queen go with the lady roland if our commands be indeed necessary to thy doing so we will hear tomorrow the history of thy kinross pleasures for this night we dismiss thy attendance  roland graeme went with the lady of lochleven who failed not to ask him many questions concerning what had passed at the sports to which he rendered such answers as were most likely to lull asleep any suspicions which she might entertain of his disposition to favour queen mary taking especial care to avoid all allusion to the apparition of magdalen graeme and of the abbot ambrosius at length after undergoing a long and somewhat close examination he was dismissed with such expressions as coming from the reserved and stern lady of lochleven might seem to express a degree of favour and countenance  his first care was to obtain some refreshment which was more cheerfully afforded him by a goodnatured pantler than by dryfesdale who was on this occasion much disposed to abide by the fashion of puddingburn house where    they who came not the first call   gat no more meat till the next meal  when roland graeme had finished his repast having his dismissal from the queen for the evening and being little inclined for such society as the castle afforded he stole into the garden in which he had permission to spend his leisure time when it pleased him in this place the ingenuity of the contriver and disposer of the walks had exerted itself to make the most of little space and by screens both of stone ornamented with rude sculpture and hedges of living green had endeavoured to give as much intricacy and variety as the confined limits of the garden would admit  here the young man walked sadly considering the events of the day and comparing what had dropped from the abbot with what he had himself noticed of the demeanour of george douglas it must be so was the painful but inevitable conclusion at which he arrived it must be by his aid that she is thus enabled like a phantom to transport herself from place to place and to appear at pleasure on the mainland or on the isletit must be so he repeated once more with him she holds a close secret and intimate correspondence altogether inconsistent with the eye of favour which she has sometimes cast upon me and destructive to the hopes which she must have known these glances have necessarily inspired and yet for love will hope where reason despairs the thought rushed on his mind that it was possible she only encouraged douglass passion so far as might serve her mistresss interest and that she was of too frank noble and candid a nature to hold out to himself hopes which she meant not to fulfil lost in these various conjectures he seated himself upon a bank of turf which commanded a view of the lake on the one side and on the other of that front of the castle along which the queens apartments were situated  the sun had now for some time set and the twilight of may was rapidly fading into a serene night on the lake the expanded water rose and fell with the slightest and softest influence of a southern breeze which scarcely dimpled the surface over which it passed in the distance was still seen the dim outline of the island of saint serf once visited by many a sandalled pilgrim as the blessed spot trodden by a man of godnow neglected or violated as the refuge of lazy priests who had with justice been compelled to give place to the sheep and the heifers of a protestant baron  as roland gazed on the dark speck amid the lighter blue of the waters which surrounded it the mazes of polemical discussion again stretched themselves before the eye of the mind had these men justly suffered their exile as licentious drones the robbers at once and disgrace of the busy hive or had the hand of avarice and rapine expelled from the temple not the ribalds who polluted but the faithful priests who served the shrine in honour and fidelity the arguments of henderson in this contemplative hour rose with double force before him and could scarcely be parried by the appeal which the abbot ambrosius had made from his understanding to his feelingsan appeal which he had felt more forcibly amid the bustle of stirring life than now when his reflections were more undisturbed it required an effort to divert his mind from this embarrassing topic and he found that he best succeeded by turning his eyes to the front of the tower watching where a twinkling light still streamed from the casement of catherine seytons apartment obscured by times for a moment as the shadow of the fair inhabitant passed betwixt the taper and the window at length the light was removed or extinguished and that object of speculation was also withdrawn from the eyes of the meditative lover dare i confess the fact without injuring his character for ever as a hero of romance  these eyes gradually became heavy speculative doubts on the subject of religious controversy and anxious conjectures concerning the state of his mistresss affections became confusedly blended together in his musings the fatigues of a busy day prevailed over the harassing subjects of contemplation which occupied his mind and he fell fast asleep  sound were his slumbers until they were suddenly dispelled by the iron tongue of the castlebell which sent its deep and sullen sounds wide over the bosom of the lake and awakened the echoes of bennarty the hill which descends steeply on its southern bank roland started up for this bell was always tolled at ten oclock as the signal for locking the castle gates and placing the keys under the charge of the seneschal he therefore hastened to the wicket by which the garden communicated with the building and had the mortification just as he reached it to hear the bolt leave its sheath with a discordant crash and enter the stone groove of the doorlintel hold hold cried the page and let me in ere you lock the wicket the voice of dryfesdale replied from within in his usual tone of embittered sullenness the hour is passed fair masteryou like not the inside of these wallseven make it a complete holiday and spend the night as well as the day out of bounds  open the door exclaimed the indignant page or by saint giles i will make thy gold chain smoke for it  make no alarm here retorted the impenetrable dryfesdale but keep thy sinful oaths and silly threats for those that regard themi do mine office and carry the keys to the seneschaladieu my young master the cool night air will advantage your hot blood  the steward was right in what he said for the cooling breeze was very necessary to appease the feverish fit of anger which roland experienced nor did the remedy succeed for some time at length after some hasty turns made through the garden exhausting his passion in vain vows of vengeance roland graeme began to be sensible that his situation ought rather to be held as matter of laughter than of serious resentment to one bred a sportsman a night spent in the open air had in it little of hardship and the poor malice of the steward seemed more worthy of his contempt than his anger i would to god he said that the grim old man may always have contented himself with such sportive revenge he often looks as he were capable of doing us a darker turn returning therefore to the turfseat which he had formerly occupied and which was partially sheltered by a trim fence of green holly he drew his mantle around him stretched himself at length on the verdant settle and endeavoured to resume that sleep which the castle bell had interrupted to so little purpose  sleep like other earthly blessings is niggard of its favours when most courted the more roland invoked her aid the farther she fled from his eyelids he had been completely awakened first by the sounds of the bell and then by his own aroused vivacity of temper and he found it difficult again to compose himself to slumber at length when his mindwas wearied out with a maze of unpleasing meditation he succeeded in coaxing himself into a broken slumber this was again dispelled by the voices of two persons who were walking in the garden the sound of whose conversation after mingling for some time in the pages dreams at length succeeded in awaking him thoroughly he raised himself from his reclining posture in the utmost astonishment which the circumstance of hearing two persons at that late hour conversing on the outside of the watchfully guarded castle of lochloven was so well calculated to excite his first thought was of supernatural beings his next upon some attempt on the part of queen marys friends and followers his last was that george of douglas possessed of the keys and having the means of ingress and egress at pleasure was availing himself of his office to hold a rendezvous with catherine seyton in the castle garden he was confirmed in this opinion by the tone of the voice which asked in a low whisper whether all was ready     chapter the thirtieth     in some breasts passion lies conceald and silent   like wars swart powder in a castle vault   until occasion like the linstock lights it   then comes at once the lightningand the thunder   and distant echoes tell that all is rent asunder                                  old play  roland graeme availing himself of a breach in the holly screen and of the assistance of the full moon which was now arisen had a perfect opportunity himself unobserved to reconnoitre the persons and the motions of those by whom his rest had been thus unexpectedly disturbed and his observations confirmed his jealous apprehensions they stood together in close and earnest conversation within four yards of the place of his retreat and he could easily recognize the tall form and deep voice of douglas and the no less remarkable dress and tone of the page at the hostelry of saint michaels  i have been at the door of the pages apartment said douglas but he is not there or he will not answer it is fast bolted on the inside as is the custom and we cannot pass through itand what his silence may bode i know not  you have trusted him too far said the other a featherheaded coxcomb upon whose changeable mind and hot brain there is no making an abiding impression  it was not i who was willing to trust him said douglas but i was assured he would prove friendly when called uponfor here he spoke so low that roland lost the tenor of his words which was the more provoking as he was fully aware that he was himself the subject of their conversation  nay replied the stranger more aloud i have on my side put him off with fair words which make fools vainbut now if you distrust him at the push deal with him with your dagger and so make open passage  that were too rash said douglas and besides as i told you the door of his apartment is shut and bolted i will essay again to waken him  graeme instantly comprehended that the ladies having been somehow made aware of his being in the garden had secured the door of the outer room in which he usually slept as a sort of sentinel upon that only access to the queens apartments but then how came catherine seyton to be abroad if the queen and the other lady were still within their chambers and the access to them locked and boltedi will be instantly at the bottom of these mysteries he said and then thank mistress catherine if this be really she for the kind use which she exhorted douglas to make of his daggerthey seek me as i comprehend and they shall not seek me in vain  douglas had by this time reentered the castle by the wicket which was now open the stranger stood alone in the garden walk his arms folded on his breast and his eyes cast impatiently up to the moon as if accusing her of betraying him by the magnificence of her lustre in a moment roland graeme stood before hima goodly night he said mistress catherine for a young lady to stray forth in disguise and to meet with men in an orchard  hush said the stranger page hush thou foolish patch and tell us in a word if thou art friend or foe  how should i be friend to one who deceives me by fair words and who would have douglas deal with me with his poniard replied roland  the fiend receive george of douglas and thee too thou born madcap and sworn marplot said the other we shall be discovered and then death is the word  catherine said the page you have dealt falsely and cruelly with me and the moment of explanation is now comeneither it nor you shall escape me  madman said the stranger i am neither kate nor catherinethe moon shines bright enough surely to know the hart from the hind  that shift shall not serve you fair mistress said the page laying hold on the lap of the strangers cloak this time at least i will know with whom i deal  unhand me said she endeavouring to extricate herself from his grasp and in a tone where anger seemed to contend with a desire to laugh use you so little discretion towards a daughter of seyton  but as roland encouraged perhaps by her risibility to suppose his violence was not unpardonably offensive kept hold on her mantle she said in a sterner tone of unmixed resentmentmadman let me gothere is life and death in this momenti would not willingly hurt thee and yet beware  as she spoke she made a sudden effort to escape and in doing so a pistol which she carried in her hand or about her person went off  this warlike sound instantly awakened the wellwarded castle the warder blew his horn and began to toll the castle bell crying out at the same time fie treason treason cry all cry all  the apparition of catherine seyton which the page had let loose in the first moment of astonishment vanished in darkness but the plash of oars was heard and in a second or two five or six harquebuses and a falconet were fired from the battlements of the castle successively as if levelled at some object on the water confounded with these incidents no way for catherines protection supposing her to be in the boat which he had heard put from the shore occurred to roland save to have recourse to george of douglas he hastened for this purpose towards the apartment of the queen whence he heard loud voices and much trampling of feet when he entered he found himself added to a confused and astonished group which assembled in that apartment stood gazing upon each other at the upper end of the room stood the queen equipped as for a journey andattended not only by the lady fleming but by the omnipresent catherine seyton dressed in the habit of her own sex and bearing in her hand the casket in which mary kept such jewels as she had been permitted to retain at the other end of the hall was the lady of lochleven hastily dressed as one startled from slumber by the sudden alarm and surrounded by domestics some bearing torches others holding naked swords partisans pistols or such other weapons as they had caught up in the hurry of a night alarm betwixt these two parties stood george of douglas his arms folded on his breast his eyes bent on the ground like a criminal who knows not how to deny yet continues unwilling to avow the guilt in which he has been detected  speak george of douglas said the lady of lochleven speak and clear the horrid suspicion which rests on thy name say a douglas was never faithless to his trust and i am a douglas say this my dearest son and it is all i ask thee to say to clear thy name even under such a foul charge say it was but the wile of these unhappy women and this false boy which plotted an escape so fatal to scotlandso destructive to thy fathers house  madam said old dryfesdale the steward this much do i say for this silly page that he could not be accessary to unlocking the doors since i myself this night bolted him out of the castle whoever limned this nightpiece the lads share in it seems to have been small  thou liest dryfesdale said the lady and wouldst throw the blame on thy masters house to save the worthless life of a gipsy boy  his death were more desirable to me than his life answered the steward sullenly but the truth is the truth  at these words douglas raised his head drew up his figure to its full height and spoke boldly and sedately as one whose resolution was taken  let no life be endangered for me i alone  douglas said the queen interrupting him art thou mad speak not i charge you  madam he replied bowing with the deepest respect gladly would i obey your commands but they must have a victim and let it be the true oneyes madam he continued addressing the lady of lochleven i alone am guilty in this matter if the word of a douglas has yet any weight with you believe me that this boy is innocent and on your conscience i charge you do him no wrong nor let the queen suffer hardship for embracing the opportunity of freedom which sincere loyaltywhich a sentiment yet deeperoffered to her acceptance yes i had planned the escape of the most beautiful the most persecuted of women and far from regretting that i for a while deceived the malice of her enemies i glory in it and am most willing to yield up life itself in her cause  now may god have compassion on my age said the lady of lochleven and enable me to bear this load of affliction o princess born in a luckless hour when will you cease to be the instrument of seduction and of ruin to all who approach you o ancient house of lochleven famed so long for birth and honour evil was the hour which brought the deceiver under thy roof  say not so madam replied her grandson the old honours of the douglas line will be outshone when one of its descendants dies for the most injured of queensfor the most lovely of women  douglas said the queen must i at this momentay even at this moment when i may lose a faithful subject for ever chide thee for forgetting what is due to me as thy queen  wretched boy said the distracted lady of lochleven hast thou fallen even thus far into the snare of this moabitish womanhast thou bartered thy name thy allegiance thy knightly oath thy duty to thy parents thy country and thy god for a feigned tear or a sickly smile from lips which flattered the infirm francislured to death the idiot darnleyread luscious poetry with the minion chastelarmingled in the lays of love which were sung by the beggar rizzioand which were joined in rapture to those of the foul and licentious bothwell  blaspheme not madam said douglasnor you fair queen and virtuous as fair chide at this moment the presumption of thy vassalthink not that the mere devotion of a subject could have moved me to the part i have been performing well you deserve that each of your lieges should die for you but i have done morehave done that to which love alone could compel a douglasi have dissembled farewell then queen of all hearts and empress of that of douglaswhen you are freed from this vile bondageas freed you shall be if justice remains in heavenand when you load with honours and titles the happy man who shall deliver you cast one thought on him whose heart would have despised every reward for a kiss of your handcast one thought on his fidelity and drop one tear on his grave and throwing himself at her feet he seized her hand and pressed it to his lips  this before my face exclaimed the lady of lochlevenwilt thou court thy adulterous paramour before the eyes of a parenttear them asunder and put him under strict ward seize him upon your lives she added seeing that her attendants looked at each other with hesitation  they are doubtful said mary save thyself douglas i command thee  he started up from the floor and only exclaiming my life or death are yours and at your disposaldrew his sword and broke through those who stood betwixt him and the door the enthusiasm of his onset was too sudden and too lively to have been opposed by any thing short of the most decided opposition and as he was both loved and feared by his fathers vassals none of them would offer him actual injury  the lady of lochleven stood astonished at his sudden escapeam i surrounded she said by traitors upon him villainspursue stab cut him down  he cannot leave the island madam said dryfesdale interfering i have the key of the boatchain  but two or three voices of those who pursued from curiosity or command of their mistress exclaimed from below that he had cast himself into the lake  brave douglas still exclaimed the queenoh true and noble heart that prefers death to imprisonment  fire upon him said the lady of lochleven if there be here a true servant of his father let him shoot the runagate dead and let the lake cover our shame  the report of a gun or two was heard but they were probably shot rather to obey the lady than with any purpose of hitting the mark and randal immediately entering said that master george had been taken up by a boat from the castle which lay at a little distance  man a barge and pursue them said the lady  it were quite vain said randal by this time they are half way to shore and a cloud has come over the moon  and has the traitor then escaped said the lady pressing her hands against her forehead with a gesture of despair the honour of our house is for ever gone and all will be deemed accomplices in this base treachery  lady of lochleven said mary advancing towards her you have this night cut off my fairest hopesyou have turned my expected freedom into bondage and dashed away the cup of joy in the very instant i was advancing it to my lipsand yet i feel for your sorrow the pity that you deny to minegladly would i comfort you if i might but as i may not i would at least part from you in charity  away proud woman said the lady who ever knew so well as thou to deal the deepest wounds under the pretence of kindness and courtesywho since the great traitor could ever so betray with a kiss  lady douglas of lochleven said the queen in this moment thou canst not offend meno not even by thy coarse and unwomanly language held to me in the presence of menials and armed retainers i have this night owed so much to one member of the house of lochleven as to cancel whatever its mistress can do or say in the wildness of her passion  we are bounden to you princess said lady lochleven putting a strong constraint on herself and passing from her tone of violence to that of bitter irony our poor house hath been but seldom graced with royal smiles and will hardly with my choice exchange their rough honesty for such courthonour as mary of scotland has now to bestow  they replied mary who knew so well how to take may think themselves excused from the obligation implied in receiving and that i have now little to offer is the fault of the douglasses and their allies  fear nothing madam replied the lady of lochleven in the same bitter tone you retain an exchequer which neither your own prodigality can drain nor your offended country deprive you of while you have fair words and delusive smiles at command you need no other bribes to lure youth to folly  the queen cast not an ungratified glance on a large mirror which hanging on one side of the apartment and illuminated by the torchlight reflected her beautiful face and person our hostess grows complaisant she said my fleming we had not thought that grief and captivity had left us so well stored with that sort of wealth which ladies prize most dearly  your grace will drive this severe woman frantic said fleming in a low tone on my knees i implore you to remember she is already dreadfully offended and that we are in her power  i will not spare her fleming answered the queen it is against my nature she returned my honest sympathy with insult and abuse and i will gall her in returnif her words are too blunt for answer let her use her poniard if she dare  the lady lochleven said the lady fleming aloud would surely do well now to withdraw and to leave her grace to repose  ay replied the lady or to leave her grace and her graces minions to think what silly fly they may next wrap their meshes about my eldest son is a widowerwere he not more worthy the flattering hopes with which you have seduced his brothertrue the yoke of marriage has been already thrice fitted onbut the church of rome calls it a sacrament and its votaries may deem it one in which they cannot too often participate  and the votaries of the church of geneva replied mary colouring with indignation as they deem marriage no sacrament are said at times to dispense with the holy ceremonythen as if afraid of the consequences of this home allusion to the errors of lady lochlevens early life the queen added come my fleming we grace her too much by this altercation we will to our sleeping apartment if she would disturb us again tonight she must cause the door to be forced so saying she retired to her bedroom followed by her two women  lady lochleven stunned as it were by this last sarcasm and not the less deeply incensed that she had drawn it upon herself remained like a statue on the spot which she had occupied when she received an affront so flagrant dryfesdale and randal endeavoured to rouse her to recollection by questions  what is your honourable ladyships pleasure in the premises  shall we not double the sentinels and place one upon the boats and another in the garden said randal  would you that despatches were sent to sir william at edinburgh to acquaint him with what has happened demanded dryfesdale and ought not the place of kinross to be alarmed lest there be force upon the shores of the lake  do all as thou wilt said the lady collecting herself and about to depart thou hast the name of a good soldier dryfesdale take all precautionssacred heaven that i should be thus openly insulted  would it be your pleasure said dryfesdale hesitating that this personthis ladybe more severely restrained  no vassal answered the lady indignantly my revenge stoops not to so low a gratification but i will have more worthy vengeance or the tomb of my ancestors shall cover my shame  and you shall have it madam replied dryfesdaleere two suns go down you shall term yourself amply revenged  the lady made no answerperhaps did not hear his words as she presently left the apartment by the command of dryfesdale the rest of the attendants were dismissed some to do the duty of guard others to their repose the steward himself remained after they had all departed and roland graeme who was alone in the apartment was surprised to see the old soldier advance towards him with an air of greater cordiality than he had ever before assumed to him but which sat ill on his scowling features  youth he said i have done thee some wrongit is thine own fault for thy behaviour hath seemed as light to me as the feather thou wearest in thy hat and surely thy fantastic apparel and idle humour of mirth and folly have made me construe thee something harshly but i saw this night from my casement as i looked out to see how thou hadst disposed of thyself in the garden i saw i say the true efforts which thou didst make to detain the companion of the perfidy of him who is no longer worthy to be called by his fathers name but must be cut off from his house like a rotten branch i was just about to come to thy assistance when the pistol went off and the warder a false knave whom i suspect to be bribed for the nonce saw himself forced to give the alarm which perchance till then he had wilfully withheld to atone therefore for my injustice towards you i would willingly render you a courtesy if you would accept of it from my hands  may i first crave to know what it is replied the page  simply to carry the news of this discovery to holyrood where thou mayest do thyself much grace as well with the earl of morton and the regent himself as with sir william douglas seeing thou hast seen the matter from end to end and borne faithful part therein the making thine own fortune will be thus lodged in thine own hand when i trust thou wilt estrange thyself from foolish vanities and learn to walk in this world as one who thinks upon the next  sir steward said roland graeme i thank you for your courtesy but i may not do your errand i pass that i am the queens sworn servant and may not be of counsel against her but setting this apart methinks it were a bad road to sir william of lochlevens favour to be the first to tell him of his sons defectionneither would the regent be over well pleased to hear the infidelity of his vassal nor morton to learn the falsehood of his kinsman  um said the steward making that inarticulate sound which expresses surprise mingled with displeasure nay then even fly where ye list for giddypated as ye may be you know how to bear you in the world  i will show you my esteem is less selfish than ye think for said the page for i hold truth and mirth to be better than gravity and cunningay and in the end to be a match for themyou never loved me less sir steward than you do at this moment i know you will give me no real confidence and i am resolved to accept no false protestations as current coin resume your old coursesuspect me as much and watch me as closely as you will i bid you defianceyou have met with your match  by heaven young man said the steward with a look of bitter malignity if thou darest to attempt any treachery towards the house of lochleven thy head shall blacken in the sun from the warders turret  he cannot commit treachery who refuses trust said the page and for my head it stands as securely on my shoulders as on any turret that ever mason built  farewell thou prating and speckled pie said dryfesdale that art so vain of thine idle tongue and variegated coat beware trap and limetwig  and fare thee well thou hoarse old raven answered the page thy solemn flight sable hue and deep croak are no charms against birdbolt or hailshot and that thou mayst findit is open war betwixt us each for the cause of our mistress and god show the right  amen and defend his own people said the steward i will let my mistress know what addition thou hast made to this mess of traitors good night monsieur featherpate  goodnight seignior sowersby replied the page and when the old man departed he betook himself to rest     chapter the thirtyfirst     poisondill faredead forsook cast off                                   king john  however weary roland graeme might be of the castle of lochlevenhowever much he might wish that the plan for marys escape had been perfected i question if he ever awoke with more pleasing feelings than on the morning after george douglass plan for accomplishing her deliverance had been frustrated in the first place he had the clearest conviction that he had misunderstood the innuendo of the abbot and that the affections of douglas were fixed not on catherine seyton but on the queen and in the second place from the sort of explanation which had taken place betwixt the steward and him he felt himself at liberty without any breach of honour towards the family of lochleven to contribute his best aid to any scheme which should in future be formed for the queens escape and independently of the goodwill which he himself had to the enterprise he knew he could find no surer road to the favour of catherine seyton he now sought but an opportunity to inform her that he had dedicated himself to this task and fortune was propitious in affording him one which was unusually favourable  at the ordinary hour of breakfast it was introduced by the steward with his usual forms who as soon as it was placed on the board in the inner apartment said to roland graeme with a glance of sarcastic import i leave you my young sir to do the office of sewerit has been too long rendered to the lady mary by one belonging to the house of douglas  were it the prime and principal who ever bore the name said roland the office were an honour to him  the steward departed without replying to this bravade otherwise than by a dark look of scorn graeme thus left alone busied himself as one engaged in a labour of love to imitate as well as he could the grace and courtesy with which george of douglas was wont to render his ceremonial service at meals to the queen of scotland there was more than youthful vanitythere was a generous devotion in the feeling with which he took up the task as a brave soldier assumes the place of a comrade who has fallen in the front of battle i am now he said their only champion and come weal come wo i will be to the best of my skill and power as faithful as trustworthy as brave as any douglas of them all could have been  at this moment catherine seyton entered alone contrary to her custom and not less contrary to her custom she entered with her kerchief at her eyes roland graeme approached her with beating heart and with downcast eyes and asked her in a low and hesitating voice whether the queen were well  can you suppose it said catherine think you her heart and body are framed of steel and iron to endure the cruel disappointment of yester even and the infamous taunts of yonder puritanic hagwould to god that i were a man to aid her more effectually  if those who carry pistols and batons and poniards said the page are not men they are at least amazons and that is as formidable  you are welcome to the flash of your wit sir replied the damsel i am neither in spirits to enjoy nor to reply to it  well then said the page list to me in all serious truth and first let me say that the gear last night had been smoother had you taken me into your counsels  and so we meant but who could have guessed that master page should choose to pass all night in the garden like some moonstricken knight in a spanish romanceinstead of being in his bedroom when douglas came to hold communication with him on our project  and why said the page defer to so late a moment so important a confidence  because your communications with henderson andwith pardonthe natural impetuosity and fickleness of your disposition made us dread to entrust you with a secret of such consequence till the last moment  and why at the last moment said the page offended at this frank avowal why at that or any other moment since i had the misfortune to incur so much suspicion  naynow you are angry again said catherine and to serve you aright i should break off this talk but i will be magnanimous and answer your question know then our reason for trusting you was twofold in the first place we could scarce avoid it since you slept in the room through which we had to pass in the second place  nay said the page you may dispense with a second reason when the first makes your confidence in me a case of necessity  good now hold thy peace said catherine in the second place as i said before there is one foolish person among us who believes that roland graemes heart is warm though his head is giddythat his blood is pure though it boils too hastilyand that his faith and honour are true as the loadstar though his tongue sometimes is far less than discreet  this avowal catherine repeated in a low tone with her eye fixed on the floor as if she shunned the glance of roland while she suffered it to escape her lipsand this single friend exclaimed the youth in rapture this only one who would do justice to the poor roland graeme and whose own generous heart taught her to distinguish between follies of the brain and faults of the heartwill you not tell me dearest catherine to whom i owe my most grateful my most heartfelt thanks  nay said catherine with her eyes still fixed on the ground if your own heart tell you not  dearest catherine said the page seizing upon her hand and kneeling on one knee  if your own heart i say tell you not said catherine gently disengaging her hand it is very ungrateful for since the maternal kindness of the lady fleming  the page started on his feet by heaven catherine your tongue wears as many disguises as your person but you only mock me cruel girl you know the lady fleming has no more regard for any one than hath the forlorn princess who is wrought into yonder piece of old figured court tapestry  it may be so said catherine seyton but you should not speak so loud  pshaw answered the page but at the same time lowering his voice she cares for no one but herself and the queen and you know besides there is no one of you whose opinion i value if i have not your own nonot that of queen mary herself  the more shame for you if it be so said catherine with great composure  nay but fair catherine said the page why will you thus damp my ardour when i am devoting myself body and soul to the cause of your mistress  it is because in doing so said catherine you debase a cause so noble by naming along with it any lower or more selfish motive believe me she said with kindling eyes and while the blood mantled on her cheek they think vilely and falsely of womeni mean of those who deserve the namewho deem that they love the gratification of their vanity or the mean purpose of engrossing a lovers admiration and affection better than they love the virtue and honour of the man they may be brought to prefer he that serves his religion his prince and his country with ardour and devotion need not plead his cause with the commonplace rant of romantic passionthe woman whom he honours with his love becomes his debtor and her corresponding affection is engaged to repay his glorious toil  you hold a glorious prize for such toil said the youth bending his eyes on her with enthusiasm  only a heart which knows how to value it said catherine he that should free this injured princess from these dungeons and set her at liberty among her loyal and warlike nobles whose hearts are burning to welcome herwhere is the maiden in scotland whom the love of such a hero would not honour were she sprung from the blood royal of the land and he the offspring of the poorest cottager that ever held a plough  i am determined said roland to take the adventure tell me first however fair catherine and speak it as if you were confessing to the priestthis poor queen i know she is unhappybut catherine do you hold her innocent she is accused of murder  do i hold the lamb guilty because it is assailed by the wolf answered catherine do i hold yonder sun polluted because an earthdamp sullies his beams  the page sighed and looked down would my conviction were as deep as thine but one thing is clear that in this captivity she hath wrongshe rendered herself up on a capitulation and the terms have been refused heri will embrace her quarrel to the death  will youwill you indeed said catherine taking his hand in her turn oh be but firm in mind as thou art bold in deed and quick in resolution keep but thy plighted faith and after ages shall honour thee as the saviour of scotland  but when i have toiled successfully to win that leah honour thou wilt not my catherine said the page condemn me to a new term of service for that rachel love  of that said catherine again extricating her hand from his grasp we shall have full time to speak but honour is the elder sister and must be won the first  i may not win her answered the page but i will venture fairly for her and man can do no more and know fair catherinefor you shall see the very secret thought of my heartthat not honour onlynot only that other and fairer sister whom you frown on me for so much as mentioningbut the stern commands of duty also compel me to aid the queens deliverance  indeed said catherine you were wont to have doubts on that matter  ay but her life was not then threatened replied roland  and is it now more endangered than heretofore asked catherine seyton in anxious terror  be not alarmed said the page but you heard the terms on which your royal mistress parted with the lady of lochleven  too wellbut too well said catherine alas that she cannot rule her princely resentment and refrain from encounters like these  that hath passed betwixt them said roland for which woman never forgives woman i saw the ladys brow turn pale and then black when before all the menzie and in her moment of power the queen humbled her to the dust by taxing her with her shame and i heard the oath of deadly resentment and revenge which she muttered in the ear of one who by his answer will i judge be but too ready an executioner of her will  you terrify me said catherine  do not so take itcall up the masculine part of your spiritwe will counteract and defeat her plans be they dangerous as they may why do you look upon me thus and weep  alas said catherine because you stand there before me a living and breathing man in all the adventurous glow and enterprise of youth yet still possessing the frolic spirits of childhoodthere you stand full alike of generous enterprise and childish recklessness and if today or tomorrow or some such brief space you lie a mangled and lifeless corpse upon the floor of these hateful dungeons who but catherine seyton will be the cause of your brave and gay career being broken short as you start from the goal alas she whom you have chosen to twine your wreath may too probably have to work your shroud  and be it so catherine said the page in the full glow of youthful enthusiasm and do thou work my shroud and if thou grace it with such tears as fall now at the thought it will honour my remains more than an earls mantle would my living body but shame on this faintness of heart the time craves a firmer moodbe a woman catherine or rather be a manthou canst be a man if thou wilt  catherine dried her tears and endeavoured to smile  you must not ask me she said about that which so much disturbs your mind you shall know all in timenay you should know all now but thathush here comes the queen  mary entered from her apartment paler than usual and apparently exhausted by a sleepless night and by the painful thoughts which had ill supplied the place of repose yet the languor of her looks was so far from impairing her beauty that it only substituted the frail delicacy of the lovely woman for the majestic grace of the queen contrary to her wont her toilette had been very hastily despatched and her hair which was usually dressed by lady fleming with great care escaping from beneath the headtire which had been hastily adjusted fell in long and luxuriant tresses of natures own curling over a neck and bosom which were somewhat less carefully veiled than usual  as she stepped over the threshold of her apartment catherine hastily drying her tears ran to meet her royal mistress and having first kneeled at her feet and kissed her hand instantly rose and placing herself on the other side of the queen seemed anxious to divide with the lady fleming the honour of supporting and assisting her the page on his part advanced and put in order the chair of state which she usually occupied and having placed the cushion and footstool for her accommodation stepped back and stood ready for service in the place usually occupied by his predecessor the young seneschal marys eye rested an instant on him and could not but remark the change of persons hers was not the female heart which could refuse compassion at least to a gallant youth who had suffered in her cause although he had been guided in his enterprise by a too presumptuous passion and the words poor douglas escaped from her lips perhaps unconsciously as she leant herself back in her chair and put the kerchief to her eyes  yes gracious madam said catherine assuming a cheerful manner in order to cheer her sovereign our gallant knight is indeed banishedthe adventure was not reserved for him but he has left behind him a youthful esquire as much devoted to your graces service and who by me makes you tender of his hand and sword  if they may in aught avail your grace said roland graeme bowing profoundly  alas said the queen what needs this catherinewhy prepare new victims to be involved in and overwhelmed by my cruel fortunewere we not better cease to struggle and ourselves sink in the tide without farther resistance than thus drag into destruction with us every generous heart which makes an effort in our favouri have had but too much of plot and intrigue around me since i was stretched an orphan child in my very cradle while contending nobles strove which should rule in the name of the unconscious innocent surely time it were that all this busy and most dangerous coil should end let me call my prison a convent and my seclusion a voluntary sequestration of myself from the world and its ways  speak not thus madam before your faithful servants said catherine to discourage their zeal at once and to break their hearts daughter of kings be not in this hour so unkinglycome roland and let us the youngest of her followers show ourselves worthy of her causelet us kneel before her footstool and implore her to be her own magnanimous self and leading roland graeme to the queens seat they both kneeled down before her mary raised herself in her chair and sat erect while extending one hand to be kissed by the page she arranged with the other the clustering locks which shaded the bold yet lovely brow of the highspirited catherine  alas ma mignóne she said for so in fondness she often called her young attendant that you should thus desperately mix with my unhappy fate the fortune of your young livesare they not a lovely couple my fleming and is it not heartrending to think that i must be their ruin  not so said roland graeme it is we gracious sovereign who will be your deliverers  ex oribus parvulorum said the queen looking upward if it is by the mouth of these children that heaven calls me to resume the stately thoughts which become my birth and my rights thou wilt grant them thy protection and to me the power of rewarding their zealthen turning to fleming she instantly addedthou knowest my friend whether to make those who have served me happy was not ever marys favourite pastime when i have been rebuked by the stern preachers of the calvinistic heresywhen i have seen the fierce countenances of my nobles averted from me has it not been because i mixed in the harmless pleasures of the young and gay and rather for the sake of their happiness than my own have mingled in the masque the song or the dance with the youth of my household well i repent not of itthough knox termed it sin and morton degradationi was happy because i saw happiness around me and woe betide the wretched jealousy that can extract guilt out of the overflowings of an unguarded gaietyfleming if we are restored to our throne shall we not have one blithesome day at a blithesome bridal of which we must now name neither the bride nor the bridegroom but that bridegroom shall have the barony of blairgowrie a fair gift even for a queen to give and that brides chaplet shall be twined with the fairest pearls that ever were found in the depths of lochlomond and thou thyself mary fleming the best dresser of tires that ever busked the tresses of a queen and who would scorn to touch those of any woman of lower rankthou thyself shalt for my love twine them into the brides tresseslook my fleming suppose them such clustered locks as those of our catherine they would not put shame upon thy skill  so saying she passed her hand fondly over the head of her youthful favourite while her more aged attendant replied despondently alas madam your thoughts stray far from home  they do my fleming said the queen but is it well or kind in you to call them backgod knows they have kept the perch this night but too closelycome i will recall the gay vision were it but to punish them yes at that blithesome bridal mary herself shall forget the weight of sorrows and the toil of state and herself once more lead a measureat whose wedding was it that we last danced my fleming i think care has troubled my memoryyet something of it i should remembercanst thou not aid mei know thou canst  alas madam replied the lady  what said mary wilt thou not help us so far this is a peevish adherence to thine own graver opinion which holds our talk as folly but thou art courtbred and wilt well understand me when i say the queen commands lady fleming to tell her where she led the last branle  with a face deadly pale and a mien as if she were about to sink into the earth the courtbred dame no longer daring to refuse obedience faltered outgracious ladyif my memory err notit was at a masque in holyroodat the marriage of sebastian  the unhappy queen who had hitherto listened with a melancholy smile provoked by the reluctance with which the lady fleming brought out her story at this illfated word interrupted her with a shriek so wild and loud that the vaulted apartment rang and both roland and catherine sprang to their feet in the utmost terror and alarm meantime mary seemed by the train of horrible ideas thus suddenly excited surprised not only beyond selfcommand but for the moment beyond the verge of reason  traitress she said to the lady fleming thou wouldst slay thy sovereigncall my french guardsa moi a moi mes français i am beset with traitors in mine own palacethey have murdered my husbandrescue rescue for the queen of scotland she started up from her chairher features late so exquisitely lovely in their paleness now inflamed with the fury of frenzy and resembling those of a bellona we will take the field ourself she said warn the citywarn lothian and fifesaddle our spanish barb and bid french paris see our petronel be chargedbetter to die at the head of our brave scotsmen like our grandfather at flodden than of a broken heart like our illstarred father  be patientbe composed dearest sovereign said catherine and then addressing lady fleming angrily she added how could you say aught that reminded her of her husband  the word reached the ear of the unhappy princess who caught it up speaking with great rapidity husbandwhat husbandnot his most christian majestyhe is ill at easehe cannot mount on horsebacknot him of the lennoxbut it was the duke of orkney thou wouldst say  for gods love madam be patient said the lady fleming  but the queens excited imagination could by no entreaty be diverted from its course bid him come hither to our aid she said and bring with him his lambs as he calls thembowton hay of talla black ormiston and his kinsman hobfie how swart they are and how they smell of sulphur what closeted with morton nay if the douglas and the hepburn hatch the complot together the bird when it breaks the shell will scare scotland will it not my fleming  she grows wilder and wilder said fleming we have too many hearers for these strange words  roland said catherine in the name of god begone you cannot aid us hereleave us to deal with her aloneawayaway  she thrust him to the door of the anteroom yet even when he had entered that apartment and shut the door he could still hear the queen talk in a loud and determined tone as if giving forth orders until at length the voice died away in a feeble and continued lamentation  at this crisis catherine entered the anteroom be not too anxious she said the crisis is now over but keep the door fastlet no one enter until she is more composed  in the name of god what does this mean said the page or what was there in the lady flemings words to excite so wild a transport  oh the lady fleming the lady fleming said catherine repeating the words impatiently the lady fleming is a foolshe loves her mistress yet knows so little how to express her love that were the queen to ask her for very poison she would deem it a point of duty not to resist her commands i could have torn her starched headtire from her formal headthe queen should have as soon had the heart out of my body as the word sebastian out of my lipsthat that piece of weaved tapestry should be a woman and yet not have wit enough to tell a lie  and what was this story of sebastian said the page by heaven catherine you are all riddles alike  you are as great a fool as fleming returned the impatient maiden know ye not that on the night of henry darnleys murder and at the blowing up of the kirk of field the queens absence was owing to her attending on a masque at holyrood given by her to grace the marriage of this same sebastian who himself a favoured servant married one of her female attendants who was near to her person  by saint giles said the page i wonder not at her passion but only marvel by what forgetfulness it was that she could urge the lady fleming with such a question  i cannot account for it said catherine but it seems as if great and violent grief and horror sometimes obscure the memory and spread a cloud like that of an exploding cannon over the circumstances with which they are accompanied but i may not stay here where i came not to moralize with your wisdom but simply to cool my resentment against that unwise lady fleming which i think hath now somewhat abated so that i shall endure her presence without any desire to damage either her curch or vasquine meanwhile keep fast that doori would not for my life that any of these heretics saw her in the unhappy state which brought on her as it has been by the success of their own diabolical plottings they would not stick to call in their snuffling cant the judgment of providence  she left the apartment just as the latch of the outward door was raised from without but the bolt which roland had drawn on the inside resisted the efforts of the person desirous to enter who is there said graeme aloud  it is i replied the harsh and yet slow voice of the steward dryfesdale  you cannot enter now returned the youth  and wherefore demanded dryfesdale seeing i come but to do my duty and inquire what mean the shrieks from the apartment of the moabitish woman wherefore i say since such is mine errand can i not enter  simply replied the youth because the bolt is drawn and i have no fancy to undo it i have the right side of the door today as you had last night  thou art illadvised thou malapert boy replied the steward to speak to me in such fashion but i shall inform my lady of thine insolence  the insolence said the page is meant for thee only in fair guerdon of thy discourtesy to me for thy ladys information i have answer more courteousyou may say that the queen is ill at ease and desires to be disturbed neither by visits nor messages  i conjure you in the name of god said the old man with more solemnity in his tone than he had hitherto used to let me know if her malady really gains power on her  she will have no aid at your hand or at your ladyswherefore begone and trouble us no morewe neither want nor will accept of aid at your hands  with this positive reply the steward grumbling and dissatisfied returned down stairs     chapter the thirtysecond     it is the curse of kings to be attended   by slaves who take their humours for a warrant   to break into the bloody house of life   and on the winking of authority   to understand a law                           king john  the lady of lochleven sat alone in her chamber endeavouring with sincere but imperfect zeal to fix her eyes and her attention on the blacklettered bible which lay before her bound in velvet and embroidery and adorned with massive silver clasps and knosps but she found her utmost efforts unable to withdraw her mind from the resentful recollection of what had last night passed betwixt her and the queen in which the latter had with such bitter taunt reminded her of her early and longrepented transgression  why she said should i resent so deeply that another reproaches me with that which i have never ceased to make matter of blushing to myself  and yet why should this woman who reapsat least has reapedthe fruits of my folly and has jostled my son aside from the throne why should she in the face of all my domestics and of her own dare to upbraid me with my shame is she not in my power does she not fear me  ha wily tempter i will wrestle with thee strongly and with better suggestions than my own evil heart can supply  she again took up the sacred volume and was endeavouring to fix her attention on its contents when she was disturbed by a tap at the door of the room it opened at her command and the steward dryfesdale entered and stood before her with a gloomy and perturbed expression on his brow  what has chanced dryfesdale that thou lookest thus said his mistresshave there been evil tidings of my son or of my grandchildren  no lady replied dryfesdale but you were deeply insulted last night and i fear me thou art as deeply avenged this morningwhere is the chaplain  what mean you by hints so dark and a question so sudden the chaplain as you well know is absent at perth upon an assembly of the brethren  i care not answered the steward he is but a priest of baal  dryfesdale said the lady sternly what meanest thou i have ever heard that in the low countries thou didst herd with the anabaptist preachers those boars which tear up the vintagebut the ministry which suits me and my house must content my retainers  i would i had good ghostly counsel though replied the steward not attending to his mistresss rebuke and seeming to speak to himself this woman of moab  speak of her with reverence said the lady she is a kings daughter  be it so replied dryfesdale she goes where there is little difference betwixt her and a beggars childmary of scotland is dying  dying and in my castle said the lady starting up in alarm of what disease or by what accident  bear patience lady the ministry was mine  thine villain and traitorhow didst thou dare  i heard you insulted ladyi heard you demand vengeancei promised you should have it and i now bring tidings of it  dryfesdale i trust thou ravest said the lady  i rave not replied the steward that which was written of me a million of years ere i saw the light must be executed by me she hath that in her veins that i fear me will soon stop the springs of life cruel villain exclaimed the lady thou hast not poisoned her and if i had said dryfesdale what does it so greatly merit men  bane verminwhy not rid them of their enemies so in italy they will do it for a cruizuedor  cowardly ruffian begone from my sight  think better of my zeal lady said the steward and judge not without looking around you lindesay ruthven and your kinsman morton poniarded rizzio and yet you now see no blood on their embroiderythe lord semple stabbed the lord of sanquhardoes his bonnet sit a jot more awry on his brow what noble lives in scotland who has not had a share for policy or revenge in some such dealingand who imputes it to them be not cheated with namesa dagger or a draught work to the same end and are little unlikea glass phial imprisons the one and a leathern sheath the otherone deals with the brain the other sluices the bloodyet i say not i gave aught to this lady  what dost thou mean by thus dallying with me said the lady as thou wouldst save thy neck from the rope it merits tell me the whole truth of this storythou hast long been known a dangerous man  ay in my masters service i can be cold and sharp as my sword be it known to you that when last on shore i consulted with a woman of skill and power called nicneven of whom the country has rung for some brief time past fools asked her for charms to make them beloved misers for means to increase their store some demanded to know the futurean idle wish since it cannot be altered others would have an explanation of the pastidler still since it cannot be recalled i heard their queries with scorn and demanded the means of avenging myself of a deadly enemy for i grow old and may trust no longer to bilboa blade she gave me a packetmix that said she with any liquid and thy vengeance is complete  villain and you mixed it with the food of this imprisoned lady to the dishonour of thy masters house  to redeem the insulted honour of my masters house i mixed the contents of the packet with the jar of succorywater they seldom fail to drain it and the woman loves it over all  it was a work of hell said the lady lochleven both the asking and the grantingaway wretched man let us see if aid be yet too late  they will not admit us madam save we enter by forcei have been twice at the door but can obtain no entrance  we will beat it level with the ground if needfuland holdsummon randal hither instantlyrandal here is a foul and evil chance befallensend off a boat instantly to kinross the chamberlain luke lundin is said to have skillfetch off too that foul witch nicneven she shall first counteract her own spell and then be burned to ashes in the island of saint serf away awaytell them to hoist sail and ply oar as ever they would have good of the douglass hand  mother nicneven will not be lightly found or fetched hither on these conditions answered dryfesdale  then grant her full assurance of safetylook to it for thine own life must answer for this ladys recovery  i might have guessed that said dryfesdale sullenly but it is my comfort i have avenged mine own cause as well as yours she hath scoffed and scripped at me and encouraged her saucy minion of a page to ridicule my stiff gait and slow speech i felt it borne in upon me that i was to be avenged on them  go to the western turret said the lady and remain there in ward until we see how this gear will terminate i know thy resolved dispositionthou wilt not attempt escape  not were the walls of the turret of eggshells and the lake sheeted ice said dryfesdale i am well taught and strong in belief that man does nought of himself he is but the foam on the billow which rises bubbles and bursts not by its own effort but by the mightier impulse of fate which urges him yet lady if i may advise amid this zeal for the life of the jezebel of scotland forget not what is due to thine own honour and keep the matter secret as you may  so saying the gloomy fatalist turned from her and stalked off with sullen composure to the place of confinement allotted to him  his lady caught at his last hint and only expressed her fear that the prisoner had partaken of some unwholesome food and was dangerously ill the castle was soon alarmed and in confusion randal was dispatched to the shore to fetch off lundin with such remedies as could counteract poison and with farther instructions to bring mother nicneven if she could be found with full power to pledge the lady of lochlevens word for her safety  meanwhile the lady of lochleven herself held parley at the door of the queens apartment and in vain urged the page to undo it  foolish boy she said thine own life and thy ladys are at stake open i say or we will cause the door to be broken down  i may not open the door without my royal mistresss orders answered roland she has been very ill and now she slumbersif you wake her by using violence let the consequence be on you and your followers  was ever woman in a strait so fearful exclaimed the lady of lochlevenat least thou rash boy beware that no one tastes the food but especially the jar of succorywater  she then hastened to the turret where dryfesdale had composedly resigned himself to imprisonment she found him reading and demanded of him was thy fell potion of speedy operation  slow answered the steward the hag asked me which i chosei told her i loved a slow and sure revenge revenge said i is the highestflavoured draught which man tastes upon earth and he should sip it by little and littlenot drain it up greedily at once  against whom unhappy man couldst thou nourish so fell a revenge  i had many objects but the chief was that insolent page  the boythou inhuman man exclaimed the lady what could he do to deserve thy malice  he rose in your favour and you graced him with your commissions that was one thing he rose in that of george douglass alsothat was another he was the favourite of the calvinistic henderson who hated me because my spirit disowns a separated priesthood the moabitish queen held him dearwinds from each opposing point blew in his favourthe old servitor of your house was held lightly among yeabove all from the first time i saw his face i longed to destroy him  what fiend have i nurtured in my house replied the lady may god forgive me the sin of having given thee food and raiment  you might not choose lady answered the steward long ere this castle was buildeday long ere the islet which sustains it reared its head above the blue water i was destined to be your faithful slave and you to be my ungrateful mistress remember you not when i plunged amid the victorious french in the time of this ladys mother and brought off your husband when those who had hung at the same breasts with him dared not attempt the rescueremember how i plunged into the lake when your grandsons skiff was overtaken by the tempest boarded and steered her safe to the land ladythe servant of a scottish baron is he who regards not his own life or that of any other save his master and for the death of the woman i had tried the potion on her sooner had not master george been her taster her deathwould it not be the happiest news that scotland ever heard is she not of the bloody guisian stock whose sword was so often red with the blood of gods saints is she not the daughter of the wretched tyrant james whom heaven cast down from his kingdom and his pride even as the king of babylon was smitten  peace villain  said the ladya thousand varied recollections thronging on her mind at the mention of her royal lovers name peace and disturb not the ashes of the deadof the royal of the unhappy dead read thy bible and may god grant thee to avail thyself better of its contents than thou hast yet done she departed hastily and as she reached the next apartment the tears rose in her eyes so hastily that she was compelled to stop and use her kerchief to dry them i expected not this she said no more than to have drawn water from the dry flint or sap from a withered tree i saw with a dry eye the apostacy and shame of george douglas the hope of my sons housethe child of my love and yet i now weep for him who has so long lain in his gravefor him to whom i owe it that his daughter can make a scoffing and a jest of my name but she is his daughtermy heart hardened against her for so many causes relents when a glance of her eye places her father unexpectedly before meand as often her likeness to that true daughter of the house of guise her detested mother has again confirmed my resolution but she must notmust not die in my house and by so foul a practice thank god the operation of the potion is slow and may be counteracted i will to her apartment once more but oh that hardened villain whose fidelity we held in such esteem and had such high proof of what miracle can unite so much wickedness and so much truth in one bosom  the lady of lochleven was not aware how far minds of a certain gloomy and determined cast by nature may be warped by a keen sense of petty injuries and insults combining with the love of gain and sense of selfinterest and amalgamated with the crude wild and indigested fanatical opinions which this man had gathered among the crazy sectaries of germany or how far the doctrines of fatalism which he had embraced so decidedly sear the human conscience by representing our actions as the result of inevitable necessity  during her visit to the prisoner roland had communicated to catherine the tenor of the conversation he had had with her at the door of the apartment the quick intelligence of that lively maiden instantly comprehended the outline of what was believed to have happened but her prejudices hurried her beyond the truth  they meant to have poisoned us she exclaimed in horror and there stands the fatal liquor which should have done the deeday as soon as douglas ceased to be our taster our food was likely to be fatally seasoned thou roland who shouldst have made the essay wert readily doomed to die with us oh dearest lady fleming pardon pardon for the injuries i said to you in my angeryour words were prompted by heaven to save our lives and especially that of the injured queen but what have we now to do that old crocodile of the lake will be presently back to shed her hypocritical tears over our dying agonieslady fleming what shall we do  our lady help us in our need  she replied how should i tell unless we were to make our plaint to the regent  make our plaint to the devil said catherine impatiently and accuse his dam at the foot of his burning thronethe queen still sleepswe must gain time the poisoning hag must not know her scheme has miscarried the old envenomed spider has but too many ways of mending her broken web the jar of succorywater said sheroland if thou best a man help meempty the jar on the chimney or from the windowmake such waste among the viands as if we had made our usual meal and leave the fragments on cup and porringer but taste nothing as thou lovest thy life i will sit by the queen and tell her at her waking in what a fearful pass we stand her sharp wit and ready spirit will teach us what is best to be done meanwhile till farther notice observe roland that the queen is in a state of torporthat lady fleming is indisposedthat character speaking in a lower tone will suit her best and save her wits some labour in vain i am not so much indisposed thou understandest  and i said the page  you replied catherine you are quite wellwho thinks it worth while to poison puppydogs or pages  does this levity become the time asked the page  it does it does answered catherine seyton if the queen approves i see plainly how this disconcerted attempt may do us good service  she went to work while she spoke eagerly assisted by roland the breakfast table soon displayed the appearance as if the meal had been eaten as usual and the ladies retired as softly as possible into the queens sleeping apartment at a new summons of the lady lochleven the page undid the door and admitted her into the anteroom asking her pardon for having withstood her alleging in excuse that the queen had fallen into a heavy slumber since she had broken her fast  she has eaten and drunken then said the lady of lochleven  surely replied the page according to her graces ordinary custom unless upon the fasts of the church  the jar she said hastily examining it it is emptydrank the lady mary the whole of this water  a large part madam and i heard the lady catherine seyton jestingly upbraid the lady mary fleming with having taken more than a just share of what remained so that but little fell to her own lot  and are they well in health said the lady of lochleven  lady fleming said the page complains of lethargy and looks duller than usual and the lady catherine of seyton feels her head somewhat more giddy than is her wont  he raised his voice a little as he said these words to apprise the ladies of the part assigned to each of them and not perhaps without the wish of conveying to the ears of catherine the pagelike jest which lurked in the allotment  i will enter the queens bedchamber said the lady of lochleven my business is express  as she advanced to the door the voice of catherine seyton was heard from withinno one can enter herethe queen sleeps  i will not be controlled young lady replied the lady of lochleven there is i wot no inner bar and i will enter in your despite  there is indeed no inner bar answered catherine firmly but there are the staples where that bar should be and into those staples have i thrust mine arm like an ancestress of your own when better employed than the douglasses of our days she thus defended the bedchamber of her sovereign against murderers try your force then and see whether a seyton cannot rival in courage a maiden of the house of douglas  i dare not attempt the pass at such risk said the lady of lochleven strange that this princess with all that justly attaches to her as blameworthy should preserve such empire over the minds of her attendantsdamsel i give thee my honour that i come for the queens safety and advantage awaken her if thou lovest her and pray her leave that i may enteri will retire from the door the whilst  thou wilt not awaken the queen said the lady fleming  what choice have we said the readywitted maiden unless you deem it better to wait till the lady lochleven herself plays lady of the bedchamber her fit of patience will not last long and the queen must be prepared to meet her  but thou wilt bring back her graces fit by thus disturbing her  heaven forbid replied catherine but if so it must pass for an effect of the poison i hope better things and that the queen will be able when she wakes to form her own judgment in this terrible crisis meanwhile do thou dear lady fleming practise to look as dull and heavy as the alertness of thy spirit will permit  catherine kneeled by the side of the queens bed and kissing her hand repeatedly succeeded at last in awakening without alarming her she seemed surprised to find that she was ready dressed but sate up in her bed and appeared so perfectly composed that catherine seyton without farther preamble judged it safe to inform her of the predicament in which they were placed mary turned pale and crossed herself again and again when she heard the imminent danger in which she had stood but like the ulysses of homer    hardly waking yet   sprung in her mind the momentary wit  and she at once understood her situation with the dangers and advantages that attended it  we cannot do better she said after her hasty conference with catherine pressing her at the same time to her bosom and kissing her forehead we cannot do better than to follow the scheme so happily devised by thy quick wit and bold affection undo the door to the lady lochlevenshe shall meet her match in art though not in perfidy fleming draw close the curtain and get thee behind itthou art a better tirewoman than an actress do but breathe heavily and if thou wilt groan slightly and it will top thy part hark they come now catherine of medicis may thy spirit inspire me for a cold northern brain is too blunt for this scene  ushered by catherine seyton and stepping as light as she could the lady lochleven was shown into the twilight apartment and conducted to the side of the couch where mary pallid and exhausted from a sleepless night and the subsequent agitation of the morning lay extended so listlessly as might well confirm the worst fears of her hostess  now god forgive us our sins said the lady of lochleven forgetting her pride and throwing herself on her knees by the side of the bed it is too trueshe is murdered  who is in the chamber said mary as if awaking from a heavy sleep seyton fleming where are you i heard a strange voice who waits call courcelles  alas her memory is at holyrood though her body is at lochleven forgive madam continued the lady if i call your attention to mei am margaret erskine of the house of mar by marriage lady douglas of lochleven  oh our gentle hostess answered the queen who hath such care of our lodgings and of our dietwe cumber you too much and too long good lady of lochleven but we now trust your task of hospitality is wellnigh ended  her words go like a knife through my heart said the lady of lochlevenwith a breaking heart i pray your grace to tell me what is your ailment that aid may be had if there be yet time  nay my ailment replied the queen is nothing worth telling or worth a leechs noticemy limbs feel heavymy heart feels colda prisoners limbs and heart are rarely otherwisefresh air methinks and freedom would soon revive me but as the estates have ordered it death alone can break my prisondoors  were it possible madam said the lady that your liberty could restore your perfect health i would myself encounter the resentment of the regentof my son sir williamof my whole friends rather than you should meet your fate in this castle  alas madam said the lady fleming who conceived the time propitious to show that her own address had been held too lightly of it is but trying what good freedom may work upon us for myself i think a free walk on the greensward would do me much good at heart  the lady of lochleven rose from the bedside and darted a penetrating look at the elder valetudinary are you so evildisposed lady fleming  evildisposed indeed madam replied the court dame and more especially since breakfast  help help exclaimed catherine anxious to break off a conversation which boded her schemes no good help i say help the queen is about to pass away aid her lady lochleven if you be a woman  the lady hastened to support the queens head who turning her eyes towards her with an air of great languor exclaimed thanks my dearest lady of lochlevennotwithstanding some passages of late i have never misconstrued or misdoubted your affection to our house it was proved as i have heard before i was born  the lady lochleven sprung from the floor on which she had again knelt and having paced the apartment in great disorder flung open the lattice as if to get air  now our lady forgive me said catherine to herself how deep must the love of sarcasm be implanted in the breasts of us women since the queen with all her sense will risk ruin rather than rein in her wit she then adventured stooping over the queens person to press her arm with her hand saying at the same time for gods sake madam restrain yourself  thou art too forward maiden said the queen but immediately added in a low whisper forgive me catherine but when i felt the hags murderous hands busy about my head and neck i felt such disgust and hatred that i must have said something or died but i will be schooled to better behaviouronly see that thou let her not touch me  now god be praised said the lady lochleven withdrawing her head from the window the boat comes as fast as sail and oar can send wood through water it brings the leech and a femalecertainly from the appearance the very person i was in quest of were she but well out of this castle with our honour safe i would that she were on the top of the wildest mountain in norway or i would i had been there myself ere i had undertaken this trust  while she thus expressed herself standing apart at one window roland graeme from the other watched the boat bursting through the waters of the lake which glided from its side in ripple and in foam he too became sensible that at the stern was seated the medical chamberlain clad in his black velvet cloak and that his own relative magdalen graeme in her assumed character of mother nieneven stood in the bow her hands clasped together and pointed towards the castle and her attitude even at that distance expressing enthusiastic eagerness to arrive at the landingplace they arrived there accordingly and while the supposed witch was detained in a room beneath the physician was ushered to the queens apartment which he entered with all due professional solemnity catherine had in the meanwhile fallen back from the queens bed and taken an opportunity to whisper to roland methinks from the information of the threadbare velvet cloak and the solemn beard there would be little trouble in haltering yonder ass but thy grandmother rolandthy grandmothers zeal will ruin us if she get not a hint to dissemble  roland without reply glided towards the door of the apartment crossed the parlour and safely entered the antechamber but when he attempted to pass farther the word back back echoed from one to the other by two men armed with carabines convinced him that the lady of lochlevens suspicions had not even in the midst of her alarms been so far lulled to sleep as to omit the precaution of stationing sentinels on her prisoners he was compelled therefore to return to the parlour or audiencechamber in which he found the lady of the castle in conference with her learned leech  a truce with your cant phrase and your solemn foppery lundin in such terms she accosted the man of art and let me know instantly if thou canst tell whether this lady hath swallowed aught that is less than wholesome  nay but good ladyhonoured patronessto whom i am alike bondsman in my medical and official capacity deal reasonably with me if this mine illustrious patient will not answer a question saving with sighs and moansif that other honourable lady will do nought but yawn in my face when i inquire after the diagnosticsand if that other young damsel who i profess is a comely maiden  talk not to me of comeliness or of damsels said the lady of lochleven i say are they evildisposedin one word man have they taken poison ay or no  poisons madam said the learned leech are of various sorts there is your animal poison as the lepus marinus as mentioned by dioscorides and galenthere are mineral and semimineral poisons as those compounded of sublimate regulus of antimony vitriol and the arsenical saltsthere are your poisons from herbs and vegetables as the aqua cymbalariae opium aconitum cantharides and the likethere are also  now out upon thee for a learned fool and i myself am no better for expecting an oracle from such a log said the lady  nay but if your ladyship will have patienceif i knew what food they have partaken of or could see but the remnants of what they have last eatenfor as to the external and internal symptoms i can discover nought like for as galen saith in his second book de antidotis  away fool said the lady send me that hag hither she shall avouch what it was that she hath given to the wretch dryfesdale or the pilniewinks and thumbikins shall wrench it out of her finger joints  art hath no enemy unless the ignorant said the mortified doctor veiling however his remark under the latin version and stepping apart into a corner to watch the result  in a minute or two magdalen graeme entered the apartment dressed as we have described her at the revel but with her muffler thrown back and all affectation of disguise she was attended by two guards of whose presence she did not seem even to be conscious and who followed her with an air of embarrassment and timidity which was probably owing to their belief in her supernatural power coupled with the effect produced by her bold and undaunted demeanour she confronted the lady of lochleven who seemed to endure with high disdain the confidence of her air and manner  wretched woman said the lady after essaying for a moment to bear her down before she addressed her by the stately severity of her look what was that powder which thou didst give to a servant of this house by name jasper dryfesdale that he might work out with it some slow and secret vengeanceconfess its nature and properties or by the honour of douglas i give thee to fire and stake before the sun is lower  alas said magdalen graeme in reply and when became a douglas or a douglass man so unfurnished in his revenge that he should seek them at the hands of a poor and solitary woman the towers in which your captives pine away into unpitied graves yet stand fast on their foundationthe crimes wrought in them have not yet burst their vaults asunderyour men have still their crossbows pistolets and daggerswhy need you seek to herbs or charms for the execution of your revenges  hear me foul hag said the lady lochlevenbut what avails speaking to theebring dryfesdale hither and let them be confronted together  you may spare your retainers the labour replied magdalen graeme i came not here to be confronted with a base groom nor to answer the interrogatories of jamess heretical lemani came to speak with the queen of scotlandgive place there  and while the lady lochleven stood confounded at her boldness and at the reproach she had cast upon her magdalen graeme strode past her into the bedchamber of the queen and kneeling on the floor made a salutation as if in the oriental fashion she meant to touch the earth with her forehead  hail princess she said hail daughter of many a king but graced above them all in that thou art called to suffer for the true faithhail to thee the pure gold of whose crown has been tried in the seventimes heated furnace of afflictionhear the comfort which god and our lady send thee by the mouth of thy unworthy servantbut firstand stooping her head she crossed herself repeatedly and still upon her knees appeared to be rapidly reciting some formula of devotion  seize her and drag her to the massymoreto the deepest dungeon with the sorceress whose master the devil could alone have inspired her with boldness enough to insult the mother of douglas in his own castle  thus spoke the incensed lady of lochleven but the physician presumed to interpose  i pray of you honoured madam she be permitted to take her course without interruption peradventure we shall learn something concerning the nostrum she hath ventured contrary to law and the rules of art to adhibit to these ladies through the medium of the steward dryfesdale  for a fool replied the lady of lochleven thou hast counselled wiselyi will bridle my resentment till their conference be over  god forbid honoured lady said doctor lundin that you should suppress it longernothing may more endanger the frame of your honoured body and truly if there be witchcraft in this matter it is held by the vulgar and even by solid authors on demonology that three scruples of the ashes of the witch when she hath been well and carefully burned at a stake is a grand catholicon in such matter even as they prescribe crinis canis rabidi a hair of the dog that bit the patient in cases of hydrophobia i warrant neither treatment being out of the regular practice of the schools but in the present case there can be little harm in trying the conclusion upon this old necromancer and quacksalverfiat experimentum as we say in corpore vili  peace fool said the lady she is about to speak  at that moment magdalen graeme arose from her knees and turned her countenance on the queen at the same time advancing her foot extending her arm and assuming the mien and attitude of a sibyl in frenzy as her gray hair floated back from beneath her coif and her eye gleamed fire from under its shaggy eyebrow the effect of her expressive though emaciated features was heightened by an enthusiasm approaching to insanity and her appearance struck with awe all who were present her eyes for a time glanced wildly around as if seeking for something to aid her in collecting her powers of expression and her lips had a nervous and quivering motion as those of one who would fain speak yet rejects as inadequate the words which present themselves mary herself caught the infection as if by a sort of magnetic influence and raising herself from her bed without being able to withdraw her eyes from those of magdalen waited as if for the oracle of a pythoness she waited not long for no sooner had the enthusiast collected herself than her gaze became instantly steady her features assumed a determined energy and when she began to speak the words flowed from her with a profuse fluency which might have passed for inspiration and which perhaps she herself mistook for such  arise she said queen of france and of england arise lioness of scotland and be not dismayed though the nets of the hunters have encircled thee stoop not to feign with the false ones whom thou shall soon meet in the field the issue of battle is with the god of armies but by battle thy cause shall be tried lay aside then the arts of lower mortals and assume those which become a queen true defender of the only true faith the armoury of heaven is open to thee faithful daughter of the church take the keys of st peter to bind and to looseroyal princess of the land take the sword of st paul to smite and to shear there is darkness in thy destinybut not in these towers not under the rule of their haughty mistress shall that destiny be closedin other lands the lioness may crouch to the power of the tigress but not in her ownnot in scotland shall the queen of scotland long remain captivenor is the fate of the royal stuart in the hands of the traitor douglas let the lady of lochleven double her bolts and deepen her dungeons they shall not retain theeeach element shall give thee its assistance ere thou shalt continue captivethe land shall lend its earthquakes the water its waves the air its tempests the fire its devouring flames to desolate this house rather than it shall continue the place of thy captivityhear this and tremble all ye who fight against the light for she says it to whom it hath been assured  she was silent and the astonished physician said if there was ever an energumene or possessed demoniac in our days there is a devil speaking with that womans tongue  practice said the lady of lochleven recovering her surprise here is all practice and impostureto the dungeon with her  lady of lochleven said mary arising from her bed and coming forward with her wonted dignity ere you make arrest on any one in our presence hear me but one word i have done you some wrongi believed you privy to the murderous purpose of your vassal and i deceived you in suffering you to believe it had taken effect i did you wrong lady of lochleven for i perceive your purpose to aid me was sincere we tasted not of the liquid nor are we now sick save that we languish for our freedom  it is avowed like mary of scotland said magdalen graeme and know besides that had the queen drained the drought to the dregs it was harmless as the water from a sainted spring trow ye proud woman she added addressing herself to the lady of lochleven that iiwould have been the wretch to put poison into the hands of a servant or vassal of the house of lochleven knowing whom that house contained as soon would i have furnished drug to slay my own daughter  am i thus bearded in mine own castle said the lady to the dungeon with hershe shall abye what is due to the vender of poisons and practiser of witchcraft  yet hear me for an instant lady of lochleven said mary and do you to magdalen be silent at my commandyour steward lady has by confession attempted my life and those of my household and this woman hath done her best to save them by furnishing him with what was harmless in place of the fatal drugs which he expected methinks i propose to you but a fair exchange when i say i forgive your vassal with all my heart and leave vengeance to god and to his conscience so that you also forgive the boldness of this woman in your presence for we trust you do not hold it as a crime that she substituted an innocent beverage for the mortal poison which was to have drenched our cup  heaven forfend madam said the lady that i should account that a crime which saved the house of douglas from a foul breach of honour and hospitality we have written to our son touching our vassals delict and he must abide his doom which will most likely be death touching this woman her trade is damnable by scripture and is mortally punished by the wise laws of our ancestryshe also must abide her doom  and have i then said the queen no claim on the house of lochleven for the wrong i hare so nearly suffered within their walls i ask but in requital the life of a frail and aged woman whose brain as yourself may judge seems somewhat affected by years and suffering  if the lady mary replied the inflexible lady of lochleven hath been menaced with wrong in the house of douglas it may be regarded as some compensation that her complots have cost that house the exile of a valued son  plead no more for me my gracious sovereign said magdalen graeme nor abase yourself to ask so much as a gray hair of my head at her hands i knew the risk at which i served my church and my queen and was ever prompt to pay my poor life as the ransom it is a comfort to think that in slaying me or in restraining my freedom or even in injuring that single gray hair the house whose honour she boasts so highly will have filled up the measure of their shame by the breach of their solemn written assurance of safetyand taking from her bosom a paper she handed it to the queen  it is a solemn assurance of safety in life and limb said queen mary with space to come and go under the hand and seal of the chamberlain of kinross granted to magdalen graeme commonly called mother nicneven in consideration of her consenting to put herself for the space of twentyfour hours if required within the iron gate of the castle of lochleven  knave said the lady turning to the chamberlain how dared you grant her such a protection  it was by your ladyships orders transmitted by randal as he can bear witness replied doctor lundin nay i am only like the pharmacopolist who compounds the drugs after the order of the mediciner  i rememberi remember answered the lady but i meant the assurance only to be used in case by residing in another jurisdiction she could not have been apprehended under our warrant  nevertheless said the queen the lady of lochleven is bound by the action of her deputy in granting the assurance  madam replied the lady the house of douglas have never broken their safeconduct and never willtoo deeply did they suffer by such a breach of trust exercised on themselves when your graces ancestor the second james in defiance of the rights of hospitality and of his own written assurance of safety poniarded the brave earl of douglas with his own hand and within two yards of the social board at which he had just before sat the king of scotlands honoured guest  methinks said the queen carelessly in consideration of so very recent and enormous a tragedy which i think only chanced some sixscore years agone the douglasses should have shown themselves less tenacious of the company of their sovereigns than you lady of lochleven seem to be of mine  let randal said the lady take the hag back to kinross and set her at full liberty discharging her from our bounds in future on peril of her headand let your wisdom to the chamberlain keep her company and fear not for your character though i send you in such company for granting her to be a witch it would be a waste of fagots to burn you for a wizard  the crestfallen chamberlain was preparing to depart but magdalen graeme collecting herself was about to reply when the queen interposed saying good mother we heartily thank you for your unfeigned zeal towards our person and pray you as our liegewoman that you abstain from whatever may lead you into personal danger and farther it is our will that you depart without a word of farther parley with any one in this castle for thy present guerdon take this small reliquaryit was given to us by our uncle the cardinal and hath had the benediction of the holy father himselfand now depart in peace and in silencefor you learned sir continued the queen advancing to the doctor who made his reverence in a manner doubly embarrassed by the awe of the queens presence which made him fear to do too little and by the apprehension of his ladys displeasure in case he should chance to do too muchfor you learned sir as it was not your fault though surely our own good fortune that we did not need your skill at this time it would not become us however circumstanced to suffer our leech to leave us without such guerdon as we can offer  with these words and with the grace which never forsook her though in the present case there might lurk under it a little gentle ridicule she offered a small embroidered purse to the chamberlain who with extended hand and arched back his learned face stooping until a physiognomist might have practised the metoposcopical science upon it as seen from behind betwixt his gambadoes was about to accept of the professional recompense offered by so fair as well as illustrious a hand but the lady interposed and regarding the chamberlain said aloud no servant of our house without instantly relinquishing that character and incurring withal our highest displeasure shall dare receive any gratuity at the hand of the lady mary  sadly and slowly the chamberlain raised his depressed stature into the perpendicular attitude and left the apartment dejectedly followed by magdalen graeme after with mute but expressive gesture she had kissed the reliquary with which the queen had presented her and raising her clasped hands and uplifted eyes towards heaven had seemed to entreat a benediction upon the royal dame as she left the castle and went towards the quay where the boat lay roland graeme anxious to communicate with her if possible threw himself in her way and might have succeeded in exchanging a few words with her as she was guarded only by the dejected chamberlain and his halberdiers but she seemed to have taken in its most strict and literal acceptation the command to be silent which she had received from the queen for to the repeated signs of her grandson she only replied by laying her finger on her lip dr lundin was not so reserved regret for the handsome gratuity and for the compulsory task of selfdenial imposed on him had grieved the spirit of that worthy officer and learned medicinereven thus my friend said he squeezing the pages hand as he bade him farewell is merit rewarded i came to cure this unhappy ladyand i profess she well deserves the trouble for say what they will of her she hath a most winning manner a sweet voice a gracious smile and a most majestic wave of her hand if she was not poisoned say my dear master roland was that fault of mine i being ready to cure her if she hadand now i am denied the permission to accept my wellearned honorariumo galen o hippocrates is the graduates cap and doctors scarlet brought to this pass frustra fatigamus remediis aegros  he wiped his eyes stepped on the gunwale and the boat pushed off from the shore and went merrily across the lake which was dimpled by the summer wind footnote  a romancer to use a scottish phrase wants but a hair to make a tether of the whole detail of the stewards supposed conspiracy against the life of mary is grounded upon an expression in one of her letters which affirms that jasper dryfesdale one of the laird of lochlevens servants had threatened to murder

 but death is by to seize us when he lists                          the spanish father  from the agitating scene in the queens presencechamber the lady of lochleven retreated to her own apartment and ordered the steward to be called before her  have they not disarmed thee dryfesdale she said on seeing him enter accoutred as usual with sword and dagger  no replied the old man how should theyyour ladyship when you commanded me to ward said nought of laying down my arms and i think none of your menials without your order or your sons dare approach jasper dryfesdale for such a purposeshall i now give up my sword to youit is worth little now for it has fought for your house till it is worn down to old iron like the pantlers old chipping knife  you have attempted a deadly crimepoison under trust  under trusthemi know not what your ladyship thinks of it but the world without thinks the trust was given you even for that very end and you would have been well off had it been so ended as i proposed and you neither the worse nor the wiser  wretch exclaimed the lady and fool as well as villain who could not even execute the crime he had planned  i bid as fair for it as man could replied dryfesdale i went to a womana witch and a papistif i found not poison it was because it was otherwise predestined i tried fair for it but the halfdone job may be clouted if you will  villain i am even now about to send off an express messenger to my son to take order how thou shouldst be disposed of prepare thyself for death if thou canst  he that looks on death lady answered dryfesdale as that which he may not shun and which has its own fixed and certain hour is ever prepared for it he that is hanged in may will eat no flaunes footnote pancakes in midsummerso there is the moan made for the old servingman but whom pray i send you on so fair an errand  there will be no lack of messengers answered his mistress  by my hand but there will replied the old man your castle is but poorly manned considering the watches that you must keep having this chargethere is the warder and two others whom you discarded for tampering with master george then for the warders tower the bailie the donjonfive men mount each guard and the rest must sleep for the most part in their clothes to send away another man were to harass the sentinels to deathunthrifty misuse for a household to take in new soldiers were dangerous the charge requiring tried men i see but one thing for iti will do your errand to sir william douglas myself  that were indeed a resourceand on what day within twenty years would it be done said the lady  even with the speed of man and horse said dryfesdale for though i care not much about the latter days of an old servingmans life yet i would like to know as soon as may be whether my neck is mine own or the hangmans  holdest thou thy own life so lightly said the lady  else i had reckoned more of that of others said the predestinarianwhat is deathit is but ceasing to liveand what is livinga weary return of light and darkness sleeping and waking being hungered and eating your dead man needs neither candle nor can neither fire nor featherbed and the joiners chest serves him for an eternal friezejerkin  wretched man believest thou not that after death comes the judgment  lady answered dryfesdale as my mistress i may not dispute your words but as spiritually speaking you are still but a burner of bricks in egypt ignorant of the freedom of the saints for as was well shown to me by that gifted man nicolaus schoefferbach who was martyred by the bloody bishop of munster he cannot sin who doth but execute that which is predestined since  silence said the lady interrupting himanswer me not with thy bold and presumptuous blasphemy but hear me thou hast been long the servant of our house  the born servant of the douglasthey have had the best of mei served them since i left lockerbie i was then ten years old and you may soon add the threescore to it  thy foul attempt has miscarried so thou art guilty only in intention it were a deserved deed to hang thee on the warders tower and yet in thy present mind it were but giving a soul to satan i take thine offer thengo hencehere is my packeti will add to it but a line to desire him to send me a faithful servant or two to complete the garrison let my son deal with you as he will if thou art wise thou wilt make for lockerbie so soon as thy foot touches dry land and let the packet find another bearer at all rates look it miscarries not  nay madam replied hei was born as i said the douglass servant and i will be no corbiemessenger in mine old ageyour message to your son shall be done as truly by me as if it concerned another mans neck i take my leave of your honour  the lady issued her commands and the old man was ferried over to the shore to proceed on his extraordinary pilgrimage it is necessary the reader should accompany him on his journey which providence had determined should not be of long duration  on arriving at the village the steward although his disgrace had transpired was readily accommodated with a horse by the chamberlains authority and the roads being by no means esteemed safe he associated himself with auchtermuchty the common carrier in order to travel in his company to edinburgh  the worthy waggoner according to the established customs of all carriers stagecoachmen and other persons in public authority from the earliest days to the present never wanted good reasons for stopping upon the road as often as he would and the place which had most captivation for him as a restingplace was a changehouse as it was termed not very distant from a romantic dell well known by the name of keirie craigs attractions of a kind very different from those which arrested the progress of john auchtermuchty and his wains still continue to hover round this romantic spot and none has visited its vicinity without a desire to remain long and to return soon  arrived near his favourite howss not all the authority of dryfesdale much diminished indeed by the rumours of his disgrace could prevail on the carrier obstinate as the brutes which he drove to pass on without his accustomed halt for which the distance he had travelled furnished little or no pretence old keltie the landlord who had bestowed his name on a bridge in the neighbourhood of his quondam dwelling received the carrier with his usual festive cordiality and adjourned with him into the house under pretence of important business which i believe consisted in their emptying together a mutchkin stoup of usquebaugh  while the worthy host and his guest were thus employed the discarded steward with a double portion of moroseness in his gesture and look walked discontentedly into the kitchen of the place which was occupied but by one guest the stranger was a slight figure scarce above the age of boyhood and in the dress of a page but bearing an air of haughty aristocratic boldness and even insolence in his look and manner that might have made dryfesdale conclude he had pretensions to superior rank had not his experience taught him how frequently these airs of superiority were assumed by the domestics and military retainers of the scottish nobilitythe pilgrims morning to you old sir said the youth you come as i think from lochleven castlewhat news of our bonny queena fairer dove was never pent up in so wretched a dovecot  they that speak of lochleven and of those whom its walls contain answered dryfesdale speak of what concerns the douglas and they who speak of what concerns the douglas do it at their peril  do you speak from fear of them old man or would you make a quarrel for themi should have deemed your age might have cooled your blood  never while there are emptypated coxcombs at each corner to keep it warm  the sight of thy gray hairs keeps mine cold said the boy who had risen up and now sat down again  it is well for thee or i had cooled it with this hollyrod replied the steward i think thou best one of those swashbucklers who brawl in alehouses and taverns and who if words were pikes and oaths were andrew ferraras would soon place the religion of babylon in the land once more and the woman of moab upon the throne  now by saint bennet of seyton said the youth i will strike thee on the face thou foulmouthed old railing heretic  saint bennet of seyton echoed the steward a proper warrant is saint bennets and for a proper nest of wolfbirds like the seytonsi will arrest thee as a traitor to king james and the good regentho john auchtermuchty raise aid against the kings traitor  so saying he laid his hand on the youths collar and drew his sword john auchtermuchty looked in but seeing the naked weapon ran faster out than he entered keltie the landlord stood by and helped neither party only exclaiming gentlemen gentlemen for the love of heaven and so forth a struggle ensued in which the young man chafed at dryfesdales boldness and unable with the ease he expected to extricate himself from the old mans determined grasp drew his dagger and with the speed of light dealt him three wounds in the breast and body the least of which was mortal the old man sunk on the ground with a deep groan and the host set up a piteous exclamation of surprise  peace ye brawling hound said the wounded steward are daggerstabs and dying men such rarities in scotland that you should cry as if the house were fallingyouth i do not forgive thee for there is nought betwixt us to forgive thou hast done what i have done to more than oneand i suffer what i have seen them sufferit was all ordained to be thus and not otherwise but if thou wouldst do me right thou wilt send this packet safely to the hands of sir william douglas and see that my memory suffer not as if i would have loitered on mine errand for fear of my life  the youth whose passion had subsided the instant he had done the deed listened with sympathy and attention when another person muffled in his cloak entered the apartment and exclaimedgood god dryfesdale and expiring  ay and dryfesdale would that he had been dead answered the wounded man rather than that his ears had heard the words of the only douglas that ever was falsebut yet it is better as it is good my murderer and the rest of you stand back a little and let me speak with this unhappy apostatekneel down by me master georgeyou have heard that i failed in my attempt to take away that moabitish stumblingblock and her retinuei gave them that which i thought would have removed the temptation out of thy pathand this though i had other reasons to show to thy mother and others i did chiefly purpose for love of thee  for the love of me base poisoner answered douglas wouldst thou have committed so horrible so unprovoked a murder and mentioned my name with it  and wherefore not george of douglas answered dryfesdale breath is now scarce with me but i would spend my last gasp on this argument hast thou not despite the honour thou owest to thy parents the faith that is due to thy religion the truth that is due to thy king been so carried away by the charms of this beautiful sorceress that thou wouldst have helped her to escape from her prisonhouse and lent her thine arm again to ascend the throne which she had made a place of abominationnay stir not from memy hand though fast stiffening has yet force enough to hold theewhat dost thou aim atto wed this witch of scotlandi warrant thee thou mayest succeedher heart and hand have been oft won at a cheaper rate than thou fool that thou art would think thyself happy to pay but should a servant of thy fathers house have seen thee embrace the fate of the idiot darnley or of the villain bothwellthe fate of the murdered fool or of the living piratewhile an ounce of ratsbane would have saved thee  think on god dryfesdale said george douglas and leave the utterance of those horrorsrepent if thou canstif not at least be silentseyton aid me to support this dying wretch that he may compose himself to better thoughts if it be possible  seyton answered the dying man seyton is it by a seytons hand that i fall at lastthere is something of retribution in thatsince the house had nigh lost a sister by my deed fixing his fading eyes on the youth he added he hath her very features and presence stoop down youth and let me see thee closeri would know thee when we meet in yonder world for homicides will herd together there and i have been one he pulled seytons face in spite of some resistance closer to his own looked at him fixedly and added thou hast begun youngthy career will be the brieferay thou wilt be met with and that anona young plant never throve that was watered with an old mans bloodyet why blame i thee  strange turns of fate he muttered ceasing to address seyton i designed what i could not do and he has done what he did not perchance designwondrous that our will should ever oppose itself to the strong and uncontrollable tide of destinythat we should strive with the stream when we might drift with the current my brain will serve me to question it no fartheri would schoefferbach were hereyet whyi am on a course which the vessel can hold without a pilotfarewell george of douglasi die true to thy fathers house he fell into convulsions at these words and shortly after expired  seyton and douglas stood looking on the dying man and when the scene was closed the former was the first to speak as i live douglas i meant not this and am sorry but he laid hands on me and compelled me to defend my freedom as i best might with my dagger if he were ten times thy friend and follower i can but say that i am sorry  i blame thee not seyton said douglas though i lament the chance there is an overruling destiny above us though not in the sense in which it was viewed by that wretched man who beguiled by some foreign mystagogue used the awful word as the ready apology for whatever he chose to dowe must examine the packet  they withdrew into an inner room and remained deep in consultation until they were disturbed by the entrance of keltie who with an embarrassed countenance asked master george douglass pleasure respecting the disposal of the body your honour knows he added that i make my bread by living men not by dead corpses and old mr dryfesdale who was but a sorry customer while he was alive occupies my public room now that he is deceased and can neither call for ale nor brandy  tie a stone round his neck said seyton and when the sun is down have him to the loch of ore heave him in and let him alone for finding out the bottom  under your favour sir said george douglas it shall not be sokeltie thou art a true fellow to me and thy having been so shall advantage thee send or take the body to the chapel at scotlands wall or to the church of ballanry and tell what tale thou wilt of his having fallen in a brawl with some unruly guests of thine auchtermuchty knows nought else nor are the times so peaceful as to admit closelooking into such accounts  nay let him tell the truth said seyton so far as it harms not our schemesay that henry seyton met with him my good fellowi care not a brass bodle for the feud  a feud with the douglas was ever to be feared however said george displeasure mingling with his natural deep gravity of manner  not when the best of the name is on my side replied seyton  alas henry if thou meanest me i am but half a douglas in this emprizehalf head half heart and half handbut i will think on one who can never be forgotten and be all or more than any of my ancestors was everkeltie say it was henry seyton did the deed but beware not a word of melet auchtermuchty carry this packet which he had resealed with his own signet to my father at edinburgh and here is to pay for the funeral expenses and thy loss of custom  and the washing of the floor said the landlord which will be an extraordinary job for blood they say will scarcely ever cleanse out  but as for your plan said george of douglas addressing seyton as if in continuation of what they had been before treating of it has a good face but under your favour you are yourself too hot and too young besides other reasons which are much against your playing the part you propose  we will consult the father abbot upon it said the youth do you ride to kinross tonight  ayso i purpose answered douglas the night will be dark and suits a muffled man footnote generally a disguised man originally one who wears the cloak or mantle muffled round the lower part of the face to conceal his countenance i have on an ancient piece of iron the representation of a robber thus accoutred endeavouring to make his way into a house and opposed by a mastiff to whom he in vain offers food the motto is spernit dona fides it is part of a firegrate said to have belonged to archbishop sharpekeltie i forgot there should be a stone laid on that mans grave recording his name and his only merit which was being a faithful servant to the douglas  what religion was the man of said seyton he used words which make me fear i have sent satan a subject before his time  i can tell you little of that said george douglas he was noted for disliking both rome and geneva and spoke of lights he had learned among the fierce sectaries of lower germanyan evil doctrine it was if we judge by the fruits god keep us from presumptuously judging of heavens secrets  amen said the young seyton and from meeting any encounter this evening  it is not thy wont to pray so said george douglas  no i leave that to you replied the youth when you are seized with scruples of engaging with your fathers vassals but i would fain have this old mans blood off these hands of mine ere i shed morei will confess to the abbot tonight and i trust to have light penance for ridding the earth of such a miscreant all i sorrow for is that he was not a score of years youngerhe drew steel first however that is one comfort     chapter the thirtyfourth     ay pedrocome you here with mask and lantern   ladder of ropes and other moonshine tools   why youngster thou mayst cheat the old duenna   flatter the waitingwoman bribe the valet   but know that i her father play the gryphon   tameless and sleepless proof to fraud or bribe   and guard the hidden treasure of her beauty                              the spanish father  the tenor of our tale carries us back to the castle of lochleven where we take up the order of events on the same remarkable day on which dryfesdale had been dismissed from the castle it was past noon the usual hour of dinner yet no preparations seemed made for the queens entertainment mary herself had retired into her own apartment where she was closely engaged in writing her attendants were together in the presencechamber and much disposed to speculate on the delay of the dinner for it may be recollected that their breakfast had been interrupted i believe in my conscience said the page that having found the poisoning scheme miscarry by having gone to the wrong merchant for their deadly wares they are now about to try how famine will work upon us  lady fleming was somewhat alarmed at this surmise but comforted herself by observing that the chimney of the kitchen had reeked that whole day in a manner which contradicted the suppositioncatherine seyton presently exclaimed they were bearing the dishes across the court marshalled by the lady lochleven herself dressed out in her highest and stiffest ruff with her partlet and sleeves of cyprus and her huge oldfashioned farthingale of crimson velvet  i believe on my word said the page approaching the window also it was in that very farthingale that she captivated the heart of gentle king jamie which procured our poor queen her precious bargain of a brother  that may hardly be master roland answered the lady fleming who was a great recorder of the changes of fashion since the farthingales came first in when the queen regent went to saint andrews after the battle of pinkie and were then called vertugardins  she would have proceeded farther in this important discussion but was interrupted by the entrance of the lady of lochleven who preceded the servants bearing the dishes and formally discharged the duty of tasting each of them lady fleming regretted in courtly phrase that the lady of lochleven should have undertaken so troublesome an office  after the strange incident of this day madam said the lady it is necessary for my honour and that of my son that i partake whatever is offered to my involuntary guest please to inform the lady mary that i attend her commands  her majesty replied lady fleming with due emphasis on the word shall be informed that the lady lochleven waits  mary appeared instantly and addressed her hostess with courtesy which even approached to something more cordial this is nobly done lady lochleven she said for though we ourselves apprehend no danger under your roof our ladies have been much alarmed by this mornings chance and our meal will be the more cheerful for your presence and assurance  please you to sit down  the lady lochleven obeyed the queens commands and roland performed the office of carver and attendant as usual but notwithstanding what the queen had said the meal was silent and unsocial and every effort which mary made to excite some conversation died away under the solemn and chill replies of the lady of lochleven at length it became plain that the queen who had considered these advances as a condescension on her part and who piqued herself justly on her powers of pleasing became offended at the repulsive conduct of her hostess after looking with a significant glance at lady fleming and catherine she slightly shrugged her shoulders and remained silent a pause ensued at the end of which the lady douglas spokei perceive madam i am a check on the mirth of this fair company i pray you to excuse mei am a widowalone here in a most perilous charge deserted by my grandsonbetrayed by my servanti am little worthy of the grace you do me in offering me a seat at your table where i am aware that wit and pastime are usually expected from the guests  if the lady lochleven is serious said the queen we wonder by what simplicity she expects our present meals to be seasoned with mirth if she is a widow she lives honoured and uncontrolled at the head of her late husbands household but i know at least of one widowed woman in the world before whom the words desertion and betrayal ought never to be mentioned since no one has been made so bitterly acquainted with their import  i meant not madam to remind you of your misfortunes by the mention of mine answered the lady lochleven and there was again a deep silence  mary at length addressed lady fleming we can commit no deadly sins here ma bonne where we are so well warded and looked to but if we could this carthusian silence might be useful as a kind of penance if thou hast adjusted my wimple amiss my fleming or if catherine hath made a wry stitch in her broidery when she was thinking of something else than her work or if roland graeme hath missed a wildduck on the wing and broke a quarrelpane footnote diamondshaped literally formed like the head of a quarrel or arrow for the crossbow of glass in the turret window as chanced to him a week since now is the time to think on your sins and to repent of them  madam i speak with all reverence said the lady lochleven but i am old and claim the privilege of age methinks your followers might find fitter subjects for repentance than the trifles you mention and so mentiononce more i crave your pardonas if you jested with sin and repentance both  you have been our taster lady lochleven said the queen i perceive you would eke out your duty with that of our father confessorand since you choose that our conversation should be serious may i ask you why the regents promisesince your son so styles himselfhas not been kept to me in that respect from time to time this promise has been renewed and as constantly broken methinks those who pretend themselves to so much gravity and sanctity should not debar from others the religious succours which their consciences require  madam the earl of murray was indeed weak enough said the lady lochleven to give so far way to your unhappy prejudices and a religioner of the pope presented himself on his part at our town of kinross but the douglass is lord of his own castle and will not permit his threshold to be darkened no not for a single moment by an emissary belonging to the bishop of rome  methinks it were well then said mary that my lord regent would send me where there is less scruple and more charity  in this madam answered the lady lochleven you mistake the nature both of charity and of religion charity giveth to those who are in delirium the medicaments which may avail their health but refuses those enticing cates and liquors which please the palate but augment the disease  this your charity lady lochleven is pure cruelty under the hypocritical disguise of friendly care i am oppressed amongst you as if you meant the destruction both of my body and soul but heaven will not endure such iniquity for ever and they who are the most active agents in it may speedily expect their reward  at this moment randal entered the apartment with a look so much perturbed that the lady fleming uttered a faint scream the queen was obviously startled and the lady of lochleven though too bold and proud to evince any marked signs of alarm asked hastily what was the matter  dryfesdale has been slain madam was the reply murdered as soon as he gained the dry land by young master henry seyton  it was now catherines turn to start and grow palehas the murderer of the douglass vassal escaped was the ladys hasty question  there was none to challenge him but old keltie and the carrier auchtermuchty replied randal unlikely men to stay one of the frackest footnote boldestmost forward youths in scotland of his years and who was sure to have friends and partakers at no great distance  was the deed completed said the lady  done and done thoroughly said randal a seyton seldom strikes twicebut the body was not despoiled and your honours packet goes forward to edinburgh by auchtermuchty who leaves keltiebridge early tomorrowmarry he has drunk two bottles of aquavitae to put the fright out of his head and now sleeps them off beside his cartavers footnote carthorses  there was a pause when this fatal tale was told the queen and lady douglas looked on each other as if each thought how she could best turn the incident to her own advantage in the controversy which was continually kept alive betwixt themcatherine seyton kept her kerchief at her eyes and wept  you see madam the bloody maxims and practice of the deluded papists said lady lochleven  nay madam replied the queen say rather you see the deserved judgment of heaven upon a calvinistical poisoner  dryfesdale was not of the church of geneva or of scotland said the lady of lochleven hastily  he was a heretic however replied mary there is but one true and unerring guide the others lead alike into error  well madam i trust it will reconcile you to your retreat that this deed shows the temper of those who might wish you at liberty bloodthirsty tyrants and cruel menquellers are they all from the clanranald and clantosach in the north to the ferniherst and buccleuch in the souththe murdering seytons in the east and  methinks madam you forget that i am a seyton said catherine withdrawing her kerchief from her face which was now coloured with indignation  if i had forgot it fair mistress your forward bearing would have reminded me said lady lochleven  if my brother has slain the villain that would have poisoned his sovereign and his sister said catherine i am only so far sorry that he should have spared the hangman his proper task for aught farther had it been the best douglas in the land he would have been honoured in falling by the seytons sword  farewell gay mistress said the lady of lochleven rising to withdraw it is such maidens as you who make giddyfashioned revellers and deadly brawlers boys must needs rise forsooth in the grace of some sprightly damsel who thinks to dance through life as through a french galliard she then made her reverence to the queen and added do you also madam fare you well till curfew time when i will make perchance more bold than welcome in attending upon your supper boardcome with me randal and tell me more of this cruel fact  tis an extraordinary chance said the queen when she had departed and villain as he was i would this man had been spared time for repentance we will cause something to be done for his soul if we ever attain our liberty and the church will permit such grace to a hereticbut tell me catherine ma mignónethis brother of thine who is so frack as the fellow called him bears he the same wonderful likeness to thee as formerly  if your grace means in temper you know whether i am so frack as the servingman spoke him  nay thou art prompt enough in all reasonable conscience replied the queen but thou art my own darling notwithstandingbut i meant is this thy twinbrother as like thee in form and features as formerly i remember thy dear mother alleged it as a reason for destining thee to the veil that were ye both to go at large thou wouldst surely get the credit of some of thy brothers mad pranks  i believe madam said catherine there are some unusually simple people even yet who can hardly distinguish betwixt us especially when for diversions sake my brother hath taken a female dressand as she spoke she gave a quick glance at roland graeme to whom this conversation conveyed a ray of light welcome as ever streamed into the dungeon of a captive through the door which opened to give him freedom  he must be a handsome cavalier this brother of thine if he be so like you replied mary he was in france i think for these late years so that i saw him not at holyrood  his looks madam have never been much found fault with answered catherine seyton but i would he had less of that angry and heady spirit which evil times have encouraged amongst our young nobles god knows i grudge not his life in your graces quarrel and love him for the willingness with which he labours for your rescue but wherefore should he brawl with an old ruffianly servingman and stain at once his name with such a broil and his hands with the blood of an old and ignoble wretch  nay be patient catherine i will not have thee traduce my gallant young knight with henry for my knight and roland graeme for my trusty squire methinks i am like a princess of romance who may shortly set at defiance the dungeons and the weapons of all wicked sorcerersbut my head aches with the agitation of the day take me la mer des histoires and resume where we left off on wednesdayour lady help thy head girl or rather may she help thy hearti asked thee for the sea of histories and thou hast brought la cronique damour  once embarked upon the sea of histories the queen continued her labours with her needle while lady fleming and catherine read to her alternately for two hours  as to roland graeme it is probable that he continued in secret intent upon the chronicle of love notwithstanding the censure which the queen seemed to pass upon that branch of study he now remembered a thousand circumstances of voice and manner which had his own prepossession been less must surely have discriminated the brother from the sister and he felt ashamed that having as it were by heart every particular of catherines gestures words and manners he should have thought her notwithstanding her spirits and levity capable of assuming the bold step loud tones and forward assurance which accorded well enough with her brothers hasty and masculine character he endeavoured repeatedly to catch a glance of catherines eye that he might judge how she was disposed to look upon him since he had made the discovery but he was unsuccessful for catherine when she was not reading herself seemed to take so much interest in the exploits of the teutonic knights against the heathens of esthonia and livonia that he could not surprise her eye even for a second but when closing the book the queen commanded their attendance in the garden mary perhaps of set purpose for rolands anxiety could not escape so practised an observer afforded him a favourable opportunity of accosting his mistress the queen commanded them to a little distance while she engaged lady fleming in a particular and private conversation the subject whereof we learn from another authority to have been the comparative excellence of the high standing ruff and the falling band roland must have been duller and more sheepish than ever was youthful lover if he had not endeavoured to avail himself of this opportunity  i have been longing this whole evening to ask of you fair catherine said the page how foolish and unapprehensive you must have thought me in being capable to mistake betwixt your brother and you  the circumstance does indeed little honour to my rustic manners said catherine since those of a wild young man were so readily mistaken for mine but i shall grow wiser in time and with that view i am determined not to think of your follies but to correct my own  it will be the lighter subject of meditation of the two said roland  i know not that said catherine very gravely i fear we have been both unpardonably foolish  i have been mad said roland unpardonably mad but you lovely catherine  i said catherine in the same tone of unusual gravity have too long suffered you to use such expressions towards mei fear i can permit it no longer and i blame myself for the pain it may give you  and what can have happened so suddenly to change our relation to each other or alter with such sudden cruelty your whole deportment to me  i can hardly tell replied catherine unless it is that the events of the day have impressed on my mind the necessity of our observing more distance to each other a chance similar to that which betrayed to you the existence of my brother may make known to henry the terms you have used to me and alas his whole conduct as well as his deed this day makes me too justly apprehensive of the consequences  fear nothing for that fair catherine answered the page i am well able to protect myself against risks of that nature  that is to say replied she that you would fight with my twinbrother to show your regard for his sister i have heard the queen say in her sad hours that men are in love or in hate the most selfish animals of creation and your carelessness in this matter looks very like it but be not so much abashedyou are no worse than others  you do me injustice catherine replied the page i thought but of being threatened with a sword and did not remember in whose hand your fancy had placed it if your brother stood before me with his drawn weapon in his hand so like as he is to you in word person and favour he might shed my lifes blood ere i could find in my heart to resist him to his injury  alas said she it is not my brother alone but you remember only the singular circumstances in which we have met in equality and i may say in intimacy you think not that whenever i reenter my fathers house there is a gulf between us you may not pass but with peril of your lifeyour only known relative is of wild and singular habits of a hostile and broken clan footnote a broken clan was one who had no chief able to find security for their good behavioura clan of outlaws and the graemes of the debateable land were in that conditionthe rest of your lineage unknownforgive me that i speak what is the undeniable truth  love my beautiful catherine despises genealogies answered roland graeme  love may but so will not the lord seyton rejoined the damsel  the queen thy mistress and mine she will intercede oh drive me not from you at the moment i thought myself most happyand if i shall aid her deliverance said not yourself that you and she would become my debtors  all scotland will become your debtors said catherine but for the active effects you might hope from our gratitude you must remember i am wholly subjected to my father and the poor queen is for a long time more likely to be dependant on the pleasure of the nobles of her party than possessed of power to control them  be it so replied roland my deeds shall control prejudice itselfit is a bustling world and i will have my share the knight of avenel high as he now stands rose from as obscure an origin as mine  ay said catherine there spoke the doughty knight of romance that will cut his way to the imprisoned princess through fiends and fiery dragons  but if i can set the princess at large and procure her the freedom of her own choice said the page where dearest catherine will that choice alight  release the princess from duresse and she will tell you said the damsel and breaking off the conversation abruptly she joined the queen so suddenly that mary exclaimed half aloud  no more tidings of evil importno dissension i trust in my limited householdthen looking on catherines blushing cheek and rolands expanded brow and glancing eyenono she said i see all is wellma petite mignone go to my apartment and fetch me downlet me seeay fetch my pomander box  and having thus disposed of her attendant in the manner best qualified to hide her confusion the queen added speaking apart to roland i should at least have two grateful subjects of catherine and you for what sovereign but mary would aid true love so willinglyay you lay your hand on your swordyour petite flamberge à rien therewell short time will show if all the good be true that is protested to usi hear them toll curfew from kinross to our chamberthis old dame hath promised to be with us again at our evening meal were it not for the hope of speedy deliverance her presence would drive me distracted but i will be patient  i profess said catherine who just then entered i would i could be henry with all a mans privileges for one momenti long to throw my plate at that confect of pride and formality and illnature  the lady fleming reprimanded her young companion for this explosion of impatience the queen laughed and they went to the presencechamber where almost immediately entered supper and the lady of the castle the queen strong in her prudent resolutions endured her presence with great fortitude and equanimity until her patience was disturbed by a new form which had hitherto made no part of the ceremonial of the castle when the other attendant had retired randal entered bearing the keys of the castle fastened upon a chain and announcing that the watch was set and the gates locked delivered the keys with all reverence to the lady of lochleven  the queen and her ladies exchanged with each other a look of disappointment anger and vexation and mary said aloud we cannot regret the smallness of our court when we see our hostess discharge in person so many of its offices in addition to her charges of principal steward of our household and grand almoner she has tonight done duty as captain of our guard  and will continue to do so in future madam answered the lady lochleven with much gravity the history of scotland may teach me how ill the duty is performed which is done by an accredited deputywe have heard madam of favourites of later date and as little merit as oliver sinclair footnote a favourite and said to be an unworthy one of james v  oh madam replied the queen my father had his female as well as his male favouritesthere were the ladies sandilands and olifaunt footnote the names of these ladies and a third frail favourite of james are preserved in an epigram too gaillard for quotation and some others methinks but their names cannot survive in the memory of so grave a person as you  the lady lochleven looked as if she could have slain the queen on the spot but commanded her temper and retired from the apartment bearing in her hand the ponderous bunch of keys  now god be praised for that womans youthful frailty said the queen had she not that weak point in her character i might waste my words on her in vainbut that stain is the very reverse of what is said of the witchs marki can make her feel there though she is otherwise insensible all overbut how say you girlshere is a new difficultyhow are these keys to be come bythere is no deceiving or bribing this dragon i trow  may i crave to know said roland whether if your grace were beyond the walls of the castle you could find means of conveyance to the firm land and protection when you are there  trust us for that roland said the queen for to that point our scheme is indifferent well laid  then if your grace will permit me to speak my mind i think i could be of some use in this matter  as how my good youthspeak on said the queen and fearlessly  my patron the knight of avenel used to compel the youth educated in his household to learn the use of axe and hammer and working in wood and ironhe used to speak of old northern champions who forged their own weapons and of the highland captain donald nan ord or donald of the hammer whom he himself knew and who used to work at the anvil with a sledgehammer in each hand some said he praised this art because he was himself of churls blood however i gained some practice in it as the lady catherine seyton partly knows for since we were here i wrought her a silver brooch  ay replied catharine but you should tell her grace that your workmanship was so indifferent that it broke to pieces next day and i flung it away  believe her not roland said the queen she wept when it was broken and put the fragments into her bosom but for your schemecould your skill avail to forge a second set of keys  no madam because i know not the wards but i am convinced i could make a set so like that hateful bunch which the lady bore off even now that could they be exchanged against them by any means she would never dream she was possessed of the wrong  and the good dame thank heaven is somewhat blind said the queen but then for a forge my boy and the means of labouring unobserved  the armourers forge at which i used sometimes to work with him is the round vault at the bottom of the turrethe was dismissed with the warder for being supposed too much attached to george douglas the people are accustomed to see me work there and i warrant i shall find some excuse that will pass current with them for putting bellows and anvil to work  the scheme has a promising face said the queen about it my lad with all speed and beware the nature of your work is not discovered  nay i will take the liberty to draw the bolt against chance visitors so that i will have time to put away what i am working upon before i undo the door  will not that of itself attract suspicion in a place where it is so current already said catherine  not a whit replied roland gregory the armourer and every good hammerman locks himself in when he is about some master piece of craft  besides something must be risked  part we then tonight said the queen and god bless you my childrenif marys head ever rises above water you shall all rise along with her     chapter the thirtyfifth     it is a time of danger not of revel   when churchmen turn to masquers                      spanish father  the enterprise of roland graeme appeared to prosper a trinket or two of which the work did not surpass the substance for the materials were silver supplied by the queen were judiciously presented to those most likely to be inquisitive into the labours of the forge and anvil which they thus were induced to reckon profitable to others and harmless in itself openly the page was seen working about such trifles in private he forged a number of keys resembling so nearly in weight and in form those which were presented every evening to the lady lochleven that on a slight inspection it would have been difficult to perceive the difference he brought them to the dark rusty colour by the use of salt and water and in the triumph of his art presented them at length to queen mary in her presencechamber about an hour before the tolling of the curfew she looked at them with pleasure but at the same time with doubti allow she said that the lady lochlevens eyes which are not of the clearest may be well deceived could we pass those keys on her in place of the real implements of her tyranny but how is this to be done and which of my little court dare attempt this tour de jongleur with any chance of success could we but engage her in some earnest matter of argumentbut those which i hold with her always have been of a kind which make her grasp her keys the faster as if she said to herselfhere i hold what sets me above your taunts and reproachesand even for her liberty mary stuart could not stoop to speak the proud heretic fairwhat shall we do shall lady fleming try her eloquence in describing the last new headtire from parisalas the good dame has not changed the fashion of her headgear since pinkiefield for aught that i know shall my mignóne catherine sing to her one of those touching airs which draw the very souls out of me and roland graemealas dame margaret douglas would rather hear a huguenot psalm of clement marrot sung to the tune of reveillez vous belle endormiecousins and liege counsellors what is to be done for our wits are really astray in this mattermust our manatarms and the champion of our body roland graeme manfully assault the old lady and take the keys from her par voie du fait  nay with your graces permission said roland i do not doubt being able to manage the matter with more discretion for though in your graces service i do not fear  a host of old women interrupted catherine each armed with rock and spindle yet he has no fancy for pikes and partisans which might rise at the cry of help a douglas a douglas  they that do not fear fair ladies tongues continued the page need dread nothing elsebut gracious liege i am wellnigh satisfied that i could pass the exchange of these keys on the lady lochleven but i dread the sentinel who is now planted nightly in the garden which by necessity we must traverse  our last advices from our friends on the shore have promised us assistance in that matter replied the queen  and is your grace well assured of the fidelity and watchfulness of those without  for their fidelity i will answer with my life and for their vigilance i will answer with my lifei will give thee instant proof my faithful roland that they are ingenuous and trusty as thyself come hithernay catherine attend us we carry not so deft a page into our private chamber alone make fast the door of the parlour fleming and warn us if you hear the least stepor stay go thou to the door catherine in a whisper thy ears and thy wits are both sharpergood fleming attend us thyselfand again she whispered her reverend presence will be as safe a watch on roland as thine canso be not jealous mignone  thus speaking they were lighted by the lady fleming into the queens bedroom a small apartment enlightened by a projecting window  look from that window roland she said see you amongst the several lights which begin to kindle and to glimmer palely through the gray of the evening from the village of kinrossseest thou i say one solitary spark apart from the others and nearer it seems to the verge of the waterit is no brighter at this distance than the torch of the poor glowworm and yet my good youth that light is more dear to mary stuart than every star that twinkles in the blue vault of heaven by that signal i know that more than one true heart is plotting my deliverance and without that consciousness and the hope of freedom it gives me i had long since stooped to my fate and died of a broken heart plan after plan has been formed and abandoned but still the light glimmers and while it glimmers my hope livesoh how many evenings have i sat musing in despair over our ruined schemes and scarce hoping that i should again see that blessed signal when it has suddenly kindled and like the lights of saint elmo in a tempest brought hope and consolation where there was only dejection and despair  if i mistake not answered roland the candle shines from the house of blinkhoolie the mailgardener  thou hast a good eye said the queen it is there where my trusty liegesgod and the saints pour blessings on themhold consultation for my deliverance the voice of a wretched captive would die on these blue waters long ere it could mingle in their councils and yet i can hold communicationi will confide the whole to theei am about to ask those faithful friends if the moment for the great attempt is nighplace the lamp in the window fleming  she obeyed and immediately withdrew it no sooner had she done so than the light in the cottage of the gardener disappeared  now count said queen mary for my heart beats so thick that i cannot count myself  the lady fleming began deliberately to count one two three and when she had arrived at ten the light on the shore showed its pale twinkle  now our lady be praised said the queen it was but two nights since that the absence of the light remained while i could tell thirty the hour of deliverance approaches may god bless those who labour in it with such truth to mealas with such hazard to themselvesand bless you too my childrencome we must to the audiencechamber again our absence might excite suspicion should they serve supper  they returned to the presencechamber and the evening concluded as usual  the next morning at dinnertime an unusual incident occurred while lady douglas of lochleven performed her daily duty of assistant and taster at the queens table she was told a manatarms had arrived recommended by her son but without any letter or other token than what he brought by word of mouth  hath he given you that token demanded the lady  he reserved it as i think for your ladyships ear replied randal  he doth well said the lady tell him to wait in the hallbut nowith your permission madam to the queen let him attend me here  since you are pleased to receive your domestics in my presence said the queen i cannot choose  my infirmities must plead my excuse madam replied the lady the life i must lead here ill suits with the years which have passed over my head and compels me to waive ceremonial  oh my good lady replied the queen i would there were nought in this your castle more strongly compulsive than the cobweb chains of ceremony but bolts and bars are harder matters to contend with  as she spoke the person announced by randal entered the room and roland graeme at once recognized in him the abbot ambrosius  what is your name good fellow said the lady  edward glendinning answered the abbot with a suitable reverence  art thou of the blood of the knight of avenel said the lady of lochleven  ay madam and that nearly replied the pretended soldier  it is likely enough said the lady for the knight is the son of his own good works and has risen from obscure lineage to his present high rank in the estatebut he is of sure truth and approved worth and his kinsman is welcome to us you hold unquestionably the true faith  do not doubt of it madam said the disguised churchman  hast thou a token to me from sir william douglas said the lady  i have madam replied he but it must be said in private  thou art right said the lady moving towards the recess of a window say in what does it consist  in the words of an old bard replied the abbot  repeat them answered the lady and he uttered in a low tone the lines from an old poem called the howlet    o douglas douglas   tender and true  trusty sir john holland footnote sir john hollands poem of the howlet is known to collectors by the beautiful edition presented to the bannatyne club by mr david laing said the lady douglas apostrophizing the poet a kinder heart never inspired a rhyme and the douglass honour was ever on thy heartstring we receive you among our followers glendinningbut randal see that he keep the outer ward only till we shall hear more touching him from our sonthou fearest not the night air glendinning  in the cause of the lady before whom i stand i fear nothing madam answered the disguised abbot  our garrison then is stronger by one trustworthy soldier said the matrongo to the buttery and let them make much of thee  when the lady lochleven had retired the queen said to roland graeme who was now almost constantly in her company i spy comfort in that strangers countenance i know not why it should be so but i am well persuaded he is a friend  your graces penetration does not deceive you answered the page and he informed her that the abbot of st marys himself played the part of the newly arrived soldier  the queen crossed herself and looked upwards unworthy sinner that i am she said that for my sake a man so holy and so high in spiritual office should wear the garb of a base sworder and run the risk of dying the death of a traitor  heaven will protect its own servant madam said catherine seyton his aid would bring a blessing on our undertaking were it not already blest for its own sake  what i admire in my spiritual father said roland was the steady front with which he looked on me without giving the least sign of former acquaintance i did not think the like was possible since i have ceased to believe that henry was the same person with catherine  but marked you not how astuciously the good father said the queen eluded the questions of the woman lochleven telling her the very truth which yet she received not as such  roland thought in his heart that when the truth was spoken for the purpose of deceiving it was little better than a lie in disguise but it was no time to agitate such questions of conscience  and now for the signal from the shore exclaimed catherine my bosom tells me we shall see this night two lights instead of one gleam from that garden of edenand then roland do you play your part manfully and we will dance on the greensward like midnight fairies  catherines conjecture misgave not nor deceived her in the evening two beams twinkled from the cottage instead of one and the page heard with beating heart that the new retainer was ordered to stand sentinel on the outside of the castle when he intimated this news to the queen she held her hand out to himhe knelt and when he raised it to his lips in all dutiful homage he found it was damp and cold as marble for gods sake madam droop not nowsink not now  call upon our lady my liege said the lady flemingcall upon your tutelar saint  call the spirits of the hundred kings you are descended from exclaimed the page in this hour of need the resolution of a monarch were worth the aid of a hundred saints  oh roland graeme said mary in a tone of deep despondency be true to memany have been false to me alas i have not always been true to myself my mind misgives me that i shall die in bondage and that this bold attempt will cost all our lives it was foretold me by a soothsayer in france that i should die in prison and by a violent death and here comes the houroh would to god it found me prepared  madam said catherine seyton remember you are a queen better we all died in bravely attempting to gain our freedom than remained here to be poisoned as men rid them of the noxious vermin that haunt old houses  you are right catherine said the queen and mary will bear her like herself but alas your young and buoyant spirit can ill spell the causes which have broken mine forgive me my children and farewell for a whilei will prepare both mind and body for this awful venture  they separated till again called together by the tolling of the curfew the queen appeared grave but firm and resolved the lady fleming with the art of an experienced courtier knew perfectly how to disguise her inward tremors catherines eye was fired as if with the boldness of the project and the half smile which dwelt upon her beautiful mouth seemed to contemn all the risk and all the consequences of discovery roland who felt how much success depended on his own address and boldness summoned together his whole presence of mind and if he found his spirits flag for a moment cast his eye upon catherine whom he thought he had never seen look so beautifuli may be foiled he thought but with this reward in prospect they must bring the devil to aid them ere they cross me thus resolved he stood like a greyhound in the slips with hand heart and eye intent upon making and seizing opportunity for the execution of their project  the keys had with the wonted ceremonial been presented to the lady lochleven she stood with her back to the casement which like that of the queens apartment commanded a view of kinross with the church which stands at some distance from the town and nearer to the lake then connected with the town by straggling cottages with her back to this casement then and her face to the table on which the keys lay for an instant while she tasted the various dishes which were placed there stood the lady of lochleven more provokingly intent than usualso at least it seemed to her prisonersupon the huge and heavy bunch of iron the implements of their restraint just when having finished her ceremony as taster of the queens table she was about to take up the keys the page who stood beside her and had handed her the dishes in succession looked sideways to the churchyard and exclaimed he saw corpsecandles in the churchyard the lady of lochleven was not without a touch though a slight one of the superstitions of the time the fate of her sons made her alive to omens and a corpselight as it was called in the family burialplace boded death she turned her head towards the casementsaw a distant glimmeringforgot her charge for one second and in that second were lost the whole fruits of her former vigilance the page held the forged keys under his cloak and with great dexterity exchanged them for the real ones his utmost address could not prevent a slight clash as he took up the latter bunch who touches the keys said the lady and while the page answered that the sleeve of his cloak had stirred them she looked round possessed herself of the bunch which now occupied the place of the genuine keys and again turned to gaze on the supposed corpsecandles  i hold these gleams she said after a moments consideration to come not from the churchyard but from the hut of the old gardener blinkhoolie i wonder what thrift that churl drives that of late he hath ever had light in his house till the night grew deep i thought him an industrious peaceful manif he turns resetter of idle companions and nightwalkers the place must be rid of him  he may work his baskets perchance said the page desirous to stop the train of her suspicion  or nets may he not answered the lady  ay madam said roland for trout and salmon  or for fools and knaves replied the lady but this shall be looked after tomorrowi wish your grace and your company a good eveningrandal attend us and randal who waited in the antechamber after having surrendered his bunch of keys gave his escort to his mistress as usual while leaving the queens apartments she retired to her own end of paragraph missing in original  tomorrow said the page rubbing his hands with glee as he repeated the ladys last words fools look tomorrow and wise folk use tonightmay i pray you my gracious liege to retire for one half hour until all the castle is composed to rest i must go and rub with oil these blessed implements of our freedom courage and constancy and all will go well provided our friends on the shore fail not to send the boat you spoke of  fear them not said catherine they are true as steelif our dear mistress do but maintain her noble and royal courage  footnote in the dangerous expedition to aberdeenshire randolph the english ambassador gives cecil the following account of queen marys demeanour  in all those garbulles i assure your honour i never saw the queen merrier never dismayed nor never thought i that stomache to be in her that i find she repented nothing but when the lords and others at inverness came in the morning from the watches that she was not a man to know what life it was to lye all night in the fields or to walk upon the causeway with a jack and a knapscap a glasgow buckler and a broadswordrandolph to cecil september 18 1562  the writer of the above letter seems to have felt the same impression which catherine seyton in the text considered as proper to the queens presence among her armed subjects  though we neither thought nor looked for other than on that day to have fought or neverwhat desperate blows would not have been given when every man should have fought in the sight of so noble a queen and so many fair ladies our enemies to have taken them from us and we to save our honours not to be reft of them your honour can easily judgethe same to the same september 24 1562   doubt not me catherine replied the queen a while since i was overborne but i have recalled the spirit of my earlier and more sprightly days when i used to accompany my armed nobles and wish to be myself a man to know what life it was to be in the fields with sword and buckler jack and knapscap  oh the lark lives not a gayer life nor sings a lighter and gayer song than the merry soldier answered catherine your grace shall be in the midst of them soon and the look of such a liege sovereign will make each of your host worth three in the hour of needbut i must to my task  we have but brief time said queen mary one of the two lights in the cottage is extinguishedthat shows the boat is put off  they will row very slow said the page or kent where depth permits to avoid noiseto our several tasksi will communicate with the good father  at the dead hour of midnight when all was silent in the castle the page put the key into the lock of the wicket which opened into the garden and which was at the bottom of a staircase which descended from the queens apartment now turn smooth and softly thou good bolt said he if ever oil softened rust and his precautions had been so effectual that the bolt revolved with little or no sound of resistance he ventured not to cross the threshold but exchanging a word with the disguised abbot asked if the boat were ready  this half hour said the sentinel she lies beneath the wall too close under the islet to be seen by the warder but i fear she will hardly escape his notice in putting off again  the darkness said the page and our profound silence may take her off unobserved as she came in hildebrand has the watch on the towera heavyheaded knave who holds a can of ale to be the best headpiece upon a nightwatch he sleeps for a wager  then bring the queen said the abbot and i will call henry seyton to assist them to the boat  on tiptoe with noiseless step and suppressed breath trembling at every rustle of their own apparel one after another the fair prisoners glided down the winding stair under the guidance of roland graeme and were received at the wicketgate by henry seyton and the churchman the former seemed instantly to take upon himself the whole direction of the enterprise my lord abbot he said give my sister your armi will conduct the queenand that youth will have the honour to guide lady fleming  this was no time to dispute the arrangement although it was not that which roland graeme would have chosen catherine seyton who well knew the garden path tripped on before like a sylph rather leading the abbot than receiving assistancethe queen her native spirit prevailing over female fear and a thousand painful reflections moved steadily forward by the assistance of henry seytonwhile the lady fleming encumbered with her fears and her helplessness roland graeme who followed in the rear and who bore under the other arm a packet of necessaries belonging to the queen the door of the garden which communicated with the shore of the islet yielded to one of the keys of which roland had possessed himself although not until he had tried severala moment of anxious terror and expectation the ladies were then partly led partly carried to the side of the lake where a boat with six rowers attended them the men couched along the bottom to secure them from observation henry seyton placed the queen in the stern the abbot offered to assist catherine but she was seated by the queens side before he could utter his proffer of help and roland graeme was just lifting lady fleming over the boatside when a thought suddenly occurred to him and exclaiming forgotten forgotten wait for me but one halfminute he replaced on the shore the helpless lady of the bedchamber threw the queens packet into the boat and sped back through the garden with the noiseless speed of a bird on the wing  by heaven he is false at last said seyton i ever feared it  he is as true said catherine as heaven itself and that i will maintain  be silent minion said her brother for shame if not for fear fellows put off and row for your lives  help me help me on board said the deserted lady fleming and that louder than prudence warranted  put offput off cried henry seyton leave all behind so the queen is safe  will you permit this madam said catherine imploringly you leave your deliverer to death  i will not said the queenseyton i command you to stay at every risk  pardon me madam if i disobey said the intractable young man and with one hand lifting in lady fleming he began himself to push off the boat  she was two fathoms length from the shore and the rowers were getting her head round when roland graeme arriving bounded from the beach and attained the boat overturning seyton on whom he lighted the youth swore a deep but suppressed oath and stopping graeme as he stepped towards the stern said your place is not with highborn dameskeep at the head and trim the vesselnow give waygive wayrow for god and the queen  the rowers obeyed and began to pull vigorously  why did ye not muffle the oars said roland graeme the dash must awaken the sentinelrow lads and get out of reach of shot for had not old hildebrand the warder supped upon poppyporridge this whispering must have waked him  it was all thine own delay said seyton thou shalt reckon with me hereafter for that and other matters  but rolands apprehension was verified too instantly to permit him to reply the sentinel whose slumbering had withstood the whispering was alarmed by the dash of the oars his challenge was instantly heard a boata boatbring to or i shoot and as they continued to ply their oars he called aloud treason treason rung the bell of the castle and discharged his harquebuss at the boat the ladies crowded on each other like startled wild foul at the flash and report of the piece while the men urged the rowers to the utmost speed they heard more than one ball whiz along the surface of the lake at no great distance from their little bark and from the lights which glanced like meteors from window to window it was evident the whole castle was alarmed and their escape discovered  pull again exclaimed seyton stretch to your oars or i will spur you to the task with my daggerthey will launch a boat immediately  that is cared for said roland i locked gate and wicket on them when i went back and no boat will stir from the island this night if doors of good oak and bolts of iron can keep men within stonewallsand now i resign my office of porter of lochleven and give the keys to the kelpies keeping  as the heavy keys plunged in the lake the abbotwho till then had been repeating his prayers exclaimed now bless thee my son for thy ready prudence puts shame on us all  footnote it is well known that the escape of queen mary from lochleven was effected by george douglas the youngest brother of sir william douglas the lord of the castle but the minute circumstances of the event have been a good deal confused owing to two agents having been concerned in it who bore the same name it has been always supposed that george douglas was induced to abet marys escape by the ambitions hope that by such service he might merit her hand but his purpose was discovered by his brother sir william and he was expelled from the castle he continued notwithstanding to hover in the neighbourhood and maintain a correspondence with the royal prisoner and others in the fortress  if we believe the english ambassador drury the queen was grateful to george douglas and even proposed a marriage with him a scheme which could hardly be serious since she was still the wife of bothwell but which if suggested at all might be with a purpose of gratifying the regent murrays ambition and propitiating his favour since he was it must be remembered the brother uterine of george douglas for whom such high honour was said to be designed  the proposal if seriously made was treated as inadmissible and mary again resumed her purpose of escape her failure in her first attempt has some picturesque particulars which might have been advantageously introduced in fictitious narrative drury sends cecil the following account of the matter  but after upon the 25th of the last april 1567 she interprised an escape and was the rather near effect through her accustomed long lying in bed all the morning the manner of it was thus there cometh in to her the laundress early as other times before she was wanted and the queen according to such a secret practice putteth on her the hood of the laundress and so with the fardel of clothes and the muffler upon her face passeth out and entereth the boat to pass the loch which after some space one of them that rowed said merrily let us see what manner of dame this is and therewith offered to pull down her muffler which to defend she put up her hands which they spied to be very fair and white wherewith they entered into suspicion whom she was beginning to wonder at her enterprise whereat she was little dismayed but charged them upon danger of their lives to row her over to the shore which they nothing regarded but eftsoons rowed her back again promising her it should be secreted and especially from the lord of the house under whose guard she lyeth it seemeth she knew her refuge andwhere to have found it if she had once landed for there did and yet do linger at a little village called kinross hard at the loch side the same george douglas one sempel and one beton the which two were sometime her trusty servants and as yet appeareth they mind her no less affectionbishop keiths history of the affairs of church and state in scotland p 490  notwithstanding this disappointment little spoke of by historians mary renewed her attempts to escape there was in the castle of lochleven a lad named william douglas some relation probably of the baron and about eighteen years old this youth proved as accessible to queen marys prayers and promises as was the brother of his patron george douglas from whom this william must be carefully kept distinct it was young william who played the part commonly assigned to his superior george stealing the keys of the castle from the table on which they lay while his lord was at supper he let the queen and a waiting woman out of the apartment where they were secured and out of the tower itself embarked with them in a small skiff and rowed them to the shore to prevent instant pursuit he for precautions sake locked the iron grated door of the tower and threw the keys into the lake they found george douglas and the queens servant beton waiting for them and lord seyton and james hamilton of orbeiston in attendance at the head of a party of faithful followers with whom they fled to niddrie castle and from thence to hamilton  in narrating this romantic story both history and tradition confuse the two douglasses together and confer on george the successful execution of the escape from the castle the merit of which belongs in reality to the boy called william or more frequently the little douglas either from his youth or his slight stature the reader will observe that in the romance the part of the little douglas has been assigned to roland graeme in another case it would be tedious to point out in a work of amusement such minute points of historical fact but the general interest taken in the fate of queen mary renders every thing of consequence which connects itself with her misfortunes   i knew said mary drawing her breath more freely as they were now out of reach of the musketryi knew my squires truth promptitude and sagacityi must have him my dear friendswith my no less true knights douglas and seytonbut where then is douglas  here madam answered the deep and melancholy voice of the boatman who sat next her and who acted as steersman  alas was it you who stretched your body before me said the queen when the balls were raining around us  believe you said he in a low tone that douglas would have resigned to any one the chance of protecting his queens life with his own  the dialogue was here interrupted by a shot or two from one of those small pieces of artillery called falconets then used in defending castles the shot was too vague to have any effect but the broader flash the deeper sound the louder return which was made by the midnight echoes of bennarty terrified and imposed silence on the liberated prisoners the boat was alongside of a rude quay or landing place running out from a garden of considerable extent ere any of them again attempted to speak they landed and while the abbot returned thanks aloud to heavenwhich had thus far favoured their enterprise douglas enjoyed the best reward of his desperate undertaking in conducting the queen to the house of the gardener  yet not unmindful of roland graeme even in that moment of terror and exhaustion mary expressly commanded seyton to give his assistance to fleming while catherine voluntarily and without bidding took the arm of the page seyton presently resigned lady fleming to the care of the abbot alleging he must look after their horses and his attendants disencumbering themselves of their boatcloaks hastened to assist him  while mary spent in the gardeners cottage the few minutes which were necessary to prepare the steeds for their departure she perceived in a corner the old man to whom the garden belonged and called him to approach he came as it were with reluctance  how brother said the abbot so slow to welcome thy royal queen and mistress to liberty and to her kingdom  the old man thus admonished came forward and in good terms of speech gave her grace joy of her deliverance the queen returned him thanks in the most gracious manner and added it will remain to us to offer some immediate reward for your fidelity for we wot well your house has been long the refuge in which our trusty servants have met to concert measures for our freedom so saying she offered gold and added we will consider your services more fully hereafter  kneel brother said the abbot kneel instantly and thank her graces kindness  good brother that wert once a few steps under me and art still many years younger replied the gardener pettishly let me do mine acknowledgments in my own way queens have knelt to me ere now and in truth my knees are too old and stiff to bend even to this lovelyfaced lady may it please your grace if your graces servants have occupied my house so that i could not call it mine ownif they have trodden down my flowers in the zeal of their midnight comings and goings and destroyed the hope of the fruit season by bringing their warhorses into my garden i do but crave of your grace in requital that you will choose your residence as far from me as possible i am an old man who would willingly creep to my grave as easily as i can in peace goodwill and quiet labour  i promise you fairly good man said the queen i will not make yonder castle my residence again if i can help it but let me press on you this moneyit will make some amends for the havoc we have made in your little garden and orchard  i thank your grace but it will make me not the least amends said the old man the ruined labours of a whole year are not so easily replaced to him who has perchance but that one year to live and besides they tell me i must leave this place and become a wanderer in mine old agei that have nothing on earth saving these fruittrees and a few old parchments and family secrets not worth knowing as for gold if i had loved it i might have remained lord abbot of st marysand yet i wot notfor if abbot boniface be but the poor peasant blinkhoolie his successor the abbot ambrosius is still transmuted for the worse into the guise of a swordandbucklerman  is this indeed the abbot boniface of whom i have heard said the queen it is indeed i who should have bent the knee for your blessing good father  bend no knee to me lady the blessing of an old man who is no longer an abbot go with you over dale and downi hear the trampling of your horses  farewell father said the queen when we are once more seated at holyrood we will neither forget thee nor thine injured garden  forget us both said the exabbot boniface and may god be with you  as they hurried out of the house they heard the old man talking and muttering to himself as he hastily drew bolt and bar behind them  the revenge of the douglasses will reach the poor old man said the queen god help me i ruin every one whom i approach  his safety is cared for said seyton he must not remain here but will be privately conducted to a place of greater security but i would your grace were in the saddleto horse to horse  the party of seyton and of douglas were increased to about ten by those attendants who had remained with the horses the queen and her ladies with all the rest who came from the boat were instantly mounted and holding aloof from the village which was already alarmed by the firing from the castle with douglas acting as their guide they soon reached the open ground and began to ride as fast as was consistent with keeping together in good order     chapter the thirtysixth     he mounted himself on a coalblack steed    and her on a freckled gray   with a bugelet horn hung down from his side    and roundly they rode away                                old ballad  the influence of the free air the rushing of the horses over high and low the ringing of the bridles the excitation at once arising from a sense of freedom and of rapid motion gradually dispelled the confused and dejected sort of stupefaction by which queen mary was at first overwhelmed she could not at last conceal the change of her feelings to the person who rode at her rein and who she doubted not was the father ambrosius for seyton with all the heady impetuosity of a youth proud and justly so of his first successful adventure assumed all the bustle and importance of commander of the little party which escorted in the language of the time the fortune of scotland he now led the van now checked his bounding steed till the rear had come up exhorted the leaders to keep a steady though rapid pace and commanded those who were hindmost of the party to use their spurs and allow no interval to take place in their line of march and anon he was beside the queen or her ladies inquiring how they brooked the hasty journey and whether they had any commands for him but while seyton thus busied himself in the general cause with some advantage to the regular order of the march and a good deal of personal ostentation the horseman who rode beside the queen gave her his full and undivided attention as if he had been waiting upon some superior being when the road was rugged and dangerous he abandoned almost entirely the care of his own horse and kept his hand constantly upon the queens bridle if a river or larger brook traversed their course his left arm retained her in the saddle while his right held her palfreys rein  i had not thought reverend father said the queen when they reached the other bank that the convent bred such good horsementhe person she addressed sighed but made no other answeri know not how it is said queen mary but either the sense of freedom or the pleasure of my favourite exercise from which i have been so long debarred or both combined seem to have given wings to meno fish ever shot through the water no bird through the air with the hurried feeling of liberty and rapture with which i sweep through this nightwind and over these wolds nay such is the magic of feeling myself once more in the saddle that i could almost swear i am at this moment mounted on my own favourite rosabelle who was never matched in scotland for swiftness for ease of motion and for sureness of foot  and if the horse which bears so dear a burden could speak answered the deep voice of the melancholy george of douglas would she not reply who but rosabelle ought at such an emergence as this to serve her beloved mistress or who but douglas ought to hold her bridlerein  queen mary started she foresaw at once all the evils like to arise to herself and him from the deep enthusiastic passion of this youth but her feelings as a woman grateful at once and compassionate prevented her assuming the dignity of a queen and she endeavoured to continue the conversation in an indifferent tone  methought she said i heard that at the division of my spoils rosabelle had become the property of lord mortons paramour and ladyelove alice  the noble palfrey had indeed been destined to so base a lot answered douglas she was kept under four keys and under the charge of a numerous crew of grooms and domesticsbut queen mary needed rosabelle and rosabelle is here  and was it well douglas said queen mary when such fearful risks of various kinds must needs be encountered that you should augment their perils to yourself for a subject of so little moment as a palfrey  do you call that of little moment answered douglas which has afforded you a moments pleasuredid you not start with joy when i first said you were mounted on rosabelleand to purchase you that pleasure though it were to last no longer than the flash of lightning doth would not douglas have risked his life a thousand times  oh peace douglas peace said the queen this is unfitting language and besides i would speak said she recollecting herself with the abbot of saint marysnay douglas i will not let you quit my rein in displeasure  displeasure lady answered douglas alas sorrow is all that i can feel for your wellwarranted contempti should be as soon displeased with heaven for refusing the wildest wish which mortal can form  abide by my rein however said mary there is room for my lord abbot on the other side and besides i doubt if his assistance would be so useful to rosabelle and me as yours has been should the road again require it  the abbot came up on the other side and she immediately opened a conversation with him on the topic of the state of parties and the plan fittest for her to pursue inconsequence of her deliverance in this conversation douglas took little share and never but when directly applied to by the queen while as before his attention seemed entirely engrossed by the care of marys personal safety she learned however she had a new obligation to him since by his contrivance the abbot whom he had furnished with the family password was introduced into the castle as one of the garrison  long before daybreak they ended their hasty and perilous journey before the gates of niddrie a castle in west lothian belonging to lord seyton  when the queen was about to alight henry seyton preventing douglas received her in his arms and kneeling down prayed her majesty to enter the house of his father her faithful servant  your grace he added may repose yourself here in perfect safety it is already garrisoned with good men for your protection and i have sent a post to my father whose instant arrival at the head of five hundred men may be looked for do not dismay yourself therefore should your sleep be broken by the trampling of horse but only think that here are some scores more of the saucy seytons come to attend you  and by better friends than the saucy seytons a scottish queen cannot be guarded replied mary rosabelle went fleet as the summer breeze and wellnigh as easy but it is long since i have been a traveller and i feel that repose will be welcomecatherine ma mignone you must sleep in my apartment tonight and bid me welcome to your noble fathers castlethanks thanks to all my kind deliverers thanks and a good night is all i can now offer but if i climb once more to the upper side of fortunes wheel i will not have her bandage mary stewart will keep her eyes open and distinguish her friendsseyton i need scarcely recommend the venerable abbot the douglas and my page to your honour able care and hospitality  henry seyton bowed and catherine and lady fleming attended the queen to her apartment where acknowledging to them that she should have found it difficult in that moment to keep her promise of holding her eyes open she resigned herself to repose and awakened not till the morning was advanced  marys first feeling when she awoke was the doubt of her freedom and the impulse prompted her to start from bed and hastily throwing her mantle over her shoulders to look out at the casement of her apartment oh sight of joy instead of the crystal sheet of lochleven unaltered save by the influence of the wind a landscape of wood and moorland lay before her and the park around the castle was occupied by the troops of her most faithful and most favourite nobles  rise rise catherine cried the enraptured princess arise and come hitherhere are swords and spears in true hands and glittering armour on loyal breasts here are banners my girl floating in the wind as lightly as summer cloudsgreat god what pleasure to my weary eyes to trace their devicesthine own brave fathersthe princely hamiltonsthe faithful flemingsseeseethey have caught a glimpse of me and throng towards the window  she flung the casement open and with her bare head from which the tresses flew back loose and dishevelled her fair arm slenderly veiled by her mantle returned by motion and sign the exulting shouts of the warriors which echoed for many a furlong around when the first burst of ecstatic joy was over she recollected how lightly she was dressed and putting her hands to her face which was covered with blushes at the recollection withdrew abruptly from the window the cause of her retreat was easily conjectured and increased the general enthusiasm for a princess who had forgotten her rank in her haste to acknowledge the services of her subjects the unadorned beauties of the lovely woman too moved the military spectators more than the highest display of her regal state might and what might have seemed too free in her mode of appearing before them was more than atoned for by the enthusiasm of the moment and by the delicacy evinced in her hasty retreat often as the shouts died away as often were they renewed till wood and hill rung again and many a deep path was made that morning on the cross of the sword that the hand should not part with the weapon till mary stewart was restored to her rights but what are promises what the hopes of mortals in ten days these gallant and devoted votaries were slain were captives or had fled  mary flung herself into the nearest seat and still blushing yet half smiling exclaimed ma mignone what will they think of meto show myself to them with my bare feet hastily thrust into the slippersonly this loose mantle about memy hair loose on my shouldersmy arms and neck so bareoh the best they can suppose is that her abode in yonder dungeon has turned their queens brain but my rebel subjects saw me exposed when i was in the depth of affliction why should i hold colder ceremony with these faithful and loyal mencall fleming howeveri trust she has not forgotten the little mail with my apparelwe must be as brave as we can mignóne  nay madam our good lady fleming was in no case to remember any thing  you jest catherine said the queen somewhat offended it is not in her nature surely to forget her duty so far as to leave us without a change of apparel  roland graeme madam took care of that answered catherine for he threw the mail with your highnesss clothes and jewels into the boat ere he ran back to lock the gatei never saw so awkward a page as that youththe packet wellnigh fell on my head  he shall make thy heart amends my girl said queen mary laughing for that and all other offences given but call fleming and let us put ourselves into apparel to meet our faithful lords  such had been the preparations and such was the skill of lady fleming that the queen appeared before her assembled nobles in such attire as became though it could not enhance her natural dignity with the most winning courtesy she expressed to each individual her grateful thanks and dignified not only every noble but many of the lesser barons by her particular attention  and whither now my lords she said what way do your counsels determine for us  to draphane castle replied lord arbroath if your majesty is so pleased and thence to dunbarton to place your graces person in safety after which we long to prove if these traitors will abide us in the field  and when do we journey  we propose said lord seyton if your graces fatigue will permit to take horse after the mornings meal  your pleasure my lords is mine replied the queen we will rule our journey by your wisdom now and hope hereafter to have the advantage of governing by it our kingdomyou will permit my ladies and me my good lords to break our fasts along with youwe must be half soldiers ourselves and set state apart  low bowed many a helmeted head at this gracious proffer when the queen glancing her eyes through the assembled leaders missed both douglas and roland graeme and inquired for them in a whisper to catherine seyton  they are in yonder oratory madam sad enough replied catherine and the queen observed that her favourites eyes were red with weeping  this must not be said the queen keep the company amusedi will seek them and introduce them myself  she went into the oratory where the first she met was george douglas standing or rather reclining in the recess of a window his back rested against the wall and his arms folded on his breast at the sight of the queen he started and his countenance showed for an instant an expression of intense delight which was instantly exchanged for his usual deep melancholy  what means this she said douglas why does the first deviser and bold executor of the happy scheme for our freedom shun the company of his fellownobles and of the sovereign whom he has obliged  madam replied douglas those whom you grace with your presence bring followers to aid your cause wealth to support your statecan offer you halls in which to feast and impregnable castles for your defence i am a houseless and landless mandisinherited by my mother and laid under her maledictiondisowned by my name and kindredwho bring nothing to your standard but a single sword and the poor life of its owner  do you mean to upbraid me douglas replied the queen by showing what you have lost for my sake  god forbid madam interrupted the young man eagerly were it to do again and had i ten times as much rank and wealth and twenty times as many friends to lose my losses would be overpaid by the first step you made as a free princess upon the soil of your native kingdom  and what then ails you that you will not rejoice with those who rejoice upon the same joyful occasion said the queen  madam replied the youth though exheridated and disowned i am yet a douglas with most of yonder nobles my family have been in feud for agesa cold reception amongst them were an insult and a kind one yet more humiliating  for shame douglas replied the queen shake off this unmanly gloomi can make thee match for the best of them in title and fortune and believe me i willgo then amongst them i command you  that word said douglas is enoughi go this only let me say that not for wealth or title would i have done that which i have donemary stewart will not and the queen cannot reward me  so saying he left the oratory mingled with the nobles and placed himself at the bottom of the table the queen looked after him and put her kerchief to her eyes  now our lady pity me she said for no sooner are my prison cares ended than those which beset me as a woman and a queen again thicken around mehappy elizabeth to whom political interest is every thing and whose heart never betrays thy headand now must i seek this other boy if i would prevent daggersdrawing betwixt him and the young seyton  roland graeme was in the same oratory but at such a distance from douglas that he could not overhear what passed betwixt the queen and him he also was moody and thoughtful but cleared his brow at the queens question how now roland you are negligent in your attendance this morning are you so much overcome with your nights ride  not so gracious madam answered graeme but i am told the page of lochleven is not the page of niddrie castle and so master henry seyton hath in a manner been pleased to supersede my attendance  now heaven forgive me said the queen how soon these cockchickens begin to sparwith children and boys at least i may be a queeni will have you friendssome one send me henry seyton hither as she spoke the last words aloud the youth whom she had named entered the apartment come hither she said henry seytoni will have you give your hand to this youth who so well aided in the plan of my escape  willingly madam answered seyton so that the youth will grant me as a boon that he touch not the hand of another seyton whom he knows of my hand has passed current for hers with him before nowand to win my friendship he must give up thoughts of my sisters love  henry seyton said the queen does it become you to add any condition to my command  madam said henry i am the servant of your graces throne son to the most loyal man in scotland our goods our castles our blood are yours our honour is in our own keeping i could say more but  nay speak on rude boy said the queen what avails it that i am released from lochleven if i am thus enthralled under the yoke of my pretended deliverers and prevented from doing justice to one who has deserved as well of me as yourself  be not in this distemperature for me sovereign lady said roland this young gentleman being the faithful servant of your grace and the brother of catherine seyton bears that about him which will charm down my passion at the hottest  i warn thee once more said henry seyton haughtily that you make no speech which may infer that the daughter of lord seyton can be aught to thee beyond what she is to every churls blood in scotland  the queen was again about to interfere for rolands complexion rose and it became somewhat questionable how long his love for catherine would suppress the natural fire of his temper but the interposition of another person hitherto unseen prevented marys interference there was in the oratory a separate shrine enclosed with a high screen of pierced oak within which was placed an image of saint bennet of peculiar sanctity from this recess in which she had been probably engaged in her devotions issued suddenly magdalen graeme and addressed henry seyton in reply to his last offensive expressionsand of what clay then are they moulded these seytons that the blood of the graemes may not aspire to mingle with theirs know proud boy that when i call this youth my daughters child i affirm his descent from malise earl of strathern called malise with the bright brand and i trow the blood of your house springs from no higher source  good mother said seyton methinks your sanctity should make you superior to these worldly vanities and indeed it seems to have rendered you somewhat oblivious touching them since to be of gentle descent the fathers name and lineage must be as well qualified as the mothers  and if i say he comes of the blood of avenel by the fathers side replied magdalen graeme name i not blood as richly coloured as thine own  of avenel said the queen is my page descended of avenel  ay gracious princess and the last male heir of that ancient housejulian avenel was his father who fell in battle against the southron  i have heard the tale of sorrow said the queen it was thy daughter then who followed that unfortunate baron to the field and died on his body alas how many ways does womans affection find to work out her own misery the tale has oft been told and sung in hall and bowerand thou roland art that child of misfortune who was left among the dead and dying henry seyton he is thine equal in blood and birth  scarcely so said henry seyton even were he legitimate but if the tale be told and sung aright julian avenel was a false knight and his leman a frail and credulous maiden  now by heaven thou liest said roland graeme and laid his hand on his sword the entrance of lord seyton however prevented violence  save me my lord said the queen and separate these wild and untamed spirits  how henry said the baron are my castle and the queens presence no checks on thine insolence and impetuosityand with whom art thou brawlingunless my eyes spell that token false it is with the very youth who aided me so gallantly in the skirmish with the leslieslet me look fair youth at the medal which thou wearest in thy cap by saint bennet it is the samehenry i command thee to forbear him as thou lovest my blessing  and as you honour my command said the queen good service hath he done me  ay madam replied young seyton as when he carried the billet enclosed in the swordsheath to lochlevenmarry the good youth knew no more than a packhorse what he was carrying  but i who dedicated him to this great work said magdalen graemei by whose advice and agency this just heir hath been unloosed from her thraldomi who spared not the last remaining hope of a falling house in this great actioni at least knew and counselled and what merit may be mine let the reward most gracious queen descend upon this youth my ministry here is ended you are freea sovereign princess at the head of a gallant army surrounded by valiant baronsmy service could avail you no farther but might well prejudice you your fortune now rests upon mens hearts and mens swords may they prove as trusty as the faith of women  you will not leave us mother said the queenyou whose practices in our favour were so powerful who dared so many dangers and wore so many disguises to blind our enemies and to confirm our friendsyou will not leave us in the dawn of our reviving fortunes ere we have time to know and to thank you  you cannot know her answered magdalen graeme who knows not herselfthere are times when in this womans frame of mine there is the strength of him of gathin this overtoiled brain the wisdom of the most sage counsellorand again the mist is on me and my strength is weakness my wisdom folly i have spoken before princes and cardinalsay noble princess even before the princes of thine own house of lorraine and i know not whence the words of persuasion came which flowed from my lips and were drunk in by their earsand now even when i most need words of persuasion there is something which chokes my voice and robs me of utterance  if there be aught in my power to do thee pleasure said the queen the barely naming it shall avail as well as all thine eloquence  sovereign lady replied the enthusiast it shames me that at this high moment something of human frailty should cling to one whose vows the saints have heard whose labours in the rightful cause heaven has prospered but it will be thus while the living spirit is shrined in the clay of mortalityi will yield to the folly she said weeping as she spoke and it shall be the last then seizing rolands hand she led him to the queens feet kneeling herself upon one knee and causing him to kneel on both mighty princess she said look on this flowerit was found by a kindly stranger on a bloody field of battle and long it was ere my anxious eyes saw and my arms pressed all that was left of my only daughter for your sake and for that of the holy faith we both profess i could leave this plant while it was yet tender to the nurture of strangersay of enemies by whom perchance his blood would have been poured forth as wine had the heretic glendinning known that he had in his house the heir of julian avenel since then i have seen him only in a few hours of doubt and dread and now i part with the child of my lovefor everfor everoh for every weary step i have made in your rightful cause in this and in foreign lands give protection to the child whom i must no more call mine  i swear to you mother said the queen deeply affected that for your sake and his own his happiness and fortunes shall be our charge  i thank you daughter of princes said magdalen and pressed her lips first to the queens hand then to the brow of her grandson and now she said drying her tears and rising with dignity earth has had its own and heaven claims the restlioness of scotland go forth and conquer  and if the prayers of a devoted votaress can avail thee they will rise in many a land and from many a distant shrine i will glide like a ghost from land to land from temple to temple and where the very name of my country is unknown the priests shall ask who is the queen of that distant northern land for whom the aged pilgrim was so fervent in prayer farewell honour be thine and earthly prosperity if it be the will of godif not may the penance thou shalt do here ensure thee happiness hereafterlet no one speak or follow memy resolution is takenmy vow cannot be cancelled  she glided from their presence as she spoke and her last look was upon her beloved grandchild he would have risen and followed but the queen and lord seyton interfered  press not on her now said lord seyton if you would not lose her for ever many a time have we seen the sainted mother and often at the most needful moment but to press on her privacy or to thwart her purpose is a crime which she cannot pardon i trust we shall yet see her at her needa holy woman she is for certain and dedicated wholly to prayer and penance and hence the heretics hold her as one distracted while true catholics deem her a saint  let me then hope said the queen that you my lord will aid me in the execution of her last request  what in the protection of my young secondcheerfullythat is in all that your majesty can think it fitting to ask of mehenry give thy hand upon the instant to roland avenel for so i presume he must now be called  and shall be lord of the barony said the queen if god prosper our rightful arms  it can only be to restore it to my kind protectress who now holds it said young avenel i would rather be landless all my life than she lost a rood of ground by me  nay said the queen looking to lord seyton his mind matches his birthhenry thou hast not yet given thy hand  it is his said henry giving it with some appearance of courtesy but whispering roland at the same timefor all this thou hast not my sisters  may it please your grace said lord seyton now that these passages are over to honour our poor meal time it were that our banners were reflected in the clyde we must to horse with as little delay as may be     chapter the thirtyseventh     ay sirour ancient crown in these wild times   oft stood upon a castthe gamesters ducat   so often staked and lost and then regaind   scarce knew so many hazards                           the spanish father  it is not our object to enter into the historical part of the reign of the illfated mary or to recount how during the week which succeeded her flight from lochleven her partisans mustered around her with their followers forming a gallant army amounting to six thousand men so much light has been lately thrown on the most minute details of the period by mr chalmers in his valuable history of queen mary that the reader may be safely referred to it for the fullest information which ancient records afford concerning that interesting time it is sufficient for our purpose to say that while marys headquarters were at hamilton the regent and his adherents had in the kings name assembled a host at glasgow inferior indeed to that of the queen in numbers but formidable from the military talents of murray morton the laird of grange and others who had been trained from their youth in foreign and domestic wars  in these circumstances it was the obvious policy of queen mary to avoid a conflict secure that were her person once in safety the number of her adherents must daily increase whereas the forces of those opposed to her must as had frequently happened in the previous history of her reign have diminished and their spirits become broken and so evident was this to her counsellors that they resolved their first step should be to place the queen in the strong castle of dunbarton there to await the course of events the arrival of succours from france and the levies which were made by her adherents in every province of scotland accordingly orders were given that all men should be on horseback or on foot apparelled in their armour and ready to follow the queens standard in array of battle the avowed determination being to escort her to the castle of dunbarton in defiance of her enemies  the muster was made upon hamiltonmoor and the march commenced in all the pomp of feudal times military music sounded banners and pennons waved armour glittered far and wide and spears glanced and twinkled like stars in a frosty sky the gallant spectacle of warlike parade was on this occasion dignified by the presence of the queen herself who with a fair retinue of ladies and household attendants and a special guard of gentlemen amongst whom young seyton and roland were distinguished gave grace at once and confidence to the army which spread its ample files before around and behind her many churchmen also joined the cavalcade most of whom did not scruple to assume arms and declare their intention of wielding them in defence of mary and the catholic faith not so the abbot of saint marys roland had not seen this prelate since the night of their escape from lochleven and he now beheld him robed in the dress of his order assume his station near the queens person roland hastened to pull off his basnet and beseech the abbots blessing  thou hast it my son said the priest i see thee now under thy true name and in thy rightful garb the helmet with the holly branch befits your brows welli have long waited for the hour thou shouldst assume it  then you knew of my descent my good father said roland  i did so but it was under seal of confession from thy grandmother nor was i at liberty to tell the secret till she herself should make it known  her reason for such secrecy my father said roland avenel  fear perchance of my brothera mistaken fear for halbert would not to ensure himself a kingdom have offered wrong to an orphan besides that your title in quiet times even had your father done your mother that justice which i well hope he did could not have competed with that of my brothers wife the child of julians elder brother  they need fear no competition from me said avenel scotland is wide enough and there are many manors to win without plundering my benefactor but prove to me my reverend father that my father was just to my mothershow me that i may call myself a legitimate avenel and make me your bounden slave for ever  ay replied the abbot i hear the seytons hold thee cheap for that stain on thy shield something however i have learnt from the late abbot boniface which if it prove sooth may redeem that reproach  tell me that blessed news said roland and the future service of my life  rash boy said the abbot i should but madden thine impatient temper by exciting hopes that may never be fulfilledand is this a time for them think on what perilous march we are bound and if thou hast a sin unconfessed neglect not the only leisure which heaven may perchance afford thee for confession and absolution  there will be time enough for both i trust when we reach dunbarton answered the page  ay said the abbot thou crowest as loudly as the restbut we are not yet at dunbarton and there is a lion in the path  mean you murray morton and the other rebels at glasgow my reverend father tush they dare not look on the royal banner  even so replied the abbot speak many of those who are older and should be wiser than thoui have returned from the southern shires where i left many a chief of name arming in the queens interesti left the lords here wise and considerate meni find them madmen on my returnthey are willing for mere pride and vainglory to brave the enemy and to carry the queen as it were in triumph past the walls of glasgow and under the beards of the adverse armyseldom does heaven smile on such mistimed confidence we shall be encountered and that to the purpose  and so much the better replied roland the field of battle was my cradle  beware it be not thy dying bed said the abbot but what avails it whispering to young wolves the dangers of the chase you will know perchance ere this day is out what yonder men are whom you hold in rash contempt  why what are they said henry seyton who now joined them have they sinews of wire and flesh of ironwill lead pierce and steel cut themif so reverend father we have little to fear  they are evil men said the abbot but the trade of war demands no saintsmurray and morton are known to be the best generals in scotland no one ever saw lindesays or ruthvens backkirkaldy of grange was named by the constable montmorency the first soldier in europemy brother too good a name for such a cause has been far and wide known for a soldier  the better the better said seyton triumphantly we shall have all these traitors of rank and name in a fair field before us our cause is the best our numbers are the strongest our hearts and limbs match theirssaint bennet and set on  the abbot made no reply but seemed lost in reflection and his anxiety in some measure communicated itself to roland avenel who ever as their line of march led over a ridge or an eminence cast an anxious look towards the towers of glasgow as if he expected to see symptoms of the enemy issuing forth it was not that he feared the fight but the issue was of such deep import to his country and to himself that the natural fire of his spirit burned with a less lively though with a more intense glow love honour fame fortune all seemed to depend on the issue of one field rashly hazarded perhaps but now likely to become unavoidable and decisive  when at length their march came to be nearly parallel with the city of glasgow roland became sensible that the high grounds before them were already in part occupied by a force showing like their own the royal banner of scotland and on the point of being supported by columns of infantry and squadrons of horse which the city gates had poured forth and which hastily advanced to sustain those troops who already possessed the ground in front of the queens forces horseman after horseman galloped in from the advanced guard with tidings that murray had taken the field with his whole army that his object was to intercept the queens march and his purpose unquestionable to hazard a battle it was now that the tempers of men were subjected to a sudden and a severe trial and that those who had too presumptuously concluded that they would pass without combat were something disconcerted when at once and with little time to deliberate they found themselves placed in front of a resolute enemytheir chiefs immediately assembled around the queen and held a hasty council of war marys quivering lip confessed the fear which she endeavoured to conceal under a bold and dignified demeanour but her efforts were overcome by painful recollections of the disastrous issue of her last appearance in arms at carberryhill and when she meant to have asked them their advice for ordering the battle she involuntarily inquired whether there were no means of escaping without an engagement  escaping answered the lord seyton when i stand as one to ten of your highnesss enemies i may think of escapebut never while i stand with three to two  battle battle exclaimed the assembled lords we will drive the rebels from their vantage ground as the hound turns the hare on the hill side  methinks my noble lords said the abbot it were as well to prevent his gaining that advantageour road lies through yonder hamlet on the brow and whichever party hath the luck to possess it with its little gardens and enclosures will attain a post of great defence  the reverend father is right said the queen oh haste thee seyton haste and get thither before themthey are marching like the wind  seyton bowed low and turned his horses headyour highness honours me he said i will instantly press forward and seize the pass  not before me my lord whose charge is the command of the vanguard said the lord of arbroath  before you or any hamilton in scotland said the seyton having the queens commandfollow me gentlemen my vassals and kinsmen saint bennet and set on  and follow me said arbroath my noble kinsmen and brave mentenants we will see which will first reach the post of danger for god and queen mary  illomened haste and most unhappy strife said the abbot who saw them and their followers rush hastily and emulously to ascend the height without waiting till their men were placed in orderand you gentlemen he continued addressing roland and seyton who were each about to follow those who hastened thus disorderly to the conflict will you leave the queens person unguarded  oh leave me not gentlemen said the queenroland and seyton do not leave methere are enough of arms to strike in this fell combat withdraw not those to whom i trust for my safety  we may not leave her grace said roland looking at seyton and turning his horse  i ever looked when thou wouldst find out that rejoined the fiery youth  roland made no answer but bit his lip till the blood came and spurring his horse up to the side of catherine seytons palfrey he whispered in a low voice i never thought to have done aught to deserve you but this day i have heard myself upbraided with cowardice and my sword remained still sheathed and all for the love of you  there is madness among us all said the damsel my father my brother and you are all alike bereft of reason ye should think only of this poor queen and you are all inspired by your own absurd jealousiesthe monk is the only soldier and man of sense amongst you allmy lord abbot she cried aloud were it not better we should draw to the westward and wait the event that god shall send us instead of remaining here in the highway endangering the queens person and cumbering the troops in their advance  you say well my daughter replied the abbot had we but one to guide us where the queens person may be in safetyour nobles hurry to the conflict without casting a thought on the very cause of the war  follow me said a knight or manatarms well mounted and attired completely in black armour but having the visor of his helmet closed and bearing no crest on his helmet or device upon his shield  we will follow no stranger said the abbot without some warrant of his truth  i am a stranger and in your hands said the horseman if you wish to know more of me the queen herself will be your warrant  the queen had remained fixed to the spot as if disabled by fear yet mechanically smiling bowing and waving her hand as banners were lowered and spears depressed before her while emulating the strife betwixt seyton and arbroath band on band pressed forward their march towards the enemy scarce however had the black rider whispered something in her ear than she assented to what he said and when he spoke aloud and with an air of command gentlemen it is the queens pleasure that you should follow me mary uttered with something like eagerness the word yes  all were in motion in an instant for the black horseman throwing off a sort of apathy of manner which his first appearance indicated spurred his horse to and fro making him take such active bounds and short turns as showed the rider master of the animal and getting the queens little retinue in some order for marching he led them to the left directing his course towards a castle which crowning a gentle yet commanding eminence presented an extensive view over the country beneath and in particular commanded a view of those heights which both armies hastened to occupy and which it was now apparent must almost instantly be the scene of struggle and dispute  yonder towers said the abbot questioning the sable horseman to whom do they belongand are they in the hands of friends  they are untenanted replied the stranger or at least they have no hostile inmatesbut urge these youths sir abbot to make more hastethis is but an evil time to satisfy their idle curiosity by peering out upon the battle in which they are to take no share  the worse luck mine said henry seyton who overheard himi would rather be under my fathers banner at this moment than be made chamberlain of holyrood for this my present duty of peaceful ward well and patiently discharged  your place under your fathers banner will shortly be right dangerous said roland avenel who pressing his horse towards the westward had still his look reverted to the armies for i see yonder body of cavalry which presses from the eastward will reach the village ere lord seyton can gain it  they are but cavalry said seyton looking attentively they cannot hold the village without shot of harquebuss  look more closely said roland you will see that each of these horseman who advance so rapidly from glasgow carries a footman behind him  now by heaven he speaks well said the black cavalier one of you two must go carry the news to lord seyton and lord arbroath that they hasten not their horsemen on before the foot but advance more regularly  be that my errand said roland for i first marked the stratagem of the enemy  but by your leave said seyton yonder is my fathers banner engaged and it best becomes me to go to the rescue  i will stand by the queens decision said roland avenel  what new appealwhat new quarrel said queen maryare there not in yonder dark host enemies enough to mary stewart but must her very friends turn enemies to each other  nay madam said roland the young master of seyton and i did but dispute who should leave your person to do a most needful message to the host he thought his rank entitled him and i deemed that the person of least consequence being myself were better perilled  not so said the queen if one must leave me be it seyton  henry seyton bowed till the white plumes on his helmet mixed with the flowing mane of his gallant warhorse then placed himself firm in the saddle shook his lance aloft with an air of triumph and determination and striking his horse with the spurs made towards his fathers banner which was still advancing up the hill and dashed his steed over every obstacle that occurred in his headlong path  my brother my father exclaimed catherine with an expression of agonized apprehensionthey are in the midst of peril and i in safety  would to god said roland that i were with them and could ransom every drop of their blood by two of mine  do i not know thou dost wish it said catherinecan a woman say to a man what i have wellnigh said to thee and yet think that he could harbour fear or faintness of heartthere is that in yon distant sound of approaching battle that pleases me even while it affrights me i would i were a man that i might feel that stern delight without the mixture of terror  ride up ride up lady catherine seyton cried the abbot as they still swept on at a rapid pace and were now close beneath the walls of the castleride up and aid lady fleming to support the queenshe gives way more and more  they halted and lifted mary from the saddle and were about to support her towards the castle when she said faintly not therenot therethese walls will i never enter more  be a queen madam said the abbot and forget that you are a woman  oh i must forget much much more answered the unfortunate mary in an under tone ere i can look with steady eyes on these wellknown scenesi must forget the days which i spent here as the bride of the lostthe murdered  this is the castle of crookstone said the lady fleming in which the queen held her first court after she was married to darnley  heaven said the abbot thy hand is upon usbear yet up madam your foes are the foes of holy church and god will this day decide whether scotland shall be catholic or heretic  a heavy and continued fire of cannon and musketry bore a tremendous burden to his words and seemed far more than they to recall the spirits of the queen  to yonder tree she said pointing to a yewtree which grew on a small mount close to the castle i know it wellfrom thence you may see a prospect wide as from the peaks of schehallion  and freeing herself from her assistants she walked with a determined yet somewhat wild step up to the stem of the noble yew the abbot catherine and roland avenel followed her while lady fleming kept back the inferior persons of her train the black horseman also followed the queen waiting on her as closely as the shadow upon the light but ever remaining at the distance of two or three yardshe folded his arms on his bosom turned his back to the battle and seemed solely occupied by gazing on mary through the bars of his closed visor the queen regarded him not but fixed her eyes upon the spreading yew  ay fair and stately tree she said as if at the sight of it she had been rapt away from the present scene and had overcome the horror which had oppressed her at the first approach to crookstone there thou standest gay and goodly as ever though thou hearest the sounds of war instead of the vows of love all is gone since i last greeted theelove and lovervows and vowerking and kingdomhow goes the field my lord abbotwith us i trustyet what but evil can marys eyes witness from this spot  her attendants eagerly bent their eyes on the field of battle but could discover nothing more than that it was obstinately contested the small enclosures and cottage gardens in the village of which they had a full and commanding view and which shortly before lay with their lines of sycamore and ashtrees so still and quiet in the mild light of a may sun were now each converted into a line of fire canopied by smoke and the sustained and constant report of the musketry and cannon mingled with the shouts of meeting combatants showed that as yet neither party had given ground  many a soul finds its final departure to heaven or hell in these awful thunders said the abbot let those that believe in the holy church join me in orisons for victory in this dreadful combat  not herenot here said the unfortunate queen pray not here father or pray in silencemy mind is too much torn between the past and the present to dare to approach the heavenly throneor if we will pray be it for one whose fondest affections have been her greatest crimes and who has ceased to be a queen only because she was a deceived and a tenderhearted woman  were it not well said roland that i rode somewhat nearer the hosts and saw the fate of the day  do so in the name of god said the abbot for if our friends are scattered our flight must be hastybut beware thou approach not too nigh the conflict there is more than thine own life depends on thy safe return  oh go not too nigh said catherine but fail not to see how the seytons fight and how they bear themselves  fear nothing i will be on my guard said roland avenel and without waiting farther answer rode towards the scene of conflict keeping as he rode the higher and unenclosed ground and ever looking cautiously around him for fear of involving himself in some hostile party as he approached the shots rung sharp and more sharply on his ear the shouts came wilder and wilder and he felt that thick beating of the heart that mixture of natural apprehension intense curiosity and anxiety for the dubious event which even the bravest experience when they approach alone to a scene of interest and of danger  at length he drew so close that from a bank screened by bushes and underwood he could distinctly see where the struggle was most keenly maintained this was in a hollow way leading to the village up which the queens vanguard had marched with more hasty courage than welladvised conduct for the purpose of possessing themselves of that post of advantage they found their scheme anticipated and the hedges and enclosures already occupied by the enemy led by the celebrated kirkaldy of grange and the earl of morton and not small was the loss which they sustained while struggling forward to come to close with the menatarms on the other side but as the queens followers were chiefly noblemen and barons with their kinsmen and followers they had pressed onward contemning obstacles and danger and had when roland arrived on the ground met hand to hand at the gorge of the pass with the regents vanguard and endeavoured to bear them out of the village at the spearpoint while their foes equally determined to keep the advantage which they had attained struggled with the like obstinacy to drive back the assailants both parties were on foot and armed in proof so that when the long lances of the front ranks were fixed in each others shields corslets and breastplates the struggle resembled that of two bulls who fixing their frontlets hard against each other remain in that posture for hours until the superior strength or obstinacy of the one compels the other to take to flight or bears him down to the earth thus locked together in the deadly struggle which swayed slowly to and fro as one or other party gained the advantage those who fell were trampled on alike by friends and foes those whose weapons were broken retired from the front rank and had their place supplied by others while the rearward ranks unable otherwise to share in the combat fired their pistols and hurled their daggers and the points and truncheons of the broken weapons like javelins against the enemy  god and the queen resounded from the one party god and the king thundered from the other while in the name of their sovereign fellowsubjects on both sides shed each others blood and in the name of their creator defaced his image amid the tumult was often heard the voices of the captains shouting their commands of leaders and chiefs crying their gathering words of groans and shrieks from the falling and the dying  the strife had lasted nearly an hour the strength of both parties seemed exhausted but their rage was unabated and their obstinacy unsubdued when roland who turned eye and ear to all around him saw a column of infantry headed by a few horsemen wheel round the base of the bank where he had stationed himself and levelling their long lances attack the queens vanguard closely engaged as they were in conflict on their front the very first glance showed him that the leader who directed this movement was the knight of avenel his ancient master and the next convinced him that its effects would be decisive the result of the attack of fresh and unbroken forces upon the flank of those already wearied with a long and obstinate struggle was indeed instantaneous  the column of the assailants which had hitherto shown one dark dense and united line of helmets surmounted with plumage was at once broken and hurled in confusion down the hill which they had so long endeavoured to gain in vain were the leaders heard calling upon their followers to stand to the combat and seen personally resisting when all resistance was evidently vain they were slain or felled to the earth or hurried backwards by the mingled tide of flight and pursuit what were rolands feelings on beholding the rout and feeling that all that remained for him was to turn bridle and endeavour to ensure the safety of the queens person  yet keen as his grief and shame might be they were both forgotten when almost close beneath the bank which he occupied he saw henry seyton forced away from his own party in the tumult covered with dust and blood and defending himself desperately against several of the enemy who had gathered around him attracted by his gay armour roland paused not a moment but pushing his steed down the bank leaped him amongst the hostile party dealt three or four blows amongst them which struck down two and made the rest stand aloof then reaching seyton his hand he exhorted him to seize fast on his horses mane  we live or die together this day said he keep but fast hold till we are out of the press and then my horse is yours  seyton heard and exerted his remaining strength and by their joint efforts roland brought him out of danger and behind the spot from whence he had witnessed the disastrous conclusion of the fight but no sooner were they under shelter of the trees than seyton let go his hold and in spite of rolands efforts to support him fell at length on the turf trouble yourself no more with me he said this is my first and my last battleand i have already seen too much to wish to see the close hasten to save the queenand commend me to catherineshe will never more be mistaken for me nor i for herthe last swordstroke has made an eternal distinction  let me aid you to mount my horse said roland eagerly and you may yet be savedi can find my own way on footturn but my horses head westward and he will carry you fleet and easy as the wind  i will never mount steed more said the youth farewelli love thee better dying than ever i thought to have done while in lifei would that old mans blood were not on my handsancte benedicte ora pro mestand not to look on a dying man but haste to save the queen  these words were spoken with the last effort of his voice and scarce were they uttered ere the speaker was no more they recalled roland to a sense of the duty which he had wellnigh forgotten but they did not reach his ears only  the queenwhere is the queen said halbert glendinning who followed by two or three horsemen appeared at this instant roland made no answer but turning his horse and confiding in his speed gave him at once rein and spur and rode over height and hollow towards the castle of crookstone more heavily armed and mounted upon a horse of less speed sir halbert glendinning followed with couched lance calling out as he rode sir with the hollybranch halt and show your right to bear that badgefly not thus cowardly nor dishonour the cognizance thou deservest not to wearhalt sir coward or by heaven i will strike thee with my lance on the back and slay thee like a dastardi am the knight of aveneli am halbert glendinning  but roland who had no purpose of encountering his old master and who besides knew the queens safety depended on his making the best speed he could answered not a word to the defiances and reproaches which sir halbert continued to throw out against him but making the best use of his spurs rode yet harder than before and had gained about a hundred yards upon his pursuer when coming near to the yewtree where he had left the queen he saw them already getting to horse and cried out as loud as he could foes foesride for it fair ladiesbrave gentlemen do your devoir to protect them  so saying he wheeled his horse and avoiding the shock of sir halbert glendinning charged one of that knights followers who was nearly on a line with him so rudely with his lance that he overthrew horse and man he then drew his sword and attacked the second while the black manatarms throwing himself in the way of glendinning they rushed on each other so fiercely that both horses were overthrown and the riders lay rolling on the plain neither was able to arise for the black horseman was pierced through with glendinnings lance and the knight of avenel oppressed with the weight of his own horse and sorely bruised besides seemed in little better plight than he whom he had mortally wounded  yield thee sir knight of avenel rescue or no rescue said roland who had put a second antagonist out of condition to combat and hastened to prevent glendinning from renewing the conflict  i may not choose but yield said sir halbert since i can no longer fight but it shames me to speak such a word to a coward like thee  call me not coward said roland lifting his visor and helping his prisoner to rise since but for old kindness at thy hands and yet more at thy ladys i had met thee as a brave man should  the favourite page of my wife said sir halbert astonished ah wretched boy i have heard of thy treason at lochleven  reproach him not my brother said the abbot he was but an agent in the hands of heaven  to horse to horse said catherine seyton mount and begone or we are all lost i see our gallant army flying for many a leagueto horse my lord abbotto horse rolandmy gracious liege to horse ere this we should have ridden many a mile  look on these features said mary pointing to the dying knight who had been unhelmed by some compassionate hand look there and tell me if she who ruins all who love her ought to fly a foot farther to save her wretched life  the reader must have long anticipated the discovery which the queens feelings had made before her eyes confirmed it it was the features of the unhappy george douglas on which death was stamping his mark  looklook at him well said the queen thus has it been with all who loved mary stewartthe royalty of francis the wit of chastelar the power and gallantry of the gay gordon the melody of rizzio the portly form and youthful grace of darnley the bold address and courtly manners of bothwelland now the deepdevoted passion of the noble douglasnought could save themthey looked on the wretched mary and to have loved her was crime enough to deserve early death no sooner had the victim formed a kind thought of me than the poisoned cup the axe and block the dagger the mine were ready to punish them for casting away affection on such a wretch as i amimportune me noti will fly no fartheri can die but once and i will die here  while she spoke her tears fell fast on the face of the dying man who continued to fix his eyes on her with an eagerness of passion which death itself could hardly subduemourn not for me he said faintly but care for your own safetyi die in mine armour as a douglas should and i die pitied by mary stewart  he expired with these words and without withdrawing his eyes from her face and the queen whose heart was of that soft and gentle mould which in domestic life and with a more suitable partner than darnley might have made her happy remained weeping by the dead man until recalled to herself by the abbot who found it necessary to use a style of unusual remonstrance we also madam he said we your graces devoted followers have friends and relatives to weep for i leave a brother in imminent jeopardythe husband of the lady flemingthe father and brothers of the lady catherine are all in yonder bloody field slain it is to be feared or prisoners we forget the fate of our nearest and dearest to wait on our queen and she is too much occupied with her own sorrows to give one thought to ours  i deserve not your reproach father said the queen checking her tears but i am docile to itwhere must we gowhat must we do  we must fly and that instantly said the abbot whither is not so easily answered but we may dispute it upon the roadlift her to her saddle and set forward  footnote i am informed in the most polite manner by d macvean esq of glasgow that i have been incorrect in my locality in giving an account of the battle of langside crookstone castle he observes lies four miles west from the field of battle and rather in the rear of murrays army the real place from which mary saw the rout of her last army was cathcart castle which being a mile and a half east from langside was situated in the rear of the queens own army i was led astray in the present case by the authority of my deceased friend james grahame the excellent and amiable author of the sabbath in his drama on the subject of queen mary and by a traditionary report of mary having seen the battle from the castle of crookstone which seemed so much to increase the interest of the scene that i have been unwilling to make in this particular instance the fiction give way to the fact which last is undoubtedly in favour of mr macveans system  it is singular how tradition which is sometimes a sure guide to truth is in other cases prone to mislead us in the celebrated field of battle at killiecrankie the traveller is struck with one of those rugged pillars of rough stone which indicate the scenes of ancient conflict a friend of the author well acquainted with the circumstances of the battle was standing near this large stone and looking on the scene around when a highland shepherd hurried down from the hill to offer his services as cicerone and proceeded to inform him that dundee was slain at that stone which was raised to his memory fie donald answered my friend how can you tell such a story to a stranger i am sure you know well enough that dundee was killed at a considerable distance from this place near the house of fascally and that this stone was here long before the battle in 1688oich oich said donald no way abashed and your honours in the right and i see you ken a about it and he wasna killed on the spot neither but lived till the next morning but a the saxon gentlemen like best to hear he was killed at the great stane it is on the same principle of pleasing my readers that i retain crookstone castle instead of cathcart  if however the author has taken a liberty in removing the actual field of battle somewhat to the eastward he has been tolerably strict in adhering to the incidents of the engagement as will appear from it comparison of events in the novel with the following account from an old writer  the regent was out on foot and all his company except the laird of grange alexander hume of manderston and some borderers to the number of two hundred the laird of grange had already viewed the ground and with all imaginable diligence caused every horseman to take behind him a footman of the regents to guard behind them and rode with speed to the head of langsidehill and set down the footmen with their culverings at the head of a straight lane where there were some cottage houses and yards of great advantage which soldiers with their continual shot killed divers of the vaunt guard led by the hamiltons who courageously and fiercely ascending up the hill were already out of breath when the regents vaunt guard joined with them where the worthy lord hume fought on foot with his pike in his hand very manfully assisted by the laird of cessford his brotherinlaw who helped him up again when he was strucken to the ground by many strokes upon his face through the throwing pistols at him after they had been discharged he was also wounded with staves and had many strokes of spears through his legs for he and grange at the joining cried to let their adversaries first lay down their spears to bear up theirs which spears were so thick fixed in the others jacks that some of the pistols and great staves that were thrown by them which were behind might be seen lying upon the spears  upon the queens side the earl of argyle commanded the battle and the lord of arbroth the vaunt guard but the regent committed to the laird of grange the special care as being an experimented captain to oversee every danger and to ride to every wing to encourage and make help where greatest need was he perceived at the first joining the right wing of the regents vaunt guard put back and like to fly whereof the greatest part were commons of the barony of renfrew whereupon he rode to them and told them that their enemy was already turning their backs requesting them to stay and debate till he should bring them fresh men forth of the battle whither at full speed he did ride alone and told the regent that the enemy were shaken and flying away behind the little village and desired a few number of fresh men to go with him where he found enough willing as the lord lindesay the laird of lochleven sir james balfour and all the regents servants who followed him with diligence and reinforced that wing which was beginning to fly which fresh men with their loose weapons struck the enemies in their flank and faces which forced them incontinent to give place and turn back after long fighting and pushing others to and fro with their spears there were not many horsemen to pursue after them and the regent cried to save and not to kill and grange was never cruel so that there were few slain and taken and the only slaughter was at the first rencounter by the shot of the soldiers which grange had planted at the lane head behind some dikes  it is remarkable that while passing through the small town of renfrew some partisans adherents of the house of lennox attempting to arrest queen mary and her attendants were obliged to make way for her not without slaughter  they set off accordinglyroland lingered a moment to command the attendants of the knight of avenel to convey their master to the castle of crookstone and to say that he demanded from him no other condition of liberty than his word that he and his followers would keep secret the direction in which the queen fled as he turned his rein to depart the honest countenance of adam woodcock stared upon him with an expression of surprise which at another time would have excited his hearty mirth he had been one of the followers who had experienced the weight of rolands arm and they now knew each other roland having put up his visor and the good yeoman having thrown away his barretcap with the iron bars in front that he might the more readily assist his master into this barretcap as it lay on the ground roland forgot not to drop a few gold pieces fruits of the queens liberality and with a signal of kind recollection and enduring friendship he departed at full gallop to overtake the queen the dust raised by her train being already far down the hill  it is not fairymoney said honest adam weighing and handling the goldand it was master roland himself that is a certain thingthe same open hand and by our lady shrugging his shouldersthe same ready fistmy lady will hear of this gladly for she mourns for him as if he were her son and to see how gay he is but these light lads are as sure to be uppermost as the froth to be on the top of the quartpotyour man of solid parts remains ever a falconer so saying he went to aid his comrades who had now come up in greater numbers to carry his master into the castle of crookstone     chapter the thirtyeighth     my native land good night                             byron  many a bitter tear was shed during the hasty flight of queen mary over fallen hopes future prospects and slaughtered friends the deaths of the brave douglas and of the fiery but gallant young seyton seemed to affect the queen as much as the fall from the throne on which she had so nearly been again seated catherine seyton devoured in secret her own grief anxious to support the broken spirits of her mistress and the abbot bending his troubled thoughts upon futurity endeavoured in vain to form some plan which had a shadow of hope the spirit of young rolandfor he also mingled in the hasty debates held by the companions of the queens flightcontinued unchecked and unbroken  your majesty he said has lost a battleyour ancestor bruce lost seven successively ere he sat triumphant on the scottish throne and proclaimed with the voice of a victor in the field of bannockburn the independence of his country are not these heaths which we may traverse at will better than the locked guarded and lakemoated castle of lochlevenwe are freein that one word there is comfort for all our losses  he struck a bold note but the heart of mary made no response  better she said i had still been in lochleven than seen the slaughter made by rebels among the subjects who offered themselves to death for my sake speak not to me of farther effortsthey would only cost the lives of you the friends who recommend them i would not again undergo what i felt when i saw from yonder mount the swords of the fell horsemen of morton raging among the faithful seytons and hamiltons for their loyalty to their queeni would not again feel what i felt when douglass lifeblood stained my mantle for his love to mary stewartnot to be empress of all that britains seas enclose find for me some place where i can hide my unhappy head which brings destruction on all who love itit is the last favour that mary asks of her faithful followers  in this dejected mood but still pursuing her flight with unabated rapidity the unfortunate mary after having been joined by lord herries and a few followers at length halted for the first time at the abbey of dundrennan nearly sixty miles distant from the field of battle in this remote quarter of galloway the reformation not having yet been strictly enforced against the monks a few still lingered in their cells unmolested and the prior with tears and reverence received the fugitive queen at the gate of his convent  i bring you ruin my good father said the queen as she was lifted from her palfrey  it is welcome said the prior if it comes in the train of duty  placed on the ground and supported by her ladies the queen looked for an instant at her palfrey which jaded and drooping its head seemed as if it mourned the distresses of its mistress  good roland said the queen whispering let rosabelle be cared for ask thy heart and it will tell thee why i make this trifling request even in this awful hour  she was conducted to her apartment and in the hurried consultation of her attendants the fatal resolution of the retreat to england was finally adopted in the morning it received her approbation and a messenger was despatched to the english warden to pray him for safeconduct and hospitality on the part of the queen of scotland on the next day the abbot ambrose walked in the garden of the abbey with roland to whom he expressed his disapprobation of the course pursued it is madness and ruin he said better commit herself to the savage highlanders or wild bordermen than to the faith of elizabeth a woman to a rival womana presumptive successor to the keeping of a jealous and childless queenroland herries is true and loyal but his counsel has ruined his mistress  ay ruin follows us every where said an old man with a spade in his hand and dressed like a laybrother of whose presence in the vehemence of his exclamation the abbot had not been awaregaze not on me with such wonderi am he who was the abbot boniface at kennaquhair who was the gardener blinkhoolie at lochleven hunted round to the place in which i served my noviciate and now ye are come to rouse me up againa weary life i have had for one to whom peace was ever the dearest blessing  we will soon rid you of our company good father said the abbot and the queen will i fear trouble your retreat no more  nay you said as much before said the querulous old man and yet i was put forth from kinross and pillaged by troopers on the roadthey took from me the certificate that you wot ofthat of the baronay he was a mosstrooper like themselvesyou asked me of it and i could never find it but they found itit showed the marriage ofofmy memory fails menow see how men differ father nicholas would have told you an hundred tales of the abbot ingelram on whose soul god have mercyhe was i warrant you fourscore and six and i am not more thanlet me see  was not avenel the name you seek my good father said roland impatiently yet moderating his tone for fear of alarming or offending the infirm old man  ay rightavenel julian avenelyou are perfect in the namei kept all the special confessions judging it held with my vow to do soi could not find it when my successor ambrosius spoke ontbut the troopers found it and the knight who commanded the party struck his breast till the target clattered like an empty wateringcan  saint mary said the abbot in whom could such a paper excite such interest what was the appearance of the knight his arms his colours  ye distract me with your questionsi dared hardly look at himthey charged me with bearing letters for the queen and searched my mail this was all along of your doings at lochleven  i trust in god said the abbot to roland who stood beside him shivering and trembling with impatience the paper has fallen into the hands of my brotheri heard he had been with his followers on the scout betwixt stirling and glasgowbore not the knight a hollybough on his helmetcanst thou not remember  oh rememberremember said the old man pettishly count as many years as i do if your plots will let you and see what and how much you rememberwhy i scarce remember the pearmains which i graffed here with my own hands some fifty years since  at this moment a bugle sounded loudly from the beach  it is the deathblast to queen marys royalty said ambrosius the english wardens answer has been received favourable doubtless for when was the door of the trap closed against the prey which it was set fordroop not rolandthis matter shall be sifted to the bottombut we must not now leave the queenfollow melet us do our duty and trust the issue with godfarewell good fatheri will visit thee again soon  he was about to leave the garden followed by roland with halfreluctant steps the exabbot resumed his spade  i could be sorry for these men he said ay and for that poor queen but what avail earthly sorrows to a man of fourscoreand it is a rare dropping morning for the early colewort  he is stricken with age said ambrosius as he dragged roland down to the seabeach we must let him take his time to collect himselfnothing now can be thought on but the fate of the queen  they soon arrived where she stood surrounded by her little train and by her side the sheriff of cumberland a gentleman of the house of lowther richly dressed and accompanied by soldiers the aspect of the queen exhibited a singular mixture of alacrity and reluctance to depart her language and gestures spoke hope and consolation to her attendants and she seemed desirous to persuade even herself that the step she adopted was secure and that the assurance she had received of kind reception was altogether satisfactory but her quivering lip and unsettled eye betrayed at once her anguish at departing from scotland and her fears of confiding herself to the doubtful faith of england  welcome my lord abbot she said speaking to ambrosius and you roland avenel we have joyful news for youour loving sisters officer proffers us in her name a safe asylum from the rebels who have driven us from our homeonly it grieves me we must here part from you for a short space  part from us madam said the abbot is your welcome in england then to commence with the abridgment of your train and dismissal of your counsellors  take it not thus good father said mary the warden and the sheriff faithful servants of our royal sister deem it necessary to obey her instructions in the present case even to the letter and can only take upon them to admit me with my female attendants an express will instantly be despatched from london assigning me a place of residence and i will speedily send to all of you whenever my court shall be formed  your court formed in england and while elizabeth lives and reigns said the abbotthat will be when we shall see two suns in one heaven  do not think so replied the queen we are well assured of our sisters good faith elizabeth loves fameand not all that she has won by her power and her wisdom will equal that which she will acquire by extending her hospitality to a distressed sisternot all that she may hereafter do of good wise and great would blot out the reproach of abusing our confidencefarewell my pagenow my knightfarewell for a brief season i will dry the tears of catherine or i will weep with her till neither of us can weep longershe held out her hand to roland who flinging himself on his knees kissed it with much emotion he was about to render the same homage to catherine when the queen assuming an air of sprightliness said her lips thou foolish boy and catherine coy it notthese english gentlemen should see that even in our cold clime beauty knows how to reward bravery and fidelity  we are not now to learn the force of scottish beauty or the mettle of scottish valour said the sheriff of cumberland courteouslyi would it were in my power to bid these attendants upon her who is herself the mistress of scottish beauty as welcome to england as my poor cares would make them but our queens orders are positive in case of such an emergence and they must not be disputed by her subjectmay i remind your majesty that the tide ebbs fast  the sheriff took the queens hand and she had already placed her foot on the gangway by which she was to enter the skiff when the abbot starting from a trance of grief and astonishment at the words of the sheriff rushed into the water and seized upon her mantle  she foresaw itshe foresaw ithe exclaimedshe foresaw your flight into her realm and foreseeing it gave orders you should be thus received blinded deceived doomedprincess your fate is sealed when you quit this strandqueen of scotland thou shalt not leave thine heritage he continued holding a still firmer grasp upon her mantle true men shall turn rebels to thy will that they may save thee from captivity or death fear not the bills and bows whom that gay man has at his beckwe will withstand him by force oh for the arm of my warlike brotherroland avenel draw thy sword  the queen stood irresolute and frightened one foot upon the plank the other on the sand of her native shore which she was quitting for ever  what needs this violence sir priest said the sheriff of cumberland i came hither at your queens command to do her service and i will depart at her least order if she rejects such aid as i can offer no marvel is it if our queens wisdom foresaw that such chance as this might happen amidst the turmoils of your unsettled state and while willing to afford fair hospitality to her royal sister deemed it wise to prohibit the entrance of a broken army of her followers into the english frontier  you hear said queen mary gently unloosing her robe from the abbots grasp that we exercise full liberty of choice in leaving this shore and questionless the choice will remain free to us in going to france or returning to our own dominions as we shall determinebesides it is too lateyour blessing father and god speed thee  may he have mercy on thee princess and speed thee also said the abbot retreating but my soul tells me i look on thee for the last time the sails were hoisted the oars were plied the vessel went freshly on her way through the firth which divides the shores of cumberland from those of galloway but not till the vessel diminished to the size of a childs frigate did the doubtful and dejected and dismissed followers of the queen cease to linger on the sands and long long could they discern the kerchief of mary as she waved the oftrepeated signal of adieu to her faithful adherents and to the shores of scotland  if good tidings of a private nature could have consoled roland for parting with his mistress and for the distresses of his sovereign he received such comfort some days subsequent to the queens leaving dundrennan a breathless postno other than adam woodcockbrought despatches from sir halbert glendinning to the abbot whom he found with roland still residing at dundrennan and in vain torturing boniface with fresh interrogations the packet bore an earnest invitation to his brother to make avenel castle for a time his residence the clemency of the regent said the writer has extended pardon both to roland and to you upon condition of your remaining a time under my wardship and i have that to communicate respecting the parentage of roland which not only you will willingly listen to but which will be also found to afford me as the husband of his nearest relative some interest in the future course of his life  the abbot read this letter and paused as if considering what were best for him to do meanwhile woodcock took roland side and addressed him as followsnow look mr roland that you do not let any papestrie nonsense lure either the priest or you from the right quarry see you you ever bore yourself as a bit of a gentleman read that and thank god that threw old abbot boniface in our way as two of the seytons men were conveying him towards dundrennan herewe searched him for intelligence concerning that fair exploit of yours at lochleven that has cost many a man his life and me a set of sore bonesand we found what is better for your purpose than ours  the paper which he gave was indeed an attestation by father philip subscribing himself unworthy sacristan and brother of the house of saint marys stating that under a vow of secrecy he had united in the holy sacrament of marriage julian avenel and catherine graeme but that julian having repented of his union he father philip had been sinfully prevailed on by him to conceal and disguise the same according to a complot devised betwixt him and the said julian avenel whereby the poor damsel was induced to believe that the ceremony had been performed by one not in holy orders and having no authority to that effect which sinful concealment the undersigned conceived to be the cause why he was abandoned to the misguiding of a waterfiend whereby he had been under a spell which obliged him to answer every question even touching the most solemn matters with idle snatches of old songs besides being sorely afflicted with rheumatic pains ever after wherefore he had deposited this testificate and confession with the day and date of the said marriage with his lawful superior boniface abbot of saint marys sub sigillo confessionis  it appeared by a letter from julian folded carefully up with the certificate that the abbot boniface had in effect bestirred himself in the affair and obtained from the baron a promise to avow his marriage but the death of both julian and his injured bride together with the abbots resignation his ignorance of the fate of their unhappy offspring and above all the good fathers listless and inactive disposition had suffered the matter to become totally forgotten until it was recalled by some accidental conversation with the abbot ambrosius concerning the fortunes of the avenel family at the request of his successor the quondam abbot made search for it but as he would receive no assistance in looking among the few records of spiritual experiences and important confessions which he had conscientiously treasured it might have remained for ever hidden amongst them but for the more active researches of sir halbert glendinning  so that you are like to be heir of avenel at last master roland after my lord and lady have gone to their place said adam and as i have but one boon to ask i trust you will not nick me with nay  not if it be in my power to say yes my trusty friend  why then i must needs if i live to see that day keep on feeding the eyases with unwashed flesh said woodcock sturdily as if doubting the reception that his request might meet with  thou shalt feed them with what you list for me said roland laughing i am not many months older than when i left the castle but i trust i have gathered wit enough to cross no man of skill in his own vocation  then i would not change places with the kings falconer said adam woodcock nor with the queens neitherbut they say she will be mewed up and never need onei see it grieves you to think of it and i could grieve for company but what help for itfortune will fly her own flight let a man hollo himself hoarse  the abbot and roland journeyed to avenel where the former was tenderly received by his brother while the lady wept for joy to find that in her favourite orphan she had protected the sole surviving branch of her own family sir halbert glendinning and his household were not a little surprised at the change which a brief acquaintance with the world had produced in their former inmate and rejoiced to find in the pettish spoiled and presuming page a modest and unassuming young man too much acquainted with his own expectations and character to be hot or petulant in demanding the consideration which was readily and voluntarily yielded to him the old major domo wingate was the first to sing his praises to which mistress lilias bore a loud echo always hoping that god would teach him the true gospel  to the true gospel the heart of roland had secretly long inclined and the departure of the good abbot for france with the purpose of entering into some house of his order in that kingdom removed his chief objection to renouncing the catholic faith another might have existed in the duty which he owed to magdalen graeme both by birth and from gratitude but he learned ere he had been long a resident in avenel that his grandmother had died at cologne in the performance of a penance too severe for her age which she had taken upon herself in behalf of the queen and church of scotland as soon as she heard of the defeat at langside the zeal of the abbot ambrosius was more regulated but he retired into the scottish convent of  and so lived there that the fraternity were inclined to claim for him the honours of canonization but he guessed their purpose and prayed them on his deathbed to do no honours to the body of one as sinful as themselves but to send his body and his heart to be buried in avenel burialaisle in the monastery of saint marys that the last abbot of that celebrated house of devotion might sleep among its ruins  footnote this was not the explanation of the incident of searching for the heart mentioned in the introduction to the tale which the author originally intended it was designed to refer to the heart of robert bruce it is generally known that that great monarch being on his deathbed bequeathed to the good lord james of douglas the task of carrying his heart to the holy land to fulfil in a certain degree his own desire to perform a crusade upon douglass death fighting against the moors in spain a sort of military hors doeuvre to which he could have pleaded no regular call of duty his followers brought back the bruces heart and deposited it in the abbey church of melrose the kennaquhair of the tale  this abbey has been always particularly favoured by the bruce we have already seen his extreme anxiety that each of the reverend brethren should be daily supplied with a service of boiled almonds rice and milk pease or the like to be called the kings mess and that without the ordinary service of their table being either disturbed in quantity or quality but this was not the only mark of the benignity of good king robert towards the monks of melrose since by a charter of the dale 29th may 1326 he conferred on the abbot of melrose the sum of two thousand pounds sterling for rebuilding the church of st marys ruined by the english and there is little or no doubt that the principal part of the remains which now display such exquisite specimens of gothic architecture at its very purest period had their origin in this munificent donation the money was to be paid out of crown lands estates forfeited to the king and other property or demesnes of the crown  a very curious letter written to his son about three weeks before his death has been pointed out to me by my friend mr thomas thomson deputyregister for scotland it enlarges so much on the love of the royal writer to the community of melrose that it is well worthy of being inserted in a work connected in some degree with scottish history  litera domini regis roberti ad filium suum david  robertius dei gratia rex scottorum david precordialissimo filio suo ac ceteris successoribus suis salutem et sic ejus precepta tenere ut cum sua benedictione possint regnare fili carissime digne censeri videtur filius qui paternos in bonis mores imitans piam ejus

ergra locum predictum sic a nobis dilectum et electum concepte presentem literam religiosis predictis dimittimus nostris successoribus in posterum ostendendam data apud cardros undecimo die maij anno regni nostri vicesimo quarto  if this charter be altogether genuine and there is no appearance of forgery it gives rise to a curious doubt in scottish history the letter announces that the king had already destined his heart to be deposited at melrose the resolution to send it to palestine under the charge of douglas must have been adopted betwixt 11th may 1329 the date of the letter and 7th june of the same year when the bruce died or else we must suppose that the commission of douglas extended not only to taking the bruces heart to palestine but to bring it safe back to its final place of deposit in the abbey of melrose  it would not be worth inquiring by what caprice the author was induced to throw the incident of the bruces heart entirely out of the story save merely to say that he found himself unable to fill up the canvass he had sketched and indisposed to prosecute the management of the supernatural machinery with which his plan when it was first roughhewn was connected and combined  long before that period arrived roland avenel was wedded to catherine seyton who after two years residence with her unhappy mistress was dismissed upon her being subjected to closer restraint than had been at first exercised she returned to her fathers house and as roland was acknowledged for the successor and lawful heir of the ancient house of avenel greatly increased as the estate was by the providence of sir halbert gleninning there occurred no objections to the match on the part of her family her mother was recently dead when she first entered the convent and her father in the unsettled times which followed queen marys flight to england was not averse to an alliance with a youth who himself loyal to queen mary still held some influence through means of sir halbert glendinning with the party in power  roland and catherine therefore were united spite of their differing faiths and the white lady whose apparition had been infrequent when the house of avenel seemed verging to extinction was seen to sport by her haunted well with a zone of gold around her bosom as broad as the baldrick of an earl                       end of the abbot
