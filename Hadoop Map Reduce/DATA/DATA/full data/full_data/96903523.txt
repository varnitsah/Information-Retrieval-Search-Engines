at the club where you called me a wild ass of the desert and went home at halfpast ten after discoursing for twenty minutes on the responsibilities of housekeeping you now drive a mailphaeton and sit under a church of england clergyman i am not angry jack it is your kismet as it was gaddys and his kismet who can avoid do not think that i am moved by a spirit of revenge as i write thus publicly that you and you alone are responsible for this book in other and more expansive days when you could look at a magnum without flushing and at a cheroot without turning white you supplied me with most of the material take it back againwould that i could have preserved your fatherless speech in the tellingtake it back and by your slippered hearth read it to the late miss deercourt she will not be any the more willing to receive my cards but she will admire you immensely and you i feel sure will love me you may even invite me to another very bad dinnerat the club which as you and your wife know

brutality to ask a woman to share my life out here  blayne on my soul i believe youre right im thinking of mrs cockley the womans an absolute wreck  done exactly because she stays down here the only way to keep her fit would be to send her to the hills for eight monthsand the same with any woman i fancy i see myself taking a wife on those terms  mackesy with the rupee at one and sixpence the

very bad tummy and a blue funk so far he asked me at once if it was cholera and i told him not to be a fool that soothed him  curtis poor devil the funk does half the business in a man of that build  anthony lighting a cheroot i firmly believe the funk will kill him if he stays down you know the amount of trouble hes been giving fewton for the last three weeks hes doing his very best to frighten himself into the grave  general chorus poor little devil why doesnt he get away  anthony cant he has his leave all right but hes so dipped he cant take it and i dont think his name on paper would raise four annas thats in confidence though  mackesy all the station knows it  anthony i suppose i shall have to die here he said squirming all across the bed hes quite made up his mind to kingdom come and i know he has nothing more than a wetweather tummy if he could only keep a hand on himself  blayne thats bad thats very bad poor little miggy good little chap too i say  anthony what do you say  blayne well look hereanyhow if its like thatas you sayi say fifty  curtiss i say fifty  mackesy i go twenty better  done bloated croesus of the bar i say fifty jervoise what do you say hi wake up

anthony lets see three fifties and a seventytwo twentythree twentysay four hundred and twenty thatll give him a month clear at the hills many thanks you men ill send round the chaprassi tomorrow  curtiss you must engineer his taking the stuff and of course you mustnt  anthony of course it would never do hed weep with gratitude over his evening drink  blayne thats just what he would do damn him oh i say anthony you pretend to know everything have you heard about gandy  anthony no divorce court at last  blayne worse hes engaged  anthony how much he cant be  blayne he is hes going to be married in a few weeks markyn told me at the judges this evening its pukka  anthony you dont say so holy moses therell be a shine in the tents of kedar  curtiss regiment cut up rough think you  anthony dont know anything about the regiment  mackesy it is bigamy then  anthony maybe do you mean to say that you men have forgotten or is there more charity in the world than i thought  done you dont look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret you bloat explain  anthony mrs herriott  blayne after a long pause to the room generally its my notion that we are a set of fools  mackesy nonsense that business was knocked on the head last season why young mallard  anthony mallard was a candlestick paraded as such think awhile recollect last season and the talk then mallard or no mallard did gandy ever talk to any other woman  curtiss theres something in that it was slightly noticeable now you come to mention it but shes at naini tat and hes at simla  anthony he had to go to simla to look after a globetrotter relative of hisa person with a title uncle or aunt  blayne and there he got engaged no law prevents a man growing tired of a woman  anthony except that he mustnt do it till the woman is tired of him and the herriott woman was not that  curtiss she may be now two months of naini tal works wonders  done curious thing how some women carry a fate with them there was a mrs deegie in the central provinces whose men invariably fell away and got married it became a regular proverb with us when i was down there i remember three men desperately devoted to her and they all one after another took wives  curtiss thats odd now i should have thought that mrs deegies influence would have led them to take other mens wives it ought to have made them afraid of the judgment of providence  anthony mrs herriott will make gandy afraid of something more than the judgment of providence i fancy  blayne supposing things are as you say hell be a fool to face her hell sit tight at simla  anthony shouldnt be a bit surprised if he went off to naini to explain hes an unaccountable sort of man and shes likely to be a more than unaccountable woman  done what makes you take her character away so confidently  anthony primum tern pus caddy was her first and a woman doesnt allow her first man to drop away without expostulation she justifies the first transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is forever and ever consequently  blayne consequently we are sitting here till past one oclock talking scandal like a set of station cats anthony its all your fault we were perfectly respectable till you came in go to bed im off goodnight all  curtiss past one its past two by jove and heres the khit coming for the late charge just heavens one two three four five rupees to pay for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is no better than she should be im ashamed of myself go to bed you slanderous villains and if im sent to beora tomorrow be prepared to hear im dead before paying my card account     the tents of kedar  only why should it be with pain at all why must i twix the leaves of corona put any kiss of pardon on thy brow why should the other women know so much and talk togethersuch the look and such the smile he used to love with then as nowany wife to any husband  scenea naini tal dinner for thirtyfour plate wines crockery and khitmatgars carefully calculated to scale of rs 6000 per mensem less exchange table split lengthways by bank of flowers  mrs herriott after conversation has risen to proper pitch ah didnt see you in

while this tobacco will hang in your dress and saddlery doesnt interest you  mrs g everything you do interests me pip  capt g yes i know i know dear ill tell you all about it some day when ive put a head on this thing in the meantime  mrs g im to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child  capt g noo i dont mean that exactly but you see i shall be tramping up and down shifting these things to and fro and i shall be in your way dont you think so  mrs g cant i lift them about let me try reaches forward to troopers saddle  capt g good gracious child dont touch it youll hurt yourself picking up saddle little girls arent expected to handle numdahs now where would you like it put holds saddle above his head  mrs g a break in her voice nowhere pip how good you areand how strong oh whats that ugly red streak inside your arm  capt g lowering saddle quickly nothing its a mark of sorts aside and jacks coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried  mrs g i know its a mark but ive never seen it before it runs all up the arm what is it  capt g a cutif you want to know  mrs g want to know of course i do i cant have my husband cut to pieces in this way how did it come was it an accident tell me pip  capt g grimly no twasnt an accident i got itfrom a manin afghanistan  mrs g in action oh pip and you never told me  capt g id forgotten all about it  mrs g hold up your arm what a horrid ugly scar are you sure it doesnt hurt now how did the man give it you  capt g desperately looking at his watch with a knife i came downold van loo did thats to sayand fell on my leg so i couldnt run and then this man came up and began chopping at me as i sprawled  mrs g oh dont dont thats enoughwell what happened  capt g i couldnt get to my holster and mafflin came round the corner and stopped the performance  mrs g how hes such a lazy man i dont believe he did  capt g dont you i dont think the man had much doubt about it jack cut his head off  mrs g cuthisheadoff with one blow as they say in the books  capt g im not sure i was too interested in myself to know much about it anyhow the head was off and jack was punching old van loo in the ribs to make him get up now you know all about it dear and now  mrs g you want me to go of course you never told me about this though ive been married to you for ever so long and you never would have told me if i hadnt found out and you never do tell me anything about yourself or what you do or what you take an interest in  capt g darling im always with you arent i  mrs g always in my pocket you were going to say i know you are but you are always thinking away from me  capt g trying to hide a smile am i i wasnt aware of it im awfly sorry  mrs g piteously oh dont make fun of me pip you know what i mean when you are reading one of those things about cavalry by that idiotic princewhy doesnt he be a prince instead of a stableboy  capt g prince kraft a stableboyoh my aunt never mind dear you were going to say  mrs g it doesnt matter you dont care for what i say onlyonly you get up and walk about the room staring in front of you and then mafflin comes in to dinner and after im in the drawingroom i can hear you and him talking and talking and talking about things i cant understand andoh i get so tired and feel so lonelyi dont want to complain and be a trouble pip but i do indeed i do  capt g my poor darling i never thought of that why dont you ask some nice people in to dinner  mrs g nice people where am i to find them horrid frumps and if i did i shouldnt be amused you know i only want you  capt g and you have me surely sweetheart  mrs g i have not pip why dont you take me into your life  capt g more than i do that would be difficult dear  mrs g yes i suppose it wouldto you im no help to youno companion to you and you like to have it so  capt g arent you a little unreasonable pussy  mrs g stamping her foot im the most reasonable woman in the worldwhen im treated properly  capt g and since when have i been treating you improperly  mrs g alwaysand since the beginning you know you have  capt g i dont but im willing to be convinced  mrs g pointing to saddlery there  capt g how do you mean  mrs g what does all that mean why am i not to be told is it so precious  capt g i forget its exact government value just at present it means that it is a great deal too heavy  mrs g then why do you touch it  capt g to make it lighter see here little love ive one notion and jack has another but we are both agreed that all this equipment is about thirty pounds too heavy the thing is how to cut it down without weakening any part of it and at the same time allowing the trooper to carry everything he wants for his own comfortsocks and shirts and things of that kind  mrs g why doesnt he pack them in a little trunk  capt g kissing her oh you darling pack them in a little trunk indeed hussars dont carry trunks and its a most important thing to make the horse do all the carrying  mrs g but why need you bother about it youre not a trooper  capt g no but i command a few score of him and equipment is nearly everything in these days  mrs g more than me  capt g stupid of course not but its a matter that im tremendously interested in because if i or jack or i and jack work out some sort of lighter saddlery and all that its possible that we may get it adopted  mrs g how  capt g sanctioned at home where they will make a sealed patterna pattern that all the saddlers must copyand so it will be used by all the regiments  mrs g and that interests you  capt g its part of my profession yknow and my profession is a good deal to me everything in a soldiers equipment is important and if we can improve that equipment so much the better for the soldiers and for us  mrs g whos us  capt g jack and i only jacks notions are too radical whats that big sigh for minnie  mrs g oh nothingand youve kept all this a secret from me why  capt g not a secret exactly dear i didnt say anything about it to you because i didnt think it would amuse you  mrs g and am i only made to be amused  capt g no of course i merely mean that it couldnt interest you  mrs g its your work andand if youd let me id count all these things up if they are too heavy you know by how much they are too heavy and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of lightness and  capt g i have got both scales somewhere in my head but its hard to tell how light you can make a headstall for instance until youve actually had a model made  mrs g but if you read out the list i could copy it down and pin it up there just above your table wouldnt that do  capt g it would be awfly nice dear but it would be giving you trouble for nothing i cant work that way i go by rule of thumb i know the present scale of weights and the other onethe one that im trying to work towill shift and vary so much that i couldnt be certain even if i wrote it down  mrs g im so sorry i thought i might help is there anything else that i could be of use in  capt g looking round the room i cant think of anything youre always helping me you know  mrs g am i how  capt g you are of course and as long as youre near mei cant explain exactly but its in the air  mrs g and thats why you wanted to send me away  capt g thats only when im trying to do workgrubby work like this  mrs g mafflins better then isnt he  capt g rashly of course he is jack and i have been thinking along the same groove for two or three years about this equipment its our hobby and it may really be useful some day  mrs g after a pause and thats all that you have away from me  capt g it isnt very far away from you now take care the oil on that bit doesnt come off on your dress  mrs g i wishi wish so much that i could really help you i believe i couldif i left the room but thats not what i mean  capt g aside give me patience i wish she would go aloud i assure you you cant do anything for me minnie and i must really settle down to this wheres my pouch  mrs g crossing to writingtable here you are bear what a mess you keep your table in  capt g dont touch it theres a method in my madness though you mightnt think of it  mrs g at table i want to lookdo you keep accounts pip  capt g bending over saddlery of a sort are you rummaging among the troop papers be careful  mrs g why i shant disturb anything good gracious i had no idea that you had anything to do with so many sick horses  capt g wish i hadnt but they insist on falling sick minnie if i were you i really should not investigate those papers you may come across something that you wont like  mrs g why will you always treat me like a child i know im not displacing the horrid things  capt g resignedly very well then dont blame me if anything happens play with the table and let me go on with the saddlery slipping hand into trouserspocket oh the deuce  mrs g her back to g whats that for  capt g nothing aside theres not much in it but i wish id torn it up  mrs g turning over contents of table i know youll hate me for this but i do want to see what your work is like a pause pip what are farcybuds  capt g hab would you really like to know they arent pretty things  mrs g this journal of veterinary science says they are of absorbing interest tell me  capt g aside it may turn her attention  gives a long and designedly loathsome account of glanders and farcy  mrs g oh thats enough dont go on  capt g but you wanted to knowthen these things suppurate and matterate and spread  mrs g pin youre making me sick youre a horrid disgusting schoolboy  capt g on his knees among the bridles you asked to be told its not my fault if you worry me into talking about horrors  mrs g why didnt you sayno  capt g good heavens child have you come in here simply to bully me  mrs g i bully you how could i youre so strong hysterically strong enough to pick me up and put me outside the door and leave me there to cry arent you  capt g it seems to me that youre an irrational little baby are you quite well  mrs g do i look ill returning to table who is your lady friend with the big grey envelope and the fat monogram outside  capt g aside then it wasnt locked up confound it aloud god made her therefore let her pass for a woman you remember what farcybuds are like  mrs g showing envelope this has nothing to do with them im going to open it may i  capt g certainly if you want to id sooner you didnt though i dont ask to look at your letters to the deercourt girl  mrs g youd better not sir takes letter from envelope now may i look if you say no i shall cry  capt g youve never cried in my knowledge of you and i dont believe you could  mrs g i feel very like it today pip dont be hard on me reads letter it begins in the middle without any dear captain gadsby or anything how funny  capt g aside no its not dear captain gadsby or anything now how funny  mrs g what a strange letter reads and so the moth has come too near the candle at last and has been singed intoshall i say respectability i congratulate him and hope he will be as happy as he deserves to be what does that mean is she congratulating you about our marriage  capt g yes i suppose so  mrs g still reading letter she seems to be a particular friend of yours  capt g yes she was an excellent matron of sortsa mrs herriottwife of a colonel herriott i used to know some of her people at home long agobefore i came out  mrs g some colonels wives are youngas young as me i knew one who was younger  capt g then it couldnt have been mrs herriott she was old enough to have been your mother dear  mrs g i remember now mrs scargill was talking about her at the dutfins tennis before you came for me on tuesday captain mafflin said she was a dear old woman do you know i think mafilin is a very clumsy man with his feet  capt g aside good old jack aloud why dear  mrs g he had put his cup down on the ground then and he literally stepped into it some of the tea spirted over my dressthe grey one i meant to tell you about it before  capt g aside there are the makings of a strategist about jack though his methods are coarse aloud youd better get a new dress then aside let us pray that that will turn her  mrs g oh it isnt stained in the least i only thought that id tell you returning to letter what an extraordinary person reads but need i remind you that you have taken upon yourself a charge of wardshipwhat in the world is a charge of wardshipwhich as you yourself know may end in consequences  capt g aside its safest to let em see everything as they come across it but seems to me that there are exceptions to the rule aloud i told you that there was nothing to be gained from rearranging my table  mrs g absently what does the woman mean she goes on talking about consequencesalmost inevitable consequences with a capital c for half a page flushing scarlet oh good gracious how abominable  capt g promptly do you think so doesnt it show a sort of motherly interest in us aside thank heaven harry always wrapped her meaning up safely aloud is it absolutely necessary to go on with the letter darling  mrs g its impertinentits simply horrid what right has this woman to write in this way to you she oughtnt to  capt g when you write to the deercourt girl i notice that you generally fill three or four sheets cant you let an old woman babble on paper once in a way she means well  mrs g i dont care she shouldnt write and if she did you ought to have shown me her letter  capt g cant you understand why i kept it to myself or must i explain at lengthas i explained the farcybuds  mrs g furiously pip i hate you this is as bad as those idiotic saddlebags on the floor never mind whether it would please me or not you ought to have given it to me to read  capt g it comes to the same thing you took it yourself  mrs g yes but if i hadnt taken it you wouldnt have said a word i think this harriet herriottits like a name in a bookis an interfering old thing  capt g aside so long as you thoroughly understand that she is old i dont much care what you think aloud very good dear would you like to write and tell her so shes seven thousand miles away  mrs g i dont want to have anything to do with her but you ought to have told me turning to last page of letter and she patronizes me too ive never seen her reads i do not know how the world stands with you in all human probability i shall never know but whatever i may have said before i pray for her sake more than for yours that all may be well i have learned what misery means and i dare not wish that any one dear to you should share my knowledge  capt g good god cant you leave that letter alone or at least cant you refrain from reading it aloud ive been through it once put it back on he desk do you hear me  mrs g irresolutely i shshant looks at gs eyes oh pip

capt g thats the worst of it she wont for fear of leaving me  capt m what are the hills made for  capt g not for my wife at any rate  capt m you know too much gaddy andi dont like you any the better for it  capt g never mind that she wants england and the butcha would be all the better for it im going to chuck you dont understand  capt m hotly i understand this one hundred and thirtyseven new horse to be licked into shape somehow before luck comes round again a hairyheeled draft wholl give more trouble than the horses a camp next cold weather for a certainty ourselves the first on the roster the russian shindy ready to come to a head at five minutes notice and you the best of us all backing out of it all think a little gaddy you wont do it  capt g hang it a man has some duties toward his family i suppose  capt m i remember a man though who told me the night after amdheran when we were picketed under jagai and hed left his swordby the way did you ever pay ranken for that swordin an utmanzais headthat man told me that hed stick by me and the pinks as long as he lived i dont blame him for not sticking by meim not much of a manbut i do blame him for not sticking by the pink hussars  capt g uneasily we were little more than boys then cant you see jack how things stand tisnt as if we were serving for our bread weve all of us more or less got the filthy lucre im luckier than some perhaps theres no call for me to serve on  capt m none in the world for you or for us except the regimental if you dont choose to answer to that of course  capt g dont be too hard on a man you know that a lot of us only take up the thing for a few years and then go back to town and catch on with the rest  capt m not lots and they arent some of us  capt g and then there are ones affairs at home to be consideredmy place and the rents and all that i dont suppose my father can last much longer and that means the title and so on  capt m fraid you wont be entered in the stud book correctly unless you go home take six months then and come out in october if i could slay off a brother or two i spose i should be a marquis of sorts any fool can be that but it needs men gaddymen like youto lead flanking squadrons properly dont you delude yourself into the belief that youre going home to take your place and prance about among pinknosed kabuli dowagers you arent built that way i know better  capt g a man has a right to live his life as happily as he can you arent married  capt m nopraise be to providence and the one or two women who have had the good sense to jawab me  capt g then you dont know what it is to go into your own room and see your wifes head on the pillow and when everything else is safe and the house shut up for the night to wonder whether the roofbeams wont give and kill her  capt m aside revelations first and second aloud soo i knew a man who got squiffy at our mess once and confided to me that he never helped his wife on to her horse without praying that shed break her neck before she came back all husbands arent alike you see  capt g what on earth has that to do with my case the man must ha been mad or his wife as bad as they make em  capt m aside no fault of yours if either werent all you say youve forgotten the time when you were insane about the herriott woman you always were a good hand at forgetting aloud not more mad than men who go to the other extreme be reasonable gaddy your roofbeams are sound enough  capt g that was only a way of speaking ive been uneasy and worried about the wife ever since that awful business three years agowheni nearly lost her can you wonder  capt m oh a shell never falls twice in the same place youve paid your toll to misfortunewhy should your wife be picked out more than anybody elses  capt g i can talk just as reasonably as you can but you dont understandyou dont understand and then theres the butcha deuce knows where the ayah takes him to sit in the evening he has a bit of a cough havent you noticed it  capt m bosh the brigadiers jumping out of his skin with pure condition hes got a muzzle like a roseleaf and the chest of a twoyearold whats demoralized you  capt g funk thats the long and the short of it funk  capt m but what is there to funk  capt g everything its ghastly  capt m ah i see  you dont want to fight and by jingo when we do youve got the kid youve got the wife youve got the money too  thats about the case eh  capt g i suppose thats it but its not br myself its because of them at least i think it is  capt m are you sure looking at the matter in a coldblooded light the wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight she has an ancestral home to go to money and the brigadier to carry on the illustrious name  capt g then it is for myself or because they are part of me you dont see it my lifes so good so pleasant as it is that i want to make it quite safe cant you understand  capt m perfectly shelterpit for the offcers charger as they say in the line  capt g and i have everything to my hand to make it so im sick of the strain and the worry for their sakes out here and there isnt a single real difficulty to prevent my dropping it altogether itll only cost mejack i hope youll never know the shame that ive been going through for the past six months  capt m hold on there i dont wish to be told every man has his moods and tenses sometimes  capt g laughing bitterly has he what do you call craning over to see where your nearfore lands  capt m in my case it means that i have been on the considerable bend and have come to parade with a head and a hand it passes in three strides  capt g lowering voice it never passes with me jack im always thinking about it phil gadsby funking a fall on parade sweet picture isnt it draw it for me  capt m gravely heaven forbid a man like you cant be as bad as that a fall is no nice thing but one never gives it a thought  capt g doesnt one wait till youve got a wife and a youngster of your own and then youll know how the roar of the squadron behind you turns you cold all up the back  capt m aside and this man led at amdheran after bagal deasin went under and we were all mixed up together and he came out of the snow dripping like a butcher aloud skittles the men can always open out and you can always pick your way more or less we havent the dust to bother us as the men have and whoever heard of a horse stepping on a man  capt g neveras long as he can see but did they open out for poor errington  capt m oh this is childish  capt g i know it is worse than that i dont care youve ridden van loo is he the sort of brute to pick his wayspecially when were coming up in column of troop with any pace on  capt m once in a blue moon do we gallop in column of troop and then only to save time arent three lengths enough for you  capt g yesquite enough they just allow for the full development of the smash im talking like a cur i know but i tell you that for the past three months ive felt every hoof of the squadron in the small of my back every time that ive led  capt m but gaddy this is awful  capt g isnt it lovely isnt it royal a captain of the pink hussars watering up his charger before parade like the blasted boozing colonel of a black regiment  capt m you never did  capt g once only he squelched like a mussuck and the troopsergeantmajor cocked his eye at me you know old haffys eye i was afraid to do it again  capt m i should think so that was the best way to rupture old van loos tummy and make him crumple you up you knew that  capt g i didnt care it took the edge off him  capt m took the edge off him gaddy youyouyou mustnt you know think of the men  capt g thats another thing i am afraid of dyou spose they know  capt m lets hope not but theyre deadly quick to spot skirmlittle things of that kind see here old man send the wife home for the hot weather and come to kashmir with me well start a boat on the dal or cross the rhotangshoot ibex or loafwhich you please only come youre a bit off your oats and youre talking nonsense look at the colonelswagbellied rascal that he is he has a wife and no end of a bowwindow of his own can any one of us ride round himchalkstones and all i cant and i think i can shove a crock along a bit  capt g some men are different i havent any nerve lord help me i havent the nerve ive taken up a hole and a half to get my knees well under the wallets i cant help it im so afraid of anything happening to me on my soul i ought to be broke in front of the squadron for cowardice  capt m ugly word that i should never have the courage to own up  capt g i meant to lie about my reasons when i began butive got out of the habit of lying to you old man jack you wontbut i know you wont  capt m of course not half aloud the pinks are paying dearly for their pride  capt g eb whatat  capt m dont you know the men have called mrs gadsby the pride of the pink hussars ever since she came to us  capt g tisnt her fault dont think that its all mine  capt m what does she say  capt g i havent exactly put it before her shes the best little woman in the world jack and all thatbut she wouldnt counsel a man to stick to his calling if it came between him and her at least i think  capt m never mind dont tell her what you told me go on the peerage and landedgentry tack  capt g shed see through it shes five times cleverer than i am  capt m aside then shell accept the sacrifice and think a little bit worse of him for the rest of her days  capt g absently i say do you despise me  capt m queer way of putting it have you ever been asked that question think a minute what answer used you to give  capt g so bad as that im not entitled to expect anything more but its a bit hard when ones best friend turns round and  capt m so have found but you will have consolationsbailiffs and drains and liquid manure and the primrose league and perhaps if youre lucky the colonelcy of a yeomanry cavalry regimentall uniform and no riding i believe how old are you  capt g thirtythree i know its  capt m at forty youll be a fool of a j p landlord at fifty youll own a bathchair and the brigadier if he takes after you will be fluttering the dovecotes ofwhats the particular dunghill youre going to also mrs gadsby will be fat  capt g limply this is rather more than a joke  capt m dyou think so isnt cutting the service a joke it generally takes a man fifty years to arrive at it youre quite right though it is more than a joke youve managed it in thirtythree  capt g dont make me feel worse than i do will it satisfy you if i own that i am a shirker a skrimshanker and a coward  capt m it wil not because im the only man in the world who can talk to you like this without being knocked down you mustnt take all that ive said to heart in this way i only spokea lot of it at leastout of pure selfishness because becauseoh damn it all old mani dont know what i shall do without you of course youve got the money and the place and all thatand there are two very good reasons why you should take care of yourself  capt g doesnt make it any sweeter im backing outi know i am i always had a soft drop in me somewhereand i darent risk any danger to them  capt m why in the world should you youre bound to think of your familybound to think erhmm if i wasnt a younger son id go toobe shot if i wouldnt  capt g thank you jack its a kind lie but its the blackest youve told for some time i know what im doing and im going into it with my eyes open old man i cant help it what would you do if you were in my place  capt m aside couldnt conceive any woman getting permanently between me and the regiment aloud cant say very likely i should do no better im sorry for youawfly sorrybut if thems your sentiments i believe i really do that you are acting wisely  capt g do you i hope you do in a whisper jack be very sure of yourself before you marry im an ungrateful ruffian to say this but marriageeven as good a marriage as mine has beenhampers a mans work it cripples his swordarm and oh it plays hell with his notions of duty sometimesgood and sweet as she issometimes i could wish that i had kept my freedomno i dont mean that exactly  mrs g coming down
