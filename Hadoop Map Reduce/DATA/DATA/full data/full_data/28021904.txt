28021904	blacky the crow  by thornton w burgess    chapter i blacky the crow makes a discovery  blacky the crow is always watching for things not intended for his sharp eyes the result is that he gets into no end of trouble which he could avoid in this respect he is just like his cousin sammy jay between them they see a great deal with which they have no business and which it would be better for them not to see  now blacky the crow finds it no easy matter to pick up a living when snow covers the green meadows and the green forest and ice binds the big river and the smiling pool he has to use his sharp eyes for all they are worth in order to find enough to fill his stomach and he will eat anything in the way of food that he can swallow often he travels long distances looking for food but at night he always comes back to the same place in the green forest to sleep in company with others of his family  blacky dearly loves company particularly at night and about the time jolly round red mr sun is beginning to think about his bed behind the purple hills you will find blacky heading for a certain part of the green forest where he knows he will have neighbors of his own kind peter rabbit says that it is because blackys conscience troubles him so that he doesnt dare sleep alone but happy jack squirrel says that blacky hasnt any conscience you can believe just which you please though i suspect that neither of them really knows  as i have said blacky is quite a traveler at this time of year and sometimes his search for food takes him to outoftheway places one day toward the very last of winter the notion entered his black head that he would have a look in a certain lonesome corner of the green forest where once upon a time redtail the hawk had lived blacky knew well enough that redtail wasnt there now he had gone south in the fell and wouldnt be back until he was sure that mistress spring had arrived on the green meadows and in the green forest  like the black imp he is blacky flew over the treetops his sharp eyes watching for something interesting below presently he saw ahead of him the old nest of redtail he knew all about that nest he had visited it before when redtail was away still it might be worth another visit you never can tell what you may find in old houses now of course blacky knew perfectly well that redtail was miles and miles hundreds of miles away and so there was nothing to fear from him but blacky learned ever so long ago that there is nothing like making sure that there is no danger so instead of flying straight to that old nest he first flew over the tree so that he could look down into it  right away he saw something that made him gasp and blink his eyes it was quite large and white and it lookedit looked very much indeed like an egg do you wonder that blacky gasped and blinked here was snow on the ground and rough brother north wind and jack frost had given no hint that they were even thinking of going back to the far north the idea of any one laying an egg at this time of year blacky flew over to a tall pinetree to think it over  must be it was a little lump of snow thought he yet if ever i saw an egg that looked like one jumping grasshoppers how good an egg would taste right now you know blacky has a weakness for eggs the more he thought about it the hungrier he grew several times he almost made up his mind to fly straight over there and make sure but he didnt quite dare if it were an egg it must belong to somebody and perhaps it would be best to find out who suddenly blacky shook himself i must be dreaming said he there couldnt there just couldnt be an egg at this time of year or in that old tumbledown nest ill just fly away and forget it  so he flew away but he couldnt forget it he kept thinking of it all day and when he went to sleep that night he made up his mind to have another look at that old nest    chapter ii blacky makes sure     as true as ever ive cawed a caw     that was a newlaid egg i saw  what are you talking about demanded sammy jay coming up just in time to hear the last part of what blacky the crow was mumbling to himself  oh nothing cousin nothing at all replied blacky i was just talking foolishness to myself sammy looked at him sharply you arent feeling sick are you cousin blacky he asked must be something the matter with you when you begin talking about newlaid eggs when everythings covered with snow and ice foolishness is no name for it whoever heard of such a thing as a newlaid egg this time of year  nobody i guess replied blacky i told you i was just talking foolishness you see im so hungry that i just got to thinking what id have if i could have anything i wanted that made me think of eggs and i tried to think just how i would feel if i should suddenly see a great big egg right in front of me i guess i must have said something about it  i guess you must have it isnt egg time yet and it wont be for a long time take my advice and just forget about impossible things im going over to farmer browns corncrib corn may not be as good as eggs but it is very good and very filling better come along said sammy  not this morning thank you some other time perhaps replied blacky  he watched sammy disappear through the trees then he flew to the top of the tallest pinetree to make sure that no one was about when he was quite sure that no one was watching him he spread his wings and headed for the most lonesome corner of the green forest  im foolish i know im foolish he muttered but ive just got to have another look in that old nest of redtail the hawk i just cant get it out of my head that that was an egg a great big white egg that i saw there yesterday it wont do any harm to have another look anyway  straight toward the tree in which was the great tumbledown nest of redtail the hawk he flew and as he drew near he flew high for blacky is too shrewd and smart to take any chances not that he thought that there could be any danger there but you never can tell and it is always the part of wisdom to be on the safe side as he passed over the top of the tree he looked down eagerly just imagine how he felt when instead of one he saw two white things in the old nesttwo white things that looked for all the world like eggs the day before there had been but one now there were two that settled it in blackys mind they were eggs they couldnt be anything else  blacky kept right on flying somehow he didnt dare stop just then he was too much excited by what he had discovered to think clearly he had got to have time to get his wits together whoever had laid those eggs was big and strong he felt sure of that it must be some one a great deal bigger than himself and he was of no mind to get into trouble even for a dinner of fresh eggs he must first find out whose they were then he would know better what to do he felt sure that no one else knew about them and he knew that they couldnt run away so he kept right on flying until he reached a certain tall pinetree where he could sit and think without being disturbed  eggs he muttered real eggs now who under the sun can have moved into redtails old house and what can they mean by laying eggs before mistress spring has even sent word that she has started its too much for me it certainly is too much for me    chapter iii blacky finds out who owns the eggs  two big white eggs in a tumbledown nest and snow and ice everywhere did ever anybody hear of such a thing before  wouldnt believe it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes muttered blacky the crow have to believe them if i cant believe them its of no use to try to believe anything in this world as sure as i sit here that old nest has two eggs in it whoever laid them must be crazy to start housekeeping at this time of year i must find out whose eggs they are and then  blacky didnt finish but there was a hungry look in his eyes that would have told any who saw it had there been any to see it that he had a use for those eggs but there was none to see it and he took the greatest care that there should be none to see him when he once again started for a certain lonesome corner of the green forest  first ill make sure that the eggs are still there thought he and flew high above the tree tops so that as he passed over the tree in which was the old nest of redtail the hawk he might look down into it to have seen him you would never have guessed that he was looking for anything in particular he seemed to be just flying over on his way to some distant place if the eggs were still there he meant to come back and hide in the top of a nearby pinetree to watch until he was sure that he might safely steal those eggs or to find out whose they were  blackys heart beat fast with excitement as he drew near that old tumbledown nest would those two big white eggs be there perhaps there would be three the very thought made him flap his wings a little faster a few more wing strokes and he would be right over the tree how he did hope to see those eggs he could almost see into the nest now one stroke two strokes three strokes blacky bit his tongue to keep from giving a sharp caw of disappointment and surprise  there were no eggs to be seen no sir there wasnt a sign of eggs in that old nest there wasnt becausewhy do you think there wasnt because blacky looked straight down on a great mass of feathers which quite covered them from sight and he didnt have to look twice to know that that great mass of feathers was really a great bird the bird to whom those eggs belonged  blacky didnt turn to come back as he had planned he kept right on just as if he hadnt seen anything and as he flew he shivered a little he shivered at the thought of what might have happened to him if he had tried to steal those eggs the day before and had been caught doing it  im thankful i knew enough to leave them alone said he funny i never once guessed whose eggs they are i might have known that no one but hooty the horned owl would think of nesting at this time of year and that was mrs hooty i saw on the nest just now my but shes big shes bigger than hooty himself yes sir its a lucky thing i didnt try to get those eggs yesterday probably both hooty and mrs hooty were sitting close by only they were sitting so still that i thought they were parts of the tree they were in blacky blacky the sooner you forget those eggs the better  some things are best forgotten as soon as they are learned who never plays with fire will surely not get burned    chapter iv the cunning of blacky  now when blacky the crow discovered that the eggs in the old tumbledown nest of redtail the hawk in a lonesome corner of the green forest belonged to hooty the owl he straightway made the best of resolutions he would simply forget all about those eggs he would forget that he ever had seen them and he would stay away from that corner of the green forest that was a very wise resolution of all the people who live in the green forest none is fiercer or more savage than hooty the owl unless it is mrs hooty she is bigger than hooty and certainly quite as much to be feared by the little people  all this blacky knows no one knows it better and blacky is not one to poke his head into trouble with his eyes open so he very wisely resolved to forget all about those eggs now it is one thing to make a resolution and quite another thing to live up to it as you all know it was easy enough to say that he would forget but not at all easy to forget it would have been different if it had been spring or early summer when there were plenty of other eggs to be had by any one smart enough to find them and steal them but now when it was still winter such an unheardof time for any one to have eggs and it was hard work to find enough to keep a hungry crows stomach filled the thought of those eggs would keep popping into his head he just couldnt seem to forget them after a little he didnt try  now blacky the crow is very very cunning he is one of the smartest of all the little people who fly no one can get into more mischief and still keep out of trouble than can blacky the crow that is because he uses the wits in that black head of his in fact some people are unkind enough to say that he spends all his spare time in planning mischief the more he thought of those eggs the more he wanted them and it wasnt long before he began to try to plan some way to get them without risking his own precious skin  i cant do it alone thought he and yet if i take any one into my secret ill have to share those eggs that wont do at all because i want them myself i found them and i ought to have them he quite forgot or overlooked the fact that those eggs really belonged to hooty and mrs hooty and to no one else now let me see what can i do  he thought and he thought and he thought and he thought and little by little a plan worked out in his little black head then he chuckled he chuckled right out loud then hurriedly looked around to see if any one had heard him no one had so he chuckled again he cocked his head on one side and half closed his eyes as if that plan was something he could see and he was looking at it very hard then he cocked his head on the other side and did the same thing  its all right said he at last itll give my relatives a lot of fun and of course they will be very grateful to me for that it wont hurt hooty or mrs hooty a bit but it will make them very angry they have very short tempers and people with short tempers usually forget everything else when they are angry well pay them a visit while the sun is bright because then perhaps they cannot see well enough to catch us and well tease them until they lose their tempers and forget all about keeping guard over those eggs then ill slip in and get one and perhaps both of them without knowing that they are doing anything of the kind my friends and relatives will help me to get a good meal my how good those eggs will taste  it was a very clever and cunning plan for blacky is a very clever and cunning rascal but of course it didnt deserve success because nothing that means needless worry and trouble for others deserves to succeed    chapter v blacky calls his friends  when blacky cries caw caw caw caw as if hed dislocate his jaw his relatives all hasten where he waits them with a crafty air they know that there is mischief afoot and the crow family is always ready for mischief so on this particular morning when they heard blacky cawing at the top of his lungs from the tallest pinetree in the green forest they hastened over there as fast as they could fly calling to each other excitedly and sure that they were going to have a good time of some kind  blacky chuckled as he saw them coming come on come on caw caw caw hurry up and flap your wings faster i know where hooty the owl is and well have no end of fun with him he cried  caw caw caw caw caw caw shouted all his relatives in great glee where is he lead us to him well drive him out of the green forest  so blacky led the way over to the most lonesome corner of the green forest straight to the tree in which hooty the owl was comfortably sleeping blacky had taken pains to slip over early that morning and make sure just where he was he had discovered hooty fast asleep and he knew that he would remain right where he was until dark you know hootys eyes are not meant for much use in bright light and the brighter the light the more uncomfortable his eyes feel blacky knows this too and he had chosen the very brightest part of the morning to call his relatives over to torment poor hooty jolly round bright mr sun was shining his very brightest and the white snow on the ground made it seem brighter still even blacky had to blink and he knew that poor hooty would find it harder still  but one thing blacky was very careful not to even hint of and that was that mrs hooty was right close at hand mrs hooty is bigger and even more fierce than hooty and blacky didnt want to frighten any of the more timid of his relatives what he hoped down deep in his crafty heart was that when they got to teasing and tormenting hooty and making the great racket which he knew they would mrs hooty would lose her temper and fly over to join hooty in trying to drive away the black tormentors then blacky would slip over to the nest which she had left unguarded and steal one and perhaps both of the eggs he knew were there  when they reached the tree where hooty was he was blinking his great yellow eyes and had fluffed out all his feathers which is a way he has when he is angry to make himself look twice as big as he really is of course he had heard the noisy crew coming and he knew well enough what to expect as soon as they saw him they began to scream as loud as ever they could and to call him all manner of names the boldest of them would dart at him as if to pull out a mouthful of feathers but took the greatest care not to get too near you see the way hooty hissed and snapped his great bill was very threatening and they knew that if once he got hold of one of them with those big cruel claws of his that would be the end  so they were content to simply scold and scream at him and fly around him just out of reach and make him generally uncomfortable and they were so busy doing this that no one noticed that blacky was not joining in the fun and no one paid any attention to the old tumbledown nest of redtail the hawk only a few trees distant so far blackys plans were working out just as he had hoped    chapter vi hooty the owl doesnt stay still     now whats the good of being smart    when others do not do their part  if blacky the crow didnt say this to himself he thought it he knew that he had made a very cunning plan to get the eggs of hooty the owl a plan so shrewd and cunning that no one else in the green forest or on the green meadows would have thought of it there was only one weakness in it and that was that it depended for success on having hooty the owl do as he usually did when tormented by a crowd of noisy crowsstay where he was until they got tired and flew away  now blacky sometimes makes a mistake that smart people are very apt to make he thinks that because he is so smart other people are stupid that is where he proves that smart as he is he isnt as smart as he thinks he is he always thought of hooty the owl as stupid that is he always thought of him that way in daytime at night when he was waked out of a sound sleep by the fierce hunting cry of hooty he wasnt so sure about hooty being stupid and he always took care to sit perfectly still in the darkness lest hootys great ears should hear him and hootys great eyes made for seeing in the dark should find him no in the night blacky was not at all sure that hooty was stupid  but in the daytime he was sure you see he quite forgot the fact that the brightness of day is to hooty what the blackness of night is to him so because hooty would simply sit still and hiss and snap his bill instead of trying to catch his tormentors or flying away blacky called him stupid he felt sure that hooty would stay right where he was now and he hoped that mrs hooty would lose her temper and leave the nest where she was sitting on those two eggs and join hooty to help him try to drive away that noisy crew  but hooty isnt stupid not a bit of it the minute he found out that blacky and his friends had discovered him he thought of mrs hooty and the two precious eggs in the old nest of redtail the hawk close by  mrs hooty mustnt be disturbed thought he that will never do at all i must lead these black rascals away where they wont discover mrs hooty i certainly must  so he spread his broad wings and blundered away among the trees a little way he didnt fly far because the instant he started to fly that whole noisy crew with the exception of blacky were after him because he couldnt use his claws or bill while flying they grew bold enough to pull a few feathers out of his back so he flew only a little way to a thick hemlocktree where it wasnt easy for the crows to get at him and where the light didnt hurt his eyes so much there he rested a few minutes and then did the same thing over again he meant to lead those bothersome crows into the darkest part of the green forest and therewell he could see better there and it might be that one of them would be careless enough to come within reach no hooty wasnt stupid certainly not  blacky awoke to that fact as he sat in the top of a tall pinetree silently watching he could see mrs hooty on the nest and as the noise of hootys tormentors sounded from farther and farther away she settled herself more comfortably and closed her eyes blacky could imagine that she was smiling to herself it was clear that she had no intention of going to help hooty his splendid plan had failed just because stupid hooty who wasnt stupid at all had flown away when he ought to have sat still it was very provoking    chapter vii blacky tries another plan     when one plan fails just try another    declare youll win some way or other  people who succeed are those who do not give up because they fail the first time they try they are the ones who as soon as one plan fails get busy right away and think of another plan and try that if the thing they are trying to do is a good thing sooner or later they succeed if they are trying to do a wrong thing very likely all their plans fail as they should  now blacky the crow knows all about the value of trying and trying he isnt easily discouraged sometimes it is a pity that he isnt because he plans so much mischief but the fact remains that he isnt and he tries and tries until he cannot think of another plan and just has to give up when he invited all his relatives to join him in tormenting hooty the owl he thought he had a plan that just couldnt fail he felt sure that mrs hooty would leave her nest and help hooty try to drive away his tormentors but mrs hooty didnt do anything of the kind because hooty was smart enough and thoughtful enough to lead his tormentors away from the nest into the darkest part of the green forest where their noise wouldnt bother mrs hooty so she just settled herself more comfortably than ever on those eggs which blacky had hoped she would give him a chance to steal and his fine plan was quite upset  not one of his relatives had noticed that nest they had been too busy teasing hooty this was just as blacky had hoped he didnt want them to know about that nest because he was selfish and wanted to get those eggs just for himself alone but now he knew that the only way he could get mrs hooty off of them would be by teasing her so that she would lose her temper and try to catch some of her tormentors if she did that there would be a chance that he might slip in and get at least one of those eggs  he would try it  for a few minutes he listened to the noise of his relatives growing fainter and fainter as hooty led them farther and farther into the green forest then he opened his mouth  caw caw caw caw he screamed caw caw caw caw come back everybody here is mrs hooty on her nest caw caw caw caw  now as soon as they heard that all blackys relatives stopped chasing and tormenting hooty and started back as fast as they could fly they didnt like the dark part of the green forest into which hooty was leading them besides they wanted to see that nest so back they came cawing at the top of their lungs for they were very much excited some of them never had seen a nest of hootys and anyway it would be just as much fun to tease mrs hooty as it was to tease hooty  where is the nest they screamed as they came back to where blacky was cawing and pretending to be very much excited  why exclaimed one that is the old nest of redtail the hawk i know all about that nest and he looked at blacky as if he thought blacky was playing a joke on them  it was redtails but it is hootys now if you dont believe me just look in it retorted blacky  at once they all began to fly over the top of the tree where they could look down into the nest and there sure enough was mrs hooty her great round yellow eyes glaring up at them angrily such a racket right away hooty was forgotten and the whole crowd at once began to torment mrs hooty only blacky sat watchful and silent waiting for mrs hooty to lose her temper and try to catch one of her tormentors he had hope a great hope that he would get one of those eggs    chapter viii hooty comes to mrs hootys aid  no one can live just for self alone a lot of people think they can but they are very much mistaken they are making one of the greatest mistakes in the world every teeny weeny act no matter what it is affects somebody else that is one of old mother natures great laws and it is just as true among the little people of the green forest and the green meadows as with boys and girls and grown people it is old mother natures way of making each of us responsible for the good of all and of teaching us that always we should help each other  as you know when blacky the crow called all his relatives over to the nest where mrs hooty was sitting on her eggs they at once stopped tormenting hooty and left him alone in a thick hemlocktree in the darkest part of the green forest of course hooty was very very glad to be left in peace and he might have spent the rest of the day there sleeping in comfort but he didnt no sir he didnt at first he gave a great sigh of relief and settled himself as if he meant to stay he listened to the voices of those noisy crows growing fainter and fainter and was glad but it was only for a few minutes  presently those voices stopped growing fainter they grew more excitedsounding than ever and they came right from one place hooty knew then that his tormentors had found the nest where mrs hooty was and that they were tormenting her just as they had tormented him he snapped his bill angrily and then more angrily  i guess mrs hooty is quite able to take care of herself he grumbled but she ought not to be disturbed while she is sitting on those eggs i hate to go back there in that bright sunshine it hurts my eyes and i dont like it but i guess ill have to go back there mrs hooty needs my help id rather stay here but  he didnt finish instead he spread his broad wings and flew back towards the nest and mrs hooty his great wings made no noise for they are made so that he can fly without making a sound if i once get hold of one of those crows he muttered to himself if i once get hold of one of those crows ill he didnt say what he would do but if you had been near enough to hear the snap of his bill you could have guessed the rest  all this time the crows were having what they called fun with mrs hooty nothing is true fun which makes others uncomfortable but somehow a great many people seem to forget this so while blacky sat watching his relatives made a tremendous racket around mrs hooty and the more angry she grew the more they screamed and called her names and darted down almost in her face as they pretended that they were going to fight her they were so busy doing this and blacky was so busy watching them hoping that mrs hooty would leave her nest and give him a chance to steal the eggs he knew were under her that no one gave hooty a thought  all of a sudden he was there right in the tree close to the nest no one had heard a sound but there he was and in the claws of one foot he held the tail feathers of one of blackys relatives it was lucky very lucky indeed for that one that the sun was in hootys eyes and so he had missed his aim otherwise there would have been one less crow  now it is one thing to tease one lone owl and quite another to tease two together besides there were those black tail feathers floating down to the snowcovered ground quite suddenly those crows decided that they had had fun enough for one day and in spite of all blacky could do to stop them away they flew cawing loudly and talking it all over noisily blacky was the last to go and his heart was sorrowful however could he get those eggs    chapter ix blacky thinks of farmer browns boy  such luck grumbled blacky as he flew over to his favorite tree to do a little thinking such luck now all my neighbors know about the nest of hooty the owl and sooner or later one of them will find out that there are eggs in it there is one thing about it though and that is that if i cant get them nobody can that is to say none of my relatives can ive tried every way i can think of and those eggs are still there my my my how i would like one of them right now  then blacky the crow did a thing which disappointed scamps often dobegan to blame the ones he was trying to wrong because his plans had failed to have heard him talking to himself you would have supposed that those eggs really belonged to him and that hooty and mrs hooty had cheated him out of them yes sir that is what you would have thought if you could have heard him muttering to himself there in the treetop in his disappointment over not getting those eggs he was so sorry for himself that he actually did feel that he was the one wrongedthat hooty and mrs hooty should have let him have those eggs  of course that was absolute foolishness but he made himself believe it just the same at least he pretended to believe it and the more he pretended the angrier he grew this is often the way with people who try to wrong others they grow angry with the ones they have tried to wrong when at last blacky had to confess to himself that he could think of no other way to get those eggs he began to wonder if there was some way to make trouble for hooty and mrs hooty it was right then that he thought of farmer browns boy blackys eyes snapped he remembered how once upon a time farmer browns boy had delighted to rob nests blacky had seen him take the eggs from the nests of blackys own relatives and from many other feathered people what he did with the eggs blacky had no idea just now he didnt care if farmer browns boy would just happen to find hootys nest he would be sure to take those eggs and then he blacky would feel better he would feel that he was even with hooty  right away he began to try to think of some way to bring farmer browns boy over to the lonesome corner of the green forest where hootys nest was if he could once get him there he felt sure that farmer browns boy would see the nest and climb up to it and then of course he would take the eggs if he couldnt have those eggs himself the next best thing would be to see some one else get them  dear me dear me such dreadful thoughts i am afraid that blackys heart was as black as his coat and the worst of it was he seemed to get a lot of pleasure in his wicked plans now right down in his heart he knew that they were wicked plans but he tried to make excuses to himself  hooty the owl is a robber said he everybody is afraid of him he lives on other people and so far as i know he does no good in the world he is big and fierce and no one loves him the green forest would be better off without him if those eggs hatch there will be little owls to be fed and they will grow up into big fierce owls like their father and mother so if i show farmer browns boy that nest and he takes those eggs i will be doing a kindness to my neighbors  so blacky talked to himself and tried to hush the still small voice down inside that tried to tell him that what he was planning to do was really a dreadful thing and all the time he watched for farmer browns boy    chapter x farmer browns boy and hooty  farmer browns boy had taken it into his head to visit the green forest it was partly because he hadnt anything else to do and it was partly because now that it was very near the end of winter he wanted to see how things were there and if there were any signs of the coming of spring blacky the crow saw him coming and blacky chuckled to himself he had watched every day for a week for just this thing now he would tell farmer browns boy about that nest of hooty the owl  he flew over to the lonesome corner of the green forest where hooty and mrs hooty had made their home and at once began to caw at the top of his voice and pretend that he was terribly excited over something  caw caw caw caw caw shouted blacky at once all his relatives within hearing hurried over to join him they knew that he was tormenting hooty and they wanted to join in the fun it wasnt long before there was a great racket going on over in that lonesome corner of the green forest  of course farmer browns boy heard it he stopped and listened now i wonder what blacky and his friends have found this time said he whenever they make a fuss like that there is usually something to see there i believe ill so over and have a look  so he turned in the direction of the lonesome corner of the green forest and as he drew near he moved very carefully so as to see all that he could without frightening the crows he knew that as soon as they saw him they would fly away and that might alarm the one they were tormenting for he knew enough of crow ways to know that when they were making such a noise as they were now making they were plaguing some one  blacky was the first to see him because he was watching for him but he didnt say anything until farmer browns boy was so near that he couldnt help but see that nest and hooty himself sitting up very straight and snapping his bill angrily at his tormentors then blacky gave the alarm and at once all the crows rose in the air and headed for the green meadows cawing at the top of their lungs blacky went with them a little way the first chance he got he dropped out of the flock and silently flew back to a place where he could see all that might happen at the nest of hooty the owl  when farmer browns boy first caught sight of the nest and saw the crows darting down toward it and acting so excited he was puzzled  thats an old nest of redtail the hawk thought he i found that last spring now what can there be there to excite those crows so  then he caught sight of hooty the owl ha so thats it he exclaimed those scamps have discovered hooty and have been having no end of fun tormenting him i wonder what hes doing there  he no longer tried to keep out of sight but walked right up to the foot of the tree all the time looking up hooty saw him but instead of flying away he snapped his bill just as he had at the crows and hissed  thats funny thought farmer browns boy if i didnt know that to be the old nest of redtail the hawk and if it werent still the tailend of winter i would think that was hootys nest  he walked in a circle around the tree looking up suddenly he gave a little start was that a tail sticking over the edge of the nest he found a stick and threw it up it struck the bottom of the nest and out flew a great bird it was mrs hooty blacky the crow chuckled    chapter xi farmer browns boy is tempted     when youre tempted to do wrong    is the time to prove youre strong    shut your eyes and clench each fist    it will help you to resist  when a bird is found sitting on a nest it is a pretty sure sign that that nest holds something worth while it is a sign that that bird has set up housekeeping so when farmer browns boy discovered mrs hooty sitting so close on the old nest of redtail the hawk in the most lonesome corner of the green forest he knew what it meant perhaps i should say that he knew what it ought to mean  it ought to mean that there were eggs in that nest  but it was hard for farmer browns boy to believe that why spring had not come yet there was still snow and the smiling pool was still covered with ice who ever heard of birds nesting at this time of year certainly not farmer browns boy and yet hooty the owl and mrs hooty were acting for all the world as feathered folks do act when they have eggs and are afraid that something is going to happen to them it was very puzzling  that nest was built by redtail the hawk and it hasnt even been repaired muttered farmer browns boy as he stared up at it if hooty and his wife have taken it for their home they are mighty poor housekeepers and if mrs hooty has laid eggs this time of year she must be crazy i suppose the way to find out is to climb up there it seems foolish but im going to do it those owls certainly act as if they are mighty anxious about something and im going to find out what it is  he looked at hooty and mrs hooty at their hooked bills and great claws and decided that he would take a stout stick along with him he had no desire to feel these great claws when he had found a stick to suit him he began to climb the tree hooty and mrs hooty snapped their bills and hissed fiercely they drew nearer farmer browns boy kept a watchful eye on them they looked so big and fierce that he was almost tempted to give up and leave them in peace but he just had to find out if there was anything in that nest so he kept on as he drew near it mrs hooty swooped very near to him and the snap of her bill made an ugly sound he held his stick ready to strike and kept on  the nest was simply a great platform of sticks when farmer browns boy reached it he found that he could not get where he could look into it so he reached over and felt inside almost at once his fingers touched something that made him tingle all over it was an egg a great big egg there was no doubt about it it was just as hard for him to believe as it had been for blacky the crow to believe when he first saw those eggs farmer browns boys fingers closed over that egg and took it out of the nest mrs hooty swooped very close and farmer browns boy nearly dropped the egg as he struck at her with his stick then mrs hooty and hooty seemed to lose courage and withdrew to a tree near by where they snapped their bills and hissed  then farmer browns boy looked at the prize in his hand it was a big dirtywhite egg his eyes shone what a splendid prize to add to his collection of birds eggs it was the first egg of the great horned owl the largest of all owls that he ever had seen  once more he felt in the nest and found there was another egg there ill take both of them said he its the first nest of hootys that ive ever found and perhaps ill never find another gee im glad i came over here to find out what those crows were making such a fuss about i wonder if i can get these clown without breaking them  just at that very minute he remembered something he remembered that he had stopped collecting eggs he remembered that he had resolved never to take another birds egg  but this is different whispered the tempter this isnt like taking the eggs of the little song birds    chapter xii a treetop battle     as black is black and white is white    so wrong is wrong and right is right  there isnt any half way about it a thing is wrong or it is right and that is all there is to it but most people have hard work to see this when they want very much to do a thing that the still small voice way down inside tells them isnt right they try to compromise to compromise is to do neither one thing nor the other but a little of both but you cant do that with right and wrong it is a queer thing but a half right never is as good as a whole right while a half wrong often very often is as bad as a whole wrong  farmer browns boy up in the tree by the nest of hooty the owl in the lonesome corner of the green forest was fighting a battle no he wasnt fighting with hooty or mrs hooty he was fighting a battle right inside himself it was a battle between right and wrong once upon a time he had taken great delight in collecting the eggs of birds in trying to see how many kinds he could get then as he had come to know the little forest and meadow people better he had seen that taking the eggs of birds is very very wrong and he had stopped stealing them he bad declared that never again would he steal an egg from a bird  but never before had he found a nest of hooty the owl those two big eggs would add ever so much to his collection take em said a little voice inside hooty is a robber you will be doing a kindness to the other birds by taking them  dont do it said another little voice hooty may be a robber but he has a place in the green forest or old mother nature never would have put him here it is just as much stealing to take his eggs as to take the eggs of any other bird he has just as much right to them as jenny wren has to hers  take one and leave one said the first voice  that will be just as much stealing as if you took both said the second voice besides you will be breaking your own word you said that you never would take another egg  i didnt promise anybody but myself declared farmer browns boy right out loud at the sound of his voice hooty and mrs hooty sitting in the next tree snapped their bills and hissed louder than ever  a promise to yourself ought to be just as good as a promise to any one else i dont wonder hooty hisses at you said the good little voice  think how fine those eggs will look in your collection and how proud you will be to show them to the other fellows who never have found a nest of hootys said the first little voice  and think how mean and small and cheap youll feel every time you look at them added the good little voice youll get a lot more fun if you leave them to hatch out and then watch the little owls grow up and learn all about their ways just think what a stout brave fellow hooty is to start housekeeping at this time of year and how wonderful it is that mrs hooty can keep these eggs warm and when they have hatched take care of the baby owls before others have even begun to build their nests besides wrong is wrong and right is right always  slowly farmer browns boy reached over the edge of the nest and put back the egg then he began to climb down the tree when he reached the ground he went off a little way and watched almost at once mrs hooty flew to the nest and settled down on the eggs while hooty mounted guard close by  im glad i didnt take em said farmer browns boy yes sir im glad i didnt take em  as he turned back toward home he saw blacky the crow flying over the green forest and little did he guess how he had upset blackys plans    chapter xiii blacky has a change of heart  blacky the crow isnt all black no indeed his coat is black and sometimes it seems as if his heart is all black but this isnt so it certainly seemed as if his heart was all black when he tried so hard to make trouble for hooty the owl it would seem as if only a black heart could have urged him to try so hard to steal the eggs of hooty and mrs hooty but this wasnt really so you see it didnt seem at all wrong to try to get those eggs blacky was hungry and those eggs would have given him a good meal he knew that hooty wouldnt hesitate to catch him and eat him if he had the chance and so it seemed to him perfectly right and fair to steal hootys eggs if he was smart enough to do so and most of the other little people of the green forest and the green meadows would have felt the same way about it you see it is one of the laws of old mother nature that each one must learn to look out for himself  but when blacky showed that nest of hootys to farmer browns boy with the hope that farmer browns boy would steal those eggs there was blackness in his heart he was doing something then which was pure meanness he was just trying to make trouble for hooty to get even because hooty had been too smart for him he had sat in the top of a tall pinetree where he could see all that happened and he had chuckled wickedly as he had seen farmer browns boy climb to hootys nest and take out an egg he felt sure that he would take both eggs he hoped so anyway  when he saw farmer browns boy put the eggs back and climb down the tree without any he had to blink his eyes to make sure that he saw straight he just couldnt believe what he saw at first he was dreadfully disappointed and angry it looked very much as if he werent going to get even with hooty after all he flew over to his favorite tree to think things over now sometimes it is a good thing to sit by oneself and think things over it gives the little small voice deep down inside a chance to be heard it was just that way with blacky now  the longer he thought the meaner his action in calling farmer browns boy looked it was one thing to try to steal those eggs himself but it was quite another matter to try to have them stolen by some one against whom hooty had no protection whatever  if it had been any one but hooty you would have done your best to have kept farmer browns boy away said the little voice inside blacky hung his head he knew that it was true more than once in fact many times he had warned other feathered folks when farmer browns boy had been hunting for their nests and had helped to lead him away  at last blacky threw up his head and chuckled and this time his chuckle was good to hear im glad that farmer browns boy didnt take those eggs said he right out loud yes sir im glad ill never do such a thing as that again im ashamed of what i did yet im glad i did it im glad because ive learned some things ive learned that farmer browns boy isnt as much to be feared as he used to be ive learned that hooty isnt as stupid as i thought he was ive learned that while it may be all right for us people of the green forest to try to outwit each other we ought to protect each other against common dangers and ive learned something i didnt know before and that is that hooty the owl is the very first of us to set up housekeeping now i think ill go hunt for an honest meal and he did    chapter xiv blacky makes a call    judge no one by his style of dress   your ignorance you thus confess    blacky the crow  caw caw caw caw there was no need of looking to see who that was peter rabbit knew without looking mrs quack knew without looking just the same both looked up just alighting in the top of a tall tree was blacky the crow caw caw caw caw he repeated looking down at peter and mrs quack and mr quack and the six young quacks i hope i am not interrupting any secret gossip  not at all peter hastened to say mrs quack was just telling me of the troubles and clangers in bringing up a young family in the far north how did you know the quacks had arrived  blacky chuckled hoarsely i didnt said he i simply thought there might be something going on i didnt know about over here in the pond of paddy the beaver so i came over to find out mr quack you and mrs quack are looking very fine this fall and those handsome young quacks you dont mean to tell me that they are your children  mrs quack nodded proudly they are said she  you dont say so exclaimed blacky as if he were very much surprised when all the time he wasnt surprised at all they are a credit to their parents yes indeed they are a credit to their parents never have i seen finer young ducks in all my life how glad the hunters with terrible guns will be to see them  mrs quack shivered at that and blacky saw it he chuckled softly you know he dearly loves to make others uncomfortable i saw three hunters over on the edge of the big river early this very morning said he  mrs quack looked more anxious than ever blackys sharp eyes noted this  that is why i came over here he added kindly i wanted to give you warning  but you didnt know the quacks were here spoke up peter  true enough peter true enough replied blacky his eyes twinkling but i thought they might be i had heard a rumor that those who go south are traveling earlier than usual this fall so i knew i might find mr and mrs quack over here any time now is it true mrs quack that we are going to have a long hard cold winter  that is what they say up in the far north replied mrs quack and it is true that jack frost had started down earlier than usual that is how it happens we are here now but about those hunters over by the big river do you suppose they will come over here there was an anxious note in mrs quacks voice  no replied blacky promptly farmer browns boy wont let them i know ive been watching him and he has been watching those hunters as long as you stay here you will be safe what a great world this would be if all those twolegged creatures were like farmer browns boy  wouldnt it cried peter then he added i wish they were  you dont wish it half as much as i do declared mrs quack  yet i can remember when he used to hunt with a terrible gun and was as bad as the worst of them said blacky  what changed him asked mrs quack looking interested  just getting really acquainted with some of the little people of the green forest and the green meadows replied blacky he found them ready to meet him more than halfway in friendship and that some of them really are his best friends  and now he is their best friend spoke up peter  blacky nodded right peter said he that is why the quacks are safe here and will be as long as they stay    chapter xv blacky does a little looking about     do not take the word of others    that things are or are not so    when there is a chance that you may    find out for yourself and know     blacky the crow  blacky the crow is a shrewd fellow he is one of the smartest and shrewdest of all the little people in the green forest and on the green meadows everybody knows it and because of this all his neighbors have a great deal of respect for him despite his mischievous ways  of course blacky had noticed that johnny chuck had dug his house deeper than usual and had stuffed himself until he was fatter than ever before he had noticed that jerry muskrat was making the walls of his house thicker than in other years and that paddy the beaver was doing the same thing to his house you know there is very little that escapes the sharp eyes of blacky the crow  he had guessed what these things meant they think we are going to have a long hard cold winter muttered blacky to himself perhaps they know but i want to see some signs of it for myself they may be only guessing anybody can do that and one guess is as good as another  then he found mr and mrs quack the mallard ducks and their children in the pond of paddy the beaver and remembered that they never had come down from their home in the far north as early in the fall as this mrs quack explained that jack frost had already started south and so they had started earlier to keep well ahead of him  looks as if there may be something in this idea of a long hard cold winter thought blacky but perhaps the quacks are only guessing too i wouldnt take their word for it any more than i would the word of johnny chuck or jerry muskrat or paddy the beaver ill look about a little  so after warning the quacks to remain in the pond of paddy the beaver if they would be safe blacky bade them goodby and flew away he headed straight for the green meadows and farmer browns cornfield a little of that yellow corn would make a good breakfast  when he reached the cornfield blacky perched on top of a shock of corn for it already had been cut and put in shocks in readiness to be carted up to farmer browns barn for a few minutes he sat there silent and motionless but all the time his sharp eyes were making sure that no enemy was hiding behind one of those brown shocks when he was quite certain that things were as safe as they seemed he picked out a plump ear of corn and began to tear open the husks so as to get at the yellow grains  seems to me these husks are unusually thick muttered blacky as he tore at them with his stout bill dont remember ever having seen them as thick as these wonder if it just happens to be so on this ear  then as a sudden thought popped into his black head he left that ear and went to another the husks of this were as thick as those on the first he flew to another shock and found the husks there just the same he tried a third shock with the same result  huh they are all alike said he then he looked thoughtful and for a few minutes sat perfectly still like a black statue they are right said he at last yes sir they are right of course he meant johnny chuck and jerry muskrat and paddy the beaver and the quacks i dont know how they know it but they are right we are going to have a long hard cold winter i know it myself now ive found a sign old mother nature has wrapped this corn in extra thick husks and of course she has done it to protect it she doesnt do things without a reason we are going to have a cold winter or my name isnt blacky the crow    chapter xvi blacky finds other signs     a single fact may fail to prove you either right or wrong    confirm it with another and your proof will then be strong    blacky the crow  after his discovery that old mother nature had wrapped all the ears of corn in extra thick husks blacky had no doubt in his own mind that johnny chuck and jerry muskrat and paddy the beaver and the quacks were quite right in feeling that the coming winter would be long hard and cold but blacky long ago learned that it isnt wise or wholly safe to depend altogether on one thing  old mother nature never does things by halves thought blacky as he sat on the fence post on the green meadows thinking over his discovery of the thick husks on the corn she wouldnt take care to protect the corn that way and not do as much for other things there must be other signs if i am smart enough to find them  he lifted one black wing and began to set in order the feathers beneath it suddenly he made a funny little hop straight up  well i never he exclaimed as he spread his wings to regain his balance i never did  is that so piped a squeaky little voice if you say you never did i suppose you never did though i want the word of some one else before i will believe it what is it you never did  blacky looked down peeping up at him from the brown grass were two bright little eyes  hello danny meadow mouse exclaimed blacky i havent seen you for a long time ive looked for you several times lately  i dont doubt it i dont doubt it at all squeaked danny youll never see me when you are looking for me that is you wont if i can help it you wont if i see you first  blacky chuckled he knew what danny meant when blacky goes looking for danny meadow mouse it usually is in hope of having a meadow mouse dinner and he knew that danny knew this ive had my breakfast said blacky and it isnt dinner time yet  what is it you never did persisted danny in his squeaky voice  that was just an exclamation explained blacky i made a discovery that surprised me so i exclaimed right out  what was it demanded danny  it was that the feathers of my coat are coming in thicker than i ever knew them to before i hadnt noticed it until i started to set them in order a minute ago he buried his bill in the feathers of his breast yes sir said he in a muffled voice they are coming in thicker than i ever knew them to before there is a lot of down around the roots of them i am going to have the warmest coat ive ever had  well dont think you are the only one retorted danny my fur never was so thick at this time of year as it is now and it is the same way with nanny meadow mouse and all our children i suppose you know what it means  what does it mean asked blacky just as if he didnt have the least idea although he had guessed the instant he discovered those extra feathers  it means we are going to have a long hard cold winter and old mother nature is preparing us for it replied danny quite as if he knew all about it youll find that everybody who doesnt go south or sleep all winter has a thicker coat than usual hello there is old roughleg the hawk he has come extra early this year i think ill go back to warn nanny without another word danny disappeared in the brown grass again blacky chuckled more signs said he to himself more signs there isnt a doubt that we are going to have a hard winter i wonder if i can stand it or if id better go a little way south where it will be warmer    chapter xvii blacky watches a queer performance     this much to me is very clear    a thing not understood is queer    blacky the crow  blacky the crow may be right again he may not be if he is right it will account for a lot of the queer people in the world they are not understood and so they are queer at least that is what other people say and never once think that perhaps they are the queer ones for not understanding  but blacky isnt like those people who are satisfied not to understand and to think other people and things queer he does his best to understand he waits and watches and uses those sharp eyes of his and those quick wits of his until at last usually he does understand  the day of his discovery of old mother natures signs that the coming winter would be long hard and cold blacky paid a visit to the big river long ago he discovered that many things are to be seen on or beside the big river things not to be seen elsewhere so there are few clays in which he does not get over there  as he drew near the big river he was very watchful and careful was blacky for this was the season when hunters with terrible guns were abroad and he had discovered that they were likely to be hiding along the big river hoping to shoot mr or mrs quack or some of their relatives so he was very watchful as he drew near the big river for he had learned that it was dangerous to pass too near a hunter with a terrible gun more than once he had been shot at but he had learned by these experiences oh yes blacky had learned for one thing he had learned to know a gun when he saw it for another thing he had learned just how far away one of these dreadful guns could be and still hurt the one it was pointed at and to always keep just a little farther away also he had learned that a man or boy without a terrible gun is quite harmless and he had learned that hunters with terrible guns are tricky and sometimes hide from those they seek to kill so that in the dreadful hunting season it is best to look sharply before approaching any place  on this afternoon as he drew near the big river he saw a man who seemed to be very busy on the shore of the big river at a place where wild rice and rushes grew for some distance out in the water for just there it was shallow far out from the shore blacky looked sharply for a terrible gun but the man had none with him and therefore was not to be feared blacky boldly drew near until he was able to see what the man was doing  then blackys eyes stretched their widest and he almost cawed right out with surprise the man was taking yellow corn from a bag a handful at a time and throwing it out in the water yes sir that is what he was doing scattering nice yellow corn among the rushes and wild rice in the water  thats a queer performance muttered blacky as he watched what is he throwing perfectly good corn out in the water for he isnt planting it for this isnt the planting season besides it wouldnt grow in the water anyway it is a shame to waste nice corn like that what is he doing it for  blacky flew over to a tree some distance away and alighted in the top of it to watch the queer performance you know blacky has very keen eyes and he can see a long distance for a while the man continued to scatter corn and blacky continued to wonder what he was doing it for at last the man went away in a boat blacky watched him until he was out of sight then he spread his wings and slowly flew back and forth just above the rushes and wild rice at the place where the man had been scattering the corn he could see some of the yellow grains on the bottom presently he saw something else ha exclaimed blacky    chapter xviii blacky becomes very suspicious     of things you do not understand       beware    they may be wholly harmless but       beware    youll find the older that you grow    that only things and folks you know     are fully to be trusted so       beware      blacky the crow  that is one of blackys wise sayings and he lives up to it it is one reason why he has come to be regarded by all his neighbors as one of the smartest of all who live in the green forest and on the green meadow he seldom gets into any real trouble because he first makes sure there is no trouble to get into when he discovers something he does not understand he is at once distrustful of it  as he watched a man scattering yellow corn in the water from the shore of the big river he at once became suspicious he couldnt understand why a man should throw good corn among the rushes and wild rice in the water and because he couldnt understand he at once began to suspect that it was for no good purpose when the man left in a boat blacky slowly flew over the rushes where the man had thrown the corn and presently his sharp eyes made a discovery that caused him to exclaim right out  what was it blacky had discovered only a few feathers no one with eyes less sharp than blackys would have noticed them and few would have given them a thought if they had noticed them but blacky knew right away that those were feathers from a duck he knew that a duck or perhaps a flock of ducks had been resting or feeding in there among those rushes and that in moving about they had left those two or three downy feathers  ha exclaimed blacky mr and mrs quack or some of their relatives have been here it is just the kind of a place ducks like also some ducks like corn if they should come back here and find this corn they would have a feast and they would be sure to come again that man who scattered the corn here didnt have a terrible gun but that doesnt mean that he isnt a hunter he may come back again and then he may have a terrible gun im suspicious of that man i am so i believe he put that corn here for ducks and i dont believe he did it out of the kindness of his heart if it was farmer browns boy i would know that all is well that he was thinking of hungry ducks with few places where they can feed in safety as they make the long journey from the far north to the sunny south but it wasnt farmer browns boy i dont like the looks of it i dont indeed ill keep watch of this place and see what happens  all the way to his favorite perch in a certain big hemlocktree in the green forest blacky kept thinking about that corn and the man who had seemed to be generous with it and the more he thought the more suspicious he became he didnt like the looks of it at all  ill warn the quacks to keep away from there ill do it the very first thing in the morning he muttered as he prepared to go to sleep if they have any sense at all they will stay in the pond of paddy the beaver but if they should go over to the big river they would be almost sure to find that corn and if they should once find it they would keep going back for more it may be all right but i dont like the looks of it  and still full of suspicions blacky went to sleep    chapter xix blacky makes more discoveries     little things you fail to see    may important prove to be    blacky the crow  one of the secrets of blackys success in life is the fact that he never fails to take note of little things long ago he learned that little things which in themselves seem harmless and not worth noticing may together prove the most important things in life so no matter how unimportant a thing may appear blacky examines it closely with those sharp eyes of his and remembers it  the very first thing blacky did as soon as he was awake the morning after he discovered the man scattering corn in the rushes at a certain place on the edge of the big river was to fly over to the pond of paddy the beaver and again warn mr and mrs quack to keep away from the big river if they and their six children would remain safe then he got some breakfast he ate it in a hurry and flew straight over to the big river to the place where he had seen that yellow corn scattered  blacky wasnt wholly surprised to find dusky the black duck own cousin to mr and mrs quack the mallard ducks with a number of his relatives in among the rushes and wild rice at the very place where that corn had been scattered they seemed quite contented and in the best of spirits blacky guessed why not a single grain of that yellow corn could blacky see he knew the ways of dusky and his relatives he knew that they must have come in there just at dusk the night before and at once had found that corn he knew that they would remain hiding there until frightened out and that then they would spend the day in some little pond where they would not be likely to be disturbed or where at least no danger could approach them without being seen in plenty of time there they would rest all day and when the black shadows came creeping out from the purple hills they would return to that place on the big river to feed for that is the time when they like best to hunt for their food  dusky looked up as blacky flew over him but blacky said nothing and dusky said nothing but if blacky didnt use his tongue he did use his eyes he saw just on the edge of the shore what looked like a lot of small bushes growing close together on the very edge of the water mixed in with them were a lot of the brown rushes they looked very harmless and innocent but blacky knew every foot of that shore along the big river and he knew that those bushes hadnt been there during the summer he knew that they hadnt grown there  he flew directly over them just back of them were a couple of logs those logs hadnt been there when he passed that way a few days before he was sure of it  ha exclaimed blacky under his breath those look to me as if they might be very handy very handy indeed for a hunter to sit on sitting there behind those bushes he would be hidden from any duck who might come in to look for nice yellow corn scattered out there among the rushes it doesnt look right to me no sir it doesnt look right to me i think ill keep an eye on this place  so blacky came back to the big river several times that day the second time back he found that dusky the black duck and his relatives had left when he returned in the afternoon he saw the same man he had seen there the afternoon before and he was doing the same thingscattering yellow corn out in the rushes and as before he went away in a boat  i dont like it muttered blacky shaking his black head i dont like it    chapter xx blacky drops a hint     when you see anothers danger    warn him though he be a stranger    blacky the crow  every day for a week a man came in a boat to scatter corn in the rushes at a certain point along the bank of the big river and every day blacky the crow watched him and shook his black head and talked to himself and told himself that he didnt like it and that he was sure that it was for no good purpose sometimes blacky watched from a distance and sometimes he flew right over the man but never once did the man have a gun with him  every morning very early blacky flew over there and every morning he found dusky the black duck and his flock in the rushes and wild rice at that particular place and he knew that they had been there all night he knew that they had come in there just at dusk the night before to feast on the yellow corn the man had scattered there in the afternoon  it is no business of mine what those ducks do muttered blacky to himself but as surely as my tail feathers are black something is going to happen to some of them one of these days that man may be fooling them but he isnt fooling me not a bit of it he hasnt had a gun with him once when i have seen him but just the same he is a hunter i feel it in my bones he knows those silly ducks come in here every night for that corn he puts out he knows that after they have been here a few times and nothing has frightened them they will be so sure that it is a safe place that they will not be the least bit suspicious then he will hide behind those bushes he has placed close to the edge of the water and wait for them with his terrible gun that is what he will do or my name isnt blacky  finally blacky decided to drop a hint to dusky the black duck so the next morning he stopped for a call good morning said he as dusky swam in just in front of him i hope you are feeling as fine as you look  quack quack replied dusky when blacky the crow flatters he hopes to gain something what is it this time  not a thing replied blacky on my honor not a thing there is nothing for me here though there seems to be plenty for you and your relatives to judge by the fact that i find you in this same place every morning what is it  corn replied dusky in a low voice as if afraid some one might overhear him nice yellow corn  corn exclaimed blacky as if very much astonished how does corn happen to be way over here in the water  dusky shook his head dont ask me for i cant tell you said he i havent the least idea all i know is that every evening when we arrive we find it here how it gets here i dont know and furthermore i dont care it is enough for me that it is here  ive seen a man over here every afternoon said blacky i thought he might be a hunter  did he have a terrible gun asked dusky suspiciously  noo replied blacky  then he isnt a hunter declared dusky looking much relieved  but perhaps one of these days he will have one and will wait for you to come in for your dinner suggested blacky he could hide behind these bushes you know  nonsense retorted dusky tossing his head there hasnt been a sign of danger here since we have been here i know you blacky you are jealous because we find plenty to eat here and you find nothing you are trying to scare us but ill tell you right now you cant scare us away from such splendid eating as we have had here so there    chapter xxi at last blacky is sure     who for another conquers fear    is truly brave it is most clear    blacky the crow  it was late in the afternoon and blacky the crow was on his way to the green forest as usual he went around by the big river to see if that man was scattering corn for the ducks he wasnt there no one was to be seen along the bank of the big river  he hasnt come today or else he came early and has left thought blacky and then his sharp eyes caught sight of something that made him turn aside and make straight for a certain tree from the top of which he could see all that went on for a long distance what was it blacky saw it was a boat coming down the big river  blacky sat still and watched presently the boat turned in among the rushes and a moment later a man stepped out on the shore it was the same man blacky had watched scatter corn in the rushes every day for a week there wasnt the least doubt about it it was the same man  ha ha exclaimed blacky and nearly lost his balance in his excitement ha ha it is just as i thought you see blackys sharp eyes had seen that the man was carrying something and that something was a gun a terrible gun blacky knows a terrible gun as far as he can see it  the hunter for of course that is what he was tramped along the shore until he reached the bushes which blacky had noticed close to the water and which he knew had not grown there the hunter looked out over the big river then he walked along where he had scattered corn the day before not a grain was to be seen this seemed to please him then he went back to the bushes and sat down on a log behind them his terrible gun across his knees  i was sure of it muttered blacky he is going to wait there for those ducks to come in and then something dreadful will happen what terrible creatures these hunters are they dont know what fairness is no sir they dont know what fairness is he has put food there day after day where dusky the black duck and his flock would be sure to find it and has waited until they have become so sure there is no danger that they are no longer suspicious he knows they will feel so sure that all is safe that they will come in without looking for danger then he will fire that terrible gun and kill them without giving them any chance at all  reddy fox is a sly clever hunter but he wouldnt do a thing like that neither would old man coyote or anybody else who wears fur or feathers they might hide and try to catch some one by surprise that is all right because each of us is supposed to be on the watch for things of that sort oh dear whats to be done it is time i was getting home to the green forest the black shadows will soon come creeping out from the purple hills and i must be safe in my hemlocktree by then i would be scared to death to be out after dark yet those ducks ought to be warned oh dear what shall i do  blacky peered over at the green forest and then over toward the purple hills behind which jolly round red mr sun would go to bed very shortly he shivered as he thought of the black shadows that soon would come swiftly out from the purple hills across the big river and over the green meadows with them might come hooty the owl and hooty wouldnt object in the least to a crow dinner he wished he was in that hemlocktree that very minute then blacky looked at the hunter with his terrible gun and thought of what might happen what would be almost sure to happen unless those ducks were warned ill wait a little while longer muttered blacky and tried to feel brave but instead he shivered    chapter xxii blacky goes home happy     no greater happiness is won    than through a deed for others done    blacky the crow  blacky sat in the top of a tree near the bank of the big river and couldnt make up his mind what to do he wanted to get home to the big thick hemlocktree in the green forest before dusk for blacky is afraid of the dark that is he is afraid to be out after dark  go along home said a voice inside him there is hardly time now for you to get there before the black shadows arrive dont waste any more time here what may happen to those silly ducks is no business of yours and there is nothing you can do anyway go along home  wait a few minutes said another little voice down inside him dont be a coward you ought to warn dusky the black duck and his flock that a hunter with a terrible gun is waiting for them is it true that it is no business of yours what happens to those ducks think again blacky think again it is the duty of each one who sees a common danger to warn his neighbors if something dreadful should happen to dusky because you were afraid of the dark you never would be comfortable in your own mind stay a little while and keep watch  not five minutes later blacky saw something that made him oh so glad he had kept watch it was a swiftly moving black line just above the water far down the big river and it was coming up he knew what that black line was he looked over at the hunter hiding behind some bushes close to the edge of the water the hunter was crouching with his terrible gun in his hands and was peeping over the bushes watching that black line he too knew what it was it was a flock of ducks flying  blacky was all ashake again but this time it wasnt with fear of being caught away from home in the dark it was with excitement he knew that those ducks had become so eager for more of that corn that delicious yellow corn which every night for a week they had found scattered in the rushes just in front of the place where that hunter was now hiding that they couldnt wait for the coming of the black shadows they were so sure there was no danger that they were coming in to eat without waiting for the black shadows as they usually did and blacky was glad perhaps now he could give them warning  up the middle of the big river flying just above the water swept the flock with dusky at its head how swiftly they flew those nine big birds blacky envied them their swift wings on past the hidden hunter but far out over the big river they swept for just a minute blacky thought they were going on up the river and not coming in to eat after all then they turned toward the other shore swept around in a circle and headed straight in toward that hidden hunter blacky glanced at him and saw that he was ready to shoot  almost without thinking blacky spread his wings and started out from that tree caw caw caw caw caw he shrieked at the top of his lungs caw caw caw caw caw it was his danger cry that everybody on the green meadows and in the green forest knows  instantly dusky turned and began to climb up up up the other ducks following him until as they passed over the hidden hunter they were so high it was useless for him to shoot he did put up his gun and aim at them but he didnt shoot you see he didnt want to frighten them so that they would not return then the flock turned and started off in the direction from which they had come and in a few minutes they were merely a black line disappearing far down the big river  blacky headed straight for the green forest chuckling as he flew he knew that those ducks would not return until after dark he had saved them this time and he was so happy he didnt even notice the black shadows and the hunter stood up and shook his fist at blacky the crow    chapter xxiii blacky calls farmer browns boy  blacky awoke in the best of spirits late the afternoon before he had saved dusky the black duck and his flock from a hunter with a terrible gun he wasnt quite sure whether he was most happy in having saved those ducks by warning them just in time or in having spoiled the plans of that hunter he hates a hunter with a terrible gun does blacky for that matter so do all the little people of the green forest and the green meadows  so blacky started out for his breakfast in high spirits after breakfast he flew over to the big river to see if dusky the black duck was feeding in the rushes along the shore dusky wasnt and blacky guessed that he and his flock had been so frightened by that warning that they had kept away from there the night before  but theyll come back after a night or so muttered blacky as he alighted in the top of a tree the same tree from which he had watched the hunter the afternoon before theyll come back and so will that hunter if he sees me around again hell try to shoot me ive done all i can do anyway dusky ought to have sense enough to be suspicious of this place after that warning hello who is that i do believe it is farmer browns boy i wish he would come over here if he should find out about that hunter perhaps he would do something to drive him away ill see if i can call him over here  blacky began to call in the way he does when he has discovered something and wants others to know about it caw caw caaw caaw caw caw caaw screamed blacky as if greatly excited  now farmer browns boy having no work to do that morning had started for a tramp over the green meadows hoping to see some of his little friends in feathers and fur he heard the excited cawing of blacky and at once turned in that direction  that black rascal has found something over on the shore of the big river said farmer browns boy to himself ill go over there to see what it is there isnt much escapes the sharp eyes of that black busybody he has led me to a lot of interesting things one time and another there he is on the top of that tree over by the big river  as farmer browns boy drew near blacky flew down and disappeared below the bank fanner browns boy chuckled whatever it is it is right down there he muttered  he walked forward rapidly but quietly and presently he reached the edge of the bank up flew blacky cawing wildly and pretending to be scared half to death again farmer browns boy chuckled youre just making believe he declared youre trying to make me believe that i have surprised you when all the time you knew i was coming and have been waiting for me now what have you found over here  he looked eagerly along the shore and at once he saw a row of low bushes close to the edge of the water he knew what it was instantly a duck blind he exclaimed a hunter has built a blind over here from which to shoot ducks i wonder if he has killed any yet i hope not he went down to the blind for that is what a duck hunters hidingplace is called and looked about a couple of grains of corn just inside the blind caught his eyes and his face darkened that fellow has been baiting ducks thought he he has been putting out corn to get them to come here regularly my how i hate that sort of thing it is bad enough to hunt them fairly but to feed them and then kill themugh i wonder if he has shot any yet  he looked all about keenly and his face cleared he knew that if that hunter had killed any ducks there would be telltale feathers in the blind and there were none    chapter xxiv farmer browns boy does some thinking  farmer browns boy sat on the bank of the big river in a brown study that means that he was thinking very hard blacky the crow sat in the top of a tall tree a short distance away and watched him blacky was silent now and there was a knowing look in his shrewd little eyes in calling farmer browns boy over there he had done all he could and he was quite satisfied to leave the matter to farmer browns boy  a hunter has made that blind to shoot black ducks from thought farmer browns boy and he has been baiting them in here by scattering corn for them black ducks are about the smartest ducks that fly but if they have been coming in here every evening and finding corn and no sign of danger they probably think it perfectly safe here and come straight in without being at all suspicious tonight or some night soon that hunter will be waiting for them  i guess the law that permits hunting ducks is all right but there ought to be a law against baiting them in that isnt hunting no sir that isnt hunting if this land were my fathers i would know what to do i would put up a sign saying that this was private property and no shooting was allowed but it isnt my fathers land and that hunter has a perfect right to shoot here he has just as much right here as i have i wish i could stop him but i dont see how i can  a frown puckered the freckled face of farmer browns boy you see he was thinking very hard and when he does that he is very apt to frown  i suppose he muttered i can tear down his blind he wouldnt know who did it but that wouldnt do much good he would build another besides it wouldnt be right he has a perfect right to make a blind here and having made it it is his and i havent any right to touch it i wont do a thing i havent a right to do that wouldnt be honest ive got to think of some other way of saving those ducks  the frown on his freckled face grew deeper and for a long time he sat without moving suddenly his face cleared and he jumped to his feet he began to chuckle i have it he exclaimed ill do a little shooting myself then he chuckled again and started for home presently he began to whistle a way he has when he is in good spirits  blacky the crow watched him go and blacky was well satisfied he didnt know what farmer browns boy was planning to do but he had a feeling that he was planning to do something and that all would be well perhaps blacky wouldnt have felt so sure could he have understood what farmer browns boy had said about doing a little shooting himself  as it was blacky flew off about his own business quite satisfied that now all would be well and he need worry no more about those ducks none of the little people of the green forest and the green meadows knew farmer browns boy better than did blacky the crow none knew better than he that farmer browns boy was their best friend it is all right now chuckled blacky it is all right now and as the cheery whistle of farmer browns boy floated back to him on the merry little breezes he repeated it it is all right now    chapter xxv blacky gets a dreadful shock     when friends prove false whom may we trust    the springs of faith are turned to dust    blacky the crow  blacky the crow was in the top of his favorite tree over near the big river early this afternoon he didnt know what was going to happen but he felt in his bones that something was and he meant to be on hand to see for a long time he sat there seeing nothing unusual at last he spied a tiny figure far away across the green meadows even at that distance he knew who it was it was farmer browns boy and he was coming toward the big river  i thought as much chuckled blacky he is coming over here to drive that hunter away  the tiny figure grew larger it was farmer browns boy beyond a doubt suddenly blackys eyes opened so wide that they looked as if they were in danger of popping out of his head he had discovered that farmer browns boy was carrying something and that that something was a gun yes sir farmer browns boy was carrying a terrible gun if blacky could have rubbed his eyes he would have done so just to make sure that there was nothing the matter with them  a gun croaked blacky farmer browns boy with a terrible gun what does it mean  nearer came farmer browns boy and blacky could see that terrible gun plainly now suddenly an idea popped into his head perhaps he is going to shoot that hunter thought blacky and somehow he felt better  farmer browns boy reached the big river at a point some distance below the blind built by the hunter he laid his gun down on the bank and went down to the edge of the water the rushes grew very thick there and for a while farmer browns boy was very busy among them blacky from his high perch could watch him and as he watched he grew more and more puzzled it looked very much as if farmer browns boy was building a blind much like that of the hunters at last he carried an old log down there got his gun and sat down just as the hunter had done in his blind the afternoon before he was quite hidden there excepting from a place high up like blackys perch  iii do believe he is going to try to shoot those ducks himself gasped blacky i wouldnt have believed it if any one had told me no sir i wouldnt have believed it iicant believe it now farmer browns boy hunting with a terrible gun yet ive got to believe my own eyes  a noise up river caught his attention it was the noise of oars in a boat there was the hunter rowing down the big river just as he had done the day before he came ashore above his blind and walked down to it  this is no place for me muttered blacky hell remember that i scared those ducks yesterday and as likely as not hell try to shoot me  blacky spread his black wings and hurriedly left the treetop heading for another tree farther back on the green meadows where he would be safe but from which he could not see as well there he sat until the black shadows warned him that it was high time for him to be getting back to the green forest  he had to hurry for it was later than usual and he was afraid to be out after dark just as he reached the green forest he heard a faint bang bang from over by the big river and he knew that it came from the place where farmer browns boy was hiding in the rushes  it is true croaked blacky farmer browns boy has turned hunter it was such a dreadful shock to blacky that it was a long time before he could go to sleep    chapter xxvi why the hunter got no ducks  the hunter who had come down the big river in a boat and landed near the place where dusky the black duck and his flock had found nice yellow corn scattered in the rushes night after night saw blacky the crow leave the top of a certain tree as he approached  it is well for you that you didnt wait for me to get nearer said the hunter you are smart enough to know that you cant play the same trick on me twice you frightened those ducks away last night but if you try it again youll be shot as surely as your coat is black  then the hunter went to his blind which you know was the hidingplace he had made of bushes and rushes and behind this he sat down with his terrible gun to wait and watch for dusky the black duck and his flock  now you remember that farther along the shore of the big river was farmer browns boy hiding in a blind he had made that afternoon the hunter couldnt see him at all he didnt have the least idea that any one else was anywhere near with that crow out of the way i think i will get some ducks tonight thought the hunter and looked at his gun to make sure that it was ready  over in the west jolly round red mr sun started to go to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows came creeping out far down the big river the hunter saw a swiftly moving black line just above the water here they come he muttered as he eagerly watched that black line draw nearer  twice those big black birds circled around over the big river opposite where the hunter was crouching behind his blind it was plain that dusky their leader remembered blackys warning the night before but this time there was no warning everything appeared safe once more the flock circled and then headed straight for that place where they hoped to find more corn the hunter crouched lower they were almost near enough for him to shoot when bang bang went a gun a short distance away  instantly dusky and his flock turned and on swift wings swung off and up the river if ever there was a disappointed hunter it was the one crouching in that blind somebody else is hunting and he spoiled my shot that time he muttered he must have a blind farther down probably some other ducks i didnt see came in to him i wonder if he got them heres hoping that next time those ducks come in here first  he once more made himself comfortable and settled down for a long wait the black shadows crept out from the farther bank of the big river jolly round red mr sun had gone to bed and the first little star was twinkling high overhead it was very still and peaceful from out in the middle of the big river sounded a low quack dusky and his flock were swimming in this time presently the hunter could see a silver line on the water and then he made out nine black spots in a few minutes those ducks would be where he could shoot them bang bang went that gun below him again with a roar of wings dusky and his flock were in the air and away that hunter stood up and said things and they were not nice things he knew that those ducks would not come back again that night and that once more he must go home emptyhanded but first he would find out who that other hunter was and what luck he had had so he tramped down the shore to where that gun had seemed to be he found the blind of farmer browns boy but there was no one there you see as soon as he had fired his gun the last time farmer browns boy had slipped out and away and as he tramped across the green meadows toward home with his gun he chuckled he didnt get those ducks this time said farmer browns boy    chapter xxvii the hunter gives up  blacky the crow didnt know what to think he couldnt make himself believe that farmer browns boy had really turned hunter yet what else could he believe hadnt he with his own eyes seen farmer browns boy with a terrible gun hide in rushes along the big river and wait for dusky the black duck and his flock to come in and hadnt he with his own ears heard the bang bang of that very gun  the very first thing the next morning blacky had hastened over to the place where farmer browns boy had hidden in the rushes with sharp eyes he looked for feathers that would tell the tale of a duck killed but there were no feathers there wasnt a thing to show that anything so dreadful had happened perhaps farmer browns boy had missed when he shot at those ducks blacky shook his head and decided to say nothing to anybody about farmer browns boy and that terrible gun  you may be sure that early in the afternoon he was perched in the top of his favorite tree over by the big river his heart sank just as on the afternoon before when he saw farmer browns boy with his terrible gun trudging across the green meadows to the big river instead of going to the same hiding place he made a new one farther down  then came the hunter a little earlier than usual instead of stopping at his blind he walked straight to the blind farmer browns boy had first made of course there was no one there the hunter looked both glad and disappointed he went back to his own blind and sat down and while he watched for the coming of the ducks he also watched that other blind to see if the unknown hunter of the night before would appear of course he didnt and when at last the hunter saw the ducks coming he was sure that this time he would get some of them  but the same thing happened as on the night before just as those ducks were almost near enough a gun went bang bang and away went the ducks they didnt come back again and once more a disappointed hunter went home without any  the next afternoon he was on hand very early he was there before farmer browns boy arrived and when he did come of course the hunter saw him he walked down to where farmer browns boy was hiding in the rushes hello said he are you the one who was shooting here last night and the night before  farmer browns boy grinned yes said he  what luck did you have asked the hunter  fine replied farmer browns boy  how many ducks did you get asked the hunter  farmer browns boy grinned more broadly than before none said he i guess im not a very good shot  then what did you mean by saying you had fine luck demanded the hunter  oh replied farmer browns boy i had the luck to see those ducks and the fun of shooting and he grinned again  the hunter lost patience he tried to order farmer browns boy away but the latter said he had as much right there as the hunter had and the hunter knew that this was so finally he gave up and muttering angrily he went back to his blind again the gun of farmer browns boy frightened away the ducks just as they were coming in  the next afternoon there was no hunter nor the next though farmer browns boy was there the hunter had decided that it was a waste of time to hunt there while farmer browns boy was about    chapter xxviii blacky has a talk with dusky the black duck     doubt not a friend but to the last    grip hard on faith and hold it fast    blacky the crow  every morning blacky the crow visited the rushes along the shore of the big river hoping to find dusky the black duck he was anxious was blacky he feared that dusky or some of his flock had been killed and he wanted to know you see he knew that farmer browns boy had been shooting over there at last early one morning he found dusky and his flock in the rushes and wild rice eagerly he counted them there were nine not one was missing blacky sighed with relief and dropped down on the shore close to where dusky was taking a nap  hello said blacky  dusky awoke with a start hello yourself said he  ive heard a terrible gun banging over here and i was afraid you or some of your flock had been shot said blacky  we havent lost a feather declared dusky that gun wasnt fired at us anyway  then who was it fired at demanded blacky  i havent the least idea replied dusky  have you seen any other ducks about here inquired blacky  not one was duskys prompt reply if there had been any i guess we would have known it  did you know that when that terrible gun was fired there was another terrible gun right over behind those bushes asked blacky  dusky shook his head no said he but i learned long ago that where there is one terrible gun there is likely to be more and so when i heard that one bang i led my flock away from here in a hurry we didnt want to take any chances  it is a lucky thing you did replied blacky there was a hunter hiding behind those bushes all the time i warned you of him once  that reminds me that i havent thanked you said dusky i knew there was something wrong over here but i didnt know what so it was a hunter i guess it is a good thing that i heeded your warning  i guess it is retorted blacky dryly do you come here in daytime instead of night now  no replied dusky we come in after dark and spend the night here there is nothing to fear from hunters after dark weve given up coming here until late in the evening and since we did that we havent heard a gun  blacky gossiped a while longer then flew off to look for his breakfast and as he flew his heart was light his shrewd little eyes twinkled  i ought to have known farmer browns boy better than even to suspect him thought he i know now why he had that terrible gun it was to frighten those ducks away so that the hunter would not have a chance to shoot them he wasnt shooting at anything he just fired in the air to scare those ducks away i know it just as well as if i had seen him do it ill never doubt farmer browns boy again and im glad i didnt say a word to anybody about seeing him with a terrible gun  blacky was right farmer browns boy had taken that way of making sure that the hunter who had first baited those ducks with yellow corn scattered in the rushes in front of his hiding place should have no chance to kill any of them while appearing to be an enemy he really had been a friend of dusky the black duck and his flock    chapter xxix blacky discovers an egg  blacky is fond of eggs as you know in this he is a great deal like other people farmer browns boy for instance but as blacky cannot keep hens as farmer browns boy does he is obliged to steal eggs or else go without if you come right down to plain everyday truth i suppose blacky isnt so far wrong when he insists that he is no more of a thief than farmer browns boy blacky says that the eggs which the bens lay belong to the hens and that he blacky has just as much right to take them as farmer browns boy he quite overlooks the fact that farmer browns boy feeds the biddies and takes the eggs as pay anyway that is what farmer browns boy says but i do not know whether or not the biddies understand it that way  so blacky the crow cannot see why he should not help himself to an egg when he gets the chance he doesnt get the chance very often to steal eggs from the hens because usually they lay their eggs in the henhouse and blacky is too suspicious to venture inside the eggs he does get are mostly those of his neighbors in the green forest and the old orchard but once in a great while some foolish hen will make a nest outside the henhouse somewhere and if blacky happens to find it the black scamp watches every minute he can spare from other mischief for a chance to steal an egg  now blacky knows just what a rogue farmer browns boy thinks he is and for this reason blacky is very careful about approaching farmer brown or any other man until he has made sure that he runs no risk of being shot blacky knows quite as well as any one what a gun looks like he also knows that without a terrible gun there is little farmer brown or any one else can do to him so when he sees farmer brown out in his fields blacky often will fly right over him and shout caw caw caw caaw in the most provoking way and fanner browns boy insists that he has seen blacky wink when he was doing it  but blacky doesnt do anything of this kind around the buildings of farmer brown you see he has learned that there are doors and windows in buildings and out of one of these a terrible gun may bang at any time though he has suspected that farmer browns boy would not now try to harm him blacky is naturally cautious and takes no chances so when he comes spying around farmer browns house and barn he does it when he is quite sure that no one is about and he makes no noise about it first he sits in a tall tree from which he can watch farmer browns home when he is quite sure that the way is clear he flies over to the old orchard and from there he inspects the barnyard never once making a sound if he is quite sure that no one is about he sometimes drops down into the henyard and helps himself to corn if any happens to be there it was on one of these silent visits that blacky spied something which he couldnt forget it was a box just inside the henhouse door in the box was some hay and in that hay he was sure that he had seen an egg in fact he was sure that he saw two eggs there he might not have noticed them but for the fact that a hen had jumped down from that box making a terrible fuss she didnt seem frightened but very proud what under the sun she had to be proud about blacky couldnt understand but he didnt stay to find out the noise she was making made him nervous he was afraid that it would bring some one to find out what was going on so he spread his black wings and flew away as silently as he had come  as he was flying away he saw those eggs you see as he rose into the air he managed to pass that open door in such a way that he could glance in that one glance was enough you know blackys eyes are very sharp he saw the hay in the box and the two eggs in the hay and that was enough for him from that instant blacky the crow began to scheme and plan to get one or both of those eggs it seemed to him that he never never had wanted anything quite so much and he was sure that he would not and could not be happy until he succeeded in getting one    chapter xxx blacky screws up his courage  if out of sight then out of mind this is a saying which you often hear it may be true sometimes but it is very far from true at other times take the case of blacky he had had only a glance into that nest just inside the door of farmer browns henhouse but that glance had been enough to show him two eggs there then as he flew away toward the green forest those eggs were out of sight of course but do you think they were out of mind not much no indeed in fact those eggs were very much in blackys mind he couldnt think of anything else he flew straight to a certain tall pinetree in a lonely part of the green forest whenever blacky wants to think or to plan mischief he seeks that particular tree and in the shelter of its broad branches he keeps out of sight of curious eyes and there he sits as still as still can be  i want one of those eggs muttered blacky as he settled himself in comfort on a certain particular spot on a certain particular branch of that tall pinetree indeed that particular branch might well be called the mischief branch for on it blacky has thought out and planned most of the mischief he is so famous for yes sir he continued i want one of those eggs and what is more i am going to have one  he half closed his eyes and tipped his head back and swallowed a couple of times as if he already tasted one of those eggs  there is more in one of those eggs than in a whole nestful of welcome robins eggs it is a very long time since i have been lucky enough to taste a hens egg and now is my chance i dont like having to go inside that henhouse even though it is barely inside the door im suspicious of doors they have a way of closing most unexpectedly i might see if i cannot get unc billy possum to bring one of those eggs out for me but that plan wont do come to think of it because i cant trust unc billy the old sinner is too fond of eggs himself i would be willing to divide with him but he would be sure to eat his first and i fear that it would taste so good that he would eat the other no ive got to get one of those eggs myself it is the only way i can be sure of it  the thing to do is to make sure that farmer browns boy and farmer brown himself are nowhere about they ought to be down in the cornfield pretty soon with them down there i have only to watch my chance and slip in it wont take but a second just a little courage blacky just a little courage nothing in this world worth having is gained without some risk the thing to do is to make sure that the risk is as small as possible  blacky shook out his feathers and then flew out of the tall pinetree as silently as he had flown into it he headed straight toward farmer browns cornfield when he was near enough to see all over the field he dropped down to the top of a fence post and there he waited he didnt have long to wait in fact he had been there but a few minutes when he spied two people coming down the long lane toward the cornfield he looked at them sharply and then gave a little sigh of satisfaction they were farmer brown and farmer browns boy presently they reached the cornfield and turned into it then they went to work and blacky knew that so far as they were concerned the way was clear for him to visit the henyard  he didnt fly straight there oh my no blacky is too clever to do anything like that he flew toward the green forest when he knew that he was out of sight of those in the cornfield he turned and flew over to the old orchard and from the top of one of the old appletrees he studied the henyard and the barnyard and farmer browns house and the barn to make absolutely sure that there was no danger near when he was quite sure he silently flew down into the henyard as he had done many times before he pretended to be looking for scattered grains of corn but all the time he was edging nearer and nearer to the open door of the henhouse at last he could see the box with the hay in it he walked right up to the open door and peered inside there was nothing to be afraid of that he could see still he hesitated he did hate to go inside that door even for a minute and that is all it would take to fly up to that nest and get one of those eggs  blacky closed his eyes for just a second and when he did that he seemed to see himself eating one of those eggs what are you afraid of he muttered to himself as he opened his eyes then with a hurried look in all directions he flew up to the edge of the box there lay the two eggs    chapter xxxi an egg that wouldnt behave     if you had an egg and it wouldnt behave     just what would you do with that egg may i ask    to make an egg do what it dont want to do     strikes me like a difficult sort of a task  all of which is pure nonsense of course who ever heard of an egg either behaving or misbehaving nobody that is nobody that i know unless it be blacky it is best not to mention eggs in blackys presence these days they are a forbidden topic when he is about blacky is apt to be a little resentful at the mere mention of an egg i dont know as i wholly blame him how would you feel if you knew you knew all there was to know about a thing and then found out that you didnt know anything at all well that is the way it is with blacky the crow  if any one had told blacky that he didnt know all there is to know about eggs he would have laughed at the idea wasnt he blacky hatched from an egg himself and hadnt he ever since he was big enough hunted eggs and stolen eggs and eaten eggs if he didnt know about eggs who did that is the way he would have talked before his visit to farmer browns henhouse it is since then that it has been unwise to mention eggs  when blacky saw the two eggs in the nest in farmer browns henhouse how blacky did wish that he could take both but he couldnt one would be all that he could manage he must take his choice and go away while the going was good which should he take  it often happens in this life that things which seem to be unimportant mere trifles in themselves prove to be just the opposite now so far as blacky could see it didnt make the least difference which egg he took excepting that one was a little bigger than the other as a matter of fact it made all the difference in the world one was brown and very good to look at the other the larger of the two was white and also very good to look at in fact blacky thought it the better of the two to look at for it was very smooth and shiny so partly on this account and partly because it was the largest blacky chose the white egg he seized it in his claws and started to fly with it but somehow he could not seem to get a good grip on it he fluttered to the ground just outside the door and there he got a better grip just as old dandycock the rooster with head down and all the feathers on his neck standing out with anger came charging at him blacky rose into the air and started over the old orchard toward the green forest  never had blacky felt more like cawing at the top of his lungs you see he felt that he had been very smart and i suspect that he also felt that he had been very brave he would have liked to boast a little but he didnt he wisely held his tongue it would be time enough to do his boasting after he had reached a place of safety and had eaten that egg he was halfway across the old orchard when he felt that egg beginning to slip now at best it isnt easy to carry an egg without breaking it you know how very careful you have to be just imagine how blacky felt when that egg began to slip do what he would he couldnt get a better grip on it it slipped a wee bit more blacky started down towards the ground but he wasnt quick enough striped chipmunk watching blacky from the old stone wall saw something white drop from blackys claws he saw blacky dash after it and clutch at it only to miss it then the white thing struck a branch of an old apple tree bounced off and fell to the ground blacky followed it  striped chipmunk stole very softly through the grass to see what blacky was doing blacky was standing close beside a white thing that looked very much like an egg he was looking at it with the queerest expression  now and then he would reach out and rap it sharply with his bill and then look as if he didnt know what to make of it he didnt that egg wasnt behaving right it should have broken when it hit the branch of the apple tree certainly it should have broken when he struck it that way with his bill however was he to eat that egg if he couldnt break the shell blacky didnt know    chapter xxxii what blacky did with the stolen egg  blacky was puzzled he didnt know what to make of that egg he had stolen from farmer browns henhouse it wasnt like any egg he ever had seen or even heard of it was a beautifullooking egg and he had been sure that it would taste as good quite as good as it looked even now he wasnt sure that if he could only taste it it would be all that he had hoped but how could he taste it when he couldnt break that shell he never had heard of such a shell he doubted if anybody else ever had either he had hammered at it with his stout bill until he was afraid that he would break that instead of the egg the more he tried to break into it and couldnt the hungrier he grew and the more certain that nothing else in all the world could possibly taste so good but the old orchard was not the place for him to work on that egg in the first place it was too near farmer browns house this made blacky uneasy you see he had something of a guilty conscience not that he felt at all a sense of having done wrong to his way of thinking if he were smart enough to get that egg he had just as much right to it as any one else particularly farmer browns boy yet he wasnt at all sure that farmer browns boy would look at the matter quite that way in fact he had a feeling that farmer browns boy would call him a thief if he should be discovered with that egg then too there were too many sharp eyes in the old orchard he wanted to get away where he could be sure of being alone then if he couldnt break that shell no one would be the wiser so he picked up the egg and flew straight over to the green forest and this time he managed to get there without dropping it  now you would never suspect blacky the crow he of the sharp wits and crafty ways of being amused by bright things would you but he is in fact blacky is quite like a little child in this matter anything that is bright and shiny interests blacky right away if he finds anything of this kind he will take it away to a certain secret place and there he will admire it and play with it and finally hide it if i didnt know that it isnt so because it couldnt possibly be so i should think that blacky was some relation to certain small boys i know always their pockets are filled with all sorts of useless odds and ends which they have picked up here and there blacky has no pockets so he keeps his treasures of this kind in a secret hidingplace a sort of treasure storehouse he visits this secretly every day uncovers his treasures and gloats over them and plays with them then carefully covers them up again first blacky took this egg over near his home and there he once more tried and tried and tried to break the shell but the shell wouldnt break not even when blacky quite lost his temper and hammered at it for all he was worth then he gave the thing up as a bad matter and flew up to his favorite roost in the top of a tall pinetree leaving the egg on the ground but from where he sat on his favorite roost in the tall pinetree he could see that provoking egg a little spot of shining white when a jolly little sunbeam found it and rested on it it was so very bright and shiny that blacky couldnt keep his eyes off it  little by little he forgot that it was an egg at least he forgot that he wanted to eat it he began to find pleasure in just looking at it it might not satisfy his stomach but it certainly was very satisfying to his eyes he forgot to think of it as a thing to eat but began to think of it wholly as a thing to look at and admire he was glad he hadnt been able to break that shell  once more he spread his black wings and flew down to the egg he cocked his head to one side and looked at it he cocked his head to the other side and looked at it he walked all around it chuckling and saying to himself pretty pretty pretty pretty and all mine mine mine mine pretty pretty and all mine  than he craftily looked all about to make sure that no one was watching him having made quite sure he rolled the egg over and turned it around and admired it to his hearts content at last he picked it up and carried it to his treasurehouse and covered it over very carefully and there that china nestegg for that is what he had stolen is still his chief treasure to this day and blacky still sometimes wonders what kind of a hen laid such a hardshelled egg  blacky has had very many other adventures but it would take another book to tell about all of them that would be hardly fair to some of the other little people who also have had adventures and want them told to you one of these is a beautiful little fellow who lives in the green forest and so the next book will be whitefoot the wood mouse
