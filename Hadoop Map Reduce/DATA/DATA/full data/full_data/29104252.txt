29104252	on books and the housing of them   by william ewart gladstone 18091898   in the old age of his intellect which at this point seemed to taste a little of decrepitude strauss declared 1 that the doctrine of immortality has recently lost the assistance of a passable argument inasmuch as it has been discovered that the stars are inhabited for where he asks could room now be found for such a multitude of souls again in view of the current estimates of prospective population for this earth some people have begun to entertain alarm for the probable condition of england if not great britain when she gets say seventy millions that are allotted to her against six or eight hundred millions for the united states we have heard in some systems of the pressure of population upon food but the idea of any pressure from any quarter upon space is hardly yet familiar still i suppose that many a reader must have been struck with the naive simplicity of the hyperbole of st john 2 perhaps a solitary unit of its kind in the new testament the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written  a book even audubon i believe the biggest known is smaller than a man but in relation to space i entertain more proximate apprehension of pressure upon available space from the book population than from the numbers of mankind we ought to recollect with more of a realized conception than we commonly attain to that a book consists like a man from whom it draws its lineage of a body and a soul they are not always proportionate to each other nay even the different members of the bookbody do not sing but clash when bindings of a profuse costliness are imposed as too often happens in the case of bibles and books of devotion upon letterpress which is respectable journeymans work and nothing more the men of the renascence had a truer sense of adaptation the age of jewelled bindings was also the age of illumination and of the beautiful miniatura which at an earlier stage meant side or margin art3 and then on account of the small portraitures included in it gradually slid into the modern sense of miniature there is a caution which we ought to carry with us more and more as we get in view of the coming period of open book trade and of demand practically boundless noble works ought not to be printed in mean and worthless forms and cheapness ought to be limited by an instinctive sense and law of fitness the binding of a book is the dress with which it walks out into the world the paper type and ink are the body in which its soul is domiciled and these three soul body and habilament are a triad which ought to be adjusted to one another by the laws of harmony and good sense  already the increase of books is passing into geometrical progression and this is not a little remarkable when we bear in mind that in great britain of which i speak while there is a vast supply of cheap works what are termed new publications issue from the press for the most part at prices fabulously high so that the class of real purchasers has been extirpated leaving behind as buyers only a few individuals who might almost be counted on the fingers while the effective circulation depends upon middlemen through the engine of circulating libraries these are not so much owners as distributers of books and they mitigate the difficulty of dearness by subdividing the cost and then selling such copies as are still in decent condition at a large reduction it is this state of things due in my opinion principally to the present form of the law of copyright which perhaps may have helped to make way for the satirical and sometimes untrue remark that in times of distress or pressure men make their first economies on their charities and their second on their books  the annual arrivals at the bodleian library are i believe some twenty thousand at the british museum forty thousand sheets of all kinds included supposing threefourths of these to be volumes of one size or another and to require on the average an inch of shelf space the result will be that in every two years nearly a mile of new shelving will be required to meet the wants of a single library but whatever may be the present rate of growth it is small in comparison with what it is likely to become the key of the question lies in the hands of the united kingdom and the united states jointly in this matter there rests upon these two powers no small responsibility they with their vast range of inhabited territory and their unity of tongue are masters of the world which will have to do as they do when the britains and america are fused into one book market when it is recognized that letters which as to their material and their aim are a highsoaring profession as to their mere remuneration are a trade when artificial fetters are relaxed and printers publishers and authors obtain the reward which wellregulated commerce would afford them then let floors beware lest they crack and walls lest they bulge and burst from the weight of books they will have to carry and to confine  it is plain for one thing that under the new state of things specialism in the future must more and more abound but specialism means subdivision of labor and with subdivision labor ought to be more completely more exactly performed let us bow our heads to the inevitable the day of encyclopaedic learning has gone by it may perhaps be said that that sun set with leibnitz but as little learning is only dangerous when it forgets that it is little so specialism is only dangerous when it forgets that it is special when it encroaches on its betters when it claims exceptional certainty or honor it is impertinent and should be rebuked but it has its own honor in its own province and is in any case to be preferred to pretentious and flaunting sciolism  a vast even a bewildering prospect is before us for evil or for good but for good unless it be our own fault far more than for evil books require no eulogy from me none could be permitted me when they already draw their testimonials from cicero4 and macaulay5 but books are the voices of the dead they are a main instrument of communion with the vast human procession of the other world they are the allies of the thought of man they are in a certain sense at enmity with the world their work is at least in the two higher compartments of our threefold life in a room well filled with them no one has felt or can feel solitary second to none as friends to the individual they are first and foremost among the compages the bonds and rivets of the race onward from that time when they were first written on the tablets of babylonia and assyria the rocks of asia minor and the monuments of egypt down to the diamond editions of mr pickering and mr frowde6  it is in truth difficult to assign dimensions for the libraries of the future and it is also a little touching to look back upon those of the past as the history of bodies cannot in the long run be separated from the history of souls i make no apology for saying a few words on the libraries which once were but which have passed away  the time may be approaching when we shall be able to estimate the quantity of book knowledge stored in the repositories of those empires which we call prehistoric for the present no clear estimate even of the great alexandrian libraries has been brought within the circle of popular knowledge but it seems pretty clear that the books they contained were reckoned at least in the aggregate by hundreds of thousands7 the form of the book however has gone through many variations and we moderns have a great advantage in the shape which the exterior has now taken it speaks to us symbolically by the title on its back as the roll of parchment could hardly do it is established that in roman times the bad institution of slavery ministered to a system under which books were multiplied by simultaneous copying in a room where a single person read aloud in the hearing of many the volume to be reproduced and that so produced they were relatively cheap had they not been so they would hardly have been as horace represents them among the habitual spoils of the grocer8 it is sad and is suggestive of many inquiries that this abundance was followed at least in the west by a famine of more than a thousand years and it is hard even after all allowances to conceive that of all the many manuscripts of homer which italy must have possessed we do not know that a single parchment or papyrus was ever read by a single individual even in a convent or even by a giant such as dante or as thomas acquinas the first of them unquestionably master of all the knowledge that was within the compass of his age there were however libraries even in the west formed by charlemagne and by others after him we are told that alcuin in writing to the great monarch spoke with longing of the relative wealth of england in these precious estates mr edwards whom i have already quoted mentions charles the fifth of france in 1365 as a collector of manuscripts but some ten years back the director of the bibliotheque nationale informed me that the french king john collected twelve hundred manuscripts at that time an enormous library out of which several scores were among the treasures in his care mary of medicis appears to have amassed in the sixteenth century probably with far less effort 5800 volumes9 oxford had before that time received noble gifts for her university library and we have to recollect with shame and indignation that that institution was plundered and destroyed by the commissioners of the boy king edward the sixth acting in the name of the reformation of religion thus it happened that opportunity was left to a private individual the munificent sir thomas bodley to attach an individual name to one of the famous libraries of the world it is interesting to learn that municipal bodies have a share in the honor due to monasteries and sovereigns in the collection of books for the common council of aix purchased books for a public library in 141910  louis the fourteenth of evil memory has at least this one good deed to his credit that he raised the royal library at paris founded two centuries before to 70000 volumes in 1791 it had 150000 volumes it profited largely by the revolution the british museum had only reached 115000 when panizzi became keeper in 1837 nineteen years afterward he left it with 560000 a number which must now have more than doubled by his noble design for occupying the central quadrangle a desert of gravel until his time he provided additional room for 1200000 volumes all this apparently enormous space for development is being eaten up with fearful rapidity and such is the greed of the splendid library that it opens its jaws like hades and threatens shortly to expel the antiquities from the building and appropriate the places they adorn  but the proper office of hasty retrospect in a paper like this is only to enlarge by degrees like the pupil of an eye the readers contemplation and estimate of the coming time and to prepare him for some practical suggestions of a very humble kind so i take up again the thread of my brief discourse national libraries draw upon a purse which is bottomless but all public libraries are not national and the case even of private libraries is becoming nay has become very serious for all who are possessed by the inexorable spirit of collection but whose ardor is perplexed and qualified or even baffled by considerations springing from the balancesheet  the purchase of a book is commonly supposed to end even for the most scrupulous customer with the payment of the booksellers bill but this is a mere popular superstition such payment is not the last but the first term in a series of goodly length if we wish to give to the block a lease of life equal to that of the pages the first condition is that it should be bound so at least one would have said half a century ago but while books are in the most instances cheaper binding from causes which i do not understand is dearer at least in england than it was in my early years so that few can afford it11 we have however the tolerable and very useful expedient of cloth binding now in some danger i fear of losing its modesty through flaring ornamentation to console us well then bound or not the book must of necessity be put into a bookcase and the bookcase must be housed and the house must be kept and the library must be dusted must be arranged should be catalogued what a vista of toil yet not unhappy toil unless indeed things are to be as they now are in at least one princely mansion of this country where books in thousands upon thousands are jumbled together with no more arrangement than a sack of coals where not even the sisterhood of consecutive volumes has been respected where undoubtedly an intending reader may at the mercy of fortune take something from the shelves that is a book but where no particular book can except by the purest accident be found  such being the outlook what are we to do with our books shall we be buried under them like tarpeia under the sabine shields shall we renounce them many will or will do worse will keep to the most worthless part of them in our resentment against their more and more exacting demands shall we sell and scatter them as it is painful to see how often the books of eminent men are ruthlessly or at least unhappily dispersed on their decease without answering in detail i shall assume that the bookbuyer is a booklover that his love is a tenacious not a transitory love and that for him the question is how best to keep his books  i pass over those conditions which are the most obvious that the building should be sound and dry the apartment airy and with abundant light and i dispose with a passing anathema of all such as would endeavour to solve their problem or at any rate compromise their difficulties by setting one row of books in front of another i also freely admit that what we have before us is not a choice between difficulty and no difficulty but a choice among difficulties  the objects further to be contemplated in the bestowal of our books so far as i recollect are three economy good arrangement and accessibility with the smallest possible expenditure of time  in a private library where the service of books is commonly to be performed by the person desiring to use them they ought to be assorted and distributed according to subject the case may be altogether different where they have to be sent for and brought by an attendant it is an immense advantage to bring the eye in aid of the mind to see within a limited compass all the works that are accessible in a given library on a given subject and to have the power of dealing with them collectively at a given spot instead of hunting them up through an entire accumulation it must be admitted however that distribution by subjects ought in some degree to be controlled by sizes if everything on a given subject from folio down to 32mo is to be brought locally together there will be an immense waste of space in the attempt to lodge objects of such different sizes in one and the same bookcase and this waste of space will cripple us in the most serious manner as will be seen with regard to the conditions of economy and of accessibility the three conditions are in truth all connected together but especially the two last named  even in a paper such as this the question of classification cannot altogether be overlooked but it is one more easy to open than to closeone upon which i am not bold enough to hope for uniformity of opinion and of practice i set aside on the one hand the case of great public libraries which i leave to the experts of those establishments and at the other end of the scale in small private libraries the matter becomes easy or even insignificant in libraries of the medium scale not too vast for some amount of personal survey some would multiply subdivision and some restrain it an acute friend asks me under what and how many general headings subjects should be classified in a library intended for practical use and reading and boldly answers by suggesting five classes only 1 science 2 speculation 3 art 4 history and 5 miscellaneous and periodical literature but this seemingly simple division at once raises questions both of practical and of theoretic difficulty as to the last periodical literature is fast attaining to such magnitude that it may require a classification of its own and that the enumeration which indexes supply useful as it is will not suffice and i fear it is the destiny of periodicals as such to carry down with them a large proportion of what in the phraseology of railways would be called dead weight as compared with live weight the limits of speculation would be most difficult to draw the diversities included under science would be so vast as at once to make subclassification a necessity the ologies are by no means well suited to rub shoulders together and sciences must include arts which are but country cousins to them or a new compartment must be established for their accommodation once more how to cope with the everlasting difficulty of works in what category to place dante petrarch swedenborg burke coleridge carlyle or a hundred more where again is poetry to stand i apprehend that it must take its place the first place without doubt in art for while it is separated from painting and her other sphereborn harmonious sisters by their greater dependence on material forms they are all more inwardly and profoundly united in their first and allenfolding principle which is to organize the beautiful for presentation to the perceptions of man  but underneath all particular criticism of this or that method of classification will be found to lie a subtler questionwhether the arrangement of a library ought not in some degree to correspond with and represent the mind of the man who forms it for my own part i plead guilty within certain limits of favoritism in classification i am sensible that sympathy and its reverse have something to do with determining in what company a book shall stand and further does there not enter into the matter a principle of humanity to the authors themselves ought we not to place them so far as may be in the neighborhood which they would like their living manhoods are printed in their works every reality every tendency endures eadem sequitur tellure sepultos  i fear that arrangement to be good must be troublesome subjects are traversed by promiscuous assemblages of works both by sizes and all by languages on the whole i conclude as follows the mechanical perfection of a library requires an alphabetical catalogue of the whole but under the shadow of this catalogue let there be as many living integers as possible for every wellchosen subdivision is a living integer and makes the library more and more an organism among others i plead for individual men as centres of subdivision not only for homer dante shakespeare but for johnson scott and burns and whatever represents a large and manifold humanity  the question of economy for those who from necessity or choice consider it at all is a very serious one it has been a fashion to make bookcases highly ornamental now books want for and in themselves no ornament at all they are themselves the ornament just as shops need no ornament and no one will think of or care for any structural ornament if the goods are tastefully disposed in the shopwindow the man who looks for society in his books will readily perceive that in proportion as the face of his bookcase is occupied by ornament he loses that society and conversely the more that face approximates to a sheet of bookbacks the more of that society he will enjoy and so it is that three great advantages come hand in hand and as will be seen reach their maximum together the sociability of books minimum of cost in providing for them and ease of access to them  in order to attain these advantages two conditions are fundamental first the shelves must as a rule be fixed secondly the cases or a large part of them should have their side against the wall and thus projecting into the room for a convenient distance they should be of twice the depth needed for a single line of books and should hold two lines one facing each way twelve inches is a fair and liberal depth for two rows of octavos the books are thus thrown into stalls but stalls after the manner of a stable or of an oldfashioned coffeeroom not after the manner of a bookstall which as times go is no stall at all but simply a flat space made by putting some scraps of boarding together and covering them with books  this method of dividing the longitudinal space by projections at right angles to it if not very frequently used has long been known a great example of it is to be found in the noble library of trinity college cambridge and is the work of sir christopher wren he has kept these cases down to very moderate height for he doubtless took into account that great heights require long ladders and that the fetching and use of these greatly add to the time consumed in getting or in replacing a book on the other hand the upper spaces of the walls are sacrificed whereas in dublin all souls and many other libraries the bookcases ascend very high and magnificent apartments walled with books may in this way be constructed access may be had to the upper portions by galleries but we cannot have stairs all round the room and even with one gallery of books a room should not be more than from sixteen to eighteen feet high if we are to act on the principle of bringing the largest possible number of volumes into the smallest possible space i am afraid it must be admitted that we cannot have a noble and imposing spectacle in a vast apartment without sacrificing economy and accessibility and vice versa  the projections should each have attached to them what i rudely term an endpiece for want of a better name that is a shallow and extremely light adhering bookcase light by reason of the shortness of the shelves which both increases the accommodation and makes one short side as well as the two long ones of the parallelopiped to present simply a face of books with the lines of shelf like threads running between the rows  the wallspaces between the projections ought also to be turned to account for shallow bookcases so far as they are not occupied by windows if the width of the interval be two feet six about sixteen inches of this may be given to shallow cases placed against the wall  economy of space is in my view best attained by fixed shelves this dictum i will now endeavor to make good if the shelves are movable each shelf imposes a dead weight on the structure of the bookcase without doing anything to support it hence it must be built with wood of considerable mass and the more considerable the mass of wood the greater are both the space occupied and the ornament needed when the shelf is fixed it contributes as a fastening to hold the parts of the bookcase together and a very long experience enables me to say that shelves of from half to threequarters of an inch worked fast into uprights of from threequarters to a full inch will amply suffice for all sizes of books except large and heavy folios which would probably require a small and only a small addition of thickness  i have recommended that as a rule the shelves be fixed and have given reasons for the adoption of such a rule i do not know whether it will receive the sanction of authorities and i make two admissions first it requires that each person owning and arranging a library should have a pretty accurate general knowledge of the sizes of his books secondly it may be expedient to introduce here and there by way of exception a single movable shelf and this i believe will be found to afford a margin sufficient to meet occasional imperfections in the computation of sizes subject to these remarks i have considerable confidence in the recommendation i have made  i will now exhibit to my reader the practical effect of such arrangement in bringing great numbers of books within easy reach let each projection be three feet long twelve inches deep ample for two faces of octavos and nine feet high so that the upper shelf can be reached by the aid of a wooden stool of two steps not more than twenty inches high and portable without the least effort in a single hand i will suppose the wall space available to be eight feet and the projections three in number with end pieces need only jut out three feet five while narrow strips of bookcase will run up the wall between the projections under these conditions the bookcases thus described will carry above 2000 octavo volumes  and a library forty feet long and twenty feet broad amply lighted having some portion of the centre fitted with very low bookcases suited to serve for some of the uses of tables will receive on the floor from 18000 to 20000 volumes of all sizes without losing the appearance of a room or assuming that of a warehouse and while leaving portions of space available near the windows for purposes of study if a gallery be added there will be accommodation for a further number of five thousand and the room need be no more than sixteen feet high but a gallery is not suitable for works above the octavo size on account of inconvenience in carriage to and fro  it has been admitted that in order to secure the vital purpose of compression with fixed shelving the rule of arrangement according to subjects must be traversed partially by division into sizes this division however need not as to the bulk of the library be more than threefold the main part would be for octavos this is becoming more and more the classical or normal size so that nowadays the octavo edition is professionally called the library edition then there should be deeper cases for quarto and folio and shallower for books below octavo each appropriately divided into shelves  if the economy of time by compression is great so is the economy of cost i think it reasonable to take the charge of provision for books in a gentlemans house and in the ordinary manner at a shilling a volume this may vary either way but it moderately represents i think my own experience in london residences of the charge of fitting up with bookcases which if of any considerable size are often unsuitable for removal the cost of the method which i have adopted later in life and have here endeavored to explain need not exceed one penny per volume each bookcase when filled represents unless in exceptional cases nearly a solid mass the intervals are so small that as a rule they admit a very small portion of dust if they are at a tolerable distance from the fireplace if carpeting be avoided except as to small movable carpets easily removed for beating and if sweeping be discreetly conducted dust may at any rate in the country be made to approach to a quantite negligeable  it is a great matter in addition to other advantages to avoid the endless trouble and the miscarriages of movable shelves the looseness and the tightness the weary arms the aching fingers and the broken fingernails but it will be fairly asked what is to be done when the shelves are fixed with volumes too large to go into them i admit that the dilemma when it occurs is formidable i admit also that no book ought to be squeezed or even coaxed into its place they should move easily both in and out and i repeat here that the plan i have recommended requires a pretty exact knowledge by measurement of the sizes of books and the proportions in which the several sizes will demand accommodation the shelfspacing must be reckoned beforehand with a good deal of care and no little time but i can say from experience that by moderate care and use this knowledge can be attained and that the resulting difficulties when measured against the aggregate of convenience are really insignificant it will be noticed that my remarks are on minute details and that they savor more of serious handiwork in the placing of books than of lordly survey and direction but what man who really loves his books delegates to any other human being as long as there is breath in his body the office of inducting them into their homes  and now as to results it is something to say that in this way 10000 volumes can be placed within a room of quite ordinary size all visible all within easy reach and without destroying the character of the apartment as a room but on the strength of a case with which i am acquainted i will even be a little more particular i take as before a room of forty feet in length and twenty in breadth thoroughly lighted by four windows on each side as high as you please but with only about nine feet of height taken for the bookcases inasmuch as all heavy ladders all adminicula requiring more than one hand to carry with care are forsworn and there is no gallery in the manner i have described there may be placed on the floor of such a room without converting it from a room into a warehouse bookcases capable of receiving in round numbers 20000 volumes  the state of the case however considered as a whole and especially with reference to libraries exceeding say 20000 or 30000 volumes and gathering rapid accretions has been found to require in extreme cases such as those of the british museum and the bodleian on its limited site a change more revolutionary in its departure from almost reversal of the ancient methods than what has been here described  the best description i can give of its essential aim so far as i have seen the processes which were tentative and initial is this the masses represented by filled bookcases are set one in front of another and in order that access may be had as it is required they are set upon trams inserted in the floor which must be a strong one and wheeled off and on as occasion requires  the idea of the society of books is in a case of this kind abandoned but even on this there is something to say neither all men nor all books are equally sociable for my part i find but little sociabilty in a huge wall of hansards or though a great improvement in the gentlemans magazine in the annual registers in the edinburgh and quarterly reviews or in the vast range of volumes which represent pamphlets innumerable yet each of these and other like items variously present to us the admissible or the valuable or the indispensable clearly these masses and such as these ought to be selected first for what i will not scruple to call interment it is a burial one however to which the process of cremation will never of set purpose be applied the word i have used is dreadful but also dreadful is the thing to have our dear old friends stowed away in catacombs or like the winebottles in bins the simile is surely lawful until the use of that commodity shall have been prohibited by the growing movement of the time but however we may gild the case by a cheering illustration or by the remembrance that the provision is one called for only by our excess of wealth it can hardly be contemplated without a shudder at a process so repulsive applied to the best beloved among inanimate objects  it may be thought that the gloomy perspective i am now opening exists for great public libraries alone but public libraries are multiplying fast and private libraries are aspiring to the public dimensions it may be hoped that for a long time to come no grave difficulties will arise in regard to private libraries meant for the ordinary use of that great majority of readers who read only for recreation or for general improvement but when study research authorship come into view when the history of thought and of inquiry in each of its branches or in any considerable number of them has to be presented the necessities of the case are terribly widened chess is a specialty and a narrow one but i recollect a statement in the quarterly review years back that there might be formed a library of twelve hundred volumes upon chess i think my deceased friend mr alfred denison collected between two and three thousand upon angling of living englishmen perhaps lord acton is the most effective and retentive reader and for his own purposes he has gathered a library of not less i believe than 100000 volumes  undoubtedly the idea of bookcemeteries such as i have supposed is very formidable it should be kept within the limits of the dire necessity which has evoked it from the underworld into the haunts of living men but it will have to be faced and faced perhaps oftener than might be supposed and the artist needed for the constructions it requires will not be so much a librarian as a warehouseman  but if we are to have cemeteries they ought to receive as many bodies as possible the condemned will live ordinarily in pitch darkness yet so that when wanted they may be called into the light asking myself how this can most effectively be done i have arrived at the conclusion that nearly twothirds or say threefifths of the whole cubic contents of a properly constructed apartment12 may be made a nearly solid mass of books a vast economy which so far as it is applied would probably quadruple or quintuple the efficiency of our repositories as to contents and prevent the population of great britain from being extruded some centuries hence into the surrounding waters by the exorbitant dimensions of their own

be not properly a room but a warehouse
