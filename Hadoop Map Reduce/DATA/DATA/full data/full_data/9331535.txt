sexual characters unequal development of the two sides of the body appearance with advancing age of characters derived from a cross the germ with all its latent characters a wonderful object monstrosities peloric flowers due in some cases to reversion  the great principle of inheritance to be discussed in this chapter has been recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations as shown by the scientific term atavism derived from atavus an ancestor by the english terms of reversion or throwingback by the french pasenarriere and by the german ruckschlag or ruckschritt when the child resembles either grandparent more closely than its immediate parents our attention is not much arrested though in truth the fact is highly remarkable but when the child resembles some remote ancestor or some distant member in a collateral lineand in the last case we must attribute this to the descent of all the members from a common progenitorwe feel a just degree of astonishment when one parent alone displays some newlyacquired and generally inheritable character and the offspring do not inherit it the cause may lie in the other parent having the power of prepotent transmission but when both parents are similarly characterised and the child does not whatever the cause may be inherit the character in question but resembles its grandparents we have one of the simplest cases of reversion we continually see another and even more simple case of atavism though not generally included under this head namely when the son more closely resembles his maternal than his paternal grandsire in some male attribute as in any peculiarity in the beard of man the horns of the bull the hackles or comb of the cock or as in certain diseases necessarily confined to the male sex for as the mother cannot possess or exhibit such male attributes the child must inherit them through her blood from his maternal grandsire  the cases of reversion may be divided into two main classes which however in some instances blend into one another namely first those occurring in a variety or race which has not been crossed but has lost by variation some character that it formerly possessed and which afterwards reappears the second class includes all cases in which an individual with some distinguishable character a race or species has at some former period been crossed and a character derived from this cross after having disappeared during one or several generations suddenly reappears a third class differing only in the manner of reproduction might be formed to include all cases of reversion effected by means of buds and therefore independent of true or seminal generation perhaps even a fourth class might be instituted to include reversions by segments in the same individual flower or fruit and in different parts of the body in the same individual animal as it grows old but the two first main classes will be sufficient for our purpose  reversion to lost characters by pure or uncrossed forms  striking instances of this first class of cases were given in the sixth chapter namely of the occasional reappearance in variouslycoloured breeds of the pigeon of blue birds with all the marks characteristic of the wild columba livia similar cases were given in the case of the fowl with the common ass as the legs of the wild progenitor are almost always striped we may feel assured that the occasional appearance of such stripes in the domestic animal is a case of simple reversion but i shall be compelled to refer again to these cases and therefore here pass them over  the aboriginal species from which our domesticated cattle and sheep are descended no doubt possessed horns but several hornless breeds are now well established yet in thesefor instance in southdown sheepit is not unusual to find among the male lambs some with small horns the horns which thus occasionally reappear in other polled breeds either grow to the full size or are curiously attached to the skin alone and hang loosely down or drop off 131 youatt on sheep pages 20 234 the same fact of loose horns occasionally appearing in hornless breeds has been observed in germany bechstein naturgesch deutschlands b 1 s 362 the galloways and suffolk cattle have been hornless for the last 100 or 150 years but a horned calf with the horn often loosely attached is occasionally produced 132 youatt on cattle pages 155 174  there is reason to believe that sheep in their early domesticated condition were brown or dingy black but even in the time of david certain flocks were spoken of as white as snow during the classical period the sheep of spain are described by several ancient authors as being black red or tawny 133 youatt on sheep 1838 pages 17 145 at the present day notwithstanding the great care which is taken to prevent it particoloured lambs and some entirely black are occasionally or even frequently dropped by our most highly improved and valued breeds such as the southdowns since the time of the famous bakewell during the last century the leicester sheep have been bred with the most scrupulous care yet occasionally greyfaced or blackspotted or wholly black lambs appear 134 i have been informed of this fact through the rev wd fox on the excellent authority of mr wilmot see also remarks on this subject in an article in the quarterly review 1849 page 395 this occurs still more frequently with the less improved breeds such as the norfolks 135 youatt pages 19 234 as bearing on this tendency in sheep to revert to dark colours i may state though in doing so i trench on the reversion of crossed breeds and likewise on the subject of prepotency that the rev wd fox was informed that seven white southdown ewes were put to a socalled spanish ram which had two small black spots on his sides and they produced thirteen lambs all perfectly black mr fox believes that this ram belonged to a breed which he has himself kept and which is always spotted with black and white and he finds that leicester sheep crossed by rams of this breed always produce black lambs he has gone on recrossing these crossed sheep with pure white leicesters during three successive generations but always with the same result mr fox was also told by the friend from whom the spotted breed was procured that he likewise had gone on for six or seven generations crossing with white sheep but still black lambs were invariably produced  similar facts could be given with respect to tailless breeds of various animals for instance mr hewitt 136 the poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 page 231 states that chickens bred from some rumpless fowls which were reckoned so good that they won a prize at an exhibition in a considerable number of instances were furnished with fully developed tailfeathers on inquiry the original breeder of these fowls stated that from the time when he had first kept them they had often produced fowls furnished with tails but that these latter would again reproduce rumpless chickens  analogous cases of reversion occur in the vegetable kingdom thus from seeds gathered from the finest cultivated varieties of heartsease viola tricolor plants perfectly wild both in their foliage and their flowers are frequently produced 137 loudons gardeners mag volume 10 1834 page 396 a nurseryman with much experience on this subject has likewise assured me that this sometimes occurs but the reversion in this instance is not to a very ancient period for the best existing varieties of the heartsease are of comparatively modern origin with most of our cultivated vegetables there is some tendency to reversion to what is known to be or may be presumed to be their aboriginal state and this would be more evident if gardeners did not generally look over their beds of seedlings and pull up the false plants or rogues as they are called it has already been remarked that some few seedling apples and pears generally resemble but apparently are not identical with the wild trees from which they are descended in our turnip 138 gardeners chronicle 1855 page 777 and carrotbeds a few plants often break that is flower too soon and their roots are generally hard and stringy as in the parentspecies by the aid of a little selection carried on during a few generations most of our cultivated plants could probably be brought back without any great change in their conditions of life to a wild or nearly wild condition mr buckman has effected this with the parsnip 139 ibid 1862 page 721 and mr hewett c watson as he informs me selected during three generations the most diverging plants of scotch kail perhaps one of the least modified varieties of the cabbage and in the third generation some of the plants came very close to the forms now established in england about old castlewalls and called indigenous  reversion in animals and plants which have run wild  in the cases hitherto considered the reverting animals and plants have not been exposed to any great or abrupt change in their conditions of life which could have induced this tendency but it is very different with animals and plants which have become feral or run wild it has been repeatedly asserted in the most positive manner by various authors that feral animals and plants invariably return to their primitive specific type it is curious on what little evidence this belief rests many of our domesticated animals could not subsist in a wild state thus the more highly improved breeds of the pigeon will not field or search for their own food sheep have never become feral and would be destroyed by almost every beast of prey 1310 mr boner speaks chamoishunting 2nd edition 1860 page 92 of sheep often running wild in the bavarian alps but on making further inquiries at my request he found that they are not able to establish themselves they generally perish from the frozen snow clinging to their wool and they have lost the skill necessary to pass over steep icy slopes on one occasion two ewes survived the winter but their lambs perished in several cases we do not know the aboriginal parent species and cannot possibly tell whether or not there has been any close degree of reversion it is not known in any instance what variety was first turned out several varieties have probably in some cases run wild and their crossing alone would tend to obliterate their proper character our domesticated animals and plants when they run wild must always be exposed to new conditions of life for as mr wallace 1311 see some excellent remarks on this subject by mr wallace journal proc linn soc 1858 volume 3 page 60 has well remarked they have to obtain their own food and are exposed to competition with the native productions under these circumstances if our domesticated animals did not undergo change of some kind the result would be quite opposed to the conclusions arrived at in this work nevertheless i do not doubt that the simple fact of animals and plants becoming feral does cause some tendency to reversion to the primitive state though this tendency has been much exaggerated by some authors  i will briefly run through the recorded cases with neither horses nor cattle is the primitive stock known and it has been shown in former chapters that they have assumed different colours in different countries thus the horses which have run wild in south america are generally brownishbay and in the east duncoloured their heads have become larger and coarser and this may be due to reversion no careful description has been given of the feral goat dogs which have run wild in various countries have hardly anywhere assumed a uniform character but they are probably descended from several domestic races and aboriginally from several distinct species feral cats both in europe and la plata are regularly striped in some cases they have grown to an unusually large size but do not differ from the domestic animal in any other character when variouslycoloured tame rabbits are turned out in europe they generally reacquire the colouring of the wild animal there can be no doubt that this does really occur but we should remember that oddly coloured and conspicuous animals would suffer much from beasts of prey and from being easily shot this at least was the opinion of a gentleman who tried to stock his woods with a nearly white variety if thus destroyed they would be supplanted by instead of being transformed into the common rabbit we have seen that the feral rabbits of jamaica and especially of porto santo have assumed new colours and other new characters the best known case of reversion and that on which the widely spread belief in its universality apparently rests is that of pigs these animals have run wild in the west indies south america and the falkland islands and have everywhere acquired the dark colour the thick bristles and great tusks of the wild boar and the young have reacquired longitudinal stripes but even in the case of the pig roulin describes the halfwild animals in different parts of south america as differing in several respects in louisiana the pig 1312 dureau de la malle comptes rendus tome 41 1855 page 807 from the statements above given the author concludes that the wild pigs of louisiana are not descended from the european sus scrofa has run wild and is said to differ a little in form and much in colour from the domestic animal yet does not closely resemble the wild boar of europe with pigeons and fowls 1313 capt w allen in his expedition to the niger states that fowls have run wild on the island of annobon and have become modified in form and voice the account is so meagre and vague that it did not appear to me worth copying but i now find that dureau de la malle comptes rendus tome 41 1855 page 690 advances this as a good instance of reversion to the primitive stock and as confirmatory of a still more vague statement in classical times by varro it is not known what variety was first turned out nor what character the feral birds have assumed the guineafowl in the west indies when feral seems to vary more than in the domesticated state  with respect to plants run wild dr hooker 1314 flora of australia 1859 introduction page 9 has strongly insisted on what slight evidence the common belief in their reversion to a primitive state rests godron 1315 de lespece tome 2 pages 54 58 60 describes wild turnips carrots and celery but these plants in their cultivated state hardly differ from their wild prototypes except in the succulency and enlargement of certain parts characters which would certainly be lost by plants growing in poor soil and struggling with other plants no cultivated plant has run wild on so enormous a scale as the cardoon cynara cardunculus in la plata every botanist who has seen it growing there in vast beds as high as a horses back has been struck with its peculiar appearance but whether it differs in any important point from the cultivated spanish form which is said not to be prickly like its american descendant or whether it differs from the wild mediterranean species which is said not to be social though this may be due merely to the nature of the conditions i do not know  reversion to characters derived from a cross in the case of subvarieties races and species  when an individual having some recognisable peculiarity unites with another of the same subvariety not having the peculiarity in question it often reappears in the descendants after an interval of several generations every one must have noticed or heard from old people of children closely resembling in appearance or mental disposition or in so small and complex a character as expression one of their grandparents or some more distant collateral relation very many anomalies of structure and diseases 1316 mr sedgwick gives many instances in the british and foreign medchirurg review april and july 1863 pages 448 188 of which instances have been given in the last chapter have come into a family from one parent and have reappeared in the progeny after passing over two or three generations the following case has been communicated to me on good authority and may i believe be fully trusted a pointerbitch produced seven puppies four were marked with blue and white which is so unusual a colour with pointers that she was thought to have played false with one of the greyhounds and the whole litter was condemned but the gamekeeper was permitted to save one as a curiosity two years afterwards a friend of the owner saw the young dog and declared that he was the image of his old pointerbitch sappho the only blue and white pointer of pure descent which he had ever seen this led to close inquiry and it was proved that he was the greatgreatgrandson of sappho so that according to the common expression he had only 116th of her blood in his veins i may give one other instance on the authority of mr r walker a large cattle breeder in kincardineshire he bought a black bull the son of a black cow with white legs white belly and part of the tail white and in 1870 a calf the grgrgrgrgrandchild of this cow was born coloured in the same very peculiar manner all the intermediate offspring having been black in these cases there can hardly be a doubt that a character derived from a cross with an individual of the same variety reappeared after passing over three generations in the one case and five in the other  when two distinct races are crossed it is notorious that the tendency in the offspring to revert to one or both parentforms is strong and endures for many generations i have myself seen the clearest evidence of this in crossed pigeons and with various plants mr sidney 1317 in his edition of youatt on the pig 1860 page 27 states that in a litter of essex pigs two young ones appeared which were the image of the berkshire boar that had been used twentyeight years before in giving size and constitution to the breed i observed in the farmyard at betley hall some fowls showing a strong likeness to the malay breed and was told by mr tollet that he had forty years before crossed his birds with malays and that though he had at first attempted to get rid of this strain he had subsequently given up the attempt in despair as the malay character would reappear  this strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert has given rise to endless discussions in how many generations after a single cross either with a distinct breed or merely with an inferior animal the breed may be considered as pure and free from all danger of reversion no one supposes that less than three generations suffices and most breeders think that six seven or eight are necessary and some go to still greater lengths 1318 dr p lucas hered nat tome 2 pages 314 892 see a good practical article on the subject in gardeners chronicle 1856 page 620 i could add a vast number of references but they would be superfluous but neither in the case of a breed which has been contaminated by a single cross nor when in the attempt to form an intermediate breed halfbred animals have been matched together during many generations can any rule be laid down how soon the tendency to reversion will be obliterated it depends on the difference in the strength or prepotency of transmission in the two parentforms on their actual amount of difference and on the nature of the conditions of life to which the crossed offspring are exposed but we must be careful not to confound these cases of reversion to characters which were gained by a cross with those under the first class in which characters originally common to both parents but lost at some former period reappear for such characters may recur after an almost indefinite number of generations  the law of reversion is as powerful with hybrids when they are sufficiently fertile to breed together or when they are repeatedly crossed with either pure parentform as in the case of mongrels it is not necessary to give instances with plants almost every one who has worked on this subject from the time of kolreuter to the present day has insisted on this tendency gartner has recorded some good instances but no one has given more striking ones than naudin 1319 kolreuter gives curious cases in his dritte fortsetzung 1766 ss 53 59 and in his wellknown memoirs on lavatera and jalapa gartner bastarderzeugung ss 437 441 etc naudin in his recherches sur lhybridite nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 25 the tendency differs in degree or strength in different groups and partly depends as we shall presently see on whether the parentplants have been long cultivated although the tendency to reversion is extremely general with nearly all mongrels and hybrids it cannot be considered as invariably characteristic of them it may also be mastered by longcontinued selection but these subjects will more properly be discussed in a future chapter on crossing from what we see of the power and scope of reversion both in pure races and when varieties or species are crossed we may infer that characters of almost every kind are capable of reappearing after having been lost for a great length of time but it does not follow from this that in each particular case certain characters will reappear for instance this will not occur when a race is crossed with another endowed with prepotency of transmission sometimes the power of reversion wholly fails without our being able to assign any cause for the failure thus it has been stated that in a french family in which 85 out of above 600 members during six generations had been subject to nightblindness there has not been a single example of this affection in the children of parents who were themselves free from it 1320 quoted by mr sedgwick in medchirurg review april 1861 page 485 dr h dobell in medchirurg transactions volume 46 gives an analogous case in which in a large family fingers with thickened joints were transmitted to several members during five generations but when the blemish once disappeared it never reappeared  reversion through budpropagationpartial reversion by segments in the same flower or fruit or in different parts of the body in the same individual animal  in the eleventh chapter many cases of reversion by buds independently of seminal generation were givenas when a leafbud on a variegated a curled or laciniated variety suddenly reassumes its proper character or as when a provencerose appears on a mossrose or a peach on a nectarinetree in some of these cases only half the flower or fruit or a smaller segment or mere stripes reassume their former character and here we have reversion by segments vilmorin 1321 verlot des varietes 1865 page 63 has also recorded several cases with plants derived from seed of flowers reverting by stripes or blotches to their primitive colours he states that in all such cases a white or palecoloured variety must first be formed and when this is propagated for a length of time by seed striped seedlings occasionally make their appearance and these can afterwards by care be multiplied by seed  the stripes and segments just referred to are not due as far as is known to reversion to characters derived from a cross but to characters lost by variation these cases however as naudin 1322 nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 25 alex braun in his rejuvenescence ray soc 1853 page 315 apparently holds a similar opinion insists in his discussion on disjunction of character are closely analogous with those given in the eleventh chapter in which crossed plants have been known to produce halfand half or striped flowers and fruit or distinct kinds of flowers on the same root resembling the two parentforms many piebald animals probably come under this same head such cases as we shall see in the chapter on crossing apparently result from certain characters not readily blending together and as a consequence of this incapacity for fusion the offspring either perfectly resemble one of their two parents or resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in another part or whilst young are intermediate in character but with advancing age revert wholly or by segments to either parentform or to both thus young trees of the cytisus adami are intermediate in foliage and flowers between the two parentforms but when older the buds continually revert either partially or wholly to both forms the cases given in the eleventh chapter on the changes which occurred during growth in crossed plants of tropaeolum cereus datura and lathyrus are all analogous as however these plants are hybrids of the first generation and as their buds after a time come to resemble their parents and not their grandparents these cases do not at first appear to come under the law of reversion in the ordinary sense of the word nevertheless as the change is effected through a succession of budgenerations on the same plant they may be thus included  analogous facts have been observed in the animal kingdom and are more remarkable as they occur in the same individual in the strictest sense and not as with plants through a succession of budgenerations with animals the act of reversion if it can be so designated does not pass over a true generation but merely over the early stages of growth in the same individual for instance i crossed several white hens with a black cock and many of the chickens were during the first year perfectly white but acquired during the second year black feathers on the other hand some of the chickens which were at first black became during the second year piebald with white a great breeder 1323 mr teebay in the poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 page 72 says that a pencilled brahma hen which has any of the blood of the light brahma in her will occasionally produce a pullet well pencilled during the first year but she will most likely moult brown on the shoulders and become quite unlike her original colours in the second year the same thing occurs with light brahmas if of impure blood i have observed exactly similar cases with the crossed offspring from differently coloured pigeons but here is a more remarkable fact i crossed a turbit which has a frill formed by the feathers being reversed on its breast with a trumpeter and one of the young pigeons thus raised at first showed not a trace of the frill but after moulting thrice a small yet unmistakably distinct frill appeared on its breast according to girou 1324 quoted by hofacker ueber die eigenschaften etc s 98 calves produced from a red cow by a black bull or from a black cow by a red bull are not rarely born red and subsequently become black i possess a dog the daughter of a white terrier by a fox coloured bulldog as a puppy she was quite white but when about six months old a black spot appeared on her nose and brown spots on her ears when a little older she was badly wounded on the back and the hair which grew on the cicatrix was of a brown colour apparently derived from her father this is the more remarkable as with most animals having coloured hair that which grows on a wounded surface is white  in the foregoing cases the characters which with advancing age reappeared were present in the immediately preceding generations but characters sometimes reappear in the same manner after a much longer interval of time thus the calves of a hornless race of cattle which originated in corrientes though at first quite hornless as they become adult sometimes acquire small crooked and loose horns and these in succeeding years occasionally become attached to the skull 1325 azara essais hist nat de paraguay tome 2 1801 page 372 white and black bantams both of which generally breed true sometimes assume as they grow old a saffron or red plumage for instance a firstrate black bantam has been described which during three seasons was perfectly black but then annually became more and more red and it deserves notice that this tendency to change whenever it occurs in a bantam is almost certain to prove hereditary 1326 these facts are given on the high authority of mr hewitt in the poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 page 248 the cuckoo or bluemottled dorking cock when old is liable to acquire yellow or orange hackles in place of his proper bluishgrey hackles 1327 the poultry book by tegetmeier 1866 page 97 now as gallus bankiva is coloured red and orange and as dorking fowls and bantams are descended from this species we can hardly doubt that the change which occasionally occurs in the plumage of these birds as their age advances results from a tendency in the individual to revert to the primitive type  crossing as a direct cause of reversion  it has long been notorious that hybrids and mongrels often revert to both or to one of their parentforms after an interval of from two to seven or eight or according to some authorities even a greater number of generations but that the act of crossing in itself gives an impulse towards reversion as shown by the reappearance of longlost characters has never i believe been hitherto proved the proof lies in certain peculiarities which do not characterise the immediate parents and therefore cannot have been derived from them frequently appearing in the offspring of two breeds when crossed which peculiarities never appear or appear with extreme rarity in these same breeds as long as they are precluded from crossing as this conclusion seems to me highly curious and novel i will give the evidence in detail  my attention was first called to this subject and i was led to make numerous experiments by mm boitard and corbie having stated that when they crossed certain breeds of pigeons birds coloured like the wild c livia or the common dovecotenamely slatyblue with double black wingbars sometimes chequered with black white loins the tail barred with black with the outer feathers edged with whitewere almost invariably produced the breeds which i crossed and the remarkable results attained have been fully described in the sixth chapter i selected pigeons belonging to true and ancient breeds which had not a trace of blue or any of the above specified marks but when crossed and their mongrels recrossed young birds were often produced more or less plainly coloured slatyblue with some or all of the proper characteristic marks i may recall to the readers memory one case namely that of a pigeon hardly distinguishable from the wild shetland species the grandchild of a redspot white fantail and two black barbs from any of which when purelybred the production of a pigeon coloured like the wild c livia would have been almost a prodigy  i was thus led to make the experiments recorded in the seventh chapter on fowls i selected longestablished pure breeds in which there was not a trace of red yet in several of the mongrels feathers of this colour appeared and one magnificent bird the offspring of a black spanish cock and white silk hen was coloured almost exactly like the wild gallus bankiva all who know anything of the breeding of poultry will admit that tens of thousands of pure spanish and of pure white silk fowls might have been reared without the appearance of a red feather the fact given on the authority of mr tegetmeier of the frequent appearance in mongrel fowls of pencilled or transverselybarred feathers like those common to many gallinaceous birds is likewise apparently a case of reversion to a character formerly possessed by some ancient progenitor of the family i owe to the kindness of this excellent observer the opportunity of inspecting some neckhackles and tailfeathers from a hybrid between the common fowl and a very distinct species the gallus varius and these feathers are transversely striped in a conspicuous manner with dark metallic blue and grey a character which could not have been derived from either immediate parent  i have been informed by mr bp brent that he crossed a white aylesbury drake and a black socalled labrador duck both of which are true breeds and he obtained a young drake closely like the mallard a boschas of the musk duck cairina moschata linn there are two subbreeds namely white and slatecoloured and these i am informed breed true or nearly true but the rev wd fox tells me that by putting a white drake to a slatecoloured duck black birds pied with white like the wild muskduck were always produced i hear from mr blyth that hybrids from the canary and goldfinch almost always have streaked feathers on their backs and this streaking must be derived from the original wild canary  we have seen in the fourth chapter that the socalled himalayan rabbit with its snowwhite body black ears nose tail and feet breeds perfectly true this race is known to have been formed by the union of two varieties of silvergrey rabbits now when a himalayan doe was crossed by a sandycoloured buck a silvergrey rabbit was produced and this is evidently a case of reversion to one of the parent varieties the young of the himalayan rabbit are born snowwhite and the dark marks do not appear until some time subsequently but occasionally young himalayan rabbits are born of a light silvergrey which colour soon disappears so that here we have a trace of reversion during an early period of life to the parent varieties independently of any recent cross  in the third chapter it was shown that at an ancient period some breeds of cattle in the wilder parts of britain were white with dark ears and that the cattle now kept half wild in certain parks and those which have run quite wild in two distant parts of the world are likewise thus coloured now an experienced breeder mr j beasley of northamptonshire 1328 gardeners chronicle and agricultural gazette 1866 page 528 crossed some carefully selected west highland cows with purelybred shorthorn bulls the bulls were red red and white or dark roan and the highland cows were all of a red colour inclining to a light or yellow shade but a considerable number of the offspringand mr beasley calls attention to this as a remarkable factwere white or white with red ears bearing in mind that none of the parents were white and that they were purelybred animals it is highly probable that here the offspring reverted in consequence of the cross to the colour of some ancient and halfwild parentbreed the following case perhaps comes under the same head cows in their natural state have their udders but little developed and do not yield nearly so much milk as our domesticated animals now there is some reason to believe 1329 ibid 1860 page 343 i am glad to find that so experienced a breeder of cattle as mr willoughby wood gardeners chronicle 1869 page 1216 admits my principle of a cross giving a tendency to reversion that crossbred animals between two kinds both of which are good milkers such as alderneys and shorthorns often turn out worthless in this respect  in the chapter on the horse reasons were assigned for believing that the primitive stock was striped and duncoloured and details were given showing that in all parts of the world stripes of a dark colour frequently appear along the spine across the legs and on the shoulders where they are occasionally double or treble and even sometimes on the face and body of horses of all breeds and of all colours but the stripes appear most frequently on the various kinds of duns in foals they are sometimes plainly seen and subsequently disappear the duncolour and the stripes are strongly transmitted when a horse thus characterised is crossed with any other but i was not able to prove that striped duns are generally produced from the crossing of two distinct breeds neither of which are duns though this does sometimes occur  the legs of the ass are often striped and this may be considered as a reversion to the wild parent form the equus taeniopus of abyssinia 1330 sclater in proc zoolog soc 1862 page 163 which is generally thus striped in the domestic animal the stripes on the shoulder are occasionally double or forked at the extremity as in certain zebrine species there is reason to believe that the foal is more frequently striped on the legs than the adult animal as with the horse i have not acquired any distinct evidence that the crossing of differentlycoloured varieties of the ass brings out the stripes  but now let us turn to the result of crossing the horse and ass although mules are not nearly so numerous in england as asses i have seen a much greater number with striped legs and with the stripes far more conspicuous than in either parentform such mules are generally lightcoloured and might be called fallowduns the shoulderstripe in one instance was deeply forked at the extremity and in another instance was double though united in the middle mr martin gives a figure of a spanish mule with strong zebralike marks on its legs 1331 history of the horse page 212 and remarks that mules are particularly liable to be thus striped on their legs in south america according to roulin 1332 mem presentes par divers savans a lacad royale tome 6 1835 page 338 such stripes are more frequent and conspicuous in the mule than in the ass in the united states mr gosse 1333 letters from alabama 1859 page 280 speaking of these animals says that in a great number perhaps in nine out of every ten the legs are banded with transverse dark stripes  many years ago i saw in the zoological gardens a curious triple hybrid from a bay mare by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra this animal when old had hardly any stripes but i was assured by the superintendent that when young it had shoulderstripes and faint stripes on its flanks and legs i mention this case more especially as an instance of the stripes being much plainer during youth than in old age  as the zebra has such a conspicuously striped body and legs it might have been expected that the hybrids from this animal and the common ass would have had their legs in some degree striped but it appears from the figures given in dr grays knowsley gleanings and still more plainly from that given by geoffroy and f cuvier 1334 hist nat des mammiferes 1820 tome 1 that the legs are much more conspicuously striped than the rest of the body and this fact is intelligible only on the belief that the ass aids in giving through the power of reversion this character to its hybrid offspring  the quagga is banded over the whole front part of its body like a zebra but has no stripes on its legs or mere traces of them but in the famous hybrid bred by lord morton 1335 philosoph transact 1821 page 20 from a chestnut nearly purelybred arabian mare by a male quagga the stripes were more strongly defined and darker than those on the legs of the quagga the mare was subsequently put to a black arabian horse and bore two colts both of which as formerly stated were plainly striped on the legs and one of them likewise had stripes on the neck and body  the equus indicus 1336 sclater in proc zoolog soc 1862 page 163 this species is the ghorkhur of nw india and has often been called the hemionus of pallas see also mr blyths excellent paper in journal of asiatic soc of bengal volume 28 1860 page 229 is characterised by a spinal stripe without shoulder or leg stripes but traces of these latter stripes may occasionally be seen even in the adult 1337 another species of wild ass the true e hemionus or kiang which ordinarily has no shoulderstripes is said occasionally to have them and these as with the horse and ass are sometimes double see mr blyth in the paper just quoted and in indian sporting review 1856 page 320 and col hamilton smith in nat library horses page 318 and dict class dhist nat tome 3 page 563 and colonel s poole who has had ample opportunities for observation informs me that in the foal when first born the head and legs are often striped but the shoulderstripe is not so distinct as in the domestic ass all these stripes excepting that along the spine soon disappear now a hybrid raised at knowsley 1338 figured in the gleanings from the knowsley menageries by dr je gray from a female of this species by a male domestic ass had all four legs transversely and conspicuously striped had three short stripes on each shoulder and had even some zebralike stripes on its face dr gray informs me that he has seen a second hybrid of the same parentage similarly striped  from these facts we see that the crossing of the several equine species tends in a marked manner to cause stripes to appear on various parts of the body especially on the legs as we do not know whether the parentform of the genus was striped the appearance of the stripes can only hypothetically be attributed to reversion but most persons after considering the many undoubted cases of variously coloured marks reappearing by reversion in my experiments on crossed pigeons and fowls will come to the same conclusion with respect to the horsegenus and if so we must admit that the progenitor of the group was striped on the legs shoulders face and probably over the whole body like a zebra  lastly professor jaeger has given 1339 darwinsche theorie und ihre stellung zu moral und religion page 85 a good case with pigs he crossed the japanese or masked breed with the common german breed and the offspring were intermediate in character he then recrossed one of these mongrels with the pure japanese and in the litter thus produced one of the young resembled in all its characters a wild pig it had a long snout and upright ears and was striped on the back it should be borne in mind that the young of the japanese breed are not striped and that they have a short muzzle and ears remarkably dependent  a similar tendency to the recovery of long lost characters holds good even with the instincts of crossed animals there are some breeds of fowls which are called everlasting layers because they have lost the instinct of incubation and so rare is it for them to incubate that i have seen notices published in works on poultry when hens of such breeds have taken to sit 1340 cases of both spanish and polish hens sitting are given in the poultry chronicle 1855 volume 3 page 477 yet the aboriginal species was of course a good incubator and with birds in a state of nature hardly any instinct is so strong as this now so many cases have been recorded of the crossed offspring from two races neither of which are incubators becoming firstrate sitters that the reappearance of this instinct must be attributed to reversion from crossing one author goes so far as to say that a cross between two nonsitting varieties almost invariably produces a mongrel that becomes broody and sits with remarkable steadiness 1341 the poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 pages 119 163 the author who remarks on the two negatives journ of hort 1862 page 325 states that two broods were raised from a spanish cock and silverpencilled hamburgh hen neither of which are incubators and no less than seven out of eight hens in these two broods showed a perfect obstinacy in sitting the rev es dixon ornamental poultry 1848 page 200 says that chickens reared from a cross between golden and black polish fowls are good and steady birds to sit mr bp brent informs me that he raised some good sitting hens by crossing pencilled hamburgh and polish breeds a crossbred bird from a spanish nonincubating cock and cochin incubating hen is mentioned in the poultry chronicle volume 3 page 13 as an exemplary mother on the other hand an exceptional case is given in the cottage gardener 1860 page 388 of a hen raised from a spanish cock and black polish hen which did not incubate another author after giving a striking example remarks that the fact can be explained only on the principle that two negatives make a positive it cannot however be maintained that hens produced from a cross between two nonsitting breeds invariably recover their lost instinct any more than that crossed fowls or pigeons invariably recover the red or blue plumage of their prototypes thus i raised several chickens from a polish hen by a spanish cockbreeds which do not incubateand none of the young hens at first showed any tendency to sit but one of themthe only one which was preservedin the third year sat well on her eggs and reared a brood of chickens so that here we have the reappearance with advancing age of a primitive instinct in the same manner as we have seen that the red plumage of the gallus bankiva is sometimes reacquired both by crossed and purelybred fowls of various kinds as they grow old  the parents of all our domesticated animals were of course aboriginally wild in disposition and when a domesticated species is crossed with a distinct species whether this is a domesticated or only a tamed animal the hybrids are often wild to such a degree that the fact is intelligible only on the principle that the cross has caused a partial return to a primitive disposition thus the earl of powis formerly imported some thoroughly domesticated humped cattle from india and crossed them with english breeds which belong to a distinct species and his agent remarked to me without any question having been asked how oddly wild the crossbred animals were the european wild boar and the chinese domesticated pig are almost certainly specifically distinct sir f darwin crossed a sow of the latter breed with a wild alpine boar which had become extremely tame but the young though having halfdomesticated blood in their veins were extremely wild in confinement and would not eat swill like common english pigs captain hutton in india crossed a tame goat with a wild one from the himalaya and he remarked to me how surprisingly wild the offspring were mr hewitt who has had great experience in crossing tame cockpheasants with fowls belonging to five breeds gives as the character of all extraordinary wildness 1342 the poultry book by tegetmeier 1866 pages 165 167 but i have myself seen one exception to this rule mr s j salter 1343 natural history review 1863 april page 277 who raised a large number of hybrids from a bantamhen by gallus sonneratii states that all were exceedingly wild mr waterton 1344 essays on natural history page 917 bred some wild ducks from eggs hatched under a common duck and the young were allowed to cross freely both amongst themselves and with the tame ducks they were half wild and half tame they came to the windows to be fed but still they had a wariness about them quite remarkable  on the other hand mules from the horse and ass are certainly not in the least wild though notorious for obstinacy and vice mr brent who has crossed canarybirds with many kinds of finches has not observed as he informs me that the hybrids were in any way remarkably wild but mr jenner weir who has had still greater experience is of a directly opposite opinion he remarks that the siskin is the tamest of finches but its mules are as wild when young as newly caught birds and are often lost through their continued efforts to escape hybrids are often raised between the common and musk duck and i have been assured by three persons who have kept these crossed birds that they were not wild but mr garnett 1345 as stated by mr orton in his physiology of breeding page 12 observed that his hybrids were wild and exhibited migratory propensities of which there is not a vestige in the common or musk duck no case is known of this latter bird having escaped and become wild in europe or asia except according to pallas on the caspian sea and the common domestic duck only occasionally becomes wild in districts where large lakes and fens abound nevertheless a large number of cases have been recorded 1346 m e de selyslongchamps refers bulletin acad roy de bruxelles tome 12 no 10 to more than seven of these hybrids shot in switzerland and france m deby asserts zoologist volume 5 184546 page 1254 that several have been shot in various parts of belgium and northern france audubon ornitholog biography volume 3 page 168 speaking of these hybrids says that in north america they now and then wander off and become quite wild of hybrids from these two ducks having been shot in a completely wild state although so few are reared in comparison with purelybred birds of either species it is improbable that any of these hybrids could have acquired their wildness from the muskduck having paired with a truly wild duck and this is known not to be the case in north america hence we must infer that they have reacquired through reversion their wildness as well as renewed powers of flight  these latter facts remind us of the statements so frequently made by travellers in all parts of the world on the degraded state and savage disposition of crossed races of man that many excellent and kindhearted mulattos have existed no one will dispute and a more mild and gentle set of men could hardly be found than the inhabitants of the island of chiloe who consist of indians commingled with spaniards in various proportions on the other hand many years ago long before i had thought of the present subject i was struck with the fact that in south america men of complicated descent between negroes indians and spaniards seldom had whatever the cause might be a good expression 1347 journal of researches 1845 page 71 livingstoneand a more unimpeachable authority cannot be quotedafter speaking of a halfcaste man on the zambesi described by the portuguese as a rare monster of inhumanity remarks it is unaccountable why halfcastes such as he are so much more cruel than the portuguese but such is undoubtedly the case an inhabitant remarked to livingstone god made white men and god made black men but the devil made halfcastes 1348 expedition to the zambesi 1865 pages 25 150 when two races both low in the scale are crossed the progeny seems to be eminently bad thus the noble hearted humboldt who felt no prejudice against the inferior races speaks in strong terms of the bad and savage disposition of zambos or halfcastes between indians and negroes and this conclusion has been arrived at by various observers 1349 dr p broca on hybridity in the genus homo english translation 1864 page 39 from these facts we may perhaps infer that the degraded state of so many halfcastes is in part due to reversion to a primitive and savage condition induced by the act of crossing even if mainly due to the unfavourable moral conditions under which they are generally reared  summary on the proximate causes leading to reversion  when purelybred animals or plants reassume longlost characterswhen the common ass for instance is born with striped legs when a pure race of black or white pigeons throws a slatyblue bird or when a cultivated heartsease with large and rounded flowers produces a seedling with small and elongated flowerswe are quite unable to assign any proximate cause when animals run wild the tendency to reversion which though it has been greatly exaggerated no doubt exists is sometimes to a certain extent intelligible thus with feral pigs exposure to the weather will probably favour the growth of the bristles as is known to be the case with the hair of other domesticated animals and through correlation the tusks will tend to be redeveloped but the reappearance of coloured longitudinal stripes on young feral pigs cannot be attributed to the direct action of external conditions in this case and in many others we can only say that any change in the habits of life apparently favour a tendency inherent or latent in the species to return to the primitive state  it will be shown in a future chapter that the position of flowers on the summit of the axis and the position of seeds within the capsule sometimes determine a tendency towards reversion and this apparently depends on the amount of sap or nutriment which the flowerbuds and seeds receive the position also of buds either on branches or on roots sometimes determines as was formerly shown the transmission of the character proper to the variety or its reversion to a former state  we have seen in the last section that when two races or species are crossed there is the strongest tendency to the reappearance in the offspring of long lost characters possessed by neither parent nor immediate progenitor when two white or red or black pigeons of wellestablished breeds are united the offspring are almost sure to inherit the same colours but when differentlycoloured birds are crossed the opposed forces of inheritance apparently counteract each other and the tendency which is inherent in both parents to produce slatyblue offspring becomes predominant so it is in several other cases but when for instance the ass is crossed with e indicus or with the horseanimals which have not striped legsand the hybrids have conspicuous stripes on their legs and even on their faces all that can be said is that an inherent tendency to reversion is evolved through some disturbance in the organisation caused by the act of crossing  another form of reversion is far commoner indeed is almost universal with the offspring from a cross namely to the characters proper to either pure parentform as a general rule crossed offspring in the first generation are nearly intermediate between their parents but the grandchildren and succeeding generations continually revert in a greater or lesser degree to one or both of their progenitors several authors have maintained that hybrids and mongrels include all the characters of both parents not fused together but merely mingled in different proportions in different parts of the body or as naudin 1350 nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 151 has expressed it a hybrid is a living mosaicwork in which the eye cannot distinguish the discordant elements so completely are they intermingled we can hardly doubt that in a certain sense this is true as when we behold in a hybrid the elements of both species segregating themselves into segments in the same flower or fruit by a process of selfattraction or selfaffinity this segregation taking place either by seminal or budpropagation naudin further believes that the segregation of the two specific elements or essences is eminently liable to occur in the male and female reproductive matter and he thus explains the almost universal tendency to reversion in successive hybrid generations for this would be the natural result of the union of pollen and ovules in both of which the elements of the same species had been segregated by selfaffinity if on the other hand pollen which included the elements of one species happened to unite with ovules including the elements of the other species the intermediate or hybrid state would still be retained and there would be no reversion but it would as i suspect be more correct to say that the elements of both parentspecies exist in every hybrid in a double state namely blended together and completely separate how this is possible and what the term specific essence or element may be supposed to express i shall attempt to show in the chapter on the hypothesis of pangenesis  but naudins view as propounded by him is not applicable to the reappearance of characters lost long ago by variation and it is hardly applicable to races or species which after having been crossed at some former period with a distinct form and having since lost all traces of the cross nevertheless occasionally yield an individual which reverts as in the case of the great greatgrandchild of the pointer sappho to the crossing form the most simple case of reversion namely of a hybrid or mongrel to its grandparents is connected by an almost perfect series with the extreme case of a purelybred race recovering characters which had been lost during many ages and we are thus led to infer that all the cases must be related by some common bond  gartner believed that only highly sterile hybrid plants exhibit any tendency to reversion to their parentforms this erroneous belief may perhaps be accounted for by the nature of the genera crossed by him for he admits that the tendency differs in different genera the statement is also directly contradicted by naudins observations and by the notorious fact that perfectly fertile mongrels exhibit the tendency in a high degreeeven in a higher degree according to gartner himself than hybrids 1351 bastarderzeugung s 582 438 etc  gartner further states that reversions rarely occur with hybrid plants raised from species which have not been cultivated whilst with those which have been long cultivated they are of frequent occurrence this conclusion explains a curious discrepancy max wichura 1352 die bastardbefruchtung der weiden 1865 s 23 for gartners remarks on this head see bastarderzeugung s 474 582 who worked exclusively on willows which had not been subjected to culture never saw an instance of reversion and he goes so far as to suspect that the careful gartner had not sufficiently protected his hybrids from the pollen of the parentspecies naudin on the other hand who chiefly experimented on cucurbitaceous and other cultivated plants insists more strenuously than any other author on the tendency to reversion in all hybrids the conclusion that the condition of the parentspecies as affected by culture is one of the proximate causes leading to reversion agrees well with the converse case of domesticated animals and cultivated plants being liable to reversion when they become feral for in both cases the organisation or constitution must be disturbed though in a very different way 1353 prof weismann in his very curious essay on the different forms produced by the same species of butterfly at different seasons saison dimorphismus der schmetterlinge pages 27 28 has come to a similar conclusion namely that any cause which disturbs the organisation such as the exposure of the cocoons to heat or even to much shaking gives a tendency to reversion  finally we have seen that characters often reappear in purelybred races without our being able to assign any proximate cause but when they become feral this is either indirectly or directly induced by the change in their conditions of life with crossed breeds the act of crossing in itself certainly leads to the recovery of longlost characters as well as of those derived from either parentform changed conditions consequent on cultivation and the relative position of buds flowers and seeds on the plant all apparently aid in giving this same tendency reversion may occur either through seminal or bud generation generally at birth but sometimes only with an advance of age segments or portions of the individual may alone be thus affected that a being should be born resembling in certain characters an ancestor removed by two or three and in some cases by hundreds or even thousands of generations is assuredly a wonderful fact in these cases the child is commonly said to inherit such characters directly from its grandparent or more remote ancestors but this view is hardly conceivable if however we suppose that every character is derived exclusively from the father or mother but that many characters lie latent or dormant in both parents during a long succession of generations the foregoing facts are intelligible in what manner characters may be conceived to lie latent will be considered in a future chapter to which i have lately alluded  latent characters  but i must explain what is meant by characters lying latent the most obvious illustration is afforded by secondary sexual characters in every female all the secondary male characters and in every male all the secondary female characters apparently exist in a latent state ready to be evolved under certain conditions it is well known that a large number of female birds such as fowls various pheasants partridges peahens ducks etc when old or diseased or when operated on assume many or all of the secondary male characters of their species in the case of the henpheasant this has been observed to occur far more frequently during certain years than during others 1354 yarrell phil transact 1827 page 268 dr hamilton in proc zoolog soc 1862 page 23 a duck ten years old has been known to assume both the perfect winter and summer plumage of the drake 1355 archiv skand beitrage zur naturgesch 8 s 397413 waterton 1356 in his essays on nat hist 1838 mr hewitt gives analogous cases with hen pheasants in journal of horticulture july 12 1864 page 37 isidore geoffroy sainthilaire in his essais de zoolog gen suites a buffon 1842 pages 496513 has collected such cases in ten different kinds of birds it appears that aristotle was well aware of the change in mental disposition in old hens the case of the female deer acquiring horns is given at page 513 gives a curious case of a hen which had ceased laying and had assumed the plumage voice spurs and warlike disposition of the cock when opposed to an enemy she would erect her hackles and show fight thus every character even to the instinct and manner of fighting must have lain dormant in this hen as long as her ovaria continued to act the females of two kinds of deer when old have been known to acquire horns and as hunter has remarked we see something of an analogous nature in the human species  on the other hand with male animals it is notorious that the secondary sexual characters are more or less completely lost when they are subjected to castration thus if the operation be performed on a young cock he never as yarrell states crows again the comb wattles and spurs do not grow to their full size and the hackles assume an intermediate appearance between true hackles and the feathers of the hen cases are recorded of confinement which often affects the reproductive system causing analogous results but characters properly confined to the female are likewise acquired by the male the capon takes to sitting on eggs and will bring up chickens and what is more curious the utterly sterile male hybrids from the pheasant and the fowl act in the same manner their delight being to watch when the hens leave their nests and to take on themselves the office of a sitter 1357 cottage gardener 1860 page 379 that admirable observer reaumur 1358 art de faire eclore etc 1749 tome 2 page 8 asserts that a cock by being long confined in solitude and darkness can be taught to take charge of young chickens he then utters a peculiar cry and retains during his whole life this newly acquired maternal instinct the many wellascertained cases of various male mammals giving milk shows that their rudimentary mammary glands retain this capacity in a latent condition  we thus see that in many probably in all cases the secondary characters of each sex lie dormant or latent in the opposite sex ready to be evolved under peculiar circumstances we can thus understand how for instance it is possible for a good milking cow to transmit her good qualities through her male offspring to future generations for we may confidently believe that these qualities are present though latent in the males of each generation so it is with the gamecock who can transmit his superiority in courage and vigour through his female to his male offspring and with man it is known 1359 sir h holland medical notes and reflections 3rd edition 1855 page 31 that diseases such as hydrocele necessarily confined to the male sex can be transmitted through the female to the grandson such cases as these offer as was remarked at the commencement of this chapter the simplest possible examples of reversion and they are intelligible on the belief that characters common to the grandparent and grandchild of the same sex are present though latent in the intermediate parent of the opposite sex  the subject of latent characters is so important as we shall see in a future chapter that i will give another illustration many animals have the right and left sides of their body unequally developed this is well known to be the case with flatfish in which the one side differs in thickness and colour and in the shape of the fins from the other and during the growth of the young fish one eye is gradually twisted from the lower to the upper surface 1360 see steenstrup on the obliquity of flounders in annals and mag of nat hist may 1865 page 361 i have given an abstract of malms explanation of this wonderful phenomenon in the origin of species 6th edition page 186 in most flatfishes the left is the blind side but in some it is the right though in both cases reversed or wrong fishes are occasionally developed and in platessa flesus the right or left side is indifferently the upper one with gasteropods or shellfish the right and left sides are extremely unlike the far greater number of species are dextral with rare and occasional reversals of development and some few are normally sinistral but certain species of bulimus and many achatinellae 1361 dr e von martens in annals and mag of nat hist march 1866 page 209 are as often sinistral as dextral i will give an analogous case in the great articulate kingdom the two sides of verruca 1362 darwin balanidae ray soc 1854 page 499 see also the appended remarks on the apparently capricious development of the thoracic limbs on the right and left sides in the higher crustaceans are so wonderfully unlike that without careful dissection it is extremely difficult to recognise the corresponding parts on the opposite sides of the body yet it is apparently a mere matter of chance whether it be the right or the left side that undergoes so singular amount of change one plant is known to me 1363 mormodes ignea darwin fertilisation of orchids 1862 page 251 in which the flower according as it stands on the one or other side of the spike is unequally developed in all the foregoing cases the two sides are perfectly symmetrical at an early period of growth now whenever a species is as liable to be unequally developed on the one as on the other side we may infer that the capacity for such development is present though latent in the undeveloped side and as a reversal of development occasionally occurs in animals of many kinds this latent capacity is probably very common  the best yet simplest cases of characters lying dormant are perhaps those previously given in which chickens and young pigeons raised from a cross between differently coloured birds are at first of one colour but in a year or two acquire feathers of the colour of the other parent for in this case the tendency to a change of plumage is clearly latent in the young bird so it is with hornless breeds of cattle some of which acquire small horns as they grow old purely bred black and white bantams and some other fowls occasionally assume with advancing years the red feathers of the parent species i will here add a somewhat different case as it connects in a striking manner latent characters of two classes mr hewitt 1364 journal of horticulture july 1864 page 38 i have had the opportunity of examining these remarkable feathers through the kindness of mr tegetmeier possessed an excellent sebright goldlaced bantam hen which as she became old grew diseased in her ovaria and assumed male characters in this breed the males resemble the females in all respects except in their combs wattles spurs and instincts hence it might have been expected that the diseased hen would have assumed only those masculine characters which are proper to the breed but she acquired in addition wellarched tail sicklefeathers quite a foot in length saddlefeathers on the loins and hackles on the neckornaments which as mr hewitt remarks would be held as abominable in this breed the sebright bantam is known 1365 the poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 page 241 to have originated about the year 1800 from a cross between a common bantam and a polish fowl recrossed by a hentailed bantam and carefully selected hence there can hardly be a doubt that the sicklefeathers and hackles which appeared in the old hen were derived from the polish fowl or common bantam and we thus see that not only certain masculine characters proper to the sebright bantam but other masculine characters derived from the first progenitors of the breed removed by a period of above sixty years were lying latent in this henbird ready to be evolved as soon as her ovaria became diseased  from these several facts it must be admitted that certain characters capacities and instincts may lie latent in an individual and even in a succession of individuals without our being able to detect the least sign of their presence when fowls pigeons or cattle of different colours are crossed and their offspring change colour as they grow old or when the crossed turbit acquired the characteristic frill after its third moult or when rarelybred bantams partially assume the red plumage of their prototype we cannot doubt that these qualities were from the first present though latent in the individual animal like the characters of a moth in the caterpillar now if these animals had produced offspring before they had acquired with advancing age their new characters nothing is more probable than that they would have transmitted them to some of their offspring who in this case would in appearance have received such characters from their grand parents or more distant progenitors we should then have had a case of reversion that is of the reappearance in the child of an ancestral character actually present though during youth completely latent in the parent and this we may safely conclude is what occurs in all reversions to progenitors however remote  this view of the latency in each generation of all the characters which appear through reversion is also supported by their actual presence in some cases during early youth alone or by their more frequent appearance and greater distinctness at this age than during maturity we have seen that this is often the case with the stripes on the legs and faces of the several species of the horse genus the himalayan rabbit when crossed sometimes produces offspring which revert to the parent silvergrey breed and we have seen that in purely bred animals palegrey fur occasionally reappears during early youth black cats we may feel assured would occasionally produce by reversion tabbies and on young black kittens with a pedigree 1366 carl vogt lectures on man english translation 1864 page 411 known to have been long pure faint traces of stripes may almost always be seen which afterwards disappear hornless suffolk cattle occasionally produce by reversion horned animals and youatt 1367 on cattle page 174 asserts that even in hornless individuals the rudiment of a horn may be often felt at an early age  no doubt it appears at first sight in the highest degree improbable that in every horse of every generation there should be a latent capacity and tendency to produce stripes though these may not appear once in a thousand generations that in every white black or other coloured pigeon which may have transmitted its proper colour during centuries there should be a latent capacity in the plumage to become blue and to be marked with certain characteristic bars that in every child in a sixfingered family there should be the capacity for the production of an additional digit and so in other cases nevertheless there is no more inherent improbability in this being the case than in a useless and rudimentary organ or even in only a tendency to the production of a rudimentary organ being inherited during millions of generations as is well known to occur with a multitude of organic beings there is no more inherent improbability in each domestic pig during a thousand generations retaining the capacity and tendency to develop great tusks under fitting conditions than in the young calf having retained for an indefinite number of generations rudimentary incisor teeth which never protrude through the gums  i shall give at the end of the next chapter a summary of the three preceding chapters but as isolated and striking cases of reversion have here been chiefly insisted on i wish to guard the reader against supposing that reversion is due to some rare or accidental combination of circumstances when a character lost during hundreds of generations suddenly reappears no doubt some such combination must occur but reversions to the immediately preceding generations may be constantly observed at least in the offspring of most unions this has been universally recognised in the case of hybrids and mongrels but it has been recognised simply from the difference between the united forms rendering the resemblance of the offspring to their grandparents or more remote progenitors of easy detection reversion is likewise almost invariably the rule as mr sedgwick has shown with certain diseases hence we must conclude that a tendency to this peculiar form of transmission is an integral part of the general law of inheritance  monstrosities  a large number of monstrous growths and of lesser anomalies are admitted by every one to be due to an arrest of development that is to the persistence of an embryonic condition but many monstrosities cannot be thus explained for parts of which no trace can be detected in the embryo but which occur in other members of the same class of animals occasionally appear and these may probably with truth be attributed to reversion as however i have treated this subject as fully as i could in my descent of man ch 1 2nd edition i will not here recur to it  when flowers which have normally an irregular structure become regular or peloric the change is generally looked at by botanists as a return to the primitive state but dr maxwell masters 1368 natural hist review april 1863 page 258 see also his lecture royal institution march 16 1860 on same subject see moquintandon elements de teratologie 1841 pages 184 352 dr peyritsch has collected a large number of very interesting cases sitzb d k akad d wissensch wien b 60 and especially b 66 1872 page 125 who has ably discussed this subject remarks that when for instance all the sepals of a tropaeolum become green and of the same shape instead of being coloured with one prolonged into a spur or when all the petals of a linaria become simple and regular such cases may be due merely to an arrest of development for in these flowers all the organs during their earliest condition are symmetrical and if arrested at this stage of growth they would not become irregular if moreover the arrest were to take place at a still earlier period of development the result would be a simple tuft of green leaves and no one probably would call this a case of reversion dr masters designates the cases first alluded to as regular peloria and others in which all the corresponding parts assume a similar form of irregularity as when all the petals in a linaria become spurred as irregular peloria we have no right to attribute these latter cases to reversion until it can be shown that the parentform for instance of the genus linaria had had all its petals spurred for a chance of this nature might result from the spreading of an anomalous structure in accordance with the law to be discussed in a future chapter of homologous parts tending to vary in the same manner but as both forms of peloria frequently occur on the same individual plant of the linaria 1369 verlot des varietes 1865 page 89 naudin nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 137 they probably stand in some close relation to one another on the doctrine that peloria is simply the result of an arrest of development it is difficult to understand how an organ arrested at a very early period of growth should acquire its full functional perfectionhow a petal supposed to be thus arrested should acquire its brilliant colours and serve as an envelope to the flower or a stamen produce efficient pollen yet this occurs with many peloric flowers that pelorism is not due to mere chance variability but either to an arrest of development or to reversion we may infer from an observation made by ch morren 1370 in his discussion on some curious peloric calceolarias quoted in journal of horticulture february 24 1863 page 152 namely that families which have irregular flowers often return by these monstrous growths to their regular form whilst we never see a regular flower realise the structure of an irregular one  some flowers have almost certainly become more or less completely peloric through reversion as the following interesting case shows corydalis tuberosa properly has one of its two nectaries colourless destitute of nectar only half the size of the other and therefore to a certain extent in a rudimentary state the pistil is curved towards the perfect nectary and the hood formed of the inner petals slips off the pistil and stamen in one direction alone so that when a bee sucks the perfect nectary the stigma and stamens are exposed and rubbed against the insects body in several closely allied genera as in dielytra etc there are two perfect nectaries the pistil is straight and the hood slips off on either side according as the bee sucks either nectary now i have examined several flowers of corydalis tuberosa in which both nectaries were equally developed and contained nectar in this we see only the redevelopment of a partially aborted organ but with this redevelopment the pistil becomes straight and the hood slips off in either direction so that these flowers have acquired the perfect structure so well adapted for insect agency of dielytra and its allies we cannot attribute these coadapted modifications to chance or to correlated variability we must attribute them to reversion to a primordial condition of the species  the peloric flowers of pelargonium have their five petals in all respects alike and there is no nectary so that they resemble the symmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus geranium but the alternate stamens are also sometimes destitute of anthers the shortened filaments being left as rudiments and in this respect they resemble the symmetrical flowers of the closely allied genus erodium hence we may look at the peloric flowers of pelargonium as having reverted to the state of some primordial form the progenitor of the three closely related genera of pelargonium geranium and erodium  in the peloric form of antirrhinum majus appropriately called the wonder the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully from those of the common snapdragon the calyx and the mouth of the corolla consist of six equal lobes and include six equal instead of four unequal stamens one of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed by the development of a microscopically minute papilla which may be found at the base of the upper lip of the flower of the common snapdragons in the nineteen plants examined by me that this papilla is a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various degrees of development in crossed plants between the common and the peloric antirrhinum again a peloric galeobdolon luteum growing in my garden had five equal petals all striped like the ordinary lower lip and included five equal instead of four unequal stamens but mr r keeley who sent me this plant informs me that the flowers vary greatly having from four to six lobes to the corolla and from three to six stamens 1371 for other cases of six divisions in peloric flowers of the labiatae and scrophulariaceae see moquin tandon teratologie page 192 now as the members of the two great families to which the antirrhinum and galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous with some of the parts confluent and others suppressed we ought not to look at the sixth stamen and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either case as due to reversion any more than the additional petals in double flowers in these same two families but the case is different with the fifth stamen in the peloric antirrhinum which is produced by the redevelopment of a rudiment always present and which probably reveals to us the state of the flower as far as the stamens are concerned at some ancient epoch it is also difficult to believe that the other four stamens and the petals after an arrest of development at a very early embryonic age would have come to full perfection in colour structure and function unless these organs had at some former period normally passed through a similar course of growth hence it appears to me probable that the progenitor of the genus antirrhinum must at some remote epoch have included five stamens and borne flowers in some degree resembling those now produced by the peloric form the conclusion that peloria is not a mere monstrosity irrespective of any former state of the species is supported by the fact that this structure is often strongly inherited as in the case of the peloric antirrhinum and gloxinia and sometimes in that of the peloric corydalis solida 1372 godron reprinted from the memoires de lacad de stanislas 1868  lastly i may add that many instances have been recorded of flowers not generally considered as peloric in which certain organs are abnormally augmented in number as an increase of parts cannot be looked at as an arrest of development nor as due to the redevelopment of rudiments for no rudiments are present and as these additional parts bring the plant into closer relationship with its natural allies they ought probably to be viewed as reversions to a primordial condition  these several facts show us in an interesting manner how intimately certain abnormal states are connected together namely arrests of development causing parts to become rudimentary or to be wholly suppressedthe redevelopment of parts now in a more or less rudimentary conditionthe reappearance of organs of which not a vestige can be detectedand to these may be added in the case of animals the presence during youth and subsequent disappearance of certain characters which occasionally are retained throughout life some naturalists look at all such abnormal structures as a return to the ideal state of the group to which the affected being belongs but it is difficult to conceive what is meant to be conveyed by this expression other naturalists maintain with greater probability and distinctness of view that the common bond of connection between the several foregoing cases is an actual though partial return to the structure of the ancient progenitor of the group if this view be correct we must believe that a vast number of characters capable of evolution lie hidden in every organic being but it would be a mistake to suppose that the number is equally great in all beings we know for instance that plants of many orders occasionally become peloric but many more cases have been observed in the labiatae and scrophulariaceae than in any other order and in one genus of the scrophulariaceae namely linaria no less than thirteen species have been described in this condition 1373 moquin tandon teratologie page 186 on this view of the nature of peloric flowers and bearing in mind certain monstrosities in the animal kingdom we must conclude that the progenitors of most plants and animals have left an impression capable of redevelopment on the germs of their descendants although these have since been profoundly modified  the fertilised germ of one of the higher animals subjected as it is to so vast a series of changes from the germinal cell to old ageincessantly agitated by what quatrefages well calls the tourbillon vitalis perhaps the most wonderful object in nature it is probable that hardly a change of any kind affects either parent without some mark being left on the germ but on the doctrine of reversion as given in this chapter the germ becomes a far more marvellous object for besides the visible changes which it undergoes we must believe that it is crowded with invisible characters proper to both sexes to both the right and left side of the body and to a long line of male and female ancestors separated by hundreds or even thousands of generations from the present time and these characters like those written on paper with invisible ink lie ready to be evolved whenever the organisation is disturbed by certain known or unknown conditions   chapter 2xiv  inheritance continuedfixedness of characterprepotencysexual limitation correspondence of age  fixedness of character apparently not due to antiquity of inheritance prepotency of transmission in individuals of the same family in crossed breeds and species often stronger in one sex than the other sometimes due to the same character being present and visible in one breed and latent in the other inheritance as limited by sex newlyacquired characters in our domesticated animals often transmitted by one sex alone sometimes lost by one sex alone inheritance at corresponding periods of life the importance of the principle with respect to embryology as exhibited in domesticated animals as exhibited in the appearance and disappearance of inherited diseases sometimes supervening earlier in the child than in the parent summary of the three preceding chapters  in the last two chapters the nature and force of inheritance the circumstances which interfere with its power and the tendency to reversion with its many remarkable contingencies were discussed in the present chapter some other related phenomena will be treated of as fully as my materials permit  fixedness of character  it is a general belief amongst breeders that the longer any character has been transmitted by a breed the more fully it will continue to be transmitted i do not wish to dispute the truth of the proposition that inheritance gains strength simply through long continuance but i doubt whether it can be proved in one sense the proposition is little better than a truism if any character has remained constant during many generations it will be likely to continue so if the conditions of life remain the same so again in improving a breed if care be taken for a length of time to exclude all inferior individuals the breed will obviously tend to become truer as it will not have been crossed during many generations by an inferior animal we have previously seen but without being able to assign any cause that when a new character appears it is occasionally from the first constant or fluctuates much or wholly fails to be transmitted so it is with the aggregate of slight differences which characterise a new variety for some propagate their kind from the first much truer than others even with plants multiplied by bulbs layers etc which may in one sense be said to form parts of the same individual it is well known that certain varieties retain and transmit through successive budgenerations their newlyacquired characters more truly than others in none of these nor in the following cases does there appear to be any relation between the force with which a character is transmitted and the length of time during which it has been transmitted some varieties such as white and yellow hyacinths and white sweetpeas transmit their colours more faithfully than do the varieties which have retained their natural colour in the irish family mentioned in the twelfth chapter the peculiar tortoiseshelllike colouring of the eyes was transmitted far more faithfully than any ordinary colour ancon and mauchamp sheep and niata cattle which are all comparatively modern breeds exhibit remarkably strong powers of inheritance many similar cases could be adduced  as all domesticated animals and cultivated plants have varied and yet are descended from aboriginally wild forms which no doubt had retained the same character from an immensely remote epoch we see that scarcely any degree of antiquity ensures a character being transmitted perfectly true in this case however it may be said that changed conditions of life induce certain modifications and not that the power of inheritance fails but in every case of failure some cause either internal or external must interfere it will generally be found that the organs or parts which in our domesticated productions have varied or which still continue to varythat is which fail to retain their former stateare the same with the parts which differ in the natural species of the same genus as on the theory of descent with modification the species of the same genus have been modified since they branched off from a common progenitor it follows that the characters by which they differ from one another have varied whilst other parts of the organisation have remained unchanged and it might be argued that these same characters now vary under domestication or fail to be inherited from their lesser antiquity but variation in a state of nature seems to stand in some close relation with changed conditions of life and characters which have already varied under such conditions would be apt to vary under the still greater changes consequent on domestication independently of their greater or less antiquity  fixedness of character or the strength of inheritance has often been judged of by the preponderance of certain characters in the crossed offspring between distinct races but prepotency of transmission here comes into play and this as we shall immediately see is a very different consideration from the strength or weakness of inheritance 141 see youatt on cattle pages 92 69 78 88 163 and youatt on sheep page 325 also dr lucas lhered nat tome 2 page 310 it has often been observed that breeds of animals inhabiting wild and mountainous countries cannot be permanently modified by our improved breeds and as these latter are of modern origin it has been thought that the greater antiquity of the wilder breeds has been the cause of their resistance to improvement by crossing but it is more probably due to their structure and constitution being better adapted to the surrounding conditions when plants are first subjected to culture it has been found that during several generations they transmit their characters truly that is do not vary and this has been attributed to ancient characters being strongly inherited but it may with equal or greater probability be consequent on changed conditions of life requiring a long time for their cumulative action notwithstanding these considerations it would perhaps be rash to deny that characters become more strongly fixed the longer they are transmitted but i believe that the proposition resolves itself into thisthat characters of all kinds whether new or old tend to be inherited and that those which have already withstood all counteracting influences and been truly transmitted will as a general rule continue to withstand them and consequently be faithfully inherited  prepotency in the transmission of character  when individuals belonging to the same family but distinct enough to be recognised or when two wellmarked races or two species are crossed the usual result as stated in the previous chapter is that the offspring in the first generation are intermediate between their parents or resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in another part but this is by no means the invariable rule for in many cases it is found that certain individuals races and species are prepotent in transmitting their likeness this subject has been ably discussed by prosper lucas 142 hered nat tome 2 pages 112120 but is rendered extremely complex by the prepotency sometimes running equally in both sexes and sometimes more strongly in one sex than in the other it is likewise complicated by the presence of secondary sexual characters which render the comparison of crossed breeds with their parents difficult  it would appear that in certain families some one ancestor and after him others in the same family have had great power in transmitting their likeness through the male line for we cannot otherwise understand how the same features should so often be transmitted after marriages with many females as in the case of the austrian emperors and so it was according to niebuhr with the mental qualities of certain roman families 143 sir h holland chapters on mental physiology 1852 page 234 the famous bull favourite is believed 144 gardeners chronicle 1860 page 270 to have had a prepotent influence on the shorthorn race it has also been observed 145 mr nh smith observations on breeding quoted in encyclop of rural sports page 278 with english racehorses that certain mares have generally transmitted their own character whilst other mares of equally pure blood have allowed the character of the sire to prevail a famous black greyhound bedlamite as i hear from mr cm brown invariably got all his puppies black no matter what was the colour of the bitch but then bedlamite had a preponderance of black in his blood both on the sire and dam side  the truth of the principle of prepotency comes out more clearly when distinct races are crossed the improved shorthorns notwithstanding that the breed is comparatively modern are generally acknowledged to possess great power in impressing their likeness on all other breeds and it is chiefly in consequence of this power that they are so highly valued for exportation 146 quoted by bronn geshichte der natur b 2 s 170 see sturm ueber racen 1825 s 104107 for the niata cattle see my journal of researches 1845 page 146 godine has given a curious case of a ram of a goatlike breed of sheep from the cape of good hope which produced offspring hardly to be distinguished from himself when crossed with ewes of twelve other breeds but two of these halfbred ewes when put to a merino ram produced lambs closely resembling the merino breed girou de buzareingues 147 lucas lheredite nat tome 2 page 112 found that of two races of french sheep the ewes of one when crossed during successive generations with merino rams yielded up their character far sooner than the ewes of the other race sturm and girou have given analogous cases with other breeds of sheep and with cattle the prepotency running in these cases through the male side but i was assured on good authority in south america that when niata cattle are crossed with common cattle though the niata breed is prepotent whether males or females are used yet that the prepotency is strongest through the female line the manx cat is tailless and has long hind legs dr wilson crossed a male manx with common cats and out of twentythree kittens seventeen were destitute of tails but when the female manx was crossed by common male cats all the kittens had tails though they were generally short and imperfect 148 mr orton physiology of breeding 1855 page 9  in making reciprocal crosses between pouter and fantail pigeons the pouter race seemed to be prepotent through both sexes over the fantail but this is probably due to weak power in the fantail rather than to any unusually strong power in the pouter for i have observed that barbs also preponderate over fantails this weakness of transmission in the fantail though the breed is an ancient one is said 149 boitard and corbie les pigeons 1824 page 224 to be general but i have observed one exception to the rule namely in a cross between a fantail and laugher the most curious instance known to me of weak power in both sexes is in the trumpeter pigeon this breed has been well known for at least 130 years it breeds perfectly true as i have been assured by those who have long kept many birds it is characterised by a peculiar tuft of feathers over the beak by a crest on the head by a singular coo quite unlike that of any other breed and by muchfeathered feet i have crossed both sexes with turbits of two subbreeds with almond tumblers spots and runts and reared many mongrels and recrossed them and though the crest on the head and feathered feet were inherited as is generally the case with most breeds i have never seen a vestige of the tuft over the beak or heard the peculiar coo boitard and corbie 1410 les pigeons pages 168 198 assert that this is the invariable result of crossing trumpeters with other breeds neumeister 1411 das ganze etc 1837 s 39 however states that in germany mongrels have been obtained though very rarely which were furnished with the tuft and would trumpet but a pair of these mongrels with a tuft which i imported never trumpeted mr brent states 1412 the pigeon book page 46 that the crossed offspring of a trumpeter were crossed with trumpeters for three generations by which time the mongrels had 78ths of this blood in their veins yet the tuft over the beak did not appear at the fourth generation the tuft appeared but the birds though now having 1516ths trumpeters blood still did not trumpet this case well shows the wide difference between inheritance and prepotency for here we have a well established old race which transmits its characters faithfully but which when crossed with any other race has the feeblest power of transmitting its two chief characteristic qualities  i will give one other instance with fowls and pigeons of weakness and strength in the transmission of the same character to their crossed offspring the silk fowl breeds true and there is reason to believe is a very ancient race but when i reared a large number of mongrels from a silk hen by a spanish cock not one exhibited even a trace of the socalled silkiness mr hewitt also asserts that in no instance are the silky feathers transmitted by this breed when crossed with any other variety but three birds out of many raised by mr orton from a cross between a silk cock and a bantam hen had silky feathers 1413 physiology of breeding page 22 mr hewitt in the poultry book by tegetmeier 1866 page 224 so that it is certain that this breed very seldom has the power of transmitting its peculiar plumage to its crossed progeny on the other hand there is a silk subvariety of the fantail pigeon which has its feathers in nearly the same state as in the silk fowl now we have already seen that fantails when crossed possess singularly weak power in transmitting their general qualities but the silk subvariety when crossed with any other smallsized race invariably transmits its silky feathers 1414 boitard and corbie les pigeons 1824 page 226  the wellknown horticulturist mr paul informs me that he fertilised the black prince hollyhock with pollen of the white globe and the lemonade and black prince hollyhocks reciprocally but not one seedling from these three crosses inherited the black colour of the black prince so again mr laxton who has had such great experience in crossing peas writes to me that whenever a cross has been effected between a whiteblossomed and a purple blossomed pea or between a whiteseeded and a purplespotted brown or maple seeded pea the offspring seems to lose nearly all the characteristics of the whiteflowered and whiteseeded varieties and this result follows whether these varieties have been used as the pollenbearing or seedproducing parents  the law of prepotency comes into action when species are crossed as with races and individuals gartner has unequivocally shown 1415 bastarderzeugung s 256 290 etc naudin nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 149 gives a striking instance of prepotency in datura stramonium when crossed with two other species that this is the case with plants to give one instance when nicotiana paniculata and vincaeflora are crossed the character of n paniculata is almost completely lost in the hybrid but if n quadrivalvis be crossed with n vincaeflora this latter species which was before so prepotent now in its turn almost disappears under the power of n quadrivalvis it is remarkable that the prepotency of one species over another in transmission is quite independent as shown by gartner of the greater or less facility with which the one fertilises the other  with animals the jackal is prepotent over the dog as is stated by flourens who made many crosses between these animals and this was likewise the case with a hybrid which i once saw between a jackal and a terrier i cannot doubt from the observations of colin and others that the ass is prepotent over the horse the prepotency in this instance running more strongly through the male than through the female ass so that the mule resembles the ass more closely than does the hinny 1416 flourens longevite humaine page 144 on crossed jackals with respect to the difference between the mule and the hinny i am aware that this has generally been attributed to the sire and dam transmitting their characters differently but colin who has given in his traite phys comp tome 2 pages 537539 the fullest description which i have met with of these reciprocal hybrids is strongly of opinion that the ass preponderates in both crosses but in an unequal degree this is likewise the conclusion of flourens and of bechstein in his naturgeschichte deutschlands b 1 s 294 the tail of the hinny is much more like that of the horse than is the tail of the mule and this is generally accounted for by the males of both species transmitting with greater power this part of their structure but a compound hybrid which i saw in the zoological gardens from a mare by a hybrid ass zebra closely resembled its mother in its tail the male pheasant judging from mr hewitts descriptions 1417 mr hewitt who has had such great experience in raising these hybrids says poultry book by mr tegetmeier 1866 pages 165167 that in all the head was destitute of wattles comb and earlappets and all closely resembled the pheasant in the shape of the tail and general contour of the body these hybrids were raised from hens of several breeds by a cockpheasant but another hybrid described by mr hewitt was raised from a henpheasant by a silverlaced bantam cock and this possessed a rudimental comb and wattles and from the hybrids which i have seen preponderates over the domestic fowl but the latter as far as colour is concerned has considerable power of transmission for hybrids raised from five differently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage i formerly examined some curious hybrids in the zoological gardens between the penguin variety of the common duck and the egyptian goose anser aegyptiacus and although i will not assert that the domesticated variety preponderated over the natural species yet it had strongly impressed its unnatural upright figure on these hybrids  i am aware that such cases as the foregoing have been ascribed by various authors not to one species race or individual being prepotent over the other in impressing its character on its crossed offspring but to such rules as that the father influences the external characters and the mother the internal or vital organs but the great diversity of the rules given by various authors almost proves their falseness dr prosper lucas has fully discussed this point and has shown 1418 lhered nat tome 2 book 2 chapter 1 that none of the rules and i could add others to those quoted by him apply to all animals similar rules have been announced for plants and have been proved by gartner 1419 bastarderzeugung s 264266 naudin nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 148 has arrived at a similar conclusion to be all erroneous if we confine our view to the domesticated races of a single species or perhaps even to the species of the same genus some such rules may hold good for instance it seems that in reciprocally crossing various breeds of fowls the male generally gives colour 1420 cottage gardener 1856 pages 101 137 but conspicuous exceptions have passed under my own eyes it seems that the ram usually gives its peculiar horns and fleece to its crossed offspring and the bull the presence or absence of horns  in the following chapter on crossing i shall have occasion to show that certain characters are rarely or never blended by crossing but are transmitted in an unmodified state from either parentform i refer to this fact here because it is sometimes accompanied on the one side by prepotency which thus acquires the false appearance of unusual strength in the same chapter i shall show that the rate at which a species or breed absorbs and obliterates another by repeated crosses depends in chief part on prepotency in transmission  in conclusion some of the cases above givenfor instance that of the trumpeter pigeonprove that there is a wide difference between mere inheritance and prepotency this latter power seems to us in our ignorance to act in most cases quite capriciously the very same character even though it be an abnormal or monstrous one such as silky feathers may be transmitted by different species when crossed either with prepotent force or singular feebleness it is obvious that a purelybred form of either sex in all cases in which prepotency does not run more strongly in one sex than the other will transmit its character with prepotent force over a mongrelised and already variable form 1421 see some remarks on this head with respect to sheep by mr wilson in gardeners chronicle 1863 page 15 many striking instances of this result are given by m malingienouel journ r agricult soc volume 14 1853 page 220 with respect to crosses between english and french sheep he found that he obtained the desired influence of the english breeds by crossing intentionally mongrelised french breeds with pure english breeds from several of the abovegiven cases we may conclude that mere antiquity of character does not by any means necessarily make it prepotent in some cases prepotency apparently depends on the same character being present and visible in one of the two breeds which are crossed and latent or invisible in the other breed and in this case it is natural that the character which is potentially present in both breeds should be prepotent thus we have reason to believe that there is a latent tendency in all horses to be duncoloured and striped and when a horse of this kind is crossed with one of any other colour it is said that the offspring are almost sure to be striped sheep have a similar latent tendency to become darkcoloured and we have seen with what prepotent force a ram with a few black spots when crossed with white sheep of various breeds coloured its offspring all pigeons have a latent tendency to become slatyblue with certain characteristic marks and it is known that when a bird thus coloured is crossed with one of any other colour it is most difficult afterwards to eradicate the blue tint a nearly parallel case is offered by those black bantams which as they grow old develop a latent tendency to acquire red feathers but there are exceptions to the rule hornless breeds of cattle possess a latent capacity to reproduce horns yet when crossed with horned breeds they do not invariably produce offspring bearing horns  we meet with analogous cases with plants striped flowers though they can be propagated truly by seed have a latent tendency to become uniformly coloured but when once crossed by a uniformly coloured variety they ever afterwards fail to produce striped seedlings 1422 verlot des varietes 1865 page 66 another case is in some respects more curious plants bearing peloric flowers have so strong a latent tendency to reproduce their normally irregular flowers that this often occurs by buds when a plant is transplanted into poorer or richer soil 1423 moquintandon teratologie page 191 now i crossed the peloric snapdragon antirrhinum majus described in the last chapter with pollen of the common form and the latter reciprocally with peloric pollen i thus raised two great beds of seedlings and not one was peloric naudin 1424 nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 137 obtained the same result from crossing a peloric linaria with the common form i carefully examined the flowers of ninety plants of the crossed antirrhinum in the two beds and their structure had not been in the least affected by the cross except that in a few instances the minute rudiment of the fifth stamen which is always present was more fully or even completely developed it must not be supposed that this entire obliteration of the peloric structure in the crossed plants can be accounted for by any incapacity of transmission for i raised a large bed of plants from the peloric antirrhinum artificially fertilised by its own pollen and sixteen plants which alone survived the winter were all as perfectly peloric as the parentplant here we have a good instance of the wide difference between the inheritance of a character and the power of transmitting it to crossed offspring the crossed plants which perfectly resembled the common snapdragon were allowed to sow themselves and out of a hundred and twentyseven seedlings eightyeight proved to be common snapdragons two were in an intermediate condition between the peloric and normal state and thirtyseven were perfectly peloric having reverted to the structure of their one grandparent this case seems at first sight to offer an exception to the rule just given namely that a character which is present in one form and latent in the other is generally transmitted with prepotent force when the two forms are crossed for in all the scrophulariaceae and especially in the genera antirrhinum and linaria there is as was shown in the last chapter a strong latent tendency to become peloric but there is also as we have seen a still stronger tendency in all peloric plants to reacquire their normal irregular structure so that we have two opposed latent tendencies in the same plants now with the crossed antirrhinums the tendency to produce normal or irregular flowers like those of the common snapdragon prevailed in the first generation whilst the tendency to pelorism appearing to gain strength by the intermission of a generation prevailed to a large extent in the second set of seedlings how it is possible for a character to gain strength by the intermission of a generation will be considered in the chapter on pangenesis  on the whole the subject of prepotency is extremely intricatefrom its varying so much in strength even in regard to the same character in different animalsfrom its running either equally in both sexes or as frequently is the case with animals but not with plants much stronger in one sex than the otherfrom the existence of secondary sexual charactersfrom the transmission of certain characters being limited as we shall immediately see by sexfrom certain characters not blending togetherand perhaps occasionally from the effects of a previous fertilisation on the mother it is therefore not surprising that no one has hitherto succeeded in drawing up general rules on the subject of prepotency  inheritance as limited by sex  new characters often appear in one sex and are afterwards transmitted to the same sex either exclusively or in a much greater degree than to the other this subject is important because with animals of many kinds in a state of nature both high and low in the scale secondary sexual characters not directly connected with the organs of reproduction are conspicuously present with our domesticated animals characters of this kind often differ widely from those distinguishing the two sexes of the parent species and the principle of inheritance as limited by sex explains how this is possible  dr p lucas has shown 1425 lhered nat tome 2 pages 137165 see also mr sedgwicks four memoirs immediately to be referred to that when a peculiarity in no manner connected with the reproductive organs appears in either parent it is often transmitted exclusively to the offspring of the same sex or to a much greater number of them than of the opposite sex thus in the family of lambert the hornlike projections on the skin were transmitted from the father to his sons and grandsons alone so it has been with other cases of ichthyosis with supernumerary digits with a deficiency of digits and phalanges and in a lesser degree with various diseases especially with colourblindness and the haemorrhagic diathesis that is an extreme liability to profuse and uncontrollable bleeding from trifling wounds on the other hand mothers have transmitted during several generations to their daughters alone supernumerary and deficient digits colourblindness and other peculiarities so that the very same peculiarity may become attached to either sex and be long inherited by that sex alone but the attachment in certain cases is much more frequent to one than the other sex the same peculiarities also may be promiscuously transmitted to either sex dr lucas gives other cases showing that the male occasionally transmits his peculiarities to his daughters alone and the mother to her sons alone but even in this case we see that inheritance is to a certain extent though inversely regulated by sex dr lucas after weighing the whole evidence comes to the conclusion that every peculiarity tends to be transmitted in a greater or lesser degree to that sex in which it first appears but a more definite rule as i have elsewhere shown 1426 descent of man 2nd edition page 32 generally holds good namely that variations which first appear in either sex at a late period of life when the reproductive functions are active tend to be developed in that sex alone whilst variations which first appear early in life in either sex are commonly transmitted to both sexes i am however far from supposing that this is the sole determining cause  a few details from the many cases collected by mr sedgwick 1427 on sexual limitation in hereditary diseases brit and for medchirurg review april 1861 page 477 july page 198 april 1863 page 445 and july page 159 also in 1867 on the influence of age in hereditary disease may be here given colourblindness from some unknown cause shows itself much oftener in males than in females in upwards of two hundred cases collected by mr sedgwick ninetenths related to men but it is eminently liable to be transmitted through women in the case given by dr earle members of eight related families were affected during five generations these families consisted of sixtyone individuals namely of thirtytwo males of whom ninesixteenths were incapable of distinguishing colour and of twentynine females of whom only onefifteenth were thus affected although colourblindness thus generally clings to the male sex nevertheless in one instance in which it first appeared in a female it was transmitted during five generations to thirteen individuals all of whom were females the haemorrhagic diathesis often accompanied by rheumatism has been known to affect the males alone during five generations being transmitted however through the females it is said that deficient phalanges in the fingers have been inherited by the females alone during ten generations in another case a man thus deficient in both hands and feet transmitted the peculiarity to his two sons and one daughter but in the third generationout of nineteen grandchildren twelve sons had the family defect whilst the seven daughters were free in ordinary cases of sexual limitation the sons or daughters inherit the peculiarity whatever it may be from their father or mother and transmit it to their children of the same sex but generally with the haemorrhagic diathesis and often with colourblindness and in some other cases the sons never inherit the peculiarity directly from their fathers but the daughters alone transmit the latent tendency so that the sons of the daughters alone exhibit it thus the father grandson and greatgreatgrandson will exhibit a peculiarity the grandmother daughter and greatgranddaughter having transmitted it in a latent state hence we have as mr sedgwick remarks a double kind of atavism or reversion each grandson apparently receiving and developing the peculiarity from his grandfather and each daughter apparently receiving the latent tendency from her grandmother  from the various facts recorded by dr prosper lucas mr sedgwick and others there can be no doubt that peculiarities first appearing in either sex though not in any way necessarily or invariably connected with that sex strongly tend to be inherited by the offspring of the same sex but are often transmitted in a latent state through the opposite sex  turning now to domesticated animals we find that certain characters not proper to the parent species are often confined to and inherited by one sex alone but we do not know the history of the first appearance of such characters in the chapter on sheep we have seen that the males of certain races differ greatly from the females in the shape of their horns these being absent in the ewes of some breeds they differ also in the development of fat in the tail and in the outline of the forehead these differences judging from the character of the allied wild species cannot be accounted for by supposing that they have been derived from distinct parent forms there is also a great difference between the horns of the two sexes in one indian breed of goats the bull zebu is said to have a larger hump than the cow in the scotch deerhound the two sexes differ in size more than in any other variety of the dog 1428 w scrope art of deer stalking page 354 and judging from analogy more than in the aboriginal parentspecies the peculiar colour called tortoiseshell is very rarely seen in a male cat the males of this variety being of a rusty tint  in various breeds of the fowl the males and females often differ greatly and these differences are far from being the same with those which distinguish the two sexes of the parentspecies the gallus bankiva and consequently have originated under domestication in certain subvarieties of the game race we have the unusual case of the hens differing from each other more than the cocks in an indian breed of a white colour shaded with black the hens invariably have black skins and their bones are covered by a black periosteum whilst the cocks are never or most rarely thus characterised pigeons offer a more interesting case for throughout the whole great family the two sexes do not often differ much and the males and females of the parentform the c livia are undistinguishable yet we have seen that with pouters the male has the characteristic quality of pouting more strongly developed than the female and in certain subvarieties the males alone are spotted or striated with black or otherwise differ in colour when male and female english carrierpigeons are exhibited in separate pens the difference in the development of the wattle over the beak and round the eyes is conspicuous so that here we have instances of the appearance of secondary sexual characters in the domesticated races of a species in which such differences are naturally quite absent  on the other hand secondary sexual characters which belong to the species in a state of nature are sometimes quite lost or greatly diminished under domestication we see this in the small size of the tusks in our improved breeds of the pig in comparison with those of the wild boar there are sub breeds of fowls in which the males have lost the fineflowing tailfeathers and hackles and others in which there is no difference in colour between the two sexes in some cases the barred plumage which in gallinaceous birds is commonly the attribute of the hen has been transferred to the cock as in the cuckoo subbreeds in other cases masculine characters have been partly transferred to the female as with the splendid plumage of the goldenspangled hamburgh hen the enlarged comb of the spanish hen the pugnacious disposition of the game hen and as in the welldeveloped spurs which occasionally appear in the hens of various breeds in polish fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot that of the male being formed of hacklelike feathers and this is a new male character in the genus gallus on the whole as far as i can judge new characters are more apt to appear in the males of our domesticated animals than in the females 1429 i have given in my descent of man 2nd edition page 223 sufficient evidence that male animals are usually more variable than the females and afterwards to be inherited exclusively or more strongly by the males finally in accordance with the principle of inheritance as limited by sex the preservation and augmentation of secondary sexual characters in natural species offers no especial difficulty as this would follow through that form of selection which i have called sexual selection  inheritance at corresponding periods of life  this is an important subject since the publication of my origin of species i have seen no reason to doubt the truth of the explanation there given of one of the most remarkable facts in biology namely the difference between the embryo and the adult animal the explanation is that variations do not necessarily or generally occur at a very early period of embryonic growth and that such variations are inherited at a corresponding age as a consequence of this the embryo even after the parentform has undergone great modification is left only slightly modified and the embryos of widelydifferent animals which are descended from a common progenitor remain in many important respects like one another and probably like their common progenitor we can thus understand why embryology throws a flood of light on the natural system of classification as this ought to be as far as possible genealogical when the embryo leads an independent life that is becomes a larva it has to be adapted to the surrounding conditions in its structure and instincts independently of those of its parents and the principle of inheritance at corresponding periods of life renders this possible  this principle is indeed in one way so obvious that it escapes attention we possess a number of races of animals and plants which when compared with one another and with their parentforms present conspicuous differences both in their immature and mature states look at the seeds of the several kinds of peas beans maize which can be propagated truly and see how they differ in size colour and shape whilst the fullgrown plants differ but little cabbages on the other hand differ greatly in foliage and manner of growth but hardly at all in their seeds and generally it will be found that the differences between cultivated plants at different periods of growth are not necessarily closely connected together for plants may differ much in their seeds and little when fullgrown and conversely may yield seeds hardly distinguishable yet differ much when fullgrown in the several breeds of poultry descended from a single species differences in the eggs and chickens whilst covered with down in the plumage at the first and subsequent moults as well as in the comb and wattles are all inherited with man peculiarities in the milk and second teeth of which i have received the details are inheritable and longevity is often transmitted so again with our improved breeds of cattle and sheep early maturity including the early development of the teeth and with certain breeds of fowl the early appearance of secondary sexual characters all come under the same head of inheritance at corresponding periods  numerous analogous facts could be given the silkmoth perhaps offers the best instance for in the breeds which transmit their characters truly the eggs differ in size colour and shape the caterpillars differ in moulting three or four times in colour even in having a darkcoloured mark like an eyebrow and in the loss of certain instinctsthe cocoons differ in size shape and in the colour and quality of the silk these several differences being followed by slight or barely distinguishable differences in the mature moth  but it may be said that if in the above cases a new peculiarity is inherited it must be at the corresponding stage of development for an egg or seed can resemble only an egg or seed and the horn in a fullgrown ox can resemble only a horn the following cases show inheritance at corresponding periods more plainly because they refer to peculiarities which might have supervened as far as we can see earlier or later in life yet are inherited at the same period at which they first appeared  in the lambert family the porcupinelike excrescences appeared in the father and sons at the same age namely about nine weeks after birth 1430 prichard phys hist of mankind 1851 volume 1 page 349 in the extraordinary hairy family described by mr crawfurd 1431 embassy to the court of ava volume 1 page 320 the third generation is described by capt yule in his narrative of the mission to the court of ava 1855 page 94 children were produced during three generations with hairy ears in the father the hair began to grow over his body at six years old in his daughter somewhat earlier namely at one year and in both generations the milk teeth appeared late in life the permanent teeth being afterwards singularly deficient greyness of hair at an unusually early age has been transmitted in some families these cases border on diseases inherited at corresponding periods of life to which i shall immediately refer  it is a wellknown peculiarity with almondtumbler pigeons that the full beauty and peculiar character of the plumage does not appear until the bird has moulted two or three times neumeister describes and figures a brace of pigeons in which the whole body is white except the breast neck and head but in their first plumage all the white feathers have coloured edges another breed is more remarkable its first plumage is black with rustyred wingbars and a crescentshaped mark on the breast these marks then become white and remain so during three or four moults but after this period the white spreads over the body and the bird loses its beauty 1432 das ganze der taubenzucht 1837 s 24 tab 4 figure 2 s 21 tab 1 figure 4 prize canary birds have their wings and tail black this colour however is only retained until the first moult so that they must be exhibited ere the change takes place once moulted the peculiarity has ceased of course all the birds emanating from this stock have black wings and tails the first year 1433 kidd treatise on the canary page 18 a curious and somewhat analogous account has been given 1434 charlesworth mag of nat hist volume 1 1837 page 167 of a family of wild pied rooks which were first observed in 1798 near chalfont and which every year from that date up to the period of the published notice viz 1837 have several of their brood particoloured black and white this variegation of the plumage however disappears with the first moult but among the next young families there are always a few pied ones these changes of plumage which are inherited at various corresponding periods of life in the pigeon canarybird and rook are remarkable because the parentspecies passes through no such change  inherited diseases afford evidence in some respects of less value than the foregoing cases because diseases are not necessarily connected with any change in structure but in other respects of more value because the periods have been more carefully observed certain diseases are communicated to the child apparently by a process like inoculation and the child is from the first affected such cases may be here passed over large classes of diseases usually appear at certain ages such as st vituss dance in youth consumption in early midlife gout later and apoplexy still later and these are naturally inherited at the same period but even in diseases of this class instances have been recorded as with st vituss dance showing that an unusually early or late tendency to the disease is inheritable 1435 dr prosper lucas hered nat tome 2 page 713 in most cases the appearance of any inherited disease is largely determined by certain critical periods in each persons life as well as by unfavourable conditions there are many other diseases which are not attached to any particular period but which certainly tend to appear in the child at about the same age at which the parent was first attacked an array of high authorities ancient and modern could be given in support of this proposition the illustrious hunter believed in it and piorry 1436 lhered dans les maladies 1840 page 135 for hunter see harlan med researches page 530 cautions the physician to look closely to the child at the period when any grave inheritable disease attacked the parent dr prosper lucas 1437 lhered nat tome 2 page 850 after collecting facts from every source asserts that affections of all kinds though not related to any particular period of life tend to reappear in the offspring at whatever period of life they first appeared in the progenitor  as the subject is important it may be well to give a few instances simply as illustrations not as proof for proof recourse must be had to the authorities above quoted some of the following cases have been selected for the sake of showing that when a slight departure from the rule occurs the child is affected somewhat earlier in life than the parent in the family of le compte blindness was inherited through three generations and no less than twentyseven children and grandchildren were all affected at about the same age their blindness in general began to advance about the fifteenth or sixteenth year and ended in total deprivation of sight at the age of about twentytwo 1438 sedgwick brit and for medchirurg review april 1861 page 485 in some accounts the number of children and grandchildren is given as 37 but this seems to be an error judging from the paper first published in the baltimore med and phys reg 1809 of which mr sedgwick has been so kind as to send me a copy in another case a father and his four children all became blind at twentyone years old in another a grandmother grew blind at thirtyfive her daughter at nineteen and three grandchildren at the ages of thirteen and eleven 1439 prosper lucas hered nat tome 1 page 400 so with deafness two brothers their father and paternal grandfather all became deaf at the age of forty 1440 sedgwick ibid july 1861 page 202  esquirol gives several striking instances of insanity coming on at the same age as that of a grandfather father and son who all committed suicide near their fiftieth year many other cases could be given as of a whole family who became insane at the age of forty 1441 piorry page 109 prosper lucas tome 2 page 759 other cerebral affections sometimes follow the same rulefor instance epilepsy and apoplexy a woman died of the latter disease when sixtythree years old one of her daughters at fortythree and the other at sixtyseven the latter had twelve children who all died from tubercular meningitis 1442 prosper lucas tome 2 page 748 i mention this latter case because it illustrates a frequent occurrence namely a change in the precise nature of an inherited disease though still affecting the same organ  asthma has attacked several members of the same family when forty years old and other families during infancy the most different diseases such as angina pectoris stone in the bladder and various affections of the skin have appeared in successive generations at nearly the same age the little finger of a man began from some unknown cause to grow inwards and the same finger in his two sons began at the same age to bend inwards in a similar manner strange and inexplicable neuralgic affections have caused parents and children to suffer agonies at about the same period of life 1443 prosper lucas tome 3 pages 678 700 702 sedgwick ibid april 1863 page 449 and july 1863 page 162 dr j steinan essay on hereditary disease 1843 pages 27 34  i will give only two other cases which are interesting as illustrating the disappearance as well as the appearance of disease at the same age two brothers their father their paternal uncles seven cousins and their paternal grandfather were all similarly affected by a skindisease called pityriasis versicolor the disease strictly limited to the males of the family though transmitted through the females usually appeared at puberty and disappeared at about the age of forty or fortyfive years the second case is that of four brothers who when about twelve years old suffered almost every week from severe headaches which were relieved only by a recumbent position in a dark room their father paternal uncles paternal grandfather and granduncles all suffered in the same way from headaches which ceased at the age of fiftyfour or fiftyfive in all those who lived so long none of the females of the family were affected 1444 these cases are given by mr sedgwick on the authority of dr h stewart in medchirurg review april 1863 pages 449 477  it is impossible to read the foregoing accounts and the many others which have been recorded of diseases coming on during three or even more generations in several members of the same family at the same age especially in the case of rare affections in which the coincidence cannot be attributed to chance and to doubt that there is a strong tendency to inheritance in disease at corresponding periods of life when the rule fails the disease is apt to come on earlier in the child than in the parent the exceptions in the other direction being very much rarer dr lucas 1445 hered nat tome 2 page 852 alludes to several cases of inherited diseases coming on at an earlier period i have already given one striking instance with blindness during three generations and mr bowman remarks that this frequently occurs with cataract with cancer there seems to be a peculiar liability to earlier inheritance sir j paget who has particularly attended to this subject and tabulated a large number of cases informs me that he believes that in nine cases out of ten the later generation suffers from the disease at an earlier period than the previous generation he adds in the instances in which the opposite relation holds and the members of later generations have cancer at a later age than their predecessors i think it will be found that the non cancerous parents have lived to extreme old ages so that the longevity of a nonaffected parent seems to have the power of influencing the fatal period in the offspring and we thus apparently get another element of complexity in inheritance  the facts showing that with certain diseases the period of inheritance occasionally or even frequently advances are important with respect to the general descenttheory for they render it probable that the same thing would occur with ordinary modifications of structure the final result of a long series of such advances would be the gradual obliteration of characters proper to the embryo and larva which would thus come to resemble more and more closely the mature parentform but any structure which was of service to the embryo or larva would be preserved by the destruction at this stage of growth of each individual which manifested any tendency to lose its proper character at too early an age  finally from the numerous races of cultivated plants and domestic animals in which the seeds or eggs the young or old differ from one another and from those of the parentspeciesfrom the cases in which new characters have appeared at a particular period and afterwards been inherited at the same periodand from what we know with respect to disease we must believe in the truth of the great principle of inheritance at corresponding periods of life  summary of the three preceding chapters  strong as is the force of inheritance it allows the incessant appearance of new characters these whether beneficial or injuriousof the most trifling importance such as a shade of colour in a flower a coloured lock of hair or a mere gestureor of the highest importance as when affecting the brain or an organ so perfect and complex as the eyeor of so grave a nature as to deserve to be called a monstrosityor so peculiar as not to occur normally in any member of the same natural classare often inherited by man by the lower animals and plants in numberless cases it suffices for the inheritance of a peculiarity that one parent alone should be thus characterised inequalities in the two sides of the body though opposed to the law of symmetry may be transmitted there is ample evidence that the effects of mutilations and of accidents especially or perhaps exclusively when followed by disease are occasionally inherited there can be no doubt that the evil effects of the longcontinued exposure of the parent to injurious conditions are sometimes transmitted to the offspring so it is as we shall see in a future chapter with the effects of the use and disuse of parts and of mental habits periodical habits are likewise transmitted but generally as it would appear with little force  hence we are led to look at inheritance as the rule and noninheritance as the anomaly but this power often appears to us in our ignorance to act capriciously transmitting a character with inexplicable strength or feebleness the very same peculiarity as the weeping habit of trees silky feathers etc may be inherited either firmly or not at all by different members of the same group and even by different individuals of the same species though treated in the same manner in this latter case we see that the power of transmission is a quality which is merely individual in its attachment as with single characters so it is with the several concurrent slight differences which distinguish subvarieties or races for of these some can be propagated almost as truly as species whilst others cannot be relied on the same rule holds good with plants when propagated by bulbs offsets etc which in one sense still form parts of the same individual for some varieties retain or inherit through successive budgenerations their character far more truly than others  some characters not proper to the parentspecies have certainly been inherited from an extremely remote epoch and may therefore be considered as firmly fixed but it is doubtful whether length of inheritance in itself gives fixedness of character though the chances are obviously in favour of any character which has long been transmitted true or unaltered still being transmitted true as long as the conditions of life remain the same we know that many species after having retained the same character for countless ages whilst living under their natural conditions when domesticated have varied in the most diversified manner that is have failed to transmit their original form so that no character appears to be absolutely fixed we can sometimes account for the failure of inheritance by the conditions of life being opposed to the development of certain characters and still oftener as with plants cultivated by grafts and buds by the conditions causing new and slight modifications incessantly to appear in this latter case it is not that inheritance wholly fails but that new characters are continually superadded in some few cases in which both parents are similarly characterised inheritance seems to gain so much force by the combined action of the two parents that it counteracts its own power and a new modification is the result  in many cases the failure of the parents to transmit their likeness is due to the breed having been at some former period crossed and the child takes after his grandparent or more remote ancestor of foreign blood in other cases in which the breed has not been crossed but some ancient character has been lost through variation it occasionally reappears through reversion so that the parents apparently fail to transmit their own likeness in all cases however we may safely conclude that the child inherits all its characters from its parents in whom certain characters are latent like the secondary sexual characters of one sex in the other when after a long succession of bud generations a flower or fruit becomes separated into distinct segments having the colours or other attributes of both parentforms we cannot doubt that these characters were latent in the earlier buds though they could not then be detected or could be detected only in an intimately commingled state so it is with animals of crossed parentage which with advancing years occasionally exhibit characters derived from one of their two parents of which not a trace could at first be perceived certain monstrosities which resemble what naturalists call the typical form of the group in question apparently come under the same law of reversion it is assuredly an astonishing fact that the male and female sexual elements that buds and even fullgrown animals should retain characters during several generations in the case of crossed breeds and during thousands of generations in the case of pure breeds written as it were in invisible ink yet ready at any time to be evolved under certain conditions  what these conditions precisely are we do not know but any cause which disturbs the organisation or constitution seems to be sufficient a cross certainly gives a strong tendency to the reappearance of longlost characters both corporeal and mental in the case of plants this tendency is much stronger with those species which have been crossed after long cultivation and which therefore have had their constitutions disturbed by this cause as well as by crossing than with species which have always lived under their natural conditions and have then been crossed a return also of domesticated animals and cultivated plants to a wild state favours reversion but the tendency under these circumstances has been much exaggerated  when individuals of the same family which differ somewhat and when races or species are crossed the one is often prepotent over the other in transmitting its character a race may possess a strong power of inheritance and yet when crossed as we have seen with trumpeterpigeons yield to the prepotency of every other race prepotency of transmission may be equal in the two sexes of the same species but often runs more strongly in one sex it plays an important part in determining the rate at which one race can be modified or wholly absorbed by repeated crosses with another we can seldom tell what makes one race or species prepotent over another but it sometimes depends on the same character being present and visible in one parent and latent or potentially present in the other  characters may first appear in either sex but oftener in the male than in the female and afterwards be transmitted to the offspring of the same sex in this case we may feel confident that the peculiarity in question is really present though latent in the opposite sex hence the father may transmit through his daughter any character to his grandson and the mother conversely to her granddaughter we thus learn and the fact is an important one that transmission and development are distinct powers occasionally these two powers seem to be antagonistic or incapable of combination in the same individual for several cases have been recorded in which the son has not directly inherited a character from his father or directly transmitted it to his son but has received it by transmission through his nonaffected mother and transmitted it through his nonaffected daughter owing to inheritance being limited by sex we see how secondary sexual characters may have arisen under nature their preservation and accumulation being dependent on their service to either sex  at whatever period of life a new character first appears it generally remains latent in the offspring until a corresponding age is attained and then is developed when this rule fails the child generally exhibits the character at an earlier period than the parent on this principle of inheritance at corresponding periods we can understand how it is that most animals display from the germ to maturity such a marvellous succession of characters  finally though much remains obscure with respect to inheritance we may look at the following laws as fairly well established  firstly a tendency in every character new and old to be transmitted by seminal and bud generation though often counteracted by various known and unknown causes  secondly reversion or atavism which depends on transmission and development being distinct powers it acts in various degrees and manners through both seminal and bud generation  thirdly prepotency of transmission which may be confined to one sex or be common to both sexes  fourthly transmission as limited by sex generally to the same sex in which the inherited character first appeared and this in many probably most cases depends on the new character having first appeared at a rather late period of life  fifthly inheritance at corresponding periods of life with some tendency to the earlier development of the inherited character  in these laws of inheritance as displayed under domestication we see an ample provision for the production through variability and natural selection of new specific forms   chapter 2xv  on crossing  free intercrossing obliterates the differences between allied breeds when the numbers of two commingling breeds are unequal one absorbs the other the rate of absorption determined by prepotency of transmission by the conditions of life and by natural selection all organic beings occasionally intercross apparent exceptions on certain characters incapable of fusion chiefly or exclusively those which have suddenly appeared in the individual on the modification of old races and the formation of new races by crossing some crossed races have bred true from their first production on the crossing of distinct species in relation to the formation of domestic races  in the two previous chapters when discussing reversion and prepotency i was necessarily led to give many facts on crossing in the present chapter i shall consider the part which crossing plays in two opposed directionsfirstly in obliterating characters and consequently in preventing the formation of new races and secondly in the modification of old races or in the formation of new and intermediate races by a combination of characters i shall also show that certain characters are incapable of fusion  the effects of free or uncontrolled breeding between the members of the same variety or of closely allied varieties are important but are so obvious that they need not be discussed at much length it is free intercrossing which chiefly gives uniformity both under nature and under domestication to the individuals of the same species or variety when they live mingled together and are not exposed to any cause inducing excessive variability the prevention of free crossing and the intentional matching of individual animals are the cornerstones of the breeders art no man in his senses would expect to improve or modify a breed in any particular manner or keep an old breed true and distinct unless he separated his animals the killing of inferior animals in each generation comes to the same thing as their separation in savage and semicivilised countries where the inhabitants have not the means of separating their animals more than a single breed of the same species rarely or never exists in former times even in the united states there were no distinct races of sheep for all had been mingled together 151 communications to the board of agriculture volume 1 page 367 the celebrated agriculturist marshall 152 review of reports north of england 1808 page 200 remarks that sheep that are kept within fences as well as shepherded flocks in open countries have generally a similarity if not a uniformity of character in the individuals of each flock for they breed freely together and are prevented from crossing with other kinds whereas in the unenclosed parts of england the unshepherded sheep even of the same flock are far from true or uniform owing to various breeds having mingled and crossed we have seen that the halfwild cattle in each of the several british parks are nearly uniform in character but in the different parks from not having mingled and crossed during many generations they differ to a certain small extent  we cannot doubt that the extraordinary number of varieties and subvarieties of the pigeon amounting to at least one hundred and fifty is partly due to their remaining differently from other domesticated birds paired for life once matched on the other hand breeds of cats imported into this country soon disappear for their nocturnal and rambling habits render it hardly possible to prevent free crossing rengger 153

peculiar character but near the capital this change has been prevented owing as he asserts to the native animal frequently crossing with cats imported from europe in all cases like the foregoing the effects of an occasional cross will be augmented by the increased vigour and fertility of the crossed offspring of which fact evidence will hereafter be given for this will lead to the mongrels increasing more rapidly than the pure parentbreeds  when distinct breeds are allowed to cross freely the result will be a heterogeneous body for instance the dogs in paraguay are far from uniform and can no longer be affiliated to their parentraces 154 rengger saugethiere etc s 154 the character which a crossed body of animals will ultimately assume must depend on several contingenciesnamely on the relative members of the individuals belonging to the two or more races which are allowed to mingle on the prepotency of one race over the other in the transmission of character and on the conditions of life to which they are exposed when two commingled breeds exist at first in nearly equal numbers the whole will sooner or later become intimately blended but not so soon both breeds being equally favoured in all respects as might have been expected the following calculation 155 white regular gradation in man page 146 shows that this is the case if a colony with an equal number of black and white men were founded and we assume that they marry indiscriminately are equally prolific and that one in thirty annually dies and is born then in 65 years the number of blacks whites and mulattoes would be equal in 91 years the whites would be 110th the blacks 110th and the mulattoes or people of intermediate degrees of colour 810ths of the whole number in three centuries not 1100th part of the whites would exist  when one of two mingled races exceed the other greatly in number the latter will soon be wholly or almost wholly absorbed and lost 156 dr wf edwards in his caracteres physiolog des races humaines page 24 first called attention to this subject and ably discussed it thus european pigs and dogs have been largely introduced in the islands of the pacific ocean and the native races have been absorbed and lost in the course of about fifty or sixty years 157 rev d tyerman and bennett journal of voyages 18211829 volume 1 page 300 but the imported races no doubt were favoured rats may be considered as semidomesticated animals some snakerats mus alexandrinus escaped in the zoological gardens of london and for a long time afterwards the keepers frequently caught crossbred rats at first halfbreds afterwards with less of the character of the snakerat till at length all traces of it disappeared 158 mr sj salter journal linn soc volume 6 1862 page 71 on the other hand in some parts of london especially near the docks where fresh rats are frequently imported an endless variety of intermediate forms may be found between the brown black and snake rat which are all three usually ranked as distinct species  how many generations are necessary for one species or race to absorb another by repeated crosses has often been discussed 159 sturm ueber racen etc 1825 s 107 bronn geschichte der natur b 2 s 170 gives a table of the proportions of blood after successive crosses dr p lucas lheredite nat tome 2 page 308 and the requisite number has probably been much exaggerated some writers have maintained that a dozen or score or even more generations are necessary but this in itself is improbable for in the tenth generation there would be only 11024th part of foreign blood in the offspring gartner found 1510 bastarderzeugung s 463 470 that with plants one species could be made to absorb another in from three to five generations and he believes that this could always be effected in from six to seven generations in one instance however kolreuter 1511 nova acta petrop 1794 page 393 see also previous volume speaks of the offspring of mirabilis vulgaris crossed during eight successive generations by m longiflora as resembling this latter species so closely that the most scrupulous observer could detect vix aliquam notabilem differentiam or as he says he succeeded ad plenariam fere transmutationem but this expression shows that the act of absorption was not even then absolutely complete though these crossed plants contained only the 1256th part of m vulgaris the conclusions of such accurate observers as gartner and kolreuter are of far higher worth than those made without scientific aim by breeders the most precise account which i have met with is given by stonehenge 1512 the dog 1867 pages 179184 and is illustrated by photographs mr hanley crossed a greyhound bitch with a bulldog the offspring in each succeeding generation being recrossed with firstrate greyhounds as stonehenge remarks it might naturally be supposed that it would take several crosses to get rid of the heavy form of the bulldog but hysterics the grgrgranddaughter of a bulldog showed no trace whatever of this breed in external form she and all of the same litter however were remarkably deficient in stoutness though fast as well as clever i believe clever refers to skill in turning hysterics was put to a son of bedlamite but the result of the fifth cross is not as yet i believe more satisfactory than that of the fourth on the other hand with sheep fleischmann 1513 as quoted in the true principles of breeding by ch macknight and dr h madden 1865 page 11 shows how persistent the effects of a single cross may be he says that the original coarse sheep of germany have 5500 fibres of wool on a square inch grades of the third or fourth merino cross produced about 8000 the twentieth cross 27000 the perfect pure merino blood 40000 to 48000 so that common german sheep crossed twenty times successively with merino did not by any means acquire wool as fine as that of the pure breed but in all cases the rate of absorption will depend largely on the conditions of life being favourable to any particular character and we may suspect that there would be a constant tendency to degeneration in the wool of merinos under the climate of germany unless prevented by careful selection and thus perhaps the foregoing remarkable case may be explained the rate of absorption must also depend on the amount of distinguishable difference between the two forms which are crossed and especially as gartner insists on prepotency of transmission in the one form over the other we have seen in the last chapter that one of two french breeds of sheep yielded up its character when crossed with merinos very much more slowly than the other and the common german sheep referred to by fleischmann may be in this respect analogous in all cases there will be more or less liability to reversion during many subsequent generations and it is this fact which has probably led authors to maintain that a score or more of generations are requisite for one race to absorb another in considering the final result of the commingling of two or more breeds we must not forget that the act of crossing in itself tends to bring back longlost characters not proper to the immediate parentforms  with respect to the influence of the conditions of life on any two breeds which are allowed to cross freely unless both are indigenous and have long been accustomed to the country where they live they will in all probability be unequally affected by the conditions and this will modify the result even with indigenous breeds it will rarely or never occur that both are equally well adapted to the surrounding circumstances more especially when permitted to roam freely and not carefully tended as is generally the case with breeds allowed to cross as a consequence of this natural selection will to a certain extent come into action and the best fitted will survive and this will aid in determining the ultimate character of the commingled body  how long a time it would require before such a crossed body of animals would assume a uniform character within a limited area no one can say that they would ultimately become uniform from free intercrossing and from the survival of the fittest we may feel assured but the characters thus acquired would rarely or never as may be inferred from the previous considerations be exactly intermediate between those of the two parentbreeds with respect to the very slight differences by which the individuals of the same subvariety or even of allied varieties are characterised it is obvious that free crossing would soon obliterate such small distinctions the formation of new varieties independently of selection would also thus be prevented except when the same variation continually recurred from the action of some strongly predisposing cause we may therefore conclude that free crossing has in all cases played an important part in giving uniformity of character to all the members of the same domestic race and of the same natural species though largely governed by natural selection and by the direct action of the surrounding conditions  on the possibility of all organic beings occasionally intercrossing  but it may be asked can free crossing occur with hermaphrodite animals and plants all the higher animals and the few insects which have been domesticated have separate sexes and must inevitably unite for each birth with respect to the crossing of hermaphrodites the subject is too large for the present volume but in the origin of species i have given a short abstract of the reasons which induce me to believe that all organic beings occasionally cross though perhaps in some cases only at long intervals of time 1514 with respect to plants an admirable essay on this subject die geschlechtervertheilung bei den pflanzen 1867 has been published by dr hildebrand who arrives at the same general conclusions as i have done various other treatises have since appeared on the same subject more especially by hermann muller and delpino i will merely recall the fact that many plants though hermaphrodite in structure are unisexual in functionsuch as those called by ck sprengel dichogamous in which the pollen and stigma of the same flower are matured at different periods or those called by me reciprocally dimorphic in which the flowers own pollen is not fitted to fertilise its own stigma or again the many kinds in which curious mechanical contrivances exist effectually preventing selffertilisation there are however many hermaphrodite plants which are not in any way specially constructed to favour intercrossing but which nevertheless commingle almost as freely as animals with separated sexes this is the case with cabbages radishes and onions as i know from having experimented on them even the peasants of liguria say that cabbages must be prevented from falling in love with each other in the orange tribe gallesio 1515 teoria della riproduzione vegetal 1816 page 12 remarks that the amelioration of the various kinds is checked by their continual and almost regular crossing so it is with numerous other plants  on the other hand some cultivated plants rarely or never intercross for instance the common pea and sweetpea lathyrus odoratus yet their flowers are certainly adapted for cross fertilisation the varieties of the tomato and aubergine solanum and the pimenta pimenta vulgaris are said 1516 verlot des varietes 1865 page 72 never to cross even when growing alongside one another but it should be observed that these are all exotic plants and we do not know how they would behave in their native country when visited by the proper insects with respect to the common pea i have ascertained that it is rarely crossed in this country owing to premature fertilisation there exist however some plants which under their natural conditions appear to be always selffertilised such as the bee ophrys ophrys apifera and a few other orchids yet these plants exhibit the plainest adaptations for crossfertilisation again some few plants are believed to produce only closed flowers called cleistogene which cannot possibly be crossed this was long thought to be the case with the leersia oryzoides 1517 duval jouve bull soc bot de france tome 10 1863 page 194 with respect to the perfect flowers setting seed see dr ascherson in bot zeitung 1864 page 350 but this grass is now known occasionally to produce perfect flowers which set seed  although some plants both indigenous and naturalised rarely or never produce flowers or if they flower never produce seeds yet no one doubts that phanerogamic plants are adapted to produce flowers and the flowers to produce seed when they fail we believe that such plants under different conditions would perform their proper function or that they formerly did so and will do so again on analogous grounds i believe that the flowers in the above specified anomalous cases which do not now intercross either would do so occasionally under different conditions or that they formerly did sothe means for affecting this being generally still retainedand will again intercross at some future period unless indeed they become extinct on this view alone many points in the structure and action of the reproductive organs in hermaphrodite plants and animals are intelligiblefor instance the fact of the male and female organs never being so completely enclosed as to render access from without impossible hence we may conclude that the most important of all the means for giving uniformity to the individuals of the same species namely the capacity of occasionally intercrossing is present or has been formerly present with all organic beings except perhaps some of the lowest  on certain characters not blending  when two breeds are crossed their characters usually become intimately fused together but some characters refuse to blend and are transmitted in an unmodified state either from both parents or from one when grey and white mice are paired the young are piebald or pure white or grey but not of an intermediate tint so it is when white and common collared turtledoves are paired in breeding game fowls a great authority mr j douglas remarks i may here state a strange fact if you cross a black with a white game you get birds of both breeds of the clearest colour sir r heron crossed during many years white black brown and fawncoloured angora rabbits and never once got these colours mingled in the same animal but often all four colours in the same litter 1518 extract of a letter from sir r heron 1838 given me by mr yarrell with respect to mice see annal des sc nat tome 1 page 180 and i have heard of other similar cases for turtledoves boitard and corbie les pigeons etc page 238 for the game fowl the poultry book 1866 page 128 for crosses of tailless fowls see bechstein naturges deutsch b 3 s 403 bronn geschichte der natur b 2 s 170 gives analogous facts with horses on the hairless condition of crossed south american dogs see rengger saugethiere von paraguay s 152 but i saw in the zoological gardens mongrels from a similar cross which were hairless quite hairy or hairy in patches that is piebald with hair for crosses of dorking and other fowls see poultry chronicle volume 2 page 355 about the crossed pigs extract of letter from sir r heron to mr yarrell for other cases see p lucas lhered nat tome 1 page 212 from cases like these in which the colours of the two parents are transmitted quite separately to the offspring we have all sorts of gradations leading to complete fusion i will give an instance a gentleman with a fair complexion light hair but dark eyes married a lady with dark hair and complexion their three children have very light hair but on careful search about a dozen black hairs were found scattered in the midst of the light hair on the heads of all three  when turnspit dogs and ancon sheep both of which have dwarfed limbs are crossed with common breeds the offspring are not intermediate in structure but take after either parent when tailless or hornless animals are crossed with perfect animals it frequently but by no means invariably happens that the offspring are either furnished with these organs in a perfect state or are quite destitute of them according to rengger the hairless condition of the paraguay dog is either perfectly or not at all transmitted to its mongrel offspring but i have seen one partial exception in a dog of this parentage which had part of its skin hairy and part naked the parts being distinctly separated as in a piebald animal when dorking fowls with five toes are crossed with other breeds the chickens often have five toes on one foot and four on the other some crossed pigs raised by sir r heron between the solid hoofed and common pig had not all four feet in an intermediate condition but two feet were furnished with properly divided and two with united hoofs  analogous facts have been observed with plants major trevor clarke crossed the little glabrousleaved annual stock matthiola with pollen of a large redflowered roughleaved biennial stock called cocardeau by the french and the result was that half the seedlings had glabrous and the other half rough leaves but none had leaves in an intermediate state that the glabrous seedlings were the product of the roughleaved variety and not accidentally of the motherplants own pollen was shown by their tall and strong habit of growth 1519 internat hort and bot congress of london 1866 in the succeeding generations raised from the roughleaved crossed seedlings some glabrous plants appeared showing that the glabrous character though incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves was all the time latent in this family of plants the numerous plants formerly referred to which i raised from reciprocal crosses between the peloric and common antirrhinum offer a nearly parallel case for in the first generation all the plants resembled the common form and in the next generation out of one hundred and thirtyseven plants two alone were in an intermediate condition the others perfectly resembling either the peloric or common form major trevor clarke also fertilised the abovementioned redflowered stock with pollen from the purple queen stock and about half the seedlings scarcely differed in habit and not at all in the red colour of the flower from the motherplant the other half bearing blossoms of a rich purple closely like those of the paternal plant gartner crossed many white and yellowflowered species and varieties of verbascum and these colours were never blended but the offspring bore either pure white or pure yellow blossoms the former in the larger proportion 1520 bastarderzeugung s 307 kolreuter dritte fortsetszung s 34 39 however obtained intermediate tints from similar crosses in the genus verbascum with respect to the turnips see herbert amaryllidaceae 1837 page 370 dr herbert raised many seedlings as he informed me from swedish turnips crossed by two other varieties and these never produced flowers of an intermediate tint but always like one of their parents i fertilised the purple sweetpea lathyrus odoratus which has a dark reddishpurple standardpetal and violetcoloured wings and keel with pollen of the painted lady sweetpea which has a pale cherrycoloured standard and almost white wings and keel and from the same pod i twice raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts the greater number resembling the father so perfect was the resemblance that i should have thought there had been some mistake if the plants which were at first identical with the paternal variety namely the paintedlady had not later in the season produced as mentioned in a former chapter flowers blotched and streaked with dark purple i raised grandchildren and greatgrandchildren from these crossed plants and they continued to resemble the paintedlady but during later generations became rather more blotched with purple yet none reverted completely to the original motherplant the purple sweetpea the following case is slightly different but still shows the same principle naudin 1521 nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 100 raised numerous hybrids between the yellow linaria vulgaris and the purple l purpurea and during three successive generations the colours kept distinct in different parts of the same flower  from cases such as the foregoing in which the offspring of the first generation perfectly resemble either parent we come by a small step to those cases in which differently coloured flowers borne on the same root resemble both parents and by another step to those in which the same flower or fruit is striped or blotched with the two parental colours or bears a single stripe of the colour or other characteristic quality of one of the parentforms with hybrids and mongrels it frequently or even generally happens that one part of the body resembles more or less closely one parent and another part the other parent and here again some resistence to fusion or what comes to the same thing some mutual affinity between the organic atoms of the same nature apparently comes into play for otherwise all parts of the body would be equally intermediate in character so again when the offspring of hybrids or mongrels which are themselves nearly intermediate in character revert either wholly or by segments to their ancestors the principle of the affinity of similar or the repulsion of dissimilar atoms must come into action to this principle which seems to be extremely general we shall recur in the chapter on pangenesis  it is remarkable as has been strongly insisted upon by isidore geoffroy st hilaire in regard to animals that the transmission of characters without fusion occurs very rarely when species are crossed i know of one exception alone namely with the hybrids naturally produced between the common and hooded crow corvus corone and cornix which however are closely allied species differing in nothing except colour nor have i met with any well ascertained cases of transmission of this kind even when one form is strongly prepotent over another when two races are crossed which have been slowly formed by mans selection and therefore resemble to a certain extent natural species such cases as puppies in the same litter closely resembling two distinct breeds are probably due to superfoetationthat is to the influence of two fathers all the characters above enumerated which are transmitted in a perfect state to some of the offspring and not to others such as distinct colours nakedness of skin smoothness of leaves absence of horns or tail additional toes pelorism dwarfed structure etchave all been known to appear suddenly in individual animals and plants from this fact and from the several slight aggregated differences which distinguish domestic races and species from one another not being liable to this peculiar form of transmission we may conclude that it is in some way connected with the sudden appearance of the characters in question  on the modification of old races and the formation of new races by crossing  we have hitherto chiefly considered the effects of crossing in giving uniformity of character we must now look to an opposite result there can be no doubt that crossing with the aid of rigorous selection during several generations has been a potent means in modifying old races and in forming new ones lord orford crossed his famous stud of greyhounds once with the bulldog in order to give them courage and perseverance certain pointers have been crossed as i hear from the rev wd fox with the foxhound to give them dash and speed certain strains of dorking fowls have had a slight infusion of game blood and i have known a great fancier who on a single occasion crossed his turbitpigeons with barbs for the sake of gaining greater breadth of beak  in the foregoing cases breeds have been crossed once for the sake of modifying some particular character but with most of the improved races of the pig which now breed true there have been repeated crossesfor instance the improved essex owes its excellence to repeated crosses with the neapolitan together probably with some infusion of chinese blood 1522 richardson pigs 1847 pages 37 42 s sidneys edition of youatt on the pig 1860 page 3 so with our british sheep almost all the races except the southdown have been largely crossed this in fact has been the history of our principal breeds 1523 see mr wc spooners excellent paper on crossbreeding journal royal agricult soc volume 20 part 2 see also an equally good article by mr ch howard in gardeners chronicle 1860 page 320 to give an example the oxfordshire downs now rank as an established breed 1524 gardeners chronicle 1857 pages 649 652 they were produced about the year 1830 by crossing hampshire and in some instances southdown ewes with cotswold rams now the hampshire ram was itself produced by repeated crosses between the native hampshire sheep and southdowns and the longwoolled cotswold were improved by crosses with the leicester which latter again is believed to have been a cross between several longwoolled sheep mr spooner after considering the various cases which have been carefully recorded concludes that from a judicious pairing of crossbred animals it is practicable to establish a new breed on the continent the history of several crossed races of cattle and of other animals has been well ascertained to give one instance the king of wurtemburg after twentyfive years careful breeding that is after six or seven generations made a new breed of cattle from a cross between a dutch and a swiss breed combined with other breeds 1525 bulletin de la soc dacclimat 1862 tome 9 page 463 see also for other cases mm moll and gayot du boeuf 1860 page 32 the sebright bantam which breeds as true as any other kind of fowl was formed about sixty years ago by a complicated cross 1526 poultry chronicle volume 2 1854 page 36 dark brahmas which are believed by some fanciers to constitute a distinct species were undoubtedly formed 1527 the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 58 in the united states within a recent period by a cross between chittagongs and cochins with plants there is little doubt that the swedeturnip originated from a cross and the history of a variety of wheat raised from two very distinct varieties and which after six years culture presented an even sample has been recorded on good authority 1528 gardeners chronicle 1852 page 765  until lately cautious and experienced breeders though not averse to a single infusion of foreign blood were almost universally convinced that the attempt to establish a new race intermediate between two widely distinct races was hopeless they clung with superstitious tenacity to the doctrine of purity of blood believing it to be the ark in which alone true safety could be found 1529 spooner in journal royal agricult soc volume 20 part 2 nor was this conviction unreasonable when two distinct races are crossed the offspring of the first generation are generally nearly uniform in character but even this sometimes fails to be the case especially with crossed dogs and fowls the young of which from the first are sometimes much diversified as crossbred animals are generally of large size and vigorous they have been raised in great numbers for immediate consumption but for breeding they are found utterly useless for though they may themselves be uniform in character they yield during many generations astonishingly diversified offspring the breeder is driven to despair and concludes that he will never form an intermediate race but from the cases already given and from others which have been recorded it appears that patience alone is necessary as mr spooner remarks nature opposes no barrier to successful admixture in the course of time by the aid of selection and careful weeding it is practicable to establish a new breed after six or seven generations the hopedfor result will in most cases be obtained but even then an occasional reversion or failure to keep true may be expected the attempt however will assuredly fail if the conditions of life be decidedly unfavourable to the characters of either parentbreed 1530 see colin traite de phys comp des animaux domestiques tome 2 page 536 where this subject is well treated  although the grandchildren and succeeding generations of crossbred animals are generally variable in an extreme degree some curious exceptions to the rule have been observed both with crossed races and species thus boitard and corbie 1531 les pigeons page 37 assert that from a pouter and a runt a cavalier will appear which we have classed amongst pigeons of pure race because it transmits all its qualities to its posterity the editor of the poultry chronicle 1532 volume 1 1854 page 101 bred some bluish fowls from a black spanish cock and a malay hen and these remained true to colour generation after generation the himalayan breed of rabbits was certainly formed by crossing two subvarieties of the silvergrey rabbit although it suddenly assumed its present character which differs much from that of either parentbreed yet it has ever since been easily and truly propagated i crossed some labrador and penguin ducks and recrossed the mongrels with penguins afterwards most of the ducks reared during three generations were nearly uniform in character being brown with a white crescentic mark on the lower part of the breast and with some white spots at the base of the beak so that by the aid of a little selection a new breed might easily have been formed with regard to crossed varieties of plants mr beaton 1533 cottage gardener 1856 page 110 remarks that melvilles extraordinary cross between the scotch kale and an early cabbage is as true and genuine as any on record but in this case no doubt selection was practised gartner 1534 bastarderzeugung s 553 has given five cases of hybrids in which the progeny kept constant and hybrids between dianthus armeria and deltoides remained true and uniform to the tenth generation dr herbert likewise showed me a hybrid from two species of loasa which from its first production had kept constant during several generations  we have seen in the first chapter that the several kinds of dogs are almost certainly descended from more than one species and so it is with cattle pigs and some other domesticated animals hence the crossing of aboriginally distinct species probably came into play at an early period in the formation of our present races from rutimeyers observations there can be little doubt that this occurred with cattle but in most cases one form will probably have absorbed and obliterated the other for it is not likely that semicivilised men would have taken the necessary pains to modify by selection their commingled crossed and fluctuating stock nevertheless those animals which were best adapted to their conditions of life would have survived through natural selection and by this means crossing will often have indirectly aided in the formation of primeval domesticated breeds within recent times as far as animals are concerned the crossing of distinct species has done little or nothing towards the formation or modification of our races it is not yet known whether the several species of silkmoth which have been recently crossed in france will yield permanent races with plants which can be multiplied by buds and cuttings hybridisation has done wonders as with many kinds of roses rhododendrons pelargoniums calceolarias and petunias nearly all these plants can be propagated by seed most of them freely but extremely few or none come true by seed  some authors believe that crossing is the chief cause of variabilitythat is of the appearance of absolutely new characters some have gone so far as to look at it as the sole cause but this conclusion is disproved by the facts given in the chapter on budvariation the belief that characters not present in either parent or in their ancestors frequently originate from crossing is doubtful that they occasionally do so is probable but this subject will be more conveniently discussed in a future chapter on the causes of variability  a condensed summary of this and of the three following chapters together with some remarks on hybridism will be given in the nineteenth chapter   chapter 2xvi  causes which interfere with the free crossing of varietiesinfluence of domestication on fertility  difficulties in judging of the fertility of varieties when crossed various causes which keep varieties distinct as the period of breeding and sexual preference varieties of wheat said to be sterile when crossed varieties of maize verbascum hollyhock gourds melons and tobacco rendered in some degree mutually sterile domestication eliminates the tendency to sterility natural to species when crossed on the increased fertility of uncrossed animals and plants from domestication and cultivation  the domesticated races of both animals and plants when crossed are with extremely few exceptions quite prolificin some cases even more so than the purelybred parentraces the offspring also raised from such crosses are likewise as we shall see in the following chapter generally more vigorous and fertile than their parents on the other hand species when crossed and their hybrid offspring are almost invariably in some degree sterile and here there seems to exist a broad and insuperable distinction between races and species the importance of this subject as bearing on the origin of species is obvious and we shall hereafter recur to it  it is unfortunate how few precise observations have been made on the fertility of mongrel animals and plants during several successive generations dr broca 161 journal de physiolog tome 2 1859 page 385 has remarked that no one has observed whether for instance mongrel dogs bred inter se are indefinitely fertile yet if a shade of infertility be detected by careful observation in the offspring of natural forms when crossed it is thought that their specific distinction is proved but so many breeds of sheep cattle pigs dogs and poultry have been crossed and recrossed in various ways that any sterility if it had existed would from being injurious almost certainly have been observed in investigating the fertility of crossed varieties many sources of doubt occur whenever the least trace of sterility between two plants however closely allied was observed by kolreuter and more especially by gartner who counted the exact number of seed in each capsule the two forms were at once ranked as distinct species and if this rule be followed assuredly it will never be proved that varieties when crossed are in any degree sterile we have formerly seen that certain breeds of dogs do not readily pair together but no observations have been made whether when paired they produce the full number of young and whether the latter are perfectly fertile inter se but supposing that some degree of sterility were found to exist naturalists would simply infer that these breeds were descended from aboriginally distinct species and it would be scarcely possible to ascertain whether or not this explanation was the true one  the sebright bantam is much less prolific than any other breed of fowls and is descended from a cross between two very distinct breeds recrossed by a third subvariety but it would be extremely rash to infer that the loss of fertility was in any manner connected with its crossed origin for it may with more probability be attributed either to longcontinued close interbreeding or to an innate tendency to sterility correlated with the absence of hackles and sickle tailfeathers  before giving the few recorded cases of forms which must be ranked as varieties being in some degree sterile when crossed i may remark that other causes sometimes interfere with varieties freely intercrossing thus they may differ too greatly in size as with some kinds of dogs and fowls for instance the editor of the journal of horticulture etc 162 december 1863 page 484 says that he can keep bantams with the larger breeds without much danger of their crossing but not with the smaller breeds such as games hamburghs etc with plants a difference in the period of flowering serves to keep varieties distinct as with the various kinds of maize and wheat thus colonel le couteur 163 on the varieties of wheat page 66 remarks the talavera wheat from flowering much earlier than any other kind is sure to continue pure in different parts of the falkland islands the cattle are breaking up into herds of different colours and those on the higher ground which are generally white usually breed as i am informed by sir j sulivan three months earlier than those on the lowland and this would manifestly tend to keep the herds from blending  certain domestic races seem to prefer breeding with their own kind and this is a fact of some importance for it is a step towards that instinctive feeling which helps to keep closely allied species in a state of nature distinct we have now abundant evidence that if it were not for this feeling many more hybrids would be naturally produced than in this case we have seen in the first chapter that the alco dog of mexico dislikes dogs of other breeds and the hairless dog of paraguay mixes less readily with the european races than the latter do with each other in germany the female spitzdog is said to receive the fox more readily than will other dogs a female australian dingo in england attracted the wild male foxes but these differences in the sexual instinct and attractive power of the various breeds may be wholly due to their descent from distinct species in paraguay the horses have much freedom and an excellent observer 164 rengger saugethiere von paraguay s 336 believes that the native horses of the same colour and size prefer associating with each other and that the horses which have been imported from entre rios and banda oriental into paraguay likewise prefer associating together in circassia six subraces of the horse have received distinct names and a native proprietor of rank 165 see a memoir by mm lherbette and de quatrefages in bull soc dacclimat tome 8 july 1861 page 312 asserts that horses of three of these races whilst living a free life almost always refuse to mingle and cross and will even attack one another  it has been observed in a district stocked with heavy lincolnshire and light norfolk sheep that both kinds though bred together when turned out in a short time separate to a sheep the lincolnshires drawing off to the rich soil and the norfolks to their own dry light soil and as long as there is plenty of grass the two breeds keep themselves as distinct as rooks and pigeons in this case different habits of life tend to keep the races distinct on one of the faroe islands not more than half a mile in diameter the halfwild native black sheep are said not to have readily mixed with the imported white sheep it is a more curious fact that the semimonstrous ancon sheep of modern origin have been observed to keep together separating themselves from the rest of the flock when put into enclosures with other sheep 166 for the norfolk sheep see marshall rural economy of norfolk volume 2 page 136 see rev l landt description of faroe page 66 for the ancon sheep see phil transact 1813 page 90 with respect to fallowdeer which live in a semidomesticated condition mr bennett 167 white nat hist of selbourne edited by bennett page 39 with respect to the origin of the darkcoloured deer see some account of english deer parks by ep shirley esq states that the dark and pale coloured herds which have long been kept together in the forest of dean in high meadow woods and in the new forest have never been known to mingle the darkcoloured deer it may be added are believed to have been first brought by james i from norway on account of their greater hardiness i imported from the island of porto santo two of the feral rabbits which differ as described in the fourth chapter from common rabbits both proved to be males and though they lived during some years in the zoological gardens the superintendent mr bartlett in vain endeavoured to make them breed with various tame kinds but whether this refusal to breed was due to any change in the instinct or simply to their extreme wildness or whether confinement had rendered them sterile as often occurs cannot be determined  whilst matching for the sake of experiment many of the most distinct breeds of pigeons it frequently appeared to me that the birds though faithful to their marriage vow retained some desire after their own kind accordingly i asked mr wicking who has kept a larger stock of various breeds together than any man in england whether he thought that they would prefer pairing with their own kind supposing that there were males and females enough of each and he without hesitation answered that he was convinced that this was the case it has often been noticed that the dovecote pigeon seems to have an actual aversion towards the several fancy breeds 168 the dovecote by the rev es dixon page 155 bechstein naturgesch deutschlands b 4 1795 page 17 yet all have certainly sprung from a common progenitor the rev wd fox informs me that his flocks of white and common chinese geese kept distinct  these facts and statements though some of them are incapable of proof resting only on the opinion of experienced observers show that some domestic races are led by different habits of life to keep to a certain extent separate and that others prefer coupling with their own kind in the same manner as species in a state of nature though in a much less degree  with respect to sterility from the crossing of domestic races i know of no wellascertained case with animals this fact seeing the great difference in structure between some breeds of pigeons fowls pigs dogs etc is extraordinary in contrast with the sterility of many closely allied natural species when crossed but we shall hereafter attempt to show that it is not so extraordinary as it at first appears and it may be well here to recall to mind that the amount of external difference between two species is not a safe guide for predicting whether or not they will breed togethersome closely allied species when crossed being utterly sterile and others which are extremely unlike being moderately fertile i have said that no case of sterility in crossed races rests on satisfactory evidence but here is one which at first seems trustworthy mr youatt 169 cattle page 202 and a better authority cannot be quoted states that formerly in lancashire crosses were frequently made between longhorn and shorthorn cattle the first cross was excellent but the produce was uncertain in the third or fourth generation the cows were bad milkers in addition to which there was much uncertainty whether the cows would conceive and full onethird of the cows among some of these halfbreds failed to be in calf this at first seems a good case but mr wilkinson states 1610 mr j wilkinson in remarks addressed to sir j sebright 1820 page 38 that a breed derived from this same cross was actually established in another part of england and if it had failed in fertility the fact would surely have been noticed moreover supposing that mr youatt had proved his case it might be argued that the sterility was wholly due to the two parentbreeds being descended from primordially distinct species  in the case of plants gartner states that he fertilised thirteen heads and subsequently nine others on a dwarf maize bearing yellow seed 1611 bastarderzeugung s 87 169 see also the table at the end of volume with pollen of a tall maize having red seed and one head alone produced good seed but only five in number though these plants are monoecious and therefore do not require castration yet i should have suspected some accident in the manipulation had not gartner expressly stated that he had during many years grown these two varieties together and they did not spontaneously cross and this considering that the plants are monoecious and abound with pollen and are well known generally to cross freely seems explicable only on the belief that these two varieties are in some degree mutually infertile the hybrid plants raised from the above five seeds were intermediate in structure extremely variable and perfectly fertile 1612 bastarderzeugung s 87 577 in like manner prof hildebrand 1613 bot zeitung 1868 page 327 could not succeed in fertilising the female flowers of a plant bearing brown grains with pollen from a certain kind bearing yellow grains although other flowers on the same plant which were fertilised with their own pollen yielded good seed no one i believe even suspects that these varieties of maize are distinct species but had the hybrids been in the least sterile no doubt gartner would at once have so classed them i may here remark that with undoubted species there is not necessarily any close relation between the sterility of a first cross and that of the hybrid offspring some species can be crossed with facility but produce utterly sterile hybrids others can be crossed with extreme difficulty but the hybrids when produced are moderately fertile i am not aware however of any instance quite like this of the maize namely of a first cross made with difficulty but yielding perfectly fertile hybrids 1614 mr shirreff formerly thought gardeners chronicle 1858 page 771 that the offspring from a cross between certain varieties of wheat became sterile in the fourth generation but he now admits improvement of the cereals 1873 that this was an error  the following case is much more remarkable and evidently perplexed gartner whose strong wish it was to draw a broad line of distinction between species and varieties in the genus verbascum he made during eighteen years a vast number of experiments and crossed no less than 1085 flowers and counted their seeds many of these experiments consisted in crossing white and yellow varieties of both v lychnitis and v blattaria with nine other species and their hybrids that the white and yellow flowered plants of these two species are really varieties no one has doubted and gartner actually raised in the case of both species one variety from the seed of the other now in two of his works 1615 kenntniss der befruchtung s 137 bastarderzeugung s 92 181 on raising the two varieties from seed see s 307 he distinctly asserts that crosses between similarlycoloured flowers yield more seed than between dissimilarlycoloured so that the yellowflowered variety of either species and conversely with the whiteflowered variety when crossed with pollen of its own kind yields more seed than when crossed with that of the white variety and so it is when differently coloured species are crossed the general results may be seen in the table at the end of his volume in one instance he gives 1616 bastarderzeugung s 216 the following details but i must premise that gartner to avoid exaggerating the degree of sterility in his crosses always compares the maximum number obtained from a cross with the average number naturally given by the pure motherplant the white variety of v lychnitis naturally fertilised by its own pollen gave from an average of twelve capsules ninetysix good seeds in each whilst twenty flowers fertilised with pollen from the yellow variety of this same species gave as the maximum only eightynine good seeds so that we have the proportion of 1000 to 908 according to gartners usual scale i should have thought it possible that so small a difference in fertility might have been accounted for by the evil effects of the necessary castration but gartner shows that the white variety of v lychnitis when fertilised first by the white variety of v blattaria and then by the yellow variety of this species yielded seed in the proportion of 622 to 438 and in both these cases castration was performed now the sterility which results from the crossing of the differently coloured varieties of the same species is fully as great as that which occurs in many cases when distinct species are crossed unfortunately gartner compared the results of the first unions alone and not the sterility of the two sets of hybrids produced from the white variety of v lychnitis when fertilised by the white and yellow varieties of v blattaria for it is probable that they would have differed in this respect  mr j scott has given me the results of a series of experiments on verbascum made by him in the botanic gardens of edinburgh 1617 the results have since been published in journ asiatic soc of bengal 1867 page 145 he repeated some of gartners experiments on distinct species but obtained only fluctuating results some confirmatory the greater number contradictory nevertheless these seem hardly sufficient to overthrow the conclusion arrived at by gartner from experiments tried on a larger scale mr scott also experimented on the relative fertility of unions between similarly and dissimilarlycoloured varieties of the same species thus he fertilised six flowers of the yellow variety of v lychnitis by its own pollen and obtained six capsules and calling for the sake of comparison the average number of good seed in each of their capsules one hundred he found that this same yellow variety when fertilised by the white variety yielded from seven capsules an average of ninetyfour seed on the same principle the white variety of v lychnitis by its own pollen from six capsules and by the pollen of the yellow variety eight capsules yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 82 the yellow variety of v thapsus by its own pollen eight capsules and by that of the white variety only two capsules yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 94 lastly the white variety of v blattaria by its own pollen eight capsules and by that of the yellow variety five capsules yielded seed in the proportion of 100 to 79 so that in every case the unions of similarlycoloured varieties of the same species were more fertile than the unions of dissimilarlycoloured varieties when all the cases are grouped together the difference of fertility is as 100 to 86 some additional trials were made and altogether thirtysix similarlycoloured unions yielded thirtyfive good capsules whilst thirtyfive dissimilarly coloured unions yielded only twentysix good capsules besides the foregoing experiments the purple v phoeniceum was crossed by a rosecoloured and a white variety of the same species these two varieties were also crossed together and these several unions yielded less seed than v phoeniceum by its own pollen hence it follows from mr scotts experiments that in the genus verbascum the similarly and dissimilarlycoloured varieties of the same species behave when crossed like closely allied but distinct species 1618 the following facts given by kolreuter in his dritte fortsetzung ss 34 39 appear at first sight strongly to confirm mr scotts and gartners statements and to a certain limited extent they do so kolreuter asserts from innumerable observations that insects incessantly carry pollen from one species and variety of verbascum to another and i can confirm this assertion yet he found that the white and yellow varieties of verbascum lychnitis often grew wild mingled together moreover he cultivated these two varieties in considerable numbers during four years in his garden and they kept true by seed but when he crossed them they produced flowers of an intermediate tint hence it might have been thought that both varieties must have a stronger elective affinity for the pollen of their own variety than for that of the other this elective affinity i may add of each species for its own pollen kolreuter dritte forts s 39 and gartner bastarderz passim being a perfectly wellascertained power but the force of the foregoing facts is much lessened by gartners numerous experiments for differently from kolreuter he never once got bastarderz s 307 an intermediate tint when he crossed the yellow and white flowered varieties of verbascum so that the fact of the white and yellow varieties keeping true to their colour by seed does not prove that they were not mutually fertilised by the pollen carried by insects from one to the other  this remarkable fact of the sexual affinity of similarlycoloured varieties as observed by gartner and mr scott may not be of very rare occurrence for the subject has not been attended to by others the following case is worth giving partly to show how difficult it is to avoid error dr herbert 1619 amaryllidaceae 1837 page 366 gartner has made a similar observation has remarked that variouslycoloured double varieties of the hollyhock althea rosea may be raised with certainty by seed from plants growing close together i have been informed that nurserymen who raise seed for sale do not separate their plants accordingly i procured seed of eighteen named varieties of these eleven varieties produced sixtytwo plants all perfectly true to their kind and seven produced fortynine plants half of which were true and half false mr masters of canterbury has given me a more striking case he saved seed from a great bed of twentyfour named varieties planted in closely adjoining rows and each variety reproduced itself truly with only sometimes a shade of difference in tint now in the hollyhock the pollen which is abundant is matured and nearly all shed before the stigma of the same flower is ready to receive it 1620 kolreuter first observed this fact mem de lacad de st petersburg volume 3 page 127 see also ck sprengel das entdeckte geheimniss s 345 and as bees covered with pollen incessantly fly from plant to plant it would appear that adjoining varieties could not escape being crossed as however this does not occur it appeared to me probable that the pollen of each variety was prepotent on its own stigma over that of all other varieties but i have no evidence on this point mr c turner of slough well known for his success in the cultivation of this plant informs me that it is the doubleness of the flowers which prevents the bees gaining access to the pollen and stigma and he finds that it is difficult even to cross them artificially whether this explanation will fully account for varieties in close proximity propagating themselves so truly by seed i do not know  the following cases are worth giving as they relate to monoecious forms which do not require and consequently cannot have been injured by castration girou de buzareingues crossed what he designates three varieties of gourd 1621 namely barbarines pastissons giraumous annal des sc nat tome 30 1833 pages 398 and 405 and asserts that their mutual fertilisation is less easy in proportion to the difference which they present i am aware how imperfectly the forms in this group were until recently known but sageret 1622 memoire sur les cucurbitaceae 1826 pages 46 55 who ranked them according to their mutual fertility considers the three forms above alluded to as varieties as does a far higher authority namely m naudin 1623 annales des sc nat 4th series tome 6 m naudin considers these forms as undoubtedly varieties of cucurbita pepo sageret 1624 mem cucurb page 8 has observed that certain melons have a greater tendency whatever the cause may be to keep true than others and m naudin who has had such immense experience in this group informs me that he believes that certain varieties intercross more readily than others of the same species but he has not proved the truth of this conclusion the frequent abortion of the pollen near paris being one great difficulty nevertheless he has grown close together during seven years certain forms of citrullus which as they could be artificially crossed with perfect facility and produced fertile offspring are ranked as varieties but these forms when not artificially crossed kept true many other varieties on the other hand in the same group cross with such facility as m naudin repeatedly insists that without being grown far apart they cannot be kept in the least true  another case though somewhat different may be here given as it is highly remarkable and is established on excellent evidence kolreuter minutely describes five varieties of the common tobacco 1625 zweite forts s 53 namely nicotiana major vulgaris 2 perennis 3 transylvanica 4 a sub var of the last 5 major latifol fl alb which were reciprocally crossed and the offspring were intermediate in character and as fertile as their parents from this fact kolreuter inferred that they are really varieties and no one as far as i can discover seems to have doubted that such is the case he also crossed reciprocally these five varieties with n glutinosa and they yielded very sterile hybrids but those raised from the var perennis whether used as the father or mother plant were not so sterile as the hybrids from the four other varieties 1626 kolreuter was so much struck with this fact that he suspected that a little pollen of n glutinosa in one of his experiments might have accidentally got mingled with that of var perennis and thus aided its fertilising power but we now know conclusively from gartner bastarderz s 34 43 that the pollen of two species never acts conjointly on a third species still less will the pollen of a distinct species mingled with a plants own pollen if the latter be present in sufficient quantity have any effect the sole effect of mingling two kinds of pollen is to produce in the same capsule seeds which yield plants some taking after the one and some after the other parent so that the sexual capacity of this one variety has certainly been in some degree modified so as to approach in nature that of n glutinosa 1627 mr scott has made some observations on the absolute sterility of a purple and white primrose primula vulgaris when fertilised by pollen from the common primrose journal of proc of linn soc volume 8 1864 page 98 but these observations require confirmation i raised a number of purpleflowered long styled seedlings from seed kindly sent me by mr scott and though they were all in some degree sterile they were much more fertile with pollen taken from the common primrose than with their own pollen mr scott has likewise described a red equalstyled cowslip p veris ibid page 106 which was found by him to be highly sterile when crossed with the common cowslip but this was not the case with several equalstyled red seedlings raised by me from his plant this variety of the cowslip presents the remarkable peculiarity of combining male organs in every respect like those of the shortstyled form with female organs resembling in function and partly in structure those of the longstyled form so that we have the singular anomaly of the two forms combined in the same flower hence it is not surprising that these flowers should be spontaneously selffertile in a high degree  these facts with respect to plants show that in some few cases certain varieties have had their sexual powers so far modified that they cross together less readily and yield less seed than other varieties of the same species we shall presently see that the sexual functions of most animals and plants are eminently liable to be affected by the conditions of life to which they are exposed and hereafter we shall briefly discuss the conjoint bearing of this fact and others on the difference in fertility between crossed varieties and crossed species  domestication eliminates the tendency to sterility which is general with species when crossed  this hypothesis was first propounded by pallas 1628 act acad st petersburg 1780 part 2 pages 84 100 and has been adopted by several authors i can find hardly any direct facts in its support but unfortunately no one has compared in the case of either animals or plants the fertility of anciently domesticated varieties when crossed with a distinct species with that of the wild parentspecies when similarly crossed no one has compared for instance the fertility of gallus bankiva and of the domesticated fowl when crossed with a distinct species of gallus or phasianus and the experiment would in all cases be surrounded by many difficulties dureau de la malle who has so closely studied classical literature states 1629 annales des sc nat tome 21 1st series page 61 that in the time of the romans the common mule was produced with more difficulty than at the present day but whether this statement may be trusted i know not a much more important though somewhat different case is given by m groenland 1630 bull bot soc de france december 27 1861 tome 8 page 612 namely that plants known from their intermediate character and sterility to be hybrids between aegilops and wheat have perpetuated themselves under culture since 1857 with a rapid but varying increase of fertility in each generation in the fourth generation the plants still retaining their intermediate character had become as fertile as common cultivated wheat  the indirect evidence in favour of the pallasian doctrine appears to me to be extremely strong in the earlier chapters i have shown that our various breeds of the dog are descended from several wild species and this probably is the case with sheep there can be no doubt that the zebu or humped indian ox belongs to a distinct species from european cattle the latter moreover are descended from two forms which may be called either species or races we have good evidence that our domesticated pigs belong to at least two specific types s scrofa and indicus now a widely extended analogy leads to the belief that if these several allied species when first reclaimed had been crossed they would have exhibited both in their first unions and in their hybrid offspring some degree of sterility nevertheless the several domesticated races descended from them are now all as far as can be ascertained perfectly fertile together if this reasoning be trustworthy and it is apparently sound we must admit the pallasian doctrine that long continued domestication tends to eliminate that sterility which is natural to species when crossed in their aboriginal state  on increased fertility from domestication and cultivation  increased fertility from domestication without any reference to crossing may be here briefly considered this subject bears indirectly on two or three points connected with the modification of organic beings as buffon long ago remarked 1631 quoted by isid geoffroy st hilaire hist naturelle generale tome 3 page 476 since this ms has been sent to press a full discussion on the present subject has appeared in mr herbert spencers principles of biology volume 2 1867 page 457 et seq domestic animals breed oftener in the year and produce more young at a birth than wild animals of the same species they also sometimes breed at an earlier age the case would hardly have deserved further notice had not some authors lately attempted to show that fertility increases and decreases in an inverse ratio with the amount of food this strange doctrine has apparently arisen from individual animals when supplied with an inordinate quantity of food and from plants of many kinds when grown on excessively rich soil as on a dunghill becoming sterile but to this latter point i shall have occasion presently to return with hardly an exception our domesticated animals which have been long habituated to a regular and copious supply of food without the labour of searching for it are more fertile than the corresponding wild animals it is notorious how frequently cats and dogs breed and how many young they produce at a birth the wild rabbit is said generally to breed four times yearly and to produce each time at most six young the tame rabbit breeds six or seven times yearly producing each time from four to eleven young and mr harrison weir tells me of a case of eighteen young having been produced at a birth all of which survived the ferret though generally so closely confined is more prolific than its supposed wild prototype the wild sow is remarkably prolific she often breeds twice in the year and bears from four to eight and sometimes even twelve young but the domestic sow regularly breeds twice a year and would breed oftener if permitted and a sow that produces less than eight at a birth is worth little and the sooner she is fattened for the butcher the better the amount of food affects the fertility of the same individual thus sheep which on mountains never produce more than one lamb at a birth when brought down to lowland pastures frequently bear twins this difference apparently is not due to the cold of the higher land for sheep and other domestic animals are said to be extremely prolific in lapland hard living also retards the period at which animals conceive for it has been found disadvantageous in the northern islands of scotland to allow cows to bear calves before they are four years old 1632 for

evidence of increased fertility from domestication the hen of the wild gallus bankiva lays from six to ten eggs a number which would be thought nothing of with the domestic hen the wild duck lays from five to ten eggs the tame one in the course of the year from eighty to one hundred the wild greylag goose lays from five to eight eggs the tame from thirteen to eighteen and she lays a second time as mr dixon has remarked highfeeding care and moderate warmth induce a habit of prolificacy which becomes in some measure hereditary whether the semidomesticated dovecote pigeon is more fertile than the wild rockpigeon c livia i know not but the more thoroughly domesticated breeds are nearly twice as fertile as dovecotes the latter however when caged and highly fed become equally fertile with house pigeons i hear from judge caton that the wild turkey in the united states does not breed when a year old as the domesticated turkeys there invariably do the peahen alone of domesticated birds is rather more fertile according to some accounts when wild in its native indian home than in europe when exposed to our much colder climate 1633 for the eggs of gallus bankiva see blyth in annals and

poultry book 1866 pages 280 282 she there lays only from four to nine or ten eggs in england she is said in the poultry book to lay five or six but another writer says from eight to twelve eggs  with respect to plants no one would expect wheat to tiller more and each ear to produce more grain in poor than in rich soil or to get in poor soil a heavy crop of peas or beans seeds vary so much in number that it is difficult to estimate them but on comparing beds of carrots in a nursery garden with wild plants the former seemed to produce about twice as much seed cultivated cabbages yielded thrice as many pods by measure as wild cabbages from the rocks of south wales the excess of berries produced by the cultivated asparagus in comparison with the wild plant is enormous no doubt many highly cultivated plants such as pears pineapples bananas sugarcane etc are nearly or quite sterile and i am inclined to attribute this sterility to excess of food and to other unnatural conditions but to this subject i shall recur  in some cases as with the pig rabbit etc and with those plants which are valued for their seed the direct selection of the more fertile individuals has probably much increased their fertility and in all cases this may have occurred indirectly from the better chance of some of the numerous offspring from the more fertile individuals having been preserved but with cats ferrets and dogs and with plants like carrots cabbages and asparagus which are not valued for their prolificacy selection can have played only a subordinate part and their increased fertility must be attributed to the more favourable conditions of life under which they have long existed   chapter 2xvii  on the good effects of crossing and on the evil effects of close interbreeding

derived from an occasional cross between individuals of the same variety but belonging to distinct families or between distinct varieties has not been so largely or so frequently discussed as have the evil effects of too close interbreeding but the former point is the more important of the two inasmuch as the evidence is more decisive the evil results from close interbreeding are difficult to detect for they accumulate slowly and differ much in degree with different species whilst the good effects which almost invariably follow a cross are from the first manifest it should however be clearly understood that the advantage of close interbreeding as far as the retention of character is concerned is indisputable and often outweighs the evil of a slight loss of constitutional vigour in relation to the subject of domestication the whole question is of some importance as too close interbreeding interferes with the improvement of old races it is important as indirectly bearing on hybridism and possibly on the extinction of species when any form has become so rare that only a few individuals remain within a confined area it bears in an important manner on the influence of free intercrossing in obliterating individual differences and thus giving uniformity of character to the individuals of the same race or species for if additional vigour and fertility be thus gained the crossed offspring will multiply and prevail and the ultimate result will be far greater than otherwise would have occurred lastly the question is of high interest as bearing on mankind i shall therefore discuss this subject at full length as the facts which prove the evil effects of close interbreeding are more copious though less decisive than those on the good effects of crossing i shall under each group of beings begin with the former  there is no difficulty in defining what is meant by a cross but this is by no means easy in regard to breeding in and in or too close interbreeding because as we shall see different species of animals are differently affected by the same degree of interbreeding the pairing of a father and daughter or mother and son or brothers and sisters if carried on during several generations is the closest possible form of interbreeding but some good judges for instance sir j sebright believe that the pairing of a brother and sister is much closer than that of parents and children for when the father is matched with his daughter he crosses as is said with only half his own blood the consequences of close interbreeding carried on for too long a time are as is generally believed loss of size constitutional vigour and fertility sometimes accompanied by a tendency to malformation manifest evil does not usually follow from pairing the nearest relations for two three or even four generations but several causes interfere with our detecting the evilsuch as the deterioration being very gradual and the difficulty of distinguishing between such direct evil and the inevitable augmentation of any morbid tendencies which may be latent or apparent in the related parents on the other hand the benefit from a cross even when there has not been any very close interbreeding is almost invariably at once conspicuous there is good reason to believe and this was the opinion of that most experienced observer sir j sebright 171 the art of improving the breed etc 1809 page 16 that the evil effects of close interbreeding may be checked or quite prevented by the related individuals being separated for a few generations and exposed to different conditions of life this conclusion is now held by many breeders for instance mr carr 172 the history of the rise and progress of the killerby etc herds page 41 remarks it is a wellknown fact that a change of soil and climate effects perhaps almost as great a change in the constitution as would result from an infusion of fresh blood i hope to show in a future work that consanguinity by itself counts for nothing but acts solely from related organisms generally having a similar constitution and having been exposed in most cases to similar conditions  that any evil directly follows from the closest interbreeding has been denied by many persons but rarely by any practical breeder and never as far as i know by one who has largely bred animals which propagate their kind quickly many physiologists attribute the evil exclusively to the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies common to both parents and that this is an active source of mischief there can be no doubt it is unfortunately too notorious that men and various domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution and with a strong hereditary disposition to disease if not actually ill are fully capable of procreating their kind close interbreeding on the other hand often induces sterility and this indicates something quite distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents the evidence immediately to be given convinces me that it is a great law of nature that all organic beings profit from an occasional cross with individuals not closely related to them in blood and that on the other hand longcontinued close interbreeding is injurious  various general considerations have had much influence in leading me to this conclusion but the reader will probably rely more on special facts and opinions the authority of experienced observers even when they do not advance the grounds of their belief is of some little value now almost all men who have bred many kinds of animals and have written on the subject such as sir j sebright andrew knight etc 173 for andrew knight see a walker on intermarriage 1838 page 227 sir j sebright treatise has just been quoted have expressed the strongest conviction on the impossibility of longcontinued close interbreeding those who have compiled works on agriculture and have associated much with breeders such as the sagacious youatt low etc have strongly declared their opinion to the same effect prosper lucas trusting largely to french authorities has come to a similar conclusion the distinguished german agriculturist hermann von nathusius who has written the most able treatise on this subject which i have met with concurs and as i shall have to quote from this treatise i may state that nathusius is not only intimately acquainted with works on agriculture in all languages and knows the pedigrees of our british breeds better than most englishmen but has imported many of our improved animals and is himself an experienced breeder  evidence of the evil effects of close interbreeding can most readily be acquired in the case of animals such as fowls pigeons etc which propagate quickly and from being kept in the same place are exposed to the same conditions now i have inquired of very many breeders of these birds and i have hitherto not met with a single man who was not thoroughly convinced that an occasional cross with another strain of the same subvariety was absolutely necessary most breeders of highly improved or fancy birds value their own strain and are most unwilling at the risk in their opinion of deterioration to make a cross the purchase of a firstrate bird of another strain is expensive and exchanges are troublesome yet all breeders as far as i can hear excepting those who keep large stocks at different places for the sake of crossing are driven after a time to take this step  another general consideration which has had great influence on my mind is that with all hermaphrodite animals and plants which it might have been thought would have perpetually fertilised themselves and been thus subjected for long ages to the closest interbreeding there is not a single species as far as i can discover in which the structure ensures selffertilisation on the contrary there are in a multitude of cases as briefly stated in the fifteenth chapter manifest adaptations which favour or inevitably lead to an occasional cross between one hermaphrodite and another of the same species and these adaptive structures are utterly purposeless as far as we can see for any other end  with cattle there can be no doubt that extremely close interbreeding may be long carried on advantageously with respect to external characters and with no manifest evil as far as constitution is concerned the case of bakewells longhorns which were closely interbred for a long period has often been quoted yet youatt says 174 cattle page 199 the breed had acquired a delicacy of constitution inconsistent with common management and the propagation of the species was not always certain but the shorthorns offer the most striking case of close interbreeding for instance the famous bull favourite who was himself the offspring of a halfbrother and sister from foljambe was matched with his own daughter granddaughter and great granddaughter so that the produce of this last union or the greatgreat granddaughter had 1516ths or 9375 per cent of the blood of favourite in her veins this cow was matched with the bull wellington having 625 per cent of favourite blood in his veins and produced clarissa clarissa was matched with the bull lancaster having 6875 of the same blood and she yielded valuable offspring 175 i give this on the authority of nathusius ueber shorthorn rindvieh 1857 s 71 see also gardeners chronicle 1860 page 270 but mr j storer a large breeder of cattle informs me that the parentage of clarissa is not well authenticated in the first volume of the herd book she was entered as having six descents from favourite which was a palpable mistake and in all subsequent editions she was spoken of as having only four descents mr storer doubts even about the four as no names of the dams are given moreover clarissa bore only two bulls and one heifer and in the next generation her progeny became extinct analogous cases of close interbreeding are given in a pamphlet published by mr c macknight and dr h madden on the true principles of breeding melbourne australia 1865 nevertheless collings who reared these animals and was a strong advocate for close breeding once crossed his stock with a galloway and the cows from this cross realised the highest prices batess herd was esteemed the most celebrated in the world for thirteen years he bred most closely in and in but during the next seventeen years though he had the most exalted notion of the value of his own stock he thrice infused fresh blood into his herd it is said that he did this not to improve the form of his animals but on account of their lessened fertility mr batess own view as given by a celebrated breeder 176 mr willoughby wood in gardeners chronicle 1855 page 411 and 1860 page 270 see the very clear tables and pedigrees given in nathusius rindvieh s 7277 was that to breed inandin from a bad stock was ruin and devastation yet that the practice may be safely followed within certain limits when the parents so related are descended from firstrate animals we thus see that there has been much close interbreeding with shorthorns but nathusius after the most careful study of their pedigrees says that he can find no instance of a breeder who has strictly followed this practice during his whole life from this study and his own experience he concludes that close interbreeding is necessary to ennoble the stock but that in effecting this the greatest care is necessary on account of the tendency to infertility and weakness it may be added that another high authority 177 mr wright journal of royal agricult soc volume 7 1846 page 204 mr j downing a successful breeder of shorthorns in ireland informs me that the raisers of the great families of shorthorns carefully conceal their sterility and want of constitution he adds that mr bates after he had bred his herd inandin for some years lost in one season twentyeight calves solely from want of constitution asserts that many more calves are born cripples from shorthorns than from other and less closely interbred races of cattle  although by carefully selecting the best animals as nature effectually does by the law of battle close interbreeding may be long carried on with cattle yet the good effects of a cross between almost any two breeds is at once shown by the greater size and vigour of the offspring as mr spooner writes to me crossing distinct breeds certainly improves cattle for the butcher such crossed animals are of course of no value to the breeder but they have been raised during many years in several parts of england to be slaughtered 178 youatt on cattle page 202 and their merit is now so fully recognised that at fatcattle shows a separate class has been formed for their reception the best fat ox at the great show at islington in 1862 was a crossed animal  the halfwild cattle which have been kept in british parks probably for 400 or 500 years or even for a longer period have been advanced by culley and others as a case of longcontinued interbreeding within the limits of the same herd without any consequent injury with respect to the cattle at chillingham the late lord tankerville owned that they were bad breeders 179 report british assoc zoolog sect 1838 the agent mr hardy estimates in a letter to me dated may 1861 that in the herd of about fifty the average number annually slaughtered killed by fighting and dying is about ten or one in five as the herd is kept up to nearly the same average number the annual rate of increase must be likewise about one in five the bulls i may add engage in furious battles of which battles the present lord tankerville has given me a graphic description so that there will always be rigorous selection of the most vigorous males i procured in 1855 from mr d gardner agent to the duke of hamilton the following account of the wild cattle kept in the dukes park in lanarkshire which is about 200 acres in extent the number of cattle varies from sixtyfive to eighty and the number annually killed i presume by all causes is from eight to ten so that the annual rate of increase can hardly be more than one in six now in south america where the herds are halfwild and therefore offer a nearly fair standard of comparison according to azara the natural increase of the cattle on an estancia is from onethird to onefourth of the total number or one in between three and four and this no doubt applies exclusively to adult animals fit for consumption hence the halfwild british cattle which have long interbred within the limits of the same herd are relatively far less fertile although in an unenclosed country like paraguay there must be some crossing between the different herds yet even there the inhabitants believe that the occasional introduction of animals from distant localities is necessary to prevent degeneration in size and diminution of fertility 1710 azara quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 pages 354 368 the decrease in size from ancient times in the chillingham and hamilton cattle must have been prodigious for professor rutimeyer has shown that they are almost certainly the descendants of the gigantic bos primigenius no doubt this decrease in size may be largely attributed to less favourable conditions of life yet animals roaming over large parks and fed during severe winters can hardly be considered as placed under very unfavourable conditions  with sheep there has often been longcontinued interbreeding within the limits of the same flock but whether the nearest relations have been matched so frequently as in the case of shorthorn cattle i do not know the messrs brown during fifty years have never infused fresh blood into their excellent flock of leicesters since 1810 mr barford has acted on the same principle with the foscote flock he asserts that half a century of experience has convinced him that when two nearly related animals are quite sound in constitution inandin breeding does not induce degeneracy but he adds that he does not pride himself on breeding from the nearest affinities in france the naz flock has been bred for sixty years without the introduction of a single strange ram 1711 for the case of the messrs brown see gardeners chronicle 1855 page 26 for the foscote flock gardeners chronicle 1860 page 416 for the naz flock bull de la soc dacclimat 1860 page 477 nevertheless most great breeders of sheep have protested against close interbreeding prolonged for too great a length of time 1712 nathusius rindvieh s 65 youatt on sheep page 495 the most celebrated of recent breeders jonas webb kept five separate families to work on thus retaining the requisite distance of relationship between the sexes 1713 gardeners chronicle 1861 page 631 and what is probably of greater importance the separate flocks will have been exposed to somewhat different conditions  although by the aid of careful selection the near interbreeding of sheep may be long continued without any manifest evil yet it has often been the practice with farmers to cross distinct breeds to obtain animals for the butcher which plainly shows that good of some kind is derived from this practice we have excellent evidence on this head from mr s druce 1714 journal r agricult soc volume 14 1853 page 212 who gives in detail the comparative numbers of four pure breeds and of a crossbreed which can be supported on the same ground and he gives their produce in fleece and carcase a high authority mr pusey sums up the result in money value during an equal length of time namely neglecting shillings for cotswolds 248 pounds for leicesters 223 pounds for southdowns 204 pounds for hampshire downs 264 pounds and for the crossbred 293 pounds a former celebrated breeder lord somerville states that his halfbreeds from ryelands and spanish sheep were larger animals than either the pure ryelands or pure spanish sheep mr spooner concludes his excellent essay on crossing by asserting that there is a pecuniary advantage in judicious crossbreeding especially when the male is larger than the female 1715 lord somerville facts on sheep and husbandry page 6 mr spooner in journal of royal agricult soc of england volume 20 part 2 see also an excellent paper on the same subject in gardeners chronicle 1860 page 321 by mr charles howard  as some of our british parks are ancient it occurred to me that there must have been longcontinued close interbreeding with the fallowdeer cervus dama kept in them but on inquiry i find that it is a common practice to infuse new blood by procuring bucks from other parks mr shirley 1716 some account of english deer parks by evelyn p shirley 1867 who has carefully studied the management of deer admits that in some parks there has been no admixture of foreign blood from a time beyond the memory of man but he concludes that in the end the constant breeding inandin is sure to tell to the disadvantage of the whole herd though it may take a very long time to prove it moreover when we find as is very constantly the case that the introduction of fresh blood has been of the very greatest use to deer both by improving their size and appearance and particularly by being of service in removing the taint of rickback if not of other diseases to which deer are sometimes subject when the blood has not been changed there can i think be no doubt but that a judicious cross with a good stock is of the greatest consequence and is indeed essential sooner or later to the prosperity of every wellordered park  mr meynells famous foxhounds have been adduced as showing that no ill effects follow from close interbreeding and sir j sebright ascertained from him that he frequently bred from father and daughter mother and son and sometimes even from brothers and sisters with greyhounds also there has been much close interbreeding but the best breeders agree that it may be carried too far 1717 stonehenge the dog 1867 pages 175188 but sir j sebright declares 1718 the art of improving the breed etc page 13 with respect to scotch deerhounds see scrope art of deer stalking pages 350353 that by breeding inandin by which he means matching brothers and sisters he has actually seen the offspring of strong spaniels degenerate into weak and diminutive lapdogs the rev wd fox has communicated to me the case of a small lot of bloodhounds long kept in the same family which had become very bad breeders and nearly all had a bony enlargement in the tail a single cross with a distinct strain of bloodhounds restored their fertility and drove away the tendency to malformation in the tail i have heard the particulars of another case with bloodhounds in which the female had to be held to the male considering how rapid is the natural increase of the dog it is difficult to understand the large price of all highly improved breeds which almost implies longcontinued close interbreeding except on the belief that this process lessens fertility and increases liability to distemper and other diseases a high authority mr scrope attributes the rarity and deterioration in size of the scotch deerhound the few individuals formerly existing throughout the country being all related in large part to close interbreeding  with all highlybred animals there is more or less difficulty in getting them to procreate quickly and all suffer much from delicacy of constitution a great judge of rabbits 1719 cottage gardener 1861 page 327 says the longeared does are often too highly bred or forced in their youth to be of much value as breeders often turning out barren or bad mothers they often desert their young so that it is necessary to have nurserabbits but i do not pretend to attribute all these evil results to close interbreeding 1720 mr huth gives the marriage of near kin 1875 page 302 from the bulletin de lacad r de med de belgique volume 9 1866 pages 287 305 several statements made by a m legrain with respect to crossing brother and sister rabbits for five or six successive generations with no consequent evil results i was so much surprised at this account and at m legrains invariable success in his experiments that i wrote to a distinguished naturalist in belgium to inquire whether m legrain was a trustworthy observer in answer i have heard that as doubts were expressed about the authenticity of these experiments a commission of inquiry was appointed and that at a succeeding meeting of the society bull de lacad r de med de belgique 1867 3rd series tome 1 no 1 to 5 dr crocq reported quil etait materiellement impossible que m legrain ait fait les experiences quil annonce to this public accusation no satisfactory answer was made  with respect to pigs there is more unanimity amongst breeders on the evil effects of close interbreeding than perhaps with any other large animal mr druce a great and successful breeder of the improved oxfordshires a crossed race writes without a change of boars of a different tribe but of the same breed constitution cannot be preserved mr fisher hobbs the raiser of the celebrated improved essex breed divided his stock into three separate families by which means he maintained the breed for more than twenty years by judicious selection from the three distinct families 1721 sidneys edition of youatt on the pig 1860 page 30 page 33 quotation from mr druce page 29 on lord westerns case lord western was the first importer of a neapolitan boar and sow from this pair he bred inandin until the breed was in danger of becoming extinct a sure result as mr sidney remarks of inandin breeding lord western then crossed his neapolitan pigs with the old essex and made the first great step towards the improved essex breed here is a more interesting case mr j wright well known as a breeder crossed 1722 journal of royal agricult soc of england 1846 volume 7 page 205 the same boar with the daughter granddaughter and great granddaughter and so on for seven generations the result was that in many instances the offspring failed to breed in others they produced few that lived and of the latter many were idiotic without sense even to suck and when attempting to move could not walk straight now it deserves especial notice that the two last sows produced by this long course of interbreeding were sent to other boars and they bore several litters of healthy pigs the best sow in external appearance produced during the whole seven generations was one in the last stage of descent but the litter consisted of this one sow she would not breed to her sire yet bred at the first trial to a stranger in blood so that in mr wrights case longcontinued and extremely close interbreeding did not affect the external form or merit of the young but with many of them the general constitution and mental powers and especially the reproductive functions were seriously affected  nathusius gives 1723 ueber rindvieh etc s 78 col le couteur who has done so much for the agriculture of jersey writes to me that from possessing a fine breed of pigs he bred them very closely twice pairing brothers and sisters but nearly all the young had fits and died suddenly an analogous and even more striking case he imported from england a pregnant sow of the large yorkshire breed and bred the product closely inandin for three generations the result was unfavourable as the young were weak in constitution with impaired fertility one of the latest sows which he esteemed a good animal produced when paired with her own uncle who was known to be productive with sows of other breeds a litter of six and a second time a litter of only five weak young pigs he then paired this sow with a boar of a small black breed which he had likewise imported from england this boar when matched with sows of his own breed produced from seven to nine young now the sow of the large breed which was so unproductive when paired with her own uncle yielded to the small black boar in the first litter twentyone and in the second litter eighteen young pigs so that in one year she produced thirtynine fine young animals  as in the case of several other animals already mentioned even when no injury is perceptible from moderately close interbreeding yet to quote the words of mr coate who five times won the annual gold medal of the smithfield club show for the best pen of pigs crosses answer well for profit to the farmer as you get more constitution and quicker growth but for me who sell a great number of pigs for breeding purposes i find it will not do as it requires many years to get anything like purity of blood again 1724 sidney on the pig page 36 see also note page 34 also richardson on the pig 1847 page 26  almost all the animals as yet mentioned are gregarious and the males must frequently pair with their own daughters for they expel the young males as well as all intruders until forced by old age and loss of strength to yield to some stronger male it is therefore not improbable that gregarious animals may have been rendered less susceptible than nonsocial species to the evil consequences of close interbreeding so that they may be enabled to live in herds without injury to their offspring unfortunately we do not know whether an animal like the cat which is not gregarious would suffer from close interbreeding in a greater degree than our other domesticated animals but the pig is not as far as i can discover strictly gregarious and we have seen that it appears eminently liable to the evil effects of close interbreeding mr huth in the case of the pig attributes page 285 these effects to their having been cultivated most for their fat or to the selected individuals having had a weak constitution but we must remember that it is great breeders who have brought forward the above cases and who are far more familiar than ordinary men can be with the causes which are likely to interfere with the fertility of their animals  the effects of close interbreeding in the case of man is a difficult subject on which i will say but little it has been discussed by various authors under many points of view 1725 dr dally has published an excellent article translated in the anthropolog review may 1864 page 65 criticising all writers who have maintained that evil follows from consanguineous marriages no doubt on this side of the question many advocates have injured their cause by inaccuracies thus it has been stated devay du danger des mariages etc 1862 page 141 that the marriages of cousins have been prohibited by the legislature of ohio but i have been assured in answer to inquiries made in the united states that this statement is a mere fable mr tylor 1726 see his interesting work on the early history of man 1865 chapter 10 has shown that with widely different races in the most distant quarters of the world marriages between relationseven between distant relationshave been strictly prohibited there are however many exceptions to the rule which are fully given by mr huth 1727 the marriage of near kin 1875 the evidence given by mr huth would i think have been even more valuable than it is on this and some other points if he had referred solely to the works of men who had long resided in each country referred to and who showed that they possessed judgment and caution see also mr w adam on consanguinity in marriage in the fortnightly review 1865 page 710 also hofacker ueber die eigenschaften etc 1828 it is a curious problem how these prohibitions arose during early and barbarous times mr tylor is inclined to attribute them to the evil effects of consanguineous marriages having been observed and he ingeniously attempts to explain some apparent anomalies in the prohibition not extending equally to the relations on the male and female side he admits however that other causes such as the extension of friendly alliances may have come into play mr w adam on the other hand concludes that related marriages are prohibited and viewed with repugnance from the confusion which would thus arise in the descent of property and from other still more recondite reasons but i cannot accept these views seeing that incest is held in abhorrence by savages such as those of australia and south america 1728 sir g grey journal of expeditions into australia volume 2 page 243 and dobrizhoffer on the abipones of south america who have no property to bequeath or fine moral feelings to confuse and who are not likely to reflect on distant evils to their progeny according to mr huth the feeling is the indirect result of exogamy inasmuch as when this practice ceased in any tribe and it became endogamous so that marriages were strictly confined to the same tribe it is not unlikely that a vestige of the former practice would still be retained so that closelyrelated marriages would be prohibited with respect to exogamy itself mr maclennan believes that it arose from a scarcity of women owing to female infanticide aided perhaps by other causes  it has been clearly shown by mr huth that there is no instinctive feeling in man against incest any more than in gregarious animals we know also how readily any prejudice or feeling may rise to abhorrence as shown by hindus in regard to objects causing defilement although there seems to be no strong inherited feeling in mankind against incest it seems possible that men during primeval times may have been more excited by strange females than by those with whom they habitually lived in the same manner as according to mr cupples 1729 descent of man 2nd edit page 524 male deerhounds are inclined towards strange females while the females prefer dogs with whom they have associated if any such feeling formerly existed in man this would have led to a preference for marriages beyond the nearest kin and might have been strengthened by the offspring of such marriages surviving in greater numbers as analogy would lead us to believe would have occurred  whether consanguineous marriages such as are permitted in civilised nations and which would not be considered as close interbreeding in the case of our domesticated animals cause any injury will never be known with certainty until a census is taken with this object in view my son george darwin has done what is possible at present by a statistical investigation 1730 journal of statistical soc june 1875 page 153 and fortnightly review june 1875 and he has come to the conclusion from his own researches and those of dr mitchell that the evidence as to any evil thus caused is conflicting but on the whole points to the evil being very small  birds  in the case of the fowl a whole array of authorities could be given against too close interbreeding sir j sebright positively asserts that he made many trials and that his fowls when thus treated became long in the legs small in the body and bad breeders 1731 the art of improving the breed page 13 he produced the famous sebright bantams by complicated crosses and by breeding inandin and since his time there has been much close interbreeding with these animals and they are now notoriously bad breeders i have seen silver bantams directly descended from his stock which had become almost as barren as hybrids for not a single chicken had been that year hatched from two full nests of eggs mr hewitt says that with these bantams the sterility of the male stands with rare exceptions in the closest relation with their loss of certain secondary male characters he adds i have noticed as a general rule that even the slightest deviation from feminine character in the tail of the male sebrightsay the elongation by only half an inch of the two principal tail feathersbrings with it improved probability of increased fertility 1732 the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 245  mr wright states 1733 journal royal agricult soc 1846 volume 7 page 205 see also ferguson on the fowl pages 83 317 see also the poultry book by tegetmeier 1866 page 135 with respect to the extent to which cockfighters found that they could venture to breed inandin viz occasionally a hen with her own son but they were cautious not to repeat the inandin breeding that mr clark whose fightingcocks were so notorious continued to breed from his own kind till they lost their disposition to fight but stood to be cut up without making any resistance and were so reduced in size as to be under those weights required for the best prizes but on obtaining a cross from mr leighton they again resumed their former courage and weight it should be borne in mind that gamecocks before they fought were always weighed so that nothing was left to the imagination about any reduction or increase of weight mr clark does not seem to have bred from brothers and sisters which is the most injurious kind of union and he found after repeated trials that there was a greater reduction in weight in the young from a father paired with his daughter than from a mother with her son i may add that mr eyton of eyton the wellknown ornithologist who is a large breeder of grey dorkings informs me that they certainly diminish in size and become less prolific unless a cross with another strain is occasionally obtained so it is with malays according to mr hewitt as far as size is concerned 1734 the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 79  an experienced writer 1735 the poultry chronicle 1854 volume 1 page 43 remarks that the same amateur as is well known seldom long maintains the superiority of his birds and this he adds undoubtedly is due to all his stock being of the same blood hence it is indispensable that he should occasionally procure a bird of another strain but this is not necessary with those who keep a stock of fowls at different stations thus mr ballance who has bred malays for thirty years and has won more prizes with these birds than any other fancier in england says that breeding inandin does not necessarily cause deterioration but all depends upon how this is managed my plan has been to keep about five or six distinct runs and to rear about two hundred or three hundred chickens each year and select the best birds from each run for crossing i thus secure sufficient crossing to prevent deterioration 1736 the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 79  we thus see that there is almost complete unanimity with poultrybreeders that when fowls are kept at the same place evil quickly follows from interbreeding carried on to an extent which would be disregarded in the case of most quadrupeds moreover it is a generally received opinion that cross bred chickens are the hardiest and most easily reared 1737 the poultry chronicle volume 1 page 89 mr tegetmeier who has carefully attended to poultry of all breeds says 1738 the poultry book 1866 page 210 that dorking hens allowed to run with houdan or crevecoeur cocks produce in the early spring chickens that for size hardihood early maturity and fitness for the market surpass those of any pure breed that we have ever raised mr hewitt gives it as a general rule with fowls that crossing the breed increases their size he makes this remark after stating that hybrids from the pheasant and fowl are considerably larger than either progenitor so again hybrids from the male golden pheasant and female common pheasant are of far larger size than either parentbird 1739 ibid 1866 page 167 and poultry chronicle volume 3 1855 page 15 to this subject of the increased size of hybrids i shall presently return  with pigeons breeders are unanimous as previously stated that it is absolutely indispensable notwithstanding the trouble and expense thus caused occasionally to cross their muchprized birds with individuals of another strain but belonging of course to the same variety it deserves notice that when size is one of the desired characters as with pouters 1740 a treatise on fancy pigeons by jm eaton page 56 the evil effects of close interbreeding are much sooner perceived than when small birds such as short faced tumblers are valued the extreme delicacy of the high fancy breeds such as these tumblers and improved english carriers is remarkable they are liable to many diseases and often die in the egg or during the first moult and their eggs have generally to be hatched under fostermothers although these highlyprized birds have invariably been subjected to much close interbreeding yet their extreme delicacy of constitution cannot perhaps be thus fully explained mr yarrell informed me that sir j sebright continued closely interbreeding some owlpigeons until from their extreme sterility he as nearly as possible lost the whole family mr brent 1741 the pigeon book page 46 tried to raise a breed of trumpeters by crossing a common pigeon and recrossing the daughter granddaughter greatgranddaughter and greatgreatgranddaughter with the same male trumpeter until he obtained a bird with 1516 of trumpeters blood but then the experiment failed for breeding so close stopped reproduction the experienced neumeister 1742 das ganze der taubenzucht 1837 s 18 also asserts that the offspring from dovecotes and various other breeds are generally very fertile and hardy birds so again mm boitard and corbie 1743 les pigeons 1824 page 35 after fortyfive years experience recommend persons to cross their breeds for amusement for if they fail to make interesting birds they will succeed under an economical point of view as it is found that mongrels are more fertile than pigeons of pure race  i will refer only to one other animal namely the hivebee because a distinguished entomologist has advanced this as a case of inevitable close interbreeding as the hive is tenanted by a single female it might have been thought that her male and female offspring would always have bred together more especially as bees of different hives are hostile to each other a strange worker being almost always attacked when trying to enter another hive but mr tegetmeier has shown 1744 proc entomolog soc august 6 1860 page 126 that this instinct does not apply to drones which are permitted to enter any hive so that there is no a priori improbability of a queen receiving a foreign drone the fact of the union invariably and necessarily taking place on the wing during the queens nuptial flight seems to be a special provision against continued interbreeding however this may be experience has shown since the introduction of the yellowbanded ligurian race into germany and england that bees freely cross mr woodbury who introduced ligurian bees into devonshire found during a single season that three stocks at distances of from one to two miles from his hives were crossed by his drones in one case the ligurian drones must have flown over the city of exeter and over several intermediate hives on another occasion several common black queens were crossed by ligurian drones at a distance of from one to three and a half miles 1745 journal of horticulture 1861 pages 39 77 158 and 1864 page 206  plants  when a single plant of a new species is introduced into any country if propagated by seed many individuals will soon be raised so that if the proper insects be present there will be crossing with newlyintroduced trees or other plants not propagated by seed we are not here concerned with old established plants it is an almost universal practice occasionally to make exchanges of seed by which means individuals which have been exposed to different conditions of lifeand this as we have seen with animals diminishes the evil from close interbreedingwill occasionally be introduced into each district  with respect to individuals belonging to the same subvariety gartner whose accuracy and experience exceeded that of all other observers states 1746 beitrage zur kenntniss der befruchtung 1844 s 366 that he has many times observed good effects from this step especially with exotic genera of which the fertility is somewhat impaired such as passiflora lobelia fuchsia herbert also says 1747 amaryllidaceae page 371 i am inclined to think that i have derived advantage from impregnating the flower from which i wished to obtain seed with pollen from another individual of the same variety or at least from another flower rather than with its own again professor lecoq ascertained that crossed offspring are more vigorous and robust than their parents 1748 de la fecondation 2nd edition 1862 page 79  general statements of this kind however can seldom be fully trusted i therefore began a long series of experiments continued for about ten years which will i think conclusively show the good effects of crossing two distinct plants of the same variety and the evil effects of longcontinued self fertilisation a clear light will thus be thrown on such questions as why flowers are almost invariably constructed so as to permit or favour or necessitate the union of two individuals we shall clearly understand why monoecious and dioeciouswhy dichogamous dimorphic and trimorphic plants exist and many other such cases i intend soon to publish an account of these experiments and i can here give only a few cases in illustration the plan which i followed was to grow plants in the same pot or in pots of the same size or close together in the open ground carefully to exclude insects and then to fertilise some of the flowers with pollen from the same flower and others on the same plant with pollen from a distinct but adjoining plant in many of these experiments the crossed plants yielded much more seed than the selffertilised plants and i have never seen the reversed case the self fertilised and crossed seeds thus obtained were allowed to germinate in the same glass vessel on damp sand and as the seeds germinated they were planted in pairs on opposite sides of the same pot with a superficial partition between them and were placed so as to be equally exposed to the light in other cases the selffertilised and crossed seeds were simply sown on opposite sides of the same small pot i have in short followed different plans but in every case have taken all the precautions which i could think of so that the two lots should be equally favoured the growth of the plants raised from the crossed and selffertilised seed were carefully observed from their germination to maturity in species belonging to fiftytwo genera and the difference in their growth and in withstanding unfavourable conditions was in most cases manifest and strongly marked it is of importance that the two lots of seed should be sown or planted on opposite sides of the same pot so that the seedlings may struggle against each other for if sown separately in ample and good soil there is often but little difference in their growth  i will briefly describe two of the first cases observed by me six crossed and six selffertilised seeds of ipomoea purpurea from plants treated in the manner above described were planted as soon as they had germinated in pairs on opposite sides of two pots and rods of equal thickness were given them to twine up five of the crossed plants grew from the first more quickly than the opposed selffertilised plants the sixth however was weakly and was for a time beaten but at last its sounder constitution prevailed and it shot ahead of its antagonist as soon as each crossed plant reached the top of its seven foot rod its fellow was measured and the result was that when the crossed plants were seven feet high the selffertilised had attained the average height of only five feet four and a half inches the crossed plants flowered a little before and more profusely than the selffertilised plants on opposite sides of another small pot a large number of crossed and selffertilised seeds were sown so that they had to struggle for bare existence a single rod was given to each lot here again the crossed plants showed from the first their advantage they never quite reached the summit of the sevenfoot rod but relatively to the selffertilised plants their average height was as seven feet to five feet two inches the experiment was repeated during several succeeding generations treated in exactly the same manner and with nearly the same result in the second generation the crossed plants which were again crossed produced 121 seedcapsules whilst the selffertilised again selffertilised produced only 84 capsules  some flowers of the mimulus luteus were fertilised with their own pollen and others were crossed with pollen from distinct plants growing in the same pot the seeds were thickly sown on opposite sides of a pot the seedlings were at first equal in height but when the young crossed plants were half an inch the selffertilised plants were only a quarter of an inch high but this degree of inequality did not last for when the crossed plants were four and a half inches high the selffertilised were three inches and they retained the same relative difference till their growth was complete the crossed plants looked far more vigorous than the uncrossed and flowered before them they produced also a far greater number of capsules as in the former case the experiment was repeated during several succeeding generations had i not watched these plants of mimulus and ipomoea during their whole growth i could not have believed it possible that a difference apparently so slight as that of the pollen being taken from the same flower or from a distinct plant growing in the same pot could have made so wonderful a difference in the growth and vigour of the plants thus produced this under a physiological point of view is a most remarkable phenomenon

mongrels by planting together six distinct varieties of cabbage these mongrels displayed an infinite diversity of character but the most remarkable circumstance was that while all the other cabbages

agricultural society 1755 gardeners chronicle 1846 page 601 specimens of crossed wheat together with their parent varieties and the editor states that they were intermediate in character united with

pedunculata alnus glutinosa and incana ulmus campestris and effusa and the crossfertilised seeds as well as seeds of the pure parenttrees were all sown at the same time and in the same place the result was that after an interval of eight years the hybrids were onethird taller than the pure trees  the facts above given refer to undoubted varieties excepting the trees crossed by clotzsch which are ranked by various botanists as stronglymarked races subspecies or species that true hybrids raised from entirely distinct species though they lose in fertility often gain in size and constitutional vigour is certain it would be superfluous to quote any facts for all experimenters kolreuter gartner herbert sageret lecoq and naudin have been struck with the wonderful vigour height

etc of his hybrids as the result of a sort of compensation due to their sterility in the same way as many emasculated animals are larger than the perfect males this view seems at first sight extremely probable and has been accepted by various authors 1761 max wichura fully accepts this view bastardbefruchtung s 43 as does the rev mj berkeley in journal of hort soc january 1866 page 70 but gartner 1762 bastarderzeugung s 394 526 528 has well remarked that there is much difficulty in fully admitting it for with many hybrids there is no parallelism between the degree of their sterility and their increased size and vigour the most striking instances of luxuriant growth have been observed with hybrids which were not sterile in any extreme degree in the genus mirabilis certain hybrids are unusually fertile and their extraordinary luxuriance of growth together with their enormous roots 1763 kolreuter nova acta 1795 page 316 have been transmitted to their progeny the result in all cases is probably in part due to the saving of nutriment and vital force through the sexual organs acting imperfectly or not at all but more especially to the general law of good being derived from a cross for it deserves especial attention that mongrel animals and plants which are so far from being sterile that their fertility is often actually augmented have as previously shown their size hardiness and constitutional vigour generally increased it is not a little remarkable that an accession of vigour and size should thus arise under the opposite contingencies of increased and diminished fertility  it is a perfectly well ascertained fact 1764 gartner bastarderzeugung s 430 that hybrids invariably breed with either pure parent and not rarely with a distinct species more readily than with one another herbert is inclined to explain even this fact by the advantage derived from a cross but gartner more justly accounts for it by the pollen of the hybrid and probably its ovules being in some degree vitiated whereas the pollen and ovules of both pure parents and of any third species are sound nevertheless there are some wellascertained and remarkable facts which as we shall presently see show that a cross by itself undoubtedly tends to increase or reestablish the fertility of hybrids  the same law namely that the crossed offspring both of varieties and species are larger than the parentforms holds good in the most striking manner with hybrid animals as well as with mongrels mr bartlett who has had such large experience says among all hybrids of vertebrated animals there is a marked increase of size he then enumerates many cases with mammals including monkeys and with various families of birds 1765 quoted by dr murie in proc zoolog soc 1870 page 40  on certain hermaphrodite plants which either normally or abnormally require to be fertilised by pollen from a distinct individual or species  the facts now to be given differ from the foregoing as selfsterility is not here the result of longcontinued close interbreeding these facts are however connected with our present subject because a cross with a distinct individual is shown to be either necessary or advantageous dimorphic and trimorphic plants though they are hermaphrodites must be reciprocally crossed one set of forms by the other in order to be fully fertile and in some cases to be fertile in any degree but i should not have noticed these plants had it not been for the following cases given by dr hildebrand 1766 botanische zeitung january 1864 s 3  primula sinensis is a reciprocally dimorphic species dr hildebrand fertilised twentyeight flowers of both forms each by pollen of the other form and obtained the full number of capsules containing on an average 427 seed per capsule here we have complete and normal fertility he then fertilised fortytwo flowers of both forms with pollen of the same form but taken from a distinct plant and all produced capsules containing on an average only 196 seed lastly and here we come to our more immediate point he fertilised fortyeight flowers of both forms with pollen of the same form and taken from the same flower and now he obtained only thirtytwo capsules and these contained on an average 186 seed or one less per capsule than in the former case so that with these illegitimate unions the act of impregnation is less assured and the fertility slightly less when the pollen and ovules belong to the same flower than when belonging to two distinct individuals of the same form dr hildebrand has recently made analogous experiments on the longstyled form of oxalis rosea with the same result 1767 monatsbericht akad wissen berlin 1866 s 372  it has recently been discovered that certain plants whilst growing in their native country under natural conditions cannot be fertilised with pollen from the same plant they are sometimes so utterly selfimpotent that though they can readily be fertilised by the pollen of a distinct species or even distinct genus yet wonderful as is the fact they never produce a single seed by their own pollen in some cases moreover the plants own pollen and stigma mutually act on each other in a deleterious manner most of the facts to be given relate to orchids but i will commence with a plant belonging to a widely different family  sixtythree flowers of corydalis cava borne on distinct plants were fertilised by dr hildebrand 1768 international hort congress london 1866 with pollen from other plants of the same species and fiftyeight capsules were obtained including on an average 45 seed in each he then fertilised sixteen flowers produced by the same raceme one with another but obtained only three capsules one of which alone contained any good seeds namely two in number lastly he fertilised twentyseven flowers each with its own pollen he left also fiftyseven flowers to be spontaneously fertilised and this would certainly have ensued if it had been possible for the anthers not only touch the stigma but the pollentubes were seen by dr hildebrand to penetrate it nevertheless these eightyfour flowers did not produce a single seedcapsule this whole case is highly instructive as it shows how widely different the action of the same pollen is according as it is placed on the stigma of the same flower or on that of another flower on the same raceme or on that of a distinct plant  with exotic orchids several analogous cases have been observed chiefly by mr john scott 1769 proc bot soc of edinburgh may 1863 these observations are given in abstract and others are added in the journal of proc of linn soc volume 8 bot 1864 page 162 oncidium sphacelatum has effective pollen for mr scott fertilised two distinct species with it the ovules are likewise capable of impregnation for they were readily fertilised by the pollen of o divaricatum nevertheless between one and two hundred flowers fertilised by their own pollen did not produce a single capsule though the stigmas were penetrated by the pollentubes mr robertson munro of the royal botanic gardens of edinburgh also informs me 1864 that a hundred and twenty flowers of this same species were fertilised by him with their own pollen and did not produce a capsule but eight flowers fertilised by the pollen of o divaricatum produced four fine capsules again between two and three hundred flowers of o divaricatum fertilised by their own pollen did not set a capsule but twelve flowers fertilised by o flexuosum produced eight fine capsules so that here we have three utterly selfimpotent species with their male and female organs perfect as shown by their mutual fertilisation in these cases fertilisation was effected only by the aid of a distinct species but as we shall presently see distinct plants raised from seed of oncidium flexuosum and probably of the other species would have been perfectly capable of fertilising each other for this is the natural process again mr scott found that the pollen of a plant of o microchilum was effective for with it he fertilised two distinct species he found its ovules good for they could be fertilised by the pollen of one of these species and by the pollen of a distinct plant of o microchilum but they could not be fertilised by pollen of the same plant though the pollentubes penetrated the stigma an analogous case has been recorded by m riviere 1770 prof lecoq de la fecondation 2nd edition 1862 page 76 with two plants of o cavendishianum which were both selfsterile but reciprocally fertilised each other all these cases refer to the genus oncidium but mr scott found that maxillaria atrorubens was totally insusceptible of fertilisation with its own pollen but fertilised and was fertilised by a widely distinct species viz m squalens  as these orchids had been grown under unnatural conditions in hothouses i concluded that their selfsterility was due to this cause but fritz muller informs me that at desterro in brazil he fertilised above one hundred flowers of the abovementioned oncidium flexuosum which is there endemic with its own pollen and with that taken from distinct plants all the former were sterile whilst those fertilised by pollen from any other plant of the same species were fertile during the first three days there was no difference in the action of the two kinds of pollen that placed on stigma of the same plant separated in the usual manner into grains and emitted tubes which penetrated the column and the stigmatic chamber shut itself but only those flowers which had been fertilised by pollen taken from a distinct plant produced seedcapsules on a subsequent occasion these experiments were repeated on a large scale with the same result fritz muller found that four other endemic species of oncidium were in like manner utterly sterile with their own pollen but fertile with that from any other plant some of them likewise produced seedcapsules when impregnated with pollen of widely distinct genera such as cyrtopodium and rodriguezia oncidium crispum however differs from the foregoing species in varying much in its self sterility some plants producing fine pods with their own pollen others failing to do so in two or three instances fritz muller observed that the pods produced by pollen taken from a distinct flower on the same plant were larger than those produced by the flowers own pollen in epidendrum cinnabarinum an orchid belonging to another division of the family fine pods were produced by the plants own pollen but they contained by weight only about half as much seed as the capsules which had been fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant and in one instance from a distinct species moreover a very large proportion and in some cases nearly all the seeds produced by the plants own pollen were destitute of an embryo some selffertilised capsules of a maxillaria were in a similar state  another observation made by fritz muller is highly remarkable namely that with various orchids the plants own pollen not only fails to impregnate the flower but acts on the stigma and is acted on in an injurious or poisonous manner this is shown by the surface of the stigma in contact with the pollen and by the pollen itself becoming in from three to five days dark brown and then decaying the discoloration and decay are not caused by parasitic cryptograms which were observed by fritz muller in only a single instance these changes are well shown by placing on the same stigma at the same time the plants own pollen and that from a distinct plant of the same species or of another species or even of another and widely remote genus thus on the stigma of oncidium flexuosum the plants own pollen and that from a distinct plant were placed side by side and in five days time the latter was perfectly fresh whilst the plants own pollen was brown on the other hand when the pollen of a distinct plant of the oncidium flexuosum and of the epidendrum zebra nov spec were placed together on the same stigma they behaved in exactly the same manner the grains separating emitting tubes and penetrating the stigma so that the two pollenmasses after an interval of eleven days could not be distinguished except by the difference of their caudicles which of course undergo no change fritz muller has moreover made a large number of crosses between orchids belonging to distinct species and genera and he finds that in all cases when the flowers are not fertilised their footstalks first begin to wither and the withering slowly spreads upwards until the germens fall off after an interval of one or two weeks and in one instance of between six and seven weeks but even in this latter case and in most other cases the pollen and stigma remained in appearance fresh occasionally however the pollen becomes brownish generally on the external surface and not in contact with the stigma as is invariably the case when the plants own pollen is applied  fritz muller observed the poisonous action of the plants own pollen in the abovementioned oncidium flexuosum o unicorne pubes  and in two other unnamed species also in two species of rodriguezia in two of notylia in one of burlingtonia and of a fourth genus in the same group in all these cases except the last it was proved that the flowers were as might have been expected fertile with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species numerous flowers of one species of notylia were fertilised with pollen from the same raceme in two days time they all withered the germens began to shrink the pollenmasses became dark brown and not one pollengrain emitted a tube so that in this orchid the injurious action of the plants own pollen is more rapid than with oncidium flexuosum eight other flowers on the same raceme were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species two of these were dissected and their stigmas were found to be penetrated by numberless pollentubes and the germens of the other six flowers became well developed on a subsequent occasion many other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and all fell off dead in a few days whilst some flowers on the same raceme which had been left simply unfertilised adhered and long remained fresh we have seen that in crossunions between extremely distinct orchids the pollen long remains undecayed but notylia behaved in this respect differently for when its pollen was placed on the stigma of oncidium flexuosum both the stigma and pollen quickly became dark brown in the same manner as if the plants own pollen had been applied  fritz muller suggests that as in all these cases the plants own pollen is not only impotent thus effectually preventing selffertilisation but likewise prevents as was ascertained in the case of the notylia and oncidium flexuosum the action of subsequently applied pollen from a distinct individual it would be an advantage to the plant to have its own pollen rendered more and more deleterious for the germens would thus quickly be killed and dropping off there would be no further waste in nourishing a part which ultimately could be of no avail  the same naturalist found in brazil three plants of a bignonia growing near together he fertilised twentynine flowerets on one of them with their own pollen and they did not set a single capsule thirty flowers were then fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant one of the three and they yielded only two capsules lastly five flowers were fertilised with pollen from a fourth plant growing at a distance and all five produced capsules fritz muller thinks that the three plants which grew near one another were probably seedlings from the same parent and that from being closely related they acted very feebly on one another this view is extremely probable for he has since shown in a remarkable paper 1771 jenaische zeitschrift fur naturwiss b 7 page 22 1872 and page 441 1873 a large part of this paper has been translated in the american naturalist 1874 page 223 that in the case of some brazilian species of abutilon which are selfsterile and between which he raised some complex hybrids that these if near relatives were much less fertile inter se than when not closely related  we now come to cases closely analogous with those just given but different in so far that only certain individuals of the species are selfsterile this selfimpotence does not depend on the pollen or ovules being in an unfit state for fertilisation for both have been found effective in union with other plants of the same or of a distinct species the fact of plants having acquired so peculiar a constitution that they can be fertilised more readily by the pollen of a distinct species than by their own is exactly the reverse of what occurs with all ordinary species for in the latter the two sexual elements of the same individual plant are of course capable of freely acting on each other but are so constituted that they are more or less impotent when brought into union with the sexual elements of a distinct species and produce more or less sterile hybrids  gartner experimented on two plants of lobelia fulgens brought from separate places and found 1772 bastarderzeugung s 64 357 that their pollen was good for he fertilised with it l cardinalis and syphilitica their ovules were likewise good for they were fertilised by the pollen of these same two species but these two plants of l fulgens could not be fertilised by their own pollen as can generally be effected with perfect ease with this species again the pollen of a plant of verbascum nigrum grown in a pot was found by gartner 1773 ibid s 357 capable of fertilising v lychnitis and v austriacum the ovules could be fertilised by the pollen of v thapsus but the flowers could not be fertilised by their own pollen kolreuter also 1774 zweite fortsetzung s 10 dritte forts s 40 mr scott likewise fertilised fiftyfour flowers of verbascum phoeniceum including two varieties with their own pollen and not a single capsule was produced many of the pollengrains emitted their tubes but only a few of them penetrated the stigmas some slight effect however was produced as many of the ovaries became somewhat developed journal asiatic soc bengal 1867 page 150 gives the case of three garden plants of verbascum phoeniceum which bore during two years many flowers these he fertilised successfully with the pollen of no less than four distinct species but they produced not a seed with their own apparently good pollen subsequently these same plants and others raised from seed assumed a strangely fluctuating condition being temporarily sterile on the male or female side or on both sides and sometimes fertile on both sides but two of the plants were perfectly fertile throughout the summer  with reseda odorata i have found certain individuals quite sterile with their own pollen and so it is with the indigenous reseda lutea the selfsterile plants of both species were perfectly fertile when crossed with pollen from any other individual of the same species these observations will hereafter be published in another work in which i shall also show that seeds sent to me by fritz muller produced by plants of eschscholtzia californica which were quite selfsterile in brazil yielded in this country plants which were only slightly selfsterile  it appears 1775 duvernoy quoted by gartner bastarderzeugung s 334 that certain flowers on certain plants of lilium candidum can be fertilised more freely by pollen from a distinct individual than by their own so again with the varieties of the potato tinzmann 1776 gardeners chronicle 1846 page 183 who made many trials with this plant says that pollen from another variety sometimes exerts a powerful influence and i have found sorts of potatoes which would not bear seed from impregnation with the pollen of their own flowers would bear it when impregnated with other pollen it does not however appear to have been proved that the pollen which failed to act on the flowers own stigma was in itself good  in the genus passiflora it has long been known that several species do not produce fruit unless fertilised by pollen taken from distinct species thus mr mowbray 1777 transact hort soc volume 7 1830 page 95 found that he could not get fruit from p alata and racemosa except by reciprocally fertilising them with each others pollen and similar facts have been observed in germany and france 1778 prof lecoq de la fecondation 1845 page 70 gartner bastarderzeugung s 64 i have received two accounts of p quadrangularis never producing fruit from its own pollen but doing so freely when fertilised in one case with the pollen of p coerulea and in another case with that of p edulis but in three other cases this species fruited freely when fertilised with its own pollen and the writer in one case attributed the favourable result to the temperature of the house having been raised from 5 deg to 10 deg fahr above the former temperature after the flowers were fertilised 1779 gardeners chronicle 1868 page 1341 with respect to p laurifolia a cultivator of much experience has recently remarked 1780 gardeners chronicle 1866 page 1068 that the flowers must be fertilised with the pollen of p coerulea or of some other common kind as their own pollen will not fertilise them but the fullest details on this subject have been given by messrs scott and robertson munro 1781 journal of proc of linn soc volume 8 1864 page 1168 mr robertson munro in trans bot soc of edinburgh volume 9 page 399 plants of passiflora racemosa coerulea and alata flowered profusely during many years in the botanic gardens of edinburgh and though repeatedly fertilised with their own pollen never produced any seed yet this occurred at once with all three species when they were crossed together in various ways in the case of p coerulea three plants two of which grew in the botanic gardens were all rendered fertile merely by impregnating each with pollen of one of the others the same result was attained in the same manner with p alata but with only one plant out of three as so many selfsterile species of passiflora have been mentioned it should be stated that the flowers of the annual p gracilis are nearly as fertile with their own pollen as with that from a distinct plant thus sixteen flowers spontaneously selffertilised produced fruit each containing on an average 213 seed whilst fruit from fourteen crossed flowers contained 241 seed  returning to p alata i have received 1866 some interesting details from mr robertson munro three plants including one in england have already been mentioned which were inveterately selfsterile and mr munro informs me of several others which after repeated trials during many years have been found in the same predicament at some other places however this species fruits readily when fertilised with its own pollen at taymouth castle there is a plant which was formerly grafted by mr donaldson on a distinct species name unknown and ever since the operation it has produced fruit in abundance by its own pollen so that this small and unnatural change in the state of this plant has restored its selffertility some of the seedlings from the taymouth castle plant were found to be not only sterile with their own pollen but with each others pollen and with the pollen of distinct species pollen from the taymouth plant failed to fertilise certain plants of the same species but was successful on one plant in the edinburgh botanic gardens seedlings were raised from this latter union and some of their flowers were fertilised by mr munro with their own pollen but they were found to be as selfimpotent as the motherplant had always proved except when fertilised by the grafted taymouth plant and except as we shall see when fertilised by her own seedlings for mr munro fertilised eighteen flowers on the selfimpotent motherplant with pollen from these her own selfimpotent seedlings and obtained remarkable as the fact is eighteen fine capsules full of excellent seed i have met with no case in regard to plants which shows so well as this of p alata on what small and mysterious causes complete fertility or complete sterility depends  the facts hitherto given relate to the muchlessened or completely destroyed fertility of pure species when impregnated with their own pollen in comparison with their fertility when impregnated by distinct individuals or distinct species but closely analogous facts have been observed with hybrids  herbert states 1782 amaryllidaceae 1837 page 371 journal of hort soc volume 2 1847 page 19 that having in flower at the same time nine hybrid hippeastrums of complicated origin descended from several species he found that almost every flower touched with pollen from another cross produced seed abundantly and those which were touched with their own pollen either failed entirely or formed slowly a pod of inferior size with fewer seeds in the horticultural journal he adds that the admission of the pollen of another crossbred hippeastrum however complicated the cross to any one flower of the number is almost sure to check the fructification of the others in a letter written to me in 1839 dr herbert says that he had already tried these experiments during five consecutive years and he subsequently repeated them with the same invariable result he was thus led to make an analogous trial on a pure species namely on the hippeastrum aulicum which he had lately imported from brazil this bulb produced four flowers three of which were fertilised by their own pollen and the fourth by the pollen of a triple cross between h bulbulosum reginae and vittatum the result was that the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow and after a few days perished entirely whereas the pod impregnated by the hybrid made vigorous and rapid progress to maturity and bore good seed which vegetated freely this is indeed as herbert remarks a strange truth but not so strange as it then appeared  as a confirmation of these statements i may add that mr m mayes 1783 loudons gardeners magazine volume 11 1835 page 260 after much experience in crossing the species of amaryllis hippeastrum says neither the species nor the hybrids will we are well aware produce seed so abundantly from their own pollen as from that of others so again mr bidwell in new south wales 1784 gardeners chronicle 1850 page 470 asserts that amaryllis belladonna bears many more seeds when fertilised by the pollen of brunswigia amaryllis of some authors josephinae or of b multiflora than when fertilised by its own pollen mr beaton dusted four flowers of a cyrtanthus with their own pollen and four with the pollen of vallota amaryllis purpurea on the seventh day those which received their own pollen slackened their growth and ultimately perished those which were crossed with the vallota held on 1785 journal hort soc volume 5 page 135 the seedlings thus raised were given to the hort soc but i find on inquiry that they unfortunately died the following winter these latter cases however relate to uncrossed species like those before given with respect to passiflora orchids etc and are here referred to only because the plants belong to the same group of amaryllidaceae  in the experiments on the hybrid hippeastrums if herbert had found that the pollen of two or three kinds alone had been more efficient on certain kinds than their own pollen it might have been argued that these from their mixed parentage had a closer mutual affinity than the others but this explanation is inadmissible for the trials were made reciprocally backwards and forwards on nine different hybrids and a cross whichever way taken always proved highly beneficial i can add a striking and analogous case from experiments made by the rev a rawson of bromley common with some complex hybrids of gladiolus this skilful horticulturist possessed a number of french varieties differing from each other only in the colour and size of the flowers all descended from gandavensis a wellknown old hybrid said to be descended from g natalensis by the pollen of g oppositiflorus 1786 mr d beaton in journal of hort 1861 page 453 lecoq however de la fecond 1862 page 369 states that this hybrid is descended from g psittacinus and cardinalis but this is opposed to herberts experience who found that the former species could not be crossed mr rawson after repeated trials found that none of the varieties would set seed with their own pollen although taken from distinct plants of the same variety which had of course been propagated by bulbs but that they all seeded freely with pollen from any other variety to give two examples ophir did not produce a capsule with its own pollen but when fertilised with that of janire brenchleyensis vulcain and linne it produced ten fine capsules but the pollen of ophir was good for when linne was fertilised by it seven capsules were produced this latter variety on the other hand was utterly barren with its own pollen which we have seen was perfectly efficient on ophir altogether mr rawson in the year 1861 fertilised twentysix flowers borne by four varieties with pollen taken from other varieties and every single flower produced a fine seedcapsule whereas fiftytwo flowers on the same plants fertilised at the same time with their own pollen did not yield a single seedcapsule mr rawson fertilised in some cases the alternate flowers and in other cases all those down one side of the spike with pollen of other varieties and the remaining flowers with their own pollen i saw these plants when the capsules were nearly mature and their curious arrangement at once brought full conviction to the mind that an immense advantage had been derived from crossing these hybrids  lastly i have heard from dr e bornet of antibes who has made numerous experiments in crossing the species of cistus but has not yet published the results that when any of these hybrids are fertile they may be said to be in regard to function dioecious for the flowers are always sterile when the pistil is fertilised by pollen taken from the same flower or from flowers on the same plant but they are often fertile if pollen be employed from a distinct individual of the same hybrid nature or from a hybrid made by a reciprocal cross  conclusion  that plants should be selfsterile although both sexual elements are in a fit state for reproduction appears at first sight opposed to all analogy with respect to the species all the individuals of which are in this state although living under their natural conditions we may conclude that their selfsterility has been acquired for the sake of effectually preventing self fertilisation the case is closely analogous with that of dimorphic and trimorphic or heterostyled plants which can be fully fertilised only by plants belonging to a different form and not as in the foregoing cases indifferently by any other individual of the species some of these hetero styled plants are completely sterile with pollen taken from the same plant or from the same form with respect to species living under their natural conditions of which only certain individuals are selfsterile as with reseda lutea it is probable that these have been rendered selfsterile to ensure occasional crossfertilisation whilst other individuals have remained self fertile to ensure the propagation of the species the case seems to be parallel with that of plants which produce as hermann muller has discovered two formsone bearing more conspicuous flowers with their structure adapted for crossfertilisation by insects and the other form with less conspicuous flowers adapted for selffertilisation the selfsterility however of some of the foregoing plants is incidental on the conditions to which they have been subjected as with the eschscholtzia the verbascum phoeniceum the sterility of which varied according to the season and with the passiflora alata which recovered its selffertility when grafted on a different stock  it is interesting to observe in the above several cases the graduated series from plants which when fertilised by their own pollen yield the full number of seeds but with the seedlings a little dwarfed in statureto plants which when selffertilised yield few seedsto those which yield none but have their ovaria somewhat developedand lastly to those in which the plants own pollen and stigma mutually act on one another like poison it is also interesting to observe on how slight a difference in the nature of the pollen or of the ovules complete selfsterility or complete selffertility must depend in some of the above cases every individual of the selfsterile species appears to be capable of producing the full complement of seed when fertilised by the pollen of any other individual though judging from the facts given with respect to abutilon the nearest kin must be excepted but not one individual can be fertilised by its own pollen as every organism differs in some slight degree from every other individual of the same species so no doubt it is with their pollen and ovules and in the above cases we must believe that complete selfsterility and complete selffertility depend on such slight differences in the ovules and pollen and not their having been differentiated in some special manner in relation to one another for it is impossible that the sexual elements of many thousand individuals should have been specialised in relation to every other individual in some however of the above cases as with certain passifloras an amount of differentiation between the pollen and ovules sufficient for fertilisation is gained only by employing pollen from a distinct species but this is probably the result of such plants having been rendered somewhat sterile from the unnatural conditions to which they have been exposed  exotic animals confined in menageries are sometimes in nearly the same state as the abovedescribed selfimpotent plants for as we shall see in the following chapter certain monkeys the larger carnivora several finches geese and pheasants cross together quite as freely as or even more freely than the individuals of the same species breed together cases will also be given of sexual incompatibility between certain male and female domesticated animals which nevertheless are fertile when matched with any other individual of the same kind  in the early part of this chapter it was shown that the crossing of individuals belonging to distinct families of the same race or to different races or species gives increased size and constitutional vigour to the offspring and except in the case of crossed species increased fertility the evidence rests on the universal testimony of breeders for it should be observed that i am not here speaking of the evil results of close interbreeding and is practically exemplified in the higher value of cross bred animals for immediate consumption the good results of crossing have also been demonstrated with some animals and with numerous plants by actual weight and measurement although animals of pure blood will obviously be deteriorated by crossing as far as their characteristic qualities are concerned there seems to be no exception to the rule that advantages of the kind just mentioned are thus gained even when there has not been any previous close interbreeding and the rule applies to such animals as cattle and sheep which can long resist breeding inandin between the nearest bloodrelations  in the case of crossed species although size vigour precocity and hardiness are with rare exceptions gained fertility in a greater or less degree is lost but the gain in the above respects can hardly be attributed to the principle of compensation for there is no close parallelism between the increased size and vigour of hybrid offspring and their sterility moreover it has been clearly proved that mongrels which are perfectly fertile gain these same advantages as well as sterile hybrids  with the higher animals no special adaptations for ensuring occasional crosses between distinct families seem to exist the eagerness of the males leading to severe competition between them is sufficient for even with gregarious animals the old and dominant males will be dispossessed after a time and it would be a mere chance if a closely related member of the same family were to be the victorious successor the structure of many of the lower animals when they are hermaphrodites is such as to prevent the ovules being fertilised by the male element of the same individual so that the concourse of two individuals is necessary in other cases the access of the male element of a distinct individual is at least possible with plants which are affixed to the ground and cannot wander from place to place like animals the numerous adaptations for crossfertilisation are wonderfully perfect as has been admitted by every one who has studied the subject  the evil consequences of longcontinued close interbreeding are not so easily recognised as the good effects from crossing for the deterioration is gradual nevertheless it is the general opinion of those who have had most experience especially with animals which propagate quickly that evil does inevitably follow sooner or later but at different rates with different animals no doubt a false belief may like a superstition prevail widely yet it is difficult to suppose that so many acute observers have all been deceived at the expense of much cost and trouble a male animal may sometimes be paired with his daughter granddaughter and so on even for seven generations without any manifest bad result but the experiment has never been tried of matching brothers and sisters which is considered the closest form of interbreeding for an equal number of generations there is good reason to believe that by keeping the members of the same family in distinct bodies especially if exposed to somewhat different conditions of life and by occasionally crossing these families the evil results of interbreeding may be much diminished or quite eliminated these results are loss of constitutional vigour size and fertility but there is no necessary deterioration in the general form of the body or in other good qualities we have seen that with pigs firstrate animals have been produced after longcontinued close interbreeding though they had become extremely infertile when paired with their near relations the loss of fertility when it occurs seems never to be absolute but only relative to animals of the same blood so that this sterility is to a certain extent analogous with that of selfimpotent plants which cannot be fertilised by their own pollen but are perfectly fertile with pollen of any other individual of the same species the fact of infertility of this peculiar nature being one of the results of longcontinued interbreeding shows that interbreeding does not act merely by combining and augmenting various morbid tendencies common to both parents for animals with such tendencies if not at the time actually ill can generally propagate their kind although offspring descended from the nearest bloodrelations are not necessarily deteriorated in structure yet some authors believe that they are eminently liable to malformations and this is not improbable as everything which lessens the vital powers acts in this manner instances of this kind have been recorded in the case of pigs bloodhounds and some other animals  finally when we consider the various facts now given which plainly show that good follows from crossing and less plainly that evil follows from close interbreeding and when we bear in mind that with very many organisms elaborate provisions have been made for the occasional union of distinct individuals the existence of a great law of nature is almost proved namely that the crossing of animals and plants which are not closely related to each other is highly beneficial or even necessary and that interbreeding prolonged during many generations is injurious   chapter 2xviii  on the advantages and disadvantages of changed conditions of life sterility from various causes  on the good derived from slight changes in the conditions of life sterility from changed conditions in animals in their native country and in menageries mammals birds and insects loss of secondary sexual characters and of instincts causes of sterility sterility of domesticated animals from changed conditions sexual incompatibility of individual animals sterility of plants from changed conditions of life contabescence of the anthers monstrosities as a cause of sterility double flowers seedless fruit sterility from the excessive development of the organs of vegetation from longcontinued propagation by buds incipient sterility the primary cause of double flowers and seedless fruit  on the good derived from slight changes in the conditions of life  in considering whether any facts were known which might throw light on the conclusion arrived at in the last chapter namely that benefits ensue from crossing and that it is a law of nature that all organic beings should occasionally cross it appeared to me probable that the good derived from slight changes in the conditions of life from being an analogous phenomenon might serve this purpose no two individuals and still less no two varieties are absolutely alike in constitution and structure and when the germ of one is fertilised by the male element of another we may believe that it is acted on in a somewhat similar manner as an individual when exposed to slightly changed conditions now every one must have observed the remarkable influence on convalescents of a change of residence and no medical man doubts the truth of this fact small farmers who hold but little land are convinced that their cattle derive great benefit from a change of pasture in the case of plants the evidence is strong that a great advantage is derived from exchanging seeds tubers bulbs and cuttings from one soil or place to another as different as possible  the belief that plants are thus benefited whether or not well founded has been firmly maintained from the time of columella who wrote shortly after the christian era to the present day and it now prevails in england france and germany 181 for england see below for germany see metzger getreidearten 1841 s 63 for france loiseleurdeslongchamps consid sur les cereales 1843 page 200 gives numerous references on this subject for southern france see godron florula juvenalis 1854 page 28 a sagacious observer bradley writing in 1724 182 a general treatise of husbandry volume 3 page 58 says when we once become masters of a good sort of seed we should at least put it into two or three hands where the soils and situations are as different as possible and every year the parties should change with one another by which means i find the goodness of the seed will be maintained for several years for want of this use many farmers have failed in their crops and been great losers he then gives his own practical experience on this head a modern writer 183 gardeners chronicle and agricult gazette 1858 page 247 and for the second statement ibid 1850 page 702 on this same subject see also rev d walker prize essay of highland agricult soc volume 2 page 200 also marshall minutes of agriculture november 1775 asserts nothing can be more clearly established in agriculture than that the continual growth of any one variety in the same district makes it liable to deterioration either in quality or quantity another writer states that he sowed close together in the same field two lots of wheatseed the product of the same original stock one of which had been grown on the same land and the other at a distance and the difference in favour of the crop from the latter seed was remarkable a gentleman in surrey who has long made it his business to raise wheat to sell for seed and who has constantly realised in the market higher prices than others assures me that he finds it indispensable continually to change his seed and that for this purpose he keeps two farms differing much in soil and elevation  with respect to the tubers of the potato i find that at the present day the practice of exchanging sets is almost everywhere followed the great growers of potatoes in lancashire formerly used to get tubers from scotland but they found that a change from the mosslands and vice versa was generally sufficient in former times in france the crop of potatoes in the vosges had become reduced in the course of fifty or sixty years in the proportion from 120150 to 3040 bushels and the famous oberlin attributed the surprising good which he effected in large part to changing the sets 184 oberlin memoirs english translation page 73 for lancashire see marshall review of reports 1808 page 295  a wellknown practical gardener mr robson 185 cottage gardener 1856 page 186 for mr robsons subsequent statements see journal of horticulture february 18 1866 page 121 for mr abbeys remarks on grafting etc ibid july 18 1865 page 44 positively states that he has himself witnessed decided advantage from obtaining bulbs of the onion tubers of the potato and various seeds all of the same kind from different soils and distant parts of england he further states that with plants propagated by cuttings as with the pelargonium and especially the dahlia manifest advantage is derived from getting plants of the same variety which have been cultivated in another place or where the extent of the place allows to take cuttings from one description of soil to plant on another so as to afford the change that seems so necessary to the wellbeing of the plants he maintains that after a time an exchange of this nature is forced on the grower whether he be prepared for it or not similar remarks have been made by another excellent gardener mr fish namely that cuttings of the same variety of calceolaria which he obtained from a neighbour showed much greater vigour than some of his own that were treated in exactly the same manner and he attributed this solely to his own plants having become to a certain extent worn out or tired of their quarters something of this kind apparently occurs in grafting and budding fruittrees for according to mr abbey grafts or buds generally take with greater facility on a distinct variety or even species or on a stock previously grafted than on stocks raised from seeds of the variety which is to be grafted and he believes this cannot be altogether explained by the stocks in question being better adapted to the soil and climate of the place it should however be added that varieties grafted or budded on very distinct kinds though they may take more readily and grow at first more vigorously than when grafted on closely allied stocks afterwards often become unhealthy  i have studied m tessiers careful and elaborate experiments 186 mem de lacad des sciences 1790 page 209 made to disprove the common belief that good is derived from a change of seed and he certainly shows that the same seed may with care be cultivated on the same farm it is not stated whether on exactly the same soil for ten consecutive years without loss another excellent observer colonel le couteur 187 on the varieties of wheat page 52 has come to the same conclusion but then he expressly adds if the same seed be used that which is grown on land manured from the mixen one year becomes seed for land prepared with lime and that again becomes seed for land dressed with ashes then for land dressed with mixed manure and so on but this in effect is a systematic exchange of seed within the limits of the same farm  on the whole the belief which has long been held by many cultivators that good follows from exchanging seed tubers etc seems to be fairly well founded it seems hardly credible that the advantage thus derived can be due to the seeds especially if very small ones obtaining in one soil some chemical element deficient in the other and in sufficient quantity to influence the whole aftergrowth of the plant as plants after once germinating are fixed to the same spot it might have been anticipated that they would show the good effects of a change more plainly than do animals which continually wander about and this apparently is the case life depending on or consisting in an incessant play of the most complex forces it would appear that their action is in some way stimulated by slight changes in the circumstances to which each organism is exposed all forces throughout nature as mr herbert spencer 188 mr spencer has fully and ably discussed this whole subject in his principles of biology 1864 volume 2 chapter 10 in the first edition of my origin of species 1859 page 267 i spoke of the good effects from slight changes in the conditions of life and from crossbreeding and of the evil effects from great changes in the conditions and from crossing widely distinct forms as a series of facts connected together by some common but unknown bond which is essentially related to the principle of life remarks tend towards an equilibrium and for the life of each organism it is necessary that this tendency should be checked these views and the foregoing facts probably throw light on the one hand on the good effects of crossing the breed for the germ will be thus slightly modified or acted on by new forces and on the other hand on the evil effects of close interbreeding prolonged during many generations during which the germ will be acted on by a male having almost identically the same constitution  sterility from changed conditions of life  i will now attempt to show that animals and plants when removed from their natural conditions are often rendered in some degree infertile or completely barren and this occurs even when the conditions have not been greatly changed this conclusion is not necessarily opposed to that at which we have just arrived namely that lesser changes of other kinds are advantageous to organic beings our present subject is of some importance from having an intimate connection with the causes of variability indirectly it perhaps bears on the sterility of species when crossed for as on the one hand slight changes in the conditions of life are favourable to plants and animals and the crossing of varieties adds to the size vigour and fertility of their offspring so on the other hand certain other changes in the conditions of life cause sterility and as this likewise ensues from crossing muchmodified forms or species we have a parallel and double series of facts which apparently stand in close relation to each other  it is notorious that many animals though perfectly tamed refuse to breed in captivity isidore geoffroy sthilaire 189 essais de zoologie generale 1841 page 256  consequently has drawn a broad distinction between tamed animals which will not breed under captivity and truly domesticated animals which breed freelygenerally more freely as shown in the sixteenth chapter than in a state of nature it is possible and generally easy to tame most animals but experience has shown that it is difficult to get them to breed regularly or even at all i shall discuss this subject in detail but will give only those cases which seem most illustrative my materials are derived from notices scattered through various works and especially from a report kindly drawn up for me by the officers of the zoological society of london which has especial value as it records all the cases during nine years from 183846 in which the animals were seen to couple but produced no offspring as well as the cases in which they never as far as known coupled this ms report i have corrected by the annual reports subsequently published up to the year 1865 1810 since the appearance of the first edition of this work mr sclater has published proc zoolog soc 1868 page 623 a list of the species of mammals which have bred in the gardens from 1848 to 1867 inclusive of the artiodactyla 85 species have been kept and of these 1 species in 19 have bred at least once during the 20 years of 28 marsupialia 1 in 25 have bred of 74 carnivora 1 in 30 have bred of 52 rodentia 1 in 47 have bred and of quadrumana 75 species have been kept and 1 in 62 have bred many facts are given on the breeding of the animals in that magnificent work gleanings from the menageries of knowsley hall by dr gray i made also particular inquiries from the experienced keeper of the birds in the old surrey zoological gardens i should premise that a slight change in the treatment of animals sometimes makes a great difference in their fertility and it is probable that the results observed in different menageries would differ indeed some animals in our zoological gardens have become more productive since the year 1846 it is also manifest from f cuviers account of the jardin des plantes 1811 du rut annales du museum 1807 tome 9 page 120 that the animals formerly bred much less freely there than with us for instance in the duck tribe which is highly prolific only one species had at that period produced young  the most remarkable cases however are afforded by animals kept in their native country which though perfectly tamed quite healthy and allowed some freedom are absolutely incapable of breeding rengger 1812 saugethiere von paraguay 1830 s 49 106 118 124 201 208 249 265 327 who in paraguay particularly attended to this subject specifies six quadrupeds in this condition and he mentions two or three others which most rarely breed mr bates in his admirable work on the amazons strongly insists on similar cases 1813 the naturalist on the amazons 1863 volume 1 pages 99 193 volume 2 page 113 and he remarks that the fact of thoroughly tamed native mammals and birds not breeding when kept by the indians cannot be wholly accounted for by their negligence or indifference for the turkey and fowl are kept and bred by various remote tribes in almost every part of the worldfor instance in the interior of africa and in several of the polynesian islands the natives are extremely fond of taming the indigenous quadrupeds and birds but they rarely or never succeed in getting them to breed  the most notorious case of an animal not breeding in captivity is that of the elephant elephants are kept in large numbers in their native indian home live to old age and are vigorous enough for the severest labour yet with a very few exceptions they have never been known even to couple though both males and females have their proper periodical seasons if however we proceed a little eastward to ava we hear from mr crawfurd 1814 embassy to the court of ava volume 1 page 534 that their breeding in the domestic state or at least in the halfdomestic state in which the female elephants are generally kept is of everyday occurrence and mr crawfurd informs me that he believes that the difference must be attributed solely to the females being allowed to roam the forest with some degree of freedom the captive rhinoceros on the other hand seems from bishop hebers account 1815 journal volume 1 page 213 to breed in india far more readily than the elephant four wild species of the horse genus have bred in europe though here exposed to a great change in their natural habits of life but the species have generally been crossed one with another most of the members of the pig family breed readily in our menageries even the red river hog potamochoerus penicillatus from the sweltering plains of west africa has bred twice in the zoological gardens here also the peccary dicotyles torquatus has bred several times but another species the d labiatus though rendered so tame as to be halfdomesticated is said to breed so rarely in its native country of paraguay that according to rengger 1816 saugethiere s 327 the fact requires confirmation mr bates remarks that the tapir though often kept tame in amazonia by the indians never breeds  ruminants generally breed quite freely in england though brought from widely different climates as may be seen in the annual reports of the zoological gardens and in the gleanings from lord derbys menagerie  the carnivora with the exception of the plantigrade division breed though with capricious exceptions about half as freely as ruminants many species of felidae have bred in various menageries although imported from diverse climates and closely confined mr bartlett the present superintendent of the zoological gardens 1817 on the breeding of the larger felidae proc zoolog soc 1861 page 140 remarks that the lion appears to breed more frequently and to bring forth more young at a birth than any other species of the family he adds that the tiger has rarely bred but there are several wellauthenticated instances of the female tiger breeding with the lion strange as the fact may appear many animals under confinement unite with distinct species and produce hybrids quite as freely as or even more freely than with their own species on inquiring from dr falconer and others it appears that the tiger when confined in india does not breed though it has been known to couple the chetah felis jubata has never been known by mr bartlett to breed in england but it has bred at frankfort nor does it breed in india where it is kept in large numbers for hunting but no pains would be taken to make them breed as only those animals which have hunted for themselves in a state of nature are serviceable and worth training 1818 sleemans rambles in india volume 2 page 10 according to rengger two species of wild cats in paraguay though thoroughly tamed have never bred although so many of the felidae breed readily in the zoological gardens yet conception by no means always follows union in the nineyear report various species are specified which were observed to couple seventythree times and no doubt this must have passed many times unnoticed yet from the seventy three unions only fifteen births ensued the carnivora in the zoological gardens were formerly less freely exposed to the air and cold than at present and this change of treatment as i was assured by the former superintendent mr miller greatly increased their fertility mr bartlett and there cannot be a more capable judge says it is remarkable that lions breed more freely in travelling collections than in the zoological gardens probably the constant excitement and irritation produced by moving from place to place or change of air may have considerable influence in the matter  many members of the dog family breed readily when confined the dhole is one of the most untamable animals in india yet a pair kept there by dr falconer produced young foxes on the other hand rarely breed and i have never heard of such an occurrence with the european fox the silver fox of north america canis argentatus however has bred several times in the zoological gardens even the otter has bred there every one knows how readily the semi domesticated ferret breeds though shut up in miserably small cages but other species of viverra and paradoxurus absolutely refuse to breed in the zoological gardens the genetta has bred both here and in the jardin des plantes and produced hybrids the herpestes fasciatus has likewise bred but i was formerly assured that the h griseus though many were kept in the gardens never bred  the plantigrade carnivora breed under confinement much less freely than other carnivora although no reason can be assigned for this fact in the nineyear report it is stated that the bears had been seen in the zoological gardens to couple freely but previously to 1848 had most rarely conceived in the reports published since this date three species have produced young hybrids in one case and wonderful to relate the white polar bear has produced young the badger meles taxus has bred several times in the gardens but i have not heard of this occurring elsewhere in england and the event must be very rare for an instance in germany has been thought worth recording 1819 wiegmann archiv fur naturgesch 1837 s 162 in paraguay the native nasua though kept in pairs during many years and perfectly tamed has never been known according to rengger to breed or show any sexual passion nor as i hear from mr bates does this animal or the cercoleptes breed in amazonia two other plantigrade genera procyon and gulo though often kept tame in paraguay never breed there in the zoological gardens species of nasua and procyon have been seen to couple but they did not produce young  as domesticated rabbits guineapigs and white mice breed so abundantly when closely confined under various climates it might have been thought that most other members of the rodent order would have bred in captivity but this is not the case it deserves notice as showing how the capacity to breed sometimes goes by affinity that the one native rodent of paraguay which there breeds freely and has yielded successive generations is the cavia aperea and this animal is so closely allied to the guineapig that it has been erroneously thought to be the parent form 1820 rengger saugethiere etc s 276 on the parentage of the guineapig see also isid geoffroy st hilaire hist nat gen i sent to mr h denny of leeds the lice which i collected from the wild aperea in la plata and he informs me that they belong to a genus distinct from those found on the guineapig this is important evidence that the aperea is not the parent of the guineapig and is worth giving as some authors erroneously suppose that the guineapig since being domesticated has become sterile when crossed with the aperea in the zoological gardens some rodents have coupled but have never produced young some have neither coupled nor bred but a few have bred as the porcupine more than once the barbary mouse lemming chinchilla and agouti dasyprocta aguti several times this latter animal has also produced young in paraguay though they were born dead and illformed but in amazonia according to mr bates it never breeds though often kept tame about the houses nor does the paca coelogenys paca breed there the common hare when confined has i believe never bred in europe though according to a recent statement it has crossed with the rabbit 1821 although the existence of the leporides as described by dr broca journal de phys tome 2 page 370 has been positively denied yet dr pigeaux annals and mag of nat hist volume 20 1867 page 75 affirms that the hare and rabbit have produced hybrids i have never heard of the dormouse breeding in confinement but squirrels offer a more curious case with one exception no species has bred in the zoological gardens yet as many as fourteen individuals of s palmarum were kept together during several years the s cinera has been seen to couple but it did not produce young nor has this species when rendered extremely tame in its native country north america been ever known to breed 1822 quadrupeds of north america by audubon and bachman 1846 page 268 at lord derbys menagerie squirrels of many kinds were kept in numbers but mr thompson the superintendent told me that none had ever bred there or elsewhere as far as he knew i have never heard of the english squirrel breeding in confinement but the species which has bred more than once in the zoological gardens is the one which perhaps might have been least expected namely the flying squirrel sciuropterus volucella it has also bred several times near birmingham but the female never produced more than two young at a birth whereas in its native american home she bears from three to six young 1823 loudons mag of nat hist volume 9 1836 page 571 audubon and bachman quadrupeds of north america page 221  monkeys in the nineyear report from the zoological gardens are stated to unite most freely but during this period though many individuals were kept there were only seven births i have heard of only one american monkey the ouistiti breeding in europe 1824 flourens de linstinct etc 1845 page 88 a macacus according to flourens bred in paris and more than one species of this genus has produced young in london especially the macacus rhesus which everywhere shows a special capacity to breed under confinement hybrids have been produced both in paris and london from this same genus the arabian baboon or cynocephalus hamadryas 1825 see annual reports zoolog soc 1855 1858 1863 1864 times newspaper august 10 1847 flourens de linstinct page 85 and a cercopithecus have bred in the zoological gardens and the latter species at the duke of northumberlands several members of the family of lemurs have produced hybrids in the zoological gardens it is much more remarkable that monkeys very rarely breed when confined in their native country thus the cay cebus azara is frequently and completely tamed in paraguay but rengger 1826 saugethiere etc s 34 49 says that it breeds so rarely that he never saw more than two females which had produced young a similar observation has been made with respect to the monkeys which are frequently tamed by the aborigines in brazil 1827 art brazil penny cyclop page 363 in amazonia these animals are so often kept in a tame state that mr bates in walking through the streets of para counted thirteen species but as he asserts they have never been known to breed in captivity 1828 the naturalist on the amazons volume 1 page 99  birds  birds offer in some respects better evidence than quadrupeds from their breeding more rapidly and being kept in greater numbers 1829 a list of the species of birds which have bred in the zoological gardens from 1848 to 1867 inclusive has been published by mr sclater in proc zoolog soc 1869 page 626 since the first edition of this work appeared of columbae 51 species have been kept and of anseres 80 species and in both these families 1 species in 26 have bred at least once in the 20 years of gallinae 83 species have been kept and 1 in 27 have bred of 57 grallae 1 in 9 have bred of 110 prehensores 1 in 22 have bred of 178 passeres 1 in 254 have bred of 94 accipitres 1 in 47 have bred of 25 picariae and of 35 herodiones not one species in either group has bred we have seen that carnivorous animals are more fertile under confinement than most other mammals the reverse holds good with carnivorous birds it is said 1830 encyclop of rural sports page 691 that as many as eighteen species have been used in europe for hawking and several others in persia and india 1831 according to sir a burnes cabool etc page 51 eight species are used for hawking in sinde they have been kept in their native country in the finest condition and have been flown during six eight or nine years 1832 loudons mag of nat hist volume 6 1833 page 110 yet there is no record of their having ever produced young as these birds were formerly caught whilst young at great expense being imported from iceland norway and sweden there can be little doubt that if possible they would have been propagated in the jardin des plantes no bird of prey has been known to couple 1833 f cuvier annal du museum tome 9 page 128 no hawk vulture or owl has ever produced fertile eggs in the zoological gardens or in the old surrey gardens with the exception in the former place on one occasion of a condor and a kite milvus niger yet several species namely the aquila fusca haliaetus leucocephalus falco tinnunculus f subbuteo and buteo vulgaris have been seen to couple in the zoological gardens mr morris 1834 the zoologist volume 78 184950 page 2648 mentions as a unique fact that a kestrel falco tinnunculus bred in an aviary the one kind of owl which has been known to couple in the zoological gardens was the eagle owl bubo maximus and this species shows a special inclination to breed in captivity for a pair at arundel castle kept more nearly in a state of nature than ever fell to the lot of an animal deprived of its liberty 1835 knox ornithological rambles in sussex page 91 actually reared their young mr gurney has given another instance of this same owl breeding in confinement and he records the case of a second species of owl the strix passerina breeding in captivity 1836 the zoologist volume 78 184950 page 2566 volume 910 18512 page 3207  of the smaller graminivorous birds many kinds have been kept tame in their native countries and have lived long yet as the highest authority on cage birds 1837 bechstein naturgesch der stubenvogel 1840 s 20 remarks their propagation is uncommonly difficult the canarybird shows that there is no inherent difficulty in these birds breeding freely in confinement and audubon says 1838 ornithological biography volume 5 page 517 that the fringilla spiza ciris of north america breeds as perfectly as the canary the difficulty with the many finches which have been kept in confinement is all the more remarkable as more than a dozen species could be named which have yielded hybrids with the canary but hardly any of these with the exception of the siskin fringilla spinus have reproduced their own kind even the bullfinch loxia pyrrhula has bred as frequently with the canary though belonging to a distinct genus as with its own species 1839 a case is recorded in the zoologist volume 12 184345 page 453 for the siskin breeding volume 34 184546 page 1075 bechstein stubenvogel s 139 speaks of bullfinches making nests but rarely producing young with respect to the skylark alauda arvensis i have heard of birds living for seven years in an aviary which never produced young and a great london birdfancier assured me that he had never known an instance of their breeding nevertheless one case has been recorded 1840 yarrell hist british birds 1839 volume 1 page 412 in the nineyear report from the zoological society twentyfour insessorial species are enumerated which had not bred and of these only four were known to have coupled  parrots are singularly longlived birds and humboldt mentions the curious fact of a parrot in south america which spoke the language of an extinct indian tribe so that this bird preserved the sole relic of a lost language even in this country there is reason to believe 1841 loudons mag of nat history volume 19 1836 page 347 that parrots have lived to the age of nearly one hundred years yet they breed so rarely though many have been kept in europe that the event has been thought worth recording in the gravest publications 1842 memoires du museum dhist nat tome 10 page 314 five cases of parrots breeding in france are here recorded see also report brit assoc zoolog 1843 nevertheless when mr buxton turned out a large number of parrots in norfolk three pairs bred and reared ten young birds in the course of two seasons and this success may be attributed to their free life 1843 annals and mag of nat hist november 1868 page 311 according to bechstein 1844 stubenvogel s 105 83 the african psittacus erithacus breeds oftener than any other species in germany the p macoa occasionally lays fertile eggs but rarely succeeds in hatching them this bird however has the instinct of incubation sometimes so strongly developed that it will hatch the eggs of fowls or pigeons in the zoological gardens and in the old surrey gardens some few species have coupled but with the exception of three species of parakeets none have bred it is a much more remarkable fact that in guiana parrots of two kinds as i am informed by sir r schomburgk are often taken from the nests by the indians and reared in large numbers they are so tame that they fly freely about the houses and come when called to be fed like pigeons yet he has never heard of a single instance of their breeding 1845 dr hancock remarks charlesworths mag of nat hist volume 2 1838 page 492 it is singular that amongst the numerous useful birds that are indigenous to guiana none are found to propagate among the indians yet the common fowl is reared in abundance throughout the country in jamaica a resident naturalist mr r hill 1846 a week at pert royal 1855 page 7 says no birds more readily submit to human dependence than the parrottribe but no instance of a parrot breeding in this tame life has been known yet mr hill specifies a number of other native birds kept tame in the west indies which never breed in this state  the great pigeon family offers a striking contrast with the parrots in the nineyear report thirteen species are recorded as having bred and what is more noticeable only two were seen to couple without any result since the above date every annual report gives many cases of various pigeons breeding the two magnificent crowned pigeons goura coronata and victoriae produced hybrids nevertheless of the former species more than a dozen birds were kept as i am informed by mr crawfurd in a park at penang under a perfectly welladapted climate but never once bred the columba migratoria in its native country north america invariably lays two eggs but in lord derbys menagerie never more than one the same fact has been observed with the c leucocephala 1847 audubon american ornithology volume 5 pages 552 557  gallinaceous birds of many genera likewise show an eminent capacity for breeding under captivity this is particularly the case with pheasants yet our english species seldom lays more than ten eggs in confinement whilst from eighteen to twenty is the usual number in the wild state 1848 mowbray on poultry 7th edition page 133 with the gallinaceae as with all other orders there are marked and inexplicable exceptions in regard to the fertility of certain species and genera under confinement although many trials have been made with the common partridge it has rarely bred even when reared in large aviaries and the hen

frequently produced young in the various european menageries even the mooruk casuarius bennetii from new ireland the african ostrich though perfectly healthy and living long in the south of france

another instance of fertility impaired but not lost under confinement as with the flying squirrel the henpheasant and two species of american pigeons  most waders can be tamed as the rev es dixon

duck family breed as readily in confinement as do the columbae and gallinae and this considering their aquatic and wandering habits and the nature of their food could not have been anticipated even some time ago above two dozen species had bred in the zoological gardens and m selyslongchamps has recorded the production of hybrids from fortyfour different members of the family and to these professor newton has added a few more cases 1856 prof newton in proc zoolog soc 1860 page 336 there is not says mr dixon 1857 the dovecote and aviary page 428 in the wide world a goose which is not in the strict sense of the word domesticable that is capable of breeding under confinement but this statement is probably too bold the capacity to breed sometimes varies in individuals of the same species thus audubon 1858 ornithological biography volume 3 page 9 kept for more than eight years some wild geese anser canadensis but they would not mate whilst other individuals of the same species produced young during the second year i know of but one instance in the whole family of a species which absolutely refuses to breed in captivity namely the dendrocygna viduata although according to sir r schomburgk 1859 geograph journal volume 13 1844 page 32 it is easily tamed and is frequently kept by the indians of guiana lastly with respect to gulls though many have been kept in the zoological gardens and in the old surrey gardens no instance was known before the year 1848 of their coupling or breeding but since that period the herring gull larus argentatus has bred many times in the zoological gardens and at knowsley  there is reason to believe that insects are affected by confinement like the higher animals it is well known that the sphingidae rarely breed when thus treated an entomologist 1860 loudons mag of nat hist volume 5 1832 page 153 in paris kept twentyfive specimens of saturnia pyri but did not succeed in getting a single fertile egg a number of females of orthosia munda and of mamestra suasa reared in confinement were unattractive to the males 1861 zoologist volumes 56 184748 page 1660 mr newport kept nearly a hundred individuals of two species of vanessa but not one paired this however might have been due to their habit of coupling on the wing 1862 transact entomolog soc volume 4 1845 page 60 mr atkinson could never succeed in india in making the tarroo silkmoth breed in confinement 1863 transact linn soc volume 7 page 40 it appears that a number of moths especially the sphingidae when hatched in the autumn out of their proper season are completely barren but this latter case is still involved in some obscurity 1864 see an interesting paper by mr newman in the zoologist 1857 page 5764 and dr wallace in proc entomolog soc june 4 1860 page 119  independently of the fact of many animals under confinement not coupling or if they couple not producing young there is evidence of another kind that their sexual functions are disturbed for many cases have been recorded of the loss by male birds when confined of their characteristic plumage thus the common linnet linota cannabina when caged does not acquire the fine crimson colour on its breast and one of the buntings emberiza passerina loses the black on its head a pyrrhula and an oriolus have been observed to assume the quiet plumage of the henbird and the falco albidus returned to the dress of an earlier age 1865 yarrell british birds volume 1 page 506 bechstein stubenvogel s 185 philosoph transact 1772 page 271 bronn geschichte der natur b 2 s 96 has collected a number of cases for the case of the deer see penny cyclop volume 8 page 350 mr thompson the superintendent of the knowsley menagerie informed me that he had often observed analogous facts the horns of a male deer cervus canadensis during the voyage from america were badly developed but subsequently in paris perfect horns were produced  when conception takes place under confinement the young are often born dead or die soon or are illformed this frequently occurs in the zoological gardens and according to rengger with native animals confined in paraguay the mothers milk often fails we may also attribute to the disturbance of the sexual functions the frequent occurrence of that monstrous instinct which leads the mother to devour her own offspringa mysterious case of perversion as it at first appears  sufficient evidence has now been advanced to prove that animals when first confined are eminently liable to suffer in their reproductive systems we feel at first naturally inclined to attribute the result to loss of health or at least to loss of vigour but this view can hardly be admitted when we reflect how healthy longlived and vigorous many animals are under captivity such as parrots and hawks when used for hawking cheetahs when used for hunting and elephants the reproductive organs themselves are not diseased and the diseases from which animals in menageries usually perish are not those which in any way affect their fertility no domestic animal is more subject to disease than the sheep yet it is remarkably prolific the failure of animals to breed under confinement has been sometimes attributed exclusively to a failure in their sexual instincts this may occasionally come into play but there is no obvious reason why this instinct should be especially liable to be affected with perfectly tamed animals except indeed indirectly through the reproductive system itself being disturbed moreover numerous cases have been given of various animals which couple freely under confinement but never conceive or if they conceive and produce young these are fewer in number than is natural to the species in the vegetable kingdom instinct of course can play no part and we shall presently see that plants when removed from their natural conditions are affected in nearly the same manner as animals change of climate cannot be the cause of the loss of fertility for whilst many animals imported into europe from extremely different climates breed freely many others when confined in their native land are completely sterile change of food cannot be the chief cause for ostriches ducks and many other animals which must have undergone a great change in this respect breed freely carnivorous birds when confined are extremely sterile whilst most carnivorous mammals except plantigrades are moderately fertile nor can the amount of food be the cause for a sufficient supply will certainly be given to valuable animals and there is no reason to suppose that much more food would be given to them than to our choice domestic productions which retain their full fertility lastly we may infer from the case of the elephant cheetah various hawks and of many animals which are allowed to lead an almost free life in their native land that want of exercise is not the sole cause  it would appear that any change in the habits of life whatever these habits may be if great enough tends to affect in an inexplicable manner the powers of reproduction the result depends more on the constitution of the species than on the nature of the change for certain whole groups are affected more than others but exceptions always occur for some species in the most fertile groups refuse to breed and some in the most sterile groups breed freely those animals which usually breed freely under confinement rarely breed as i was assured in the zoological gardens within a year or two after their first importation when an animal which is generally sterile under confinement happens to breed the young apparently do not inherit this power for had this been the case various quadrupeds and birds which are valuable for exhibition would have become common dr broca even affirms 1866 journal de physiologie tome 2 page 347 that many animals in the jardin des plantes after having produced young for three or four successive generations become sterile but this may be the result of too close interbreeding it is a remarkable circumstance that many mammals and birds have produced hybrids under confinement quite as readily as or even more readily than they have procreated their own kind of this fact many instances have been given 1867 for additional evidence on this subject see f cuvier in annales du museum tome 12 page 119 and we are thus reminded of those plants which when cultivated refuse to be fertilised by their own pollen but can easily be fertilised by that of a distinct species finally we must conclude limited as the conclusion is that changed conditions of life have an especial power of acting injuriously on the reproductive system the whole case is quite peculiar for these organs though not diseased are thus rendered incapable of performing their proper functions or perform them imperfectly  sterility of domesticated animals from changed conditions  with respect to domesticated animals as their domestication mainly depends on the accident of their breeding freely under captivity we ought not to expect that their reproductive system would be affected by any moderate degree of change those orders of quadrupeds and birds of which the wild species breed most readily in our menageries have afforded us the greatest number of domesticated productions savages in most parts of the world are fond of taming animals 1868 numerous instances could be given thus livingstone travels page 217 states that the king of the barotse an inland tribe which never had any communication with white men was extremely fond of taming animals and every young antelope was brought to him mr galton informs me that the damaras are likewise fond of keeping pets the indians of south america follow the same habit capt wilkes states that the polynesians of the samoan islands tamed pigeons and the new zealanders as mr mantell informs me kept various kinds of birds and if any of these regularly produced young and were at the same time useful they would be at once domesticated if when their masters migrated into other countries they were in addition found capable of withstanding various climates they would be still more valuable and it appears that the animals which breed readily in captivity can generally withstand different climates some few domesticated animals such as the reindeer and camel offer an exception to this rule many of our domesticated animals can bear with undiminished fertility the most unnatural conditions for instance rabbits guineapigs and ferrets breed in miserably confined hutches few european dogs of any kind withstand the climate of india without degenerating but as long as they survive they retain as i hear from dr falconer their fertility so it is according to dr daniell with english dogs taken to sierra leone the fowl a native of the hot jungles of india becomes more fertile than its parentstock in every quarter of the world until we advance as far north as greenland and northern siberia where this bird will not breed both fowls and pigeons which i received during the autumn direct from sierra leone were at once ready to couple 1869 for analogous cases with the fowl see reaumur lart de faire eclore etc 1749 page 243 and col sykes in proc zoolog soc 1832 etc with respect to the fowl not breeding in northern regions see latham hist of birds volume 8 1823 page 169 i have also seen pigeons breeding as freely as the common kinds within a year after their importation from the upper nile the guinea fowl an aboriginal of the hot and dry deserts of africa whilst living under our damp and cool climate produces a large supply of eggs  nevertheless our domesticated animals under new conditions occasionally show signs of lessened fertility roulin asserts that in the hot valleys of the equatorial cordillera sheep are not fully fecund 1870 mem par divers savans acad des sciences tome 6 1835 page 347 and according to lord somerville 1871 youatt on sheep page 181 the merinosheep which he imported from spain were not at first perfectly fertile it is said 1872 j mills treatise on cattle 1776 page 72 that mares brought up on dry food in the stable and turned out to grass do not at first breed the peahen as we have seen is said not to lay so many eggs in england as in india it was long before the canarybird was fully fertile and even now firstrate breeding birds are not common 1873 bechstein stubenvogel s 242 in the hot and dry province of delhi as i hear from dr falconer the eggs of the turkey though placed under a hen are extremely liable to fail according to roulin geese taken to the lofty plateau of bogota at first laid seldom and then only a few eggs of these scarcely a fourth were hatched and half the young birds died in the second generation they were more fertile and when roulin wrote they were becoming as fertile as our geese in europe with respect to the valley of quito mr orton says 1874 the andes and the amazon 1870 page 107 the only geese in the valley are a few imported from europe and these refuse to propagate in the philippine archipelago the goose it is asserted will not breed or even lay eggs 1875 crawford descriptive dict of the indian islands 1856 page 145 a more curious case is that of the fowl which according to roulin when first introduced would not breed at cusco in bolivia but subsequently became quite fertile and the english game fowl lately introduced had not as yet arrived at its full fertility for to raise two or three chickens from a nest of eggs was thought fortunate in europe close confinement has a marked effect on the fertility of the fowl it has been found in france that with fowls allowed considerable freedom only twenty per cent of the eggs failed when allowed less freedom forty per cent failed and in close confinement sixty out of the hundred were not hatched 1876 bull de la soc dacclimat tome 9 1862 pages 380 384 so we see that unnatural and changed conditions of life produce some effect on the fertility of our most thoroughly domesticated animals in the same manner though in a far less degree as with captive wild animals  it is by no means rare to find certain males and females which will not breed together though both are known to be perfectly fertile with other males and females we have no reason to suppose that this is caused by these animals having been subjected to any change in their habits of life therefore such cases are hardly related to our present subject the cause apparently lies in an innate sexual incompatibility of the pair which are matched several instances have been communicated to me by mr wc spooner well known for his essay on crossbreeding by mr eyton of eyton by mr wicksted and other breeders and especially by mr waring of chelsfield in relation to horses cattle pigs foxhounds other dogs and pigeons 1877 for pigeons see dr chapuis le pigeon voyageur belge 1865 page 66 in these cases females which either previously or subsequently were proved to be fertile failed to breed with certain males with whom it was particularly desired to match them a change in the constitution of the female may sometimes have occurred before she was put to the second male but in other cases this explanation is hardly tenable for a female known not to be barren has been unsuccessfully paired seven or eight times with the same male likewise known to be perfectly fertile with cartmares which sometimes will not breed with stallions of pure blood but subsequently have bred with cartstallions mr spooner is inclined to attribute the failure to the lesser sexual power of the racehorse but i have heard from the greatest breeder of racehorses at the present day through mr waring that it frequently occurs with a mare to be put several times during one or two seasons to a particular stallion of acknowledged power and yet prove barren the mare afterwards breeding at once with some other horse these facts are worth recording as they show like so many previous facts on what slight constitutional differences the fertility of an animal often depends  sterility of plants from changed conditions of life and from other causes  in the vegetable kingdom cases of sterility frequently occur analogous with those previously given in the animal kingdom but the subject is obscured by several circumstances presently to be discussed namely the contabescence of the anthers as gartner has named a certain affectionmonstrosities doubleness of the flowermuchenlarged fruitand longcontinued or excessive propagation by buds  it is notorious that many plants in our gardens and hothouses though preserved in the most perfect health rarely or never produce seed i do not allude to plants which run to leaves from being kept too damp or too warm or too much manured for these do not flower and the case may be wholly different nor do i allude to fruit not ripening from want of heat or rotting from too much moisture but many exotic plants with their ovules and pollen appearing perfectly sound will not set any seed the sterility in many cases as i know from my own observation is simply due to the absence of the proper insects for carrying the pollen to the stigma but after excluding the several cases just specified there are many plants in which the reproductive system has been seriously affected by the altered conditions of life to which they have been subjected  it would be tedious to enter on many details linnaeus long ago observed 1878 swedish acts volume 1 1739 page 3 pallas makes the same remark in his travels english translation volume 1 page 292 that alpine plants although naturally loaded with seed produce either few or none when cultivated in gardens but exceptions often occur the draba sylvestris one of our most thoroughly alpine plants multiplies itself by seed in mr hc watsons garden near london and kerner who has particularly attended to the cultivation of alpine plants found that various kinds when cultivated spontaneously sowed themselves 1879 a kerner die cultur der alpenpflanzen 1864 s 139 watson cybele britannica volume 1 page 131 mr d cameron also has written on the culture of alpine plants in gard chronicle 1848 pages 253 268 and mentions a few which seed many plants which naturally grow in peatearth are entirely sterile in our gardens i have noticed the same fact with several liliaceous plants which nevertheless grew vigorously  too much manure renders some kinds utterly sterile as i have myself observed the tendency to sterility from this cause runs in families thus according to gartner 1880 beitrage zur kenntniss der befruchtung 1844 s 333 it is hardly possible to give too much manure to most gramineae cruciferae and leguminosae whilst succulent and bulbousrooted plants are easily affected extreme poverty of soil is less apt to induce sterility but dwarfed plants of trifolium minus and repens growing on a lawn often mown and never manured were found by me not to produce any seed the temperature of the soil and the season at which plants are watered often have a marked effect on their fertility as was observed by kolreuter in the case of mirabilis 1881 nova acta petrop 1793 page 391 mr scott in the botanic gardens of edinburgh observed that oncidium divaricatum would not set seed when grown in a basket in which it throve but was capable of fertilisation in a pot where it was a little damper pelargonium fulgidum for many years after its introduction seeded freely it then became sterile now it is fertile 1882 cottage gardener 1856 pages 44 109 if kept in a dry stove during the winter other varieties of pelargonium are sterile and others fertile without our being able to assign any cause very slight changes in the position of a plant whether planted on a bank or at its base sometimes make all the difference in its producing seed temperature apparently has a much more powerful influence on the fertility of plants than on that of animals nevertheless it is wonderful what changes some few plants will withstand with undiminished fertility thus the zephyranthes candida a native of the moderately warm banks of the plata sows itself in the hot dry country near lima and in yorkshire resists the severest frosts and i have seen seeds gathered from pods which had been covered with snow during three weeks 1883 dr herbert amaryllidaceae page 176 berberis wallichii from the hot khasia range in india is uninjured by our sharpest frosts and ripens its fruit under our cool summers nevertheless i presume we must attribute to change of climate the sterility of many foreign plants thus the persian and chinese lilacs syringa persica and chinensis though perfectly hardy here never produce a seed the common lilac s vulgaris seeds with us moderately well but in parts of germany the capsules never contain seed 1884 gartner beitrage zur kenntniss etc s 560 564 some few of the cases given in the last chapter of selfimpotent plants might have been here introduced as their state seems due to the conditions to which they have been subjected  the liability of plants to be affected in their fertility by slightly changed conditions is the more remarkable as the pollen when once in process of formation is not easily injured a plant may be transplanted or a branch with flowerbuds be cut off and placed in water and the pollen will be matured pollen also when once mature may be kept for weeks or even months 1885 gardeners chronicle 1844 page 215 1850 page 470 faivre gives a good resume on this subject in his la variabilite des especes 1868 page 155 the female organs are more sensitive for gartner 1886 beitrage zur kenntniss etc s 252 338 found that dicotyledonous plants when carefully removed so that they did not in the least flag could seldom be fertilised this occurred even with potted plants if the roots had grown out of the hole at the bottom in some few cases however as with digitalis transplantation did not prevent fertilisation and according to the testimony of mawz brassica rapa when pulled up by its roots and placed in water ripened its seed flowerstems of several monocotyledonous plants when cut off and placed in water likewise produce seed but in these cases i presume that the flowers had been already fertilised for herbert 1887 journal of hort soc volume 2 1847 page 83 found with the crocus that the plants might be removed or mutilated after the act of fertilisation and would still perfect their seeds but that if transplanted before being fertilised the application of pollen was powerless  plants which have been long cultivated can generally endure with undiminished fertility various and great changes but not in most cases so great a change of climate as domesticated animals it is remarkable that many plants under these circumstances are so much affected that the proportion and the nature of their chemical ingredients are modified yet their fertility is unimpaired thus as dr falconer informs me there is a great difference in the character of the fibre in hemp in the quantity of oil in the seed of the linum in the proportion of narcotin to morphine in the poppy in gluten to starch in wheat when these plants are cultivated on the plains and on the mountains of india nevertheless they all remain fully fertile  contabescence  gartner has designated by this term a peculiar condition of the anthers in certain plants in which they are shrivelled or become brown and tough and contain no good pollen when in this state they exactly resemble the anthers of the most sterile hybrids gartner 1888 beitrage zur kenntniss etc s 117 et seq kolreuter zweite fortsetzung s 10 121 dritte fortsetzung s 57 herbert amaryllidaceae page 355 wiegmann ueber die bastarderzeugung s 27 in his discussion on this subject has shown that plants of many orders are occasionally thus affected but the caryophyllaceae and liliaceae suffer most and to these orders i think the ericaceae may be added contabescence varies in degree but on the same plant all the flowers are generally affected to nearly the same extent the anthers are affected at a very early period in the flowerbud and remain in the same state with one recorded exception during the life of the plant the affection cannot be cured by any change of treatment and is propagated by layers cuttings etc and perhaps even by seed in contabescent plants the female organs are seldom affected or merely become precocious in their development the cause of this affection is doubtful and is different in different cases until i read gartners discussion i attributed it as apparently did herbert to the unnatural treatment of the plants but its permanence under changed conditions and the female organs not being affected seem incompatible with this view the fact of several endemic plants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems at first sight equally incompatible with this view but kolreuter believes that this is the result of their transplantation the contabescent plants of dianthus and verbascum found wild by wiegmann grew on a dry and sterile bank the fact that exotic plants are eminently liable to this affection also seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their unnatural treatment in some instances as with silene gartners view seems the most probable namely that it is caused by an inherent tendency in the species to become dioecious i can add another cause namely the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants for i have observed seedlings of three species of primula and of lythrum salicaria which had been raised from plants illegitimately fertilised by their ownform pollen with some or all their anthers in a contabescent state there is perhaps an additional cause namely selffertilisation for many plants of dianthus and lobelia which had been raised from selffertilised seeds had their anthers in this state but these instances are not conclusive as both genera are liable from other causes to this affection  cases of an opposite nature likewise occur namely plants with the female organs struck with sterility whilst the male organs remain perfect dianthus japonicus a passiflora and nicotiana have been described by gartner 1889 bastarderzengung s 356 as being in this unusual condition  monstrosities as a cause of sterility  great deviations of structure even when the reproductive organs themselves are not seriously affected sometimes cause plants to become sterile but in other cases plants may become monstrous to an extreme degree and yet retain their full fertility gallesio who certainly had great experience 1890 teoria della riproduzione 1816 page 84 traite du citrus 1811 page 67 often attributes sterility to this cause but it may be suspected that in some of his cases sterility was the cause and not the result of the monstrous growths the curious st valery apple although it bears fruit rarely produces seed the wonderfully anomalous flowers of begonia frigida formerly described though they appear fit for fructification are sterile 1891 mr cw crocker in gardeners chronicle 1861 page 1092 species of primula in which the calyx is brightly coloured are said 1892 verlot des varietes 1865 page 80 to be often sterile though i have known them to be fertile on the other hand verlot gives several cases of proliferous flowers which can be propagated by seed this was the case with a poppy which had become monopetalous by the union of its petals 1893 verlot ibid page 88 another extraordinary poppy with the stamens replaced by numerous small supplementary capsules likewise reproduces itself by seed this has also occurred with a plant of saxifraga geum in which a series of adventitious carpels bearing ovules on their margins had been developed between the stamens and the normal carpels 1894 prof allman brit assoc quoted in the phytologist volume 2 page 483 prof harvey on the authority of mr andrews who discovered the plant informed me that this monstrosity could be propagated by seed with respect to the poppy see prof goeppert as quoted in journal of horticulture july 1 1863 page 171 lastly with respect to peloric flowers which depart wonderfully from the natural structurethose of linaria vulgaris seem generally to be more or less sterile whilst those before described of antirrhinum majus when artificially fertilised with their own pollen are perfectly fertile though sterile when left to themselves for bees are unable to crawl into the narrow tubular flower the peloric flowers of corydalis solida according to godron 1895 comptes rendus december 19 1864 page 1039 are sometimes barren and sometimes fertile whilst those of gloxinia are well known to yield plenty of seed in our greenhouse pelargoniums the central flower of the truss is often peloric and mr masters informs me that he tried in vain during several years to get seed from these flowers i likewise made many vain attempts but sometimes succeeded in fertilising them with pollen from a normal flower of another variety and conversely i several times fertilised ordinary flowers with peloric pollen only once i succeeded in raising a plant from a peloric flower fertilised by pollen from a peloric flower borne by another variety but the plant it may be added presented nothing particular in its structure hence we may conclude that no general rule can be laid down but any great deviation from the normal structure even when the reproductive organs themselves are not seriously affected certainly often leads to sexual impotence  double flowers  when the stamens are converted into petals the plant becomes on the male side sterile when both stamens and pistils are thus changed the plant becomes completely barren symmetrical flowers having numerous stamens and petals are the most liable to become double as perhaps follows from all multiple organs being the most subject to variability but flowers furnished with only a few stamens and others which are asymmetrical in structure sometimes become double as we see with the double gorse or ulex and antirrhinum the compositae bear what are called double flowers by the abnormal development of the corolla of their central florets doubleness is sometimes connected with prolification 1896 gardeners chronicle 1866 page 681 or the continued growth of the axis of the flower doubleness is strongly inherited no one has produced as lindley remarks 1897 theory of horticulture page 333 double flowers by promoting the perfect health of the plant on the contrary unnatural conditions of life favour their production there is some reason to believe that seeds kept during many years and seeds believed to be imperfectly fertilised yield double flowers more freely than fresh and perfectly fertilised

the rule have lately been recorded 18100 gardeners chronicle 1865 page 626 1866 pages 290 730 and verlot des varietes page 75 that though general it cannot be looked at as invariable variegation seems generally to result from a feeble or atrophied condition of the plant and a large proportion of the seedlings raised from parents if both are variegated usually perish at an early age hence we may perhaps infer that doubleness which is the antagonistic state commonly arises from a plethoric condition on the other hand extremely poor soil sometimes though rarely appears to cause doubleness i

gartner bastarderzeugung s 567 found several wild plants growing near a hot spring with double flowers with respect to the cause of doubleness which arises as we see under widely different circumstances i shall presently attempt to show that the most probable view is that unnatural conditions first give a tendency to sterility and that then on the principle of compensation as the reproductive organs do not perform their proper functions they either become developed into petals or additional petals are formed this view has lately been supported by mr laxton 18103 gardeners

produces bulbs but no seeds whilst a poor soil and dry climate lead to an opposite result in china according to mr fortune an extraordinary number of little bulbs are developed in the axils of the leaves of the yam and this plant does not bear seed whether in these cases as in those of double flowers and seedless fruit sexual sterility from changed conditions of life is the primary cause which leads to the excessive development of the organs of vegetation is doubtful though some evidence might be advanced in favour of this view it is perhaps a more probable view that plants which propagate themselves largely by one method namely by buds have not sufficient vital power or organised matter for the other method of sexual generation  several distinguished botanists and good practical judges believe that long continued propagation by cuttings runners tubers bulbs etc independently of any excessive development of these parts is the cause of many plants failing to produce flowers or producing only barren flowersit is as if they had lost the habit of sexual generation 18109 godron de lespece tome 2 page 106 herbert on crocus in journal of hort soc volume 1 1846 page 254 dr wight from what he has seen in india believes in this view madras journal of lit and science volume 4 1836 page 61 that many plants when thus propagated are sterile there can be no doubt but as to whether the long continuance of this form of propagation is the actual cause of their sterility i will not venture from the want of sufficient evidence to express an opinion  that plants may be propagated for long periods by buds without the aid of sexual generation we may safely infer from this being the case with many plants which must have long survived in a state of nature as i have had occasion before to allude to this subject i will here give such cases as i have collected many alpine plants ascend mountains beyond the height at which they can produce seed 18110 wahlenberg specifies eight species

other analogous cases see more especially on this plant and on other allied cases prof caspary die nuphar abhand naturw gesellsch zu halle b 11 1870 page 40 78 other cases analogous with the foregoing could be given for instance some kinds of mosses and lichens have never been seen to fructify in france  some of these endemic and naturalised plants are probably rendered sterile from excessive multiplication by buds and their consequent incapacity to produce and nourish seed but the sterility of others more probably depends on the peculiar conditions under which they live as in the case of the ivy in the northern part of europe and of the trees in the swamps of the united states yet these plants must be in some respects eminently well adapted for the stations which they occupy for they hold their places against a host of competitors  finally the high degree of sterility which often accompanies the doubling of flowers or an excessive development of fruit seldom supervenes at once an incipient tendency is observed and continued selection completes the result the view which seems the most probable and which connects together all the foregoing facts and brings them within our present subject is that changed and unnatural conditions of life first give a tendency to sterility and in consequence of this the organs of reproduction being no longer able fully to perform their proper functions a supply of organised matter not required for the development of the seed flows either into these organs and renders them foliaceous or into the fruit stems tubers etc increasing their size and succulency but it is probable that there exists independently of any incipient sterility an antagonism between the two forms of reproduction namely by seed and buds when either is carried to an extreme degree that incipient sterility plays an important part in the doubling of flowers and in the other cases just specified i infer chiefly from the following facts when fertility is lost from a wholly different cause namely from hybridism there is a strong tendency as gartner 18118 bastarderzeugung s 565 kolreuter dritte fortsetzung s 73 87 119 also shows that when two species one single and the other double are crossed the hybrids are apt to be extremely double affirms for flowers to become double and this tendency is inherited moreover it is notorious that with hybrids the male organs become sterile before the female organs and with double flowers the stamens first become foliaceous this latter fact is well shown by the male flowers of dioecious plants which according to gallesio 18119 teoria della riproduzione veg 1816 page 73 first become double again gartner 18120 bastarderzeugung s 573 often insists that the flowers of even utterly sterile hybrids which do not produce any seed generally yield perfect capsules or fruita fact which has likewise been repeatedly observed by naudin with the cucurbitaceae so that the production of fruit by plants rendered sterile through any cause is intelligible kolreuter has also expressed his unbounded astonishment at the size and development of the tubers in certain hybrids and all experimentalists 18121 ibid s 527 have remarked on the strong tendency in hybrids to increase by roots runners and suckers seeing that hybrid plants which from their nature are more or less sterile thus tend to produce double flowers that they have the parts including the seed that is the fruit perfectly developed even when containing no seed that they sometimes yield gigantic roots that they almost invariably tend to increase largely by suckers and other such meansseeing this and knowing from the many facts given in the earlier parts of this chapter that almost all organic beings when exposed to unnatural conditions tend to become more or less sterile it seems much the most probable view that with cultivated plants sterility is the exciting cause and double flowers rich seedless fruit and in some cases largelydeveloped organs of vegetation etc are the indirect resultsthese results having been in most cases largely increased through continued selection by man   chapter 2xix  summary of the four last chapters with remarks on hybridism  on the effects of crossing the influence of domestication on fertility close interbreeding good and evil results from changed conditions of life varieties when crossed not invariably fertile on the difference in fertility between crossed species and varieties conclusions with respect to hybridism light thrown on hybridism by the illegitimate progeny of heterostyled plants sterility of crossed species due to differences confined to the reproductive system not accumulated through natural selection reasons why domestic varieties are not mutually sterile too much stress has been laid on the difference in fertility between crossed species and crossed varieties conclusion  it was shown in the fifteenth chapter that when individuals of the same variety or even of a distinct variety are allowed freely to intercross uniformity of character is ultimately acquired some few characters however are incapable of fusion but these are unimportant as they are often of a semimonstrous nature and have suddenly appeared hence to preserve our domesticated breeds true or to improve them by methodical selection it is obviously necessary that they should be kept separate nevertheless a whole body of individuals may be slowly modified through unconscious selection as we shall see in a future chapter without separating them into distinct lots domestic races have often been intentionally modified by one or two crosses made with some allied race and occasionally even by repeated crosses with very distinct races but in almost all such cases longcontinued and careful selection has been absolutely necessary owing to the excessive variability of the crossed offspring due to the principle of reversion in a few instances however mongrels have retained a uniform character from their first production  when two varieties are allowed to cross freely and one is much more numerous than the other the former will ultimately absorb the latter should both varieties exist in nearly equal numbers it is probable that a considerable period would elapse before the acquirement of a uniform character and the character ultimately acquired would largely depend on prepotency of transmission and on the conditions of life for the nature of these conditions would generally favour one variety more than another so that a kind of natural selection would come into play unless the crossed offspring were slaughtered by man without the least discrimination some degree of unmethodical selection would likewise come into action from these several considerations we may infer that when two or more closely allied species first came into the possession of the same tribe their crossing will not have influenced in so great a degree as has often been supposed the character of the offspring in future times although in some cases it probably has had a considerable effect  domestication as a general rule increases the prolificness of animals and plants it eliminates the tendency to sterility which is common to species when first taken from a state of nature and crossed on this latter head we have no direct evidence but as our races of dogs cattle pigs etc are almost certainly descended from aboriginally distinct stocks and as these races are now fully fertile together or at least incomparably more fertile than most species when crossed we may with entire confidence accept this conclusion  abundant evidence has been given that crossing adds to the size vigour and fertility of the offspring this holds good when there has been no previous close interbreeding it applies to the individuals of the same variety but belonging to different families to distinct varieties subspecies and even to species in the latter case though size is gained fertility is lost but the increased size vigour and hardiness of many hybrids cannot be accounted for solely on the principle of compensation from the inaction of the reproductive system certain plants whilst growing under their natural conditions others when cultivated and others of hybrid origin are completely selfimpotent though perfectly healthy and such plants can be stimulated to fertility only by being crossed with other individuals of the same or of a distinct species  on the other hand longcontinued close interbreeding between the nearest relations diminishes the constitutional vigour size and fertility of the offspring and occasionally leads to malformations but not necessarily to general deterioration of form or structure this failure of fertility shows that the evil results of interbreeding are independent of the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents though this augmentation no doubt is often highly injurious our belief that evil follows from close interbreeding rests to a certain extent on the experience of practical breeders especially of those who have reared many animals of quickly propagating kinds but it likewise rests on several carefully recorded experiments with some animals close interbreeding may be carried on for a long period with impunity by the selection of the most vigorous and healthy individuals but sooner or later evil follows the evil however comes on so slowly and gradually that it easily escapes observation but can be recognised by the almost instantaneous manner in which size constitutional vigour and fertility are regained when animals that have long been interbred are crossed with a distinct family  these two great classes of facts namely the good derived from crossing and the evil from close interbreeding with the consideration of the innumerable adaptations throughout nature for compelling or favouring or at least permitting the occasional union of distinct individuals taken together lead to the conclusion that it is a law of nature that organic beings shall not fertilise themselves for perpetuity this law was first plainly hinted at in 1799 with respect to plants by andrew knight 191 transactions phil soc 1799 page 202 for kolreuter see mem de lacad de stpetersbourg tome 3 1809 published 1811 page 197 in reading ck sprengels remarkable work das entdeckte geheimniss etc 1793 it is curious to observe how often this wonderfully acute observer failed to understand the full meaning of the structure of the flowers which he has so well described from not always having before his mind the key to the problem namely the good derived from the crossing of distinct individual plants and not long afterwards that sagacious observer kolreuter after showing how well the malvaceae are adapted for crossing asks an id aliquid in recessu habeat quod hujuscemodi flores nunquam proprio suo pulvere sed semper eo aliarum su speciei impregnentur merito quaritur certe natura nil facit frustra although we may demur to kolreuters saying that nature does nothing in vain seeing how many rudimentary and useless organs there are yet undoubtedly the argument from the innumerable contrivances which favour crossing is of the greatest weight the most important result of this law is that it leads to uniformity of character in the individuals of the same species in the case of certain hermaphrodites which probably intercross only at long intervals of time and with unisexual animals inhabiting somewhat separated localities which can only occasionally come into contact and pair the greater vigour and fertility of the crossed offspring will ultimately tend to give uniformity of character but when we go beyond the limits of the same species free intercrossing is barred by the law of sterility  in searching for facts which might throw light on the cause of the good effects from crossing and of the evil effects from close interbreeding we have seen that on the one hand it is a widely prevalent and ancient belief that animals and plants profit from slight changes in their condition of life and it would appear that the germ in a somewhat analogous manner is more effectually stimulated by the male element when taken from a distinct individual and therefore slightly modified in nature than when taken from a male having the same identical constitution on the other hand numerous facts have been given showing that when animals are first subjected to captivity even in their native land and although allowed much liberty their reproductive functions are often greatly impaired or quite annulled some groups of animals are more affected than others but with apparently capricious exceptions in every group some animals never or rarely couple under confinement some couple freely but never or rarely conceive the secondary male characters the maternal functions and instincts are occasionally affected with plants when first subjected to cultivation analogous facts have been observed we probably owe our double flowers rich seedless fruits and in some cases greatly developed tubers etc to incipient sterility of the above nature combined with a copious supply of nutriment animals which have long been domesticated and plants which have long been cultivated can generally withstand with unimpaired fertility great changes in their conditions of life though both are sometimes slightly affected with animals the somewhat rare capacity of breeding freely under confinement together with their utility mainly determine the kinds which have been domesticated  we can in no case precisely say what is the cause of the diminished fertility of an animal when first captured or of a plant when first cultivated we can only infer that it is caused by a change of some kind in the natural conditions of life the remarkable susceptibility of the reproductive system to such changesa susceptibility not common to any other organapparently has an important bearing on variability as we shall see in a future chapter  it is impossible not to be struck with the double parallelism between the two classes of facts just alluded to on the one hand slight changes in the conditions of life and crosses between slightly modified forms or varieties are beneficial as far as prolificness and constitutional vigour are concerned on the other hand changes in the conditions greater in degree or of a different nature and crosses between forms which have been slowly and greatly modified by natural meansin other words between speciesare highly injurious as far as the reproductive system is concerned and in some few instances as far as constitutional vigour is concerned can this parallelism be accidental does it not rather indicate some real bond of connection as a fire goes out unless it be stirred up so the vital forces are always tending according to mr herbert spencer to a state of equilibrium unless disturbed and renovated through the action of other forces  in some few cases varieties tend to keep distinct by breeding at different seasons by great difference in size or by sexual preference but the crossing of varieties far from diminishing generally adds to the fertility of the first union and of the mongrel offspring whether all the more widely distinct domestic varieties are invariably quite fertile when crossed we do not positively know much time and trouble would be requisite for the necessary experiments and many difficulties occur such as the descent of the various races from aboriginally distinct species and the doubts whether certain forms ought to be ranked as species or varieties nevertheless the wide experience of practical breeders proves that the great majority of varieties even if some should hereafter prove not to be indefinitely fertile inter se are far more fertile when crossed than the vast majority of closely allied natural species a few remarkable cases have however been given on the authority of excellent observers showing that with plants certain forms which undoubtedly must be ranked as varieties yield fewer seeds when crossed than is natural to the parentspecies other varieties have had their reproductive powers so far modified that they are either more or less fertile than their parents when crossed with a distinct species  nevertheless the fact remains indisputable that domesticated varieties of animals and of plants which differ greatly from one another in structure but which are certainly descended from the same aboriginal species such as the races of the fowl pigeon many vegetables and a host of other productions are extremely fertile when crossed and this seems to make a broad and impassable barrier between domestic varieties and natural species but as i will now attempt to show the distinction is not so great and overwhelmingly important as it at first appears  on the difference in fertility between varieties and species when crossed  this work is not the proper place for fully treating the subject of hybridism and i have already given in my origin of species a moderately full abstract i will here merely enumerate the general conclusions which may be relied on and which bear on our present point  firstly  the laws governing the production of hybrids are identical or nearly identical in the animal and vegetable kingdoms  secondly  the sterility of distinct species when first united and that of their hybrid offspring graduate by an almost infinite number of steps from zero when the ovule is never impregnated and a seedcapsule is never formed up to complete fertility we can only escape the conclusion that some species are fully fertile when crossed by determining to designate as varieties all the forms which are quite fertile this high degree of fertility is however rare nevertheless plants which have been exposed to unnatural conditions sometimes become modified in so peculiar a manner that they are much more fertile when crossed with a distinct species than when fertilised by their own pollen success in effecting a first union between two species and the fertility of their hybrids depend in an eminent degree on the conditions of life being favourable the innate sterility of hybrids of the same parentage and raised from the same seedcapsule often differs much in degree  thirdly  the degree of sterility of a first cross between two species does not always run strictly parallel with that of their hybrid offspring many cases are known of species which can be crossed with ease but yield hybrids excessively sterile and conversely some which can be crossed with great difficulty but produce fairly fertile hybrids this is an inexplicable fact on the view that species have been specially endowed with mutual sterility in order to keep them distinct  fourthly  the degree of sterility often differs greatly in two species when reciprocally crossed for the first will readily fertilise the second but the latter is incapable after hundreds of trials of fertilising the former hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses between the same two species likewise sometimes differ in their degree of sterility these cases also are utterly inexplicable on the view of sterility being a special endowment  fifthly  the degree of sterility of first crosses and of hybrids runs to a certain extent parallel with the general or systematic affinity of the forms which are united for species belonging to distinct genera can rarely and those belonging to distinct families can never be crossed the parallelism however is far from complete for a multitude of closely allied species will not unite or unite with extreme difficulty whilst other species widely different from one another can be crossed with perfect facility nor does the difficulty depend on ordinary constitutional differences for annual and perennial plants deciduous and evergreen trees plants flowering at different seasons inhabiting different stations and naturally living under the most opposite climates can often be crossed with ease the difficulty or facility apparently depends exclusively on the sexual constitution of the species which are crossed or on their sexual elective affinity ie wahlverwandtschaft of gartner as species rarely or never become modified in one character without being at the same time modified in many characters and as systematic affinity includes all visible similarities and dissimilarities any difference in sexual constitution between two species would naturally stand in more or less close relation with their systematic position  sixthly  the sterility of species when first crossed and that of hybrids may possibly depend to a certain extent on distinct causes with pure species the reproductive organs are in a perfect condition whilst with hybrids they are often plainly deteriorated a hybrid embryo which partakes of the constitution of its father and mother is exposed to unnatural conditions as long as it is nourished within the womb or egg or seed of the motherform and as we know that unnatural conditions often induce sterility the reproductive organs of the hybrid might at this early age be permanently affected but this cause has no bearing on the infertility of first unions the diminished number of the offspring from first unions may often result as is certainly sometimes the case from the premature death of most of the hybrid embryos but we shall immediately see that a law of an unknown nature apparently exists which leads to the offspring from unions which are infertile being themselves more or less infertile and this at present is all that can be said  seventhly  hybrids and mongrels present with the one great exception of fertility the most striking accordance in all other respects namely in the laws of their resemblance to their two parents in their tendency to reversion in their variability and in being absorbed through repeated crosses by either parent form  after arriving at these conclusions i was led to investigate a subject which throws considerable light on hybridism namely the fertility of heterostyled or dimorphic and trimorphic plants when illegitimately united i have had occasion several times to allude to these plants and i may here give a brief abstract of my observations several plants belonging to distinct orders present two forms which exist in about equal numbers and which differ in no respect except in their reproductive organs one form having a long pistil with short stamens the other a short pistil with long stamens both with differently sized pollengrains with trimorphic plants there are three forms likewise differing in the lengths of their pistils and stamens in the size and colour of the pollengrains and in some other respects and as in each of the three forms there are two sets of stamens there are altogether six sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils these organs are so proportioned in length to one another that in any two of the forms half the stamens in each stand on a level with the stigma of the third form now i have shown and the result has been confirmed by other observers that in order to obtain full fertility with these plants it is necessary that the stigma of the one form should be fertilised by pollen taken from the stamens of corresponding height in the other form so that with dimorphic species two unions which may be called legitimate are fully fertile and two which may be called illegitimate are more or less infertile with trimorphic species six unions are legitimate or fully fertile and twelve are illegitimate or more or less infertile 192 my observations on the character and hybridlike nature of the offspring from the illegitimate union of dimorphic and trimorphic plants were published in the journal of the linnean soc volume 10 page 393 the abstract here given is nearly the same with that which appeared in the 6th edition of my origin of species  the infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and trimorphic plants when illegitimately fertilised that is by pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil differs much in degree up to absolute and utter sterility just in the same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species as the degree of sterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the conditions of life being more or less favourable so i have found it with illegitimate unions it is well known that if pollen of a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a flower and its own pollen be afterwards even after a considerable interval of time placed on the same stigma its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen so it is with the pollen of the several forms of the same species for legitimate pollen is strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen when both are placed on the same stigma i ascertained this by fertilising several flowers first illegitimately and twentyfour hours afterwards legitimately with pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety and all the seedlings were similarly coloured this shows that the legitimate pollen though applied twentyfour hours subsequently had wholly destroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen again as in making reciprocal crosses between the same two species there is occasionally a great difference in the result so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants for instance the midstyled form of lythrum salicaria could be illegitimately fertilised with the greatest ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the shortstyled form and yielded many seeds but the shortstyled form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens of the midstyled form  in all these respects the forms of the same undoubted species when illegitimately united behave in exactly the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed this led me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings raised from several illegitimate unions the chief result is that these illegitimate plants as they may be called are not fully fertile it is possible to raise from dimorphic species both longstyled and shortstyled illegitimate plants and from trimorphic plants all three illegitimate forms these can then be properly united in a legitimate manner when this is done there is no apparent reason why they should not yield as many seeds as did their parents when legitimately fertilised but such is not the case they are all infertile but in various degrees some being so utterly and incurably sterile that they did not yield during four seasons a single seed or even seedcapsule these illegitimate plants which are so sterile although united with each other in a legitimate manner may be strictly compared with hybrids when crossed inter se and it is well known how sterile these latter generally are when on the other hand a hybrid is crossed with either pure parent species the sterility is usually much lessened and so it is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant in the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the two parentspecies so the sterility of certain illegitimate plants was unusually great whilst the sterility of the union from which they were derived was by no means great with hybrids raised from the same seedcapsule the degree of sterility is innately variable so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate plants lastly many hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers whilst other and more sterile hybrids produce few flowers and are weak miserable dwarfs exactly similar cases occur with the illegitimate offspring of various dimorphic and trimorphic plants  although there is the closest identity in character and behaviour between illegitimate plants and hybrids it is hardly an exaggeration to maintain that the former are hybrids but produced within the limits of the same species by the improper union of certain forms whilst ordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between socalled distinct species we have already seen that there is the closest similarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions and first crosses between distinct species this will perhaps be made more fully apparent by an illustrationwe may suppose that a botanist found two wellmarked varieties and such occur of the longstyled form of the trimorphic lithrum salicaria and that he determined to try by crossing whether they were specifically distinct he would find that they yielded only about onefifth of the proper number of seed and that they behaved in all the other abovespecified respects as if they had been two distinct species but to make the case sure he would raise plants from his supposed hybridised seed and he would find that the seedlings were miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile and that they behaved in all other respects like ordinary hybrids he might then maintain that he had actually proved in accordance with the common view that his two varieties were as good and as distinct species as any in the world but he would be completely mistaken  the facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important because they show us first that the physiological test of lessened fertility both in first crosses and in hybrids is no criterion of specific distinction secondly because we may conclude that there is some unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions with that of their illegitimate offspring and we are led to extend the same view to first crosses and hybrids thirdly because we find and this seems to me of especial importance that two or three forms of the same species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever either in structure or in constitution relatively to external conditions and yet be sterile when united in certain ways for we must remember that it is the union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form for instance of two longstyled forms which results in sterility whilst it is the union of the sexual element proper to two distinct forms which is fertile hence the case appears at first sight exactly the reverse of what occurs in the ordinary unions of the individuals of the same species and with crosses between distinct species it is however doubtful whether this is really so but i will not enlarge on this obscure subject  we may however infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic and trimorphic plants that the sterility of distinct species when crossed and of their hybrid progeny depends exclusively on the nature of their sexual elements and not on any difference in their structure or general constitution we are also led to this same conclusion by considering reciprocal crosses in which the male of one species cannot be united or only with great difficulty with the female of a second species whilst the converse cross can be effected with perfect facility that excellent observer gartner likewise concluded that species when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their reproductive systems  on the principle which makes it necessary for man whilst he is selecting and improving his domestic varieties to keep them separate it would clearly be advantageous to varieties in a state of nature that is to incipient species if they could be kept from blending either through sexual aversion or by becoming mutually sterile hence it at one time appeared to me probable as it has to others that this sterility might have been acquired through natural selection on this view we must suppose that a shade of lessened fertility first spontaneously appeared like any other modification in certain individuals of a species when crossed with other individuals of the same species and that successive slight degrees of infertility from being advantageous were slowly accumulated this appears all the more probable if we admit that the structural differences between the forms of dimorphic and trimorphic plants as the length and curvature of the pistil etc have been coadapted through natural selection for if this be admitted we can hardly avoid extending the same conclusion to their mutual infertility sterility moreover has been acquired through natural selection for other and widely different purposes as with neuter insects in reference to their social economy in the case of plants the flowers on the circumference of the truss in the guelder rose viburnum opulus and those on the summit of the spike in the featherhyacinth muscari comosum have been rendered conspicuous and apparently in consequence sterile in order that insects might easily discover and visit the perfect flowers but when we endeavour to apply the principle of natural selection to the acquirement by distinct species of mutual sterility we meet with great difficulties in the first place it may be remarked that separate regions are often inhabited by groups of species or by single species which when brought together and crossed are found to be more or less sterile now it could clearly have been no advantage to such separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile and consequently this could not have been effected through natural selection but it may perhaps be argued that if a species were rendered sterile with some one compatriot sterility with other species would follow as a necessary consequence in the second place it is as much opposed to the theory of natural selection as to the theory of special creation that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one form should have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form whilst at the same time the male element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise the first form for this peculiar state of the reproductive system could not possibly have been advantageous to either species  in considering the probability of natural selection having come into action in rendering species mutually sterile one of the greatest difficulties will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility it may be admitted on the principle above explained that it would profit an incipient species if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its parentform or with some other variety for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in process of formation but he who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection to that higher degree which is common to so many species and which is universal with species which have been differentiated to a generic or family rank will find the subject extraordinarily complex after mature reflection it seems to me that this could not have been effected through natural selection take the case of any two species which when crossed produce few and sterile offspring now what is there which could favour the survival of those individuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree with mutual infertility and which thus approached by one small step towards absolute sterility yet an advance of this kind if the theory of natural selection be brought to bear must have incessantly occurred with many species for a multitude are mutually quite barren with sterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural selection from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the community to which they belonged over other communities of the same species but an individual animal not belonging to a social community if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety would not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to the other individuals of the same variety thus leading to their preservation  but it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail for with plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed species must be due to some principle quite independent of natural selection both gartner and kolreuter have proved that in general including numerous species a series can be formed from species which when crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds to species which never produce a single seed but yet are affected by the pollen of certain other species for the germen swells it is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals which have already ceased to yield seeds so that this acme of sterility when the germen alone is affected cannot have been gained through selection and from the laws governing the various grades of sterility being so uniform throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms we may infer that the cause whatever it may be is the same or nearly the same in all cases  as species have not been rendered mutually infertile through the accumulative action of natural selection and as we may safely conclude from the previous as well as from other and more general considerations that they have not been endowed through an act of creation with this quality we must infer that it has arisen incidentally during their slow formation in connection with other and unknown changes in their organisation by a quality arising incidentally i refer to such cases as different species of animals and plants being differently affected by poisons to which they are not naturally exposed and this difference in susceptibility is clearly incidental on other and unknown differences in their organisation so again the capacity in different kinds of trees to be grafted on each other or on a third species differs much and is of no advantage to these trees but is incidental on structural or functional differences in their woody tissues we need not feel surprise at sterility incidentally resulting from crosses between distinct speciesthe modified descendants of a common progenitorwhen we bear in mind how easily the reproductive system is affected by various causesoften by extremely slight changes in the conditions of life by too close interbreeding and by other agencies it is well to bear in mind such cases as that of the passiflora alata which recovered its selffertility from being grafted on a distinct speciesthe cases of plants which normally or abnormally are selfimpotent but can readily be fertilised by the pollen of a distinct speciesand lastly the cases of individual domesticated animals which evince towards each other sexual incompatibility  we now at last come to the immediate point under discussion how is it that with some few exceptions in the case of plants domesticated varieties such as those of the dog fowl pigeon several fruittrees and culinary vegetables which differ from each other in external characters more than many species are perfectly fertile when crossed or even fertile in excess whilst closely allied species are almost invariably in some degree sterile we can to a certain extent give a satisfactory answer to this question passing over the fact that the amount of external difference between two species is no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility so that similar differences in the case of varieties would be no sure guide we know that with species the cause lies exclusively in differences in their sexual constitution now the conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been subjected have had so little tendency towards modifying the reproductive system in a manner leading to mutual sterility that we have very good grounds for admitting the directly opposite doctrine of pallas namely that such conditions generally eliminate this tendency so that the domesticated descendants of species which in their natural state would have been in some degree sterile when crossed become perfectly fertile together with plants so far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards mutual sterility that in several wellauthenticated cases already often alluded to certain species have been affected in a very different manner for they have become self impotent whilst still retaining the capacity of fertilising and being fertilised by distinct species if the pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility through longcontinued domestication be admitted and it can hardly be rejected it becomes in the highest degree improbable that similar circumstances should commonly both induce and eliminate the same tendency though in certain cases with species having a peculiar constitution sterility might occasionally be thus induced thus as i believe we can understand why with domesticated animals varieties have not been produced which are mutually sterile and why with plants only a few such cases have been observed namely by gartner with certain varieties of maize and verbascum by other experimentalists with varieties of the gourd and melon and by kolreuter with one kind of tobacco  with respect to varieties which have originated in a state of nature it is almost hopeless to expect to prove by direct evidence that they have been rendered mutually sterile for if even a trace of sterility could be detected such varieties would at once be raised by almost every naturalist to the rank of distinct species if for instance gartners statement were fully confirmed that the blue and red flowered forms of the pimpernel anagallis arvensis are sterile when crossed i presume that all the botanists who now maintain on various grounds that these two forms are merely fleeting varieties would at once admit that they were specifically distinct  the real difficulty in our present subject is not as it appears to me why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties as soon as they have been modified in a sufficient and permanent degree to take rank as species we are far from precisely knowing the cause but we can see that the species owing to their struggle for existence with numerous competitors must have been exposed to more uniform conditions of life during long periods of time than domestic varieties have been and this may well make a wide difference in the result for we know how commonly wild animals and plants when taken from their natural conditions and subjected to captivity are rendered sterile and the reproductive functions of organic beings which have always lived and been slowly modified under natural conditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural cross domesticated productions on the other hand which as shown by the mere fact of their domestication were not originally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life and which can now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of conditions might be expected to produce varieties which would be little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like manner  certain naturalists have recently laid too great stress as it appears to me on the difference in fertility between varieties and species when crossed some allied species of trees cannot be grafted on one another whilst all varieties can be so grafted some allied animals are affected in a very different manner by the same poison but with varieties no such case until recently was known whilst now it has been proved that immunity from certain poisons sometimes stands in correlation with the colour of the individuals of the same species the period of gestation generally differs much in distinct species but with varieties until lately no such difference had been observed here we have various physiological differences and no doubt others could be added between one species and another of the same genus which do not occur or occur with extreme rarity in the case of varieties and these differences are apparently wholly or in chief part incidental on other constitutional differences just in the same manner as the sterility of crossed species is incidental on differences confined to the sexual system why then should these latter differences however serviceable they may indirectly be in keeping the inhabitants of the same country distinct be thought of such paramount importance in comparison with other incidental and functional differences no sufficient answer to this question can be given hence the fact that widely distinct domestic varieties are with rare exceptions perfectly fertile when crossed and produce fertile offspring whilst closely allied species are with rare exceptions more or less sterile is not nearly so formidable an objection as it appears at first to the theory of the common descent of allied species   chapter 2xx  selection by man  selection a difficult art methodical unconscious and natural selection results of methodical selection care taken in selection selection with plants selection carried on by the ancients and by semicivilised people unimportant characters often attended to unconscious selection as circumstances slowly change so have our domesticated animals changed through the action of unconscious selection influence of different breeders on the same subvariety plants as affected by unconscious selection effects of selection as shown by the great amount of difference in the parts most valued by man  the power of selection whether exercised by man or brought into play under nature through the struggle for existence and the consequent survival of the fittest absolutely depends on the variability of organic beings without variability nothing can be effected slight individual differences however suffice for the work and are probably the chief or sole means in the production of new species hence our discussion on the causes and laws of variability ought in strict order to have preceded the present subject as well as inheritance crossing etc but practically the present arrangement has been found the most convenient man does not attempt to cause variability though he unintentionally effects this by exposing organisms to new conditions of life and by crossing breeds already formed but variability being granted he works wonders unless some degree of selection be exercised the free commingling of the individuals of the same variety soon obliterates as we have previously seen the slight differences which arise and gives uniformity of character to the whole body of individuals in separated districts long continued exposure to different conditions of life may produce new races without the aid of selection but to this subject of the direct action of the conditions of life i shall recur in a future chapter  when animals or plants are born with some conspicuous and firmly inherited new character selection is reduced to the preservation of such individuals and to the subsequent prevention of crosses so that nothing more need be said on the subject but in the great majority of cases a new character or some superiority in an old character is at first faintly pronounced and is not strongly inherited and then the full difficulty of selection is experienced indomitable patience the finest powers of discrimination and sound judgment must be exercised during many years a clearly predetermined object must be kept steadily in view few men are endowed with all these qualities especially with that of discriminating very slight differences judgment can be acquired only by long experience but if any of these qualities be wanting the labour of a life may be thrown away i have been astonished when celebrated breeders whose skill and judgment have been proved by their success at exhibitions have shown me their animals which appeared all alike and have assigned their reasons for matching this and that individual the importance of the great principle of selection mainly lies in this power of selecting scarcely appreciable differences which nevertheless are found to be transmissible and which can be accumulated until the result is made manifest to the eyes of every beholder  the principle of selection may be conveniently divided into three kinds methodical selection is that which guides a man who systematically endeavours to modify a breed according to some predetermined standard unconscious selection is that which follows from men naturally preserving the most valued and destroying the less valued individuals without any thought of altering the breed and undoubtedly this process slowly works great changes unconscious selection graduates into methodical and only extreme cases can be distinctly separated for he who preserves a useful or perfect animal will generally breed from it with the hope of getting offspring of the same character but as long as he has not a predetermined purpose to improve the breed he may be said to be selecting unconsciously 201 the term unconscious selection has been objected to as a contradiction but see some excellent observations on this head by prof huxley nat hist review october 1864 page 578 who remarks that when the wind heaps up sanddunes it sifts and unconsciously selects from the gravel on the beach grains of sand of equal size lastly we have natural selection which implies that the individuals which are best fitted for the complex and in the course of ages changing conditions to which they are exposed generally survive and procreate their kind with domestic productions natural selection comes to a certain extent into action independently of and even in opposition to the will of man  methodical selection  what man has effected within recent times in england by methodical selection is clearly shown by our exhibitions of improved quadrupeds and fancy birds with respect to cattle sheep and pigs we owe their great improvement to a long series of wellknown namesbakewell coiling ellman bates jonas webb lords leicester and western fisher hobbs and others agricultural writers are unanimous on the power of selection any number of statements to this effect could be quoted a few will suffice youatt a sagacious and experienced observer writes 202 on sheep 1838 page 60 the principle of selection is that which enables the agriculturist not only to modify the character of his flock but to change it altogether a great breeder of shorthorns 203 mr j wright on shorthorn cattle in journal of royal agricult soc volume 7 pages 208 209 says in the anatomy of the shoulder modern breeders have made great improvement on the ketton shorthorns by correcting the defect in the knuckle or shoulderjoint and by laying the top of the shoulder more snugly in the crop and thereby filling up the hollow behind itthe eye has its fashion at different periods at one time the eye high and outstanding from the head and at another time the sleepy eye sunk into the head but these extremes have merged into the medium of a full clear and prominent eye with a placid look  again hear what an excellent judge of pigs 204 hd richardson on pigs 1847 page 44 says the legs should be no longer than just to prevent the animals belly from trailing on the ground the leg is the least profitable portion of the hog and we therefore require no more of it than is absolutely necessary for the support of the rest let any one compare the wildboar with any improved breed and he will see how effectually the legs have been shortened  few persons except breeders are aware of the systematic care taken in selecting animals and of the necessity of having a clear and almost prophetic vision into futurity lord spencers skill and judgment were well known and he writes 205 journal of royal agricult soc volume 1 page 24 it is therefore very desirable before any man commences to breed either cattle or sheep that he should make up his mind to the shape and qualities he wishes to obtain and steadily pursue this object lord somerville in speaking of the marvellous improvement of the new leicester sheep effected by bakewell and his successors says it would seem as if they had first drawn a perfect form and then given it life youatt 206 on sheep pages 520 319 urges the necessity of annually drafting each flock as many animals will certainly degenerate from the standard of excellence which the breeder has established in his own mind even with a bird of such little importance as the canary long ago 17801790 rules were established and a standard of perfection was fixed according to which the london fanciers tried to breed the several sub varieties 207 loudons mag of nat hist volume 8 1835 page 618 a great winner of prizes at the pigeonshows 208 a treatise on the art of breeding the almond tumbler 1851 page 9 in describing the shortfaced almond tumbler says there are many firstrate fanciers who are particularly partial to what is called the goldfinchbeak which is very beautiful others say take a fullsize round cherry then take a barleycorn and judiciously placing and thrusting it into the cherry form as it were your beak and that is not all for it will form a good head and beak provided as i said before it is judiciously done others take an oat but as i think the goldfinchbeak the handsomest i would advise the inexperienced fancier to get the head of a goldfinch and keep it by him for his observation wonderfully different as are the beaks of the rock pigeon and goldfinch the end has undoubtedly been nearly gained as far as external shape and proportions are concerned  not only should our animals be examined with the greatest care whilst alive but as anderson remarks 209 recreations in agriculture volume 2 page 409 their carcases should be scrutinised so as to breed from the descendants of such only as in the language of the butcher cut up well the grain of the meat in cattle and its being well marbled with fat 2010 youatt on cattle pages 191 227 and the greater or less accumulation of fat in the abdomen of our sheep

best mode is to purchase two young brothercocks kill dress and serve up one if he be indifferent similarly dispose of the other and try again if however he be fine and wellflavoured his brother will not be amiss for breeding purposes for the table  the great principle of the division of labour has been brought to bear on selection in certain districts 2012 wilson in transact highland agricult soc quoted in gardeners chronicle 1844 page 29 the breeding of bulls is confined to a very limited number of persons who by devoting their whole attention to this department are able from year to year to furnish a class of bulls which are steadily improving the general breed of the district the rearing and letting of choice rams has long been as is well known a chief source of profit to several eminent breeders in parts of germany this principle is carried with merino sheep to an extreme point 2013 simmonds quoted in gardeners chronicle 1855 page 637 and for the second quotation see youatt on sheep page 171 so important is the proper selection of breeding animals considered that the best flockmasters do not trust to their own judgment or to that of their shepherds but employ persons called sheepclassifiers who make it their special business to attend to this part of the management of several flocks and thus to preserve or if possible to improve the best qualities of both parents in the lambs in saxony when the lambs are weaned each in his turn is placed upon a table that his wool and form may be minutely observed the finest are selected for breeding and receive a first mark when they are one year old and prior to shearing them another close examination of those previously marked takes place those in which no defect can be found receive a second mark and the rest are condemned a few months afterwards a third and last scrutiny is made the prime rams and ewes receive a third and final mark but the slightest blemish is sufficient to cause the rejection of the animal these sheep are bred and valued almost exclusively for the fineness of their wool and the result corresponds with the labour bestowed on their selection instruments have been invented to measure accurately the thickness of the fibres and an austrian fleece has been produced of which twelve hairs equalled in thickness one from a leicester sheep  throughout the world wherever silk is produced the greatest care is bestowed on selecting the cocoons from which the moths for breeding are to be reared a careful cultivator 2014 robinet vers a soie 1848 page 271 likewise examines the moths themselves and destroys those that are not perfect but what more immediately concerns us is that certain families in france devote themselves to raising eggs for sale 2015 quatrefages les maladies du ver a soie 1859 page 101 in china near shanghai the inhabitants of two small districts have the privilege of raising eggs for the whole surrounding country and that they may give up their whole time to this business they are interdicted by law from producing silk 2016 m simon in bull de la soc dacclimat tome 9 1862 page 221  the care which successful breeders take in matching their birds is surprising sir john sebright whose fame is perpetuated by the sebright bantam used to spend two and three days in examining consulting and disputing with a friend which were the best of five or six birds 2017 the poultry chronicle volume 1 1854 page 607 mr bult whose pouterpigeons won so many prizes and were exported to north america under the charge of a man sent on purpose told me that he always deliberated for several days before he matched each pair hence we can understand the advice of an eminent fancier who writes 2018 jm eaton a treatise on fancy pigeons 1852 page 14 and a treatise on the almond tumbler 1851 page 11 i would here particularly guard you against having too great a variety of pigeons otherwise you will know a little of all but nothing about one as it ought to be known apparently it transcends the power of the human intellect to breed all kinds it is possible that there may be a few fanciers that have a good general knowledge of fancy pigeons but there are many more who labour under the delusion of supposing they know what they do not the excellence of one sub variety the almond tumbler lies in the plumage carriage head beak and eye but it is too presumptuous in the beginner to try for all these points the great judge above quoted says there are some young fanciers who are overcovetous who go for all the above five properties at once they have their reward by getting nothing we thus see that breeding even fancy pigeons is no simple art we may smile at the solemnity of these precepts but he who laughs will win no prizes  what methodical selection has effected for our animals is sufficiently proved as already remarked by our exhibitions so greatly were the sheep belonging to some of the earlier breeders such as bakewell and lord western changed that many persons could not be persuaded that they had not been crossed our pigs as mr corringham remarks 2019 journal royal agricultural soc volume 6 page 22 during the last twenty years have undergone through rigorous selection together with crossing a complete metamorphosis the first exhibition for poultry was held in the zoological gardens in 1845 and the improvement effected since that time has been great as mr bailey the great judge remarked to me it was formerly ordered that the comb of the spanish cock should be upright and in four or five years all good birds had upright combs it was ordered that the polish cock should have no comb or wattles and now a bird thus furnished would be at once disqualified beards were ordered and out of fiftyseven pens lately 1860 exhibited at the crystal palace all had beards so it has been in many other cases but in all cases the judges order only what is occasionally produced and what can be improved and rendered constant by selection the steady increase in weight during the last few years in our fowls turkeys ducks and geese is notorious sixpound ducks are now common whereas four pounds was formerly the average as the time required to make a change has not often been recorded it may be worth mentioning that it took mr wicking thirteen years to put a clean white head on an almond tumblers body a triumph says another fancier of which he may be justly proud 2020 poultry chronicle volume 2 1855 page 596  mr tollet of betley hall selected cows and especially bulls descended from good milkers for the sole purpose of improving his cattle for the production of cheese he steadily tested the milk with the lactometer and in eight years he increased as i was informed by him the product in proportion of four to three here is a curious case 2021 isid geoffroy sthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 254 of steady but slow progress with the end not as yet fully attained in 1784 a race of silkworms was introduced into france in which one hundred in the thousand failed to produce white cocoons but now after careful selection during sixtyfive generations the proportion of yellow cocoons has been reduced to thirtyfive in the thousand  with plants selection has been followed with the same good result as with animals but the process is simpler for plants in the great majority of cases bear both sexes nevertheless with most kinds it is necessary to take as much care to prevent crosses as with animals or unisexual plants but with some plants such as peas this care is not necessary with all improved plants excepting of course those which are propagated by buds cuttings etc it is almost indispensable to examine the seedlings and destroy those which depart from the proper type this is called roguing and is in fact a form of selection like the rejection of inferior animals experienced horticulturists and agriculturists incessantly urge every one to preserve the finest plants for the production of seed  although plants often present much more conspicuous variations than animals yet the closest attention is generally requisite to detect each slight and favourable change mr masters relates 2022 gardeners chronicle 1850 page 198 how many a patient hour was devoted whilst he was young to the detection of differences in peas intended for seed mr barnet 2023 transact hort soc volume 6 page 152 remarks that the old scarlet american strawberry was cultivated for more than a century without producing a single variety and another writer observes how singular it was that when gardeners first began to attend to this fruit it began to vary the truth no doubt being that it had always varied but that until slight variations were selected and propagated by seed no conspicuous result was obtained the finest shades of difference in wheat have been discriminated and selected with almost as much care as in the case of the higher animals for instance by col le couteur and more especially by major hallett  it may be worth while to give a few examples of methodical selection with plants but in fact the great improvement of all our anciently cultivated plants may be attributed to selection long carried on in part methodically and in part unconsciously i have shown in a former chapter how the weight of the gooseberry has been increased by systematic selection and culture the flowers of the heartsease have been similarly increased in size and regularity of outline with the cineraria mr glenny 2024 journal of horticulture 1862 page 369 was bold enough when the flowers were ragged and starry and ill defined in colour to fix a standard which was then considered outrageously high and impossible and which even if reached it was said we should be no gainers by as it would spoil the beauty of the flowers he maintained that he was right and the event has proved it to be so the doubling of flowers has several times been effected by careful selection the rev w williamson

cultivation in france has almost exactly doubled its yield of sugar this has been effected by the most careful selection the specific gravity of the roots being regularly tested and the best roots saved for the production of seed 2030 godron de lespece 1859 tome 2 page 69 gardeners chronicle 1854 page 258  selection by ancient and semicivilised people  in attributing so much importance to the selection of animals and plants it may be objected that methodical selection would not have been carried on during ancient times a distinguished naturalist considers it as absurd to suppose that semicivilised people should have practised selection of any kind undoubtedly the principle has been systematically acknowledged and followed to a far greater extent within the last hundred years than at any former period and a corresponding result has been gained but it would be a greater error to suppose as we shall immediately see that its importance was not recognised and acted on during the most ancient times and by semi civilised people i should premise that many facts now to be given only show that care was taken in breeding but when this is the case selection is almost sure to be practised to a certain extent we shall hereafter be enabled better to judge how far selection when only occasionally carried on by a few of the inhabitants of a country will slowly produce a great effect  in a wellknown passage in the thirtieth chapter of genesis rules are given for influencing as was then thought possible the colour of sheep and speckled and dark breeds are spoken of as being kept separate by the time of david the fleece was likened to snow youatt 2031 on sheep page 18 who has discussed all the passages in relation to breeding in the old testament concludes that at this early period some of the best principles of breeding must have been steadily and long pursued it was ordered according to moses that thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind but mules

animals from particular places or having a particular character were valued thus it is said  two pigs of the pigs of mac lir a ram and ewe both round and red i brought with me from aengus i brought with me a stallion and a mare from the beautiful stud of manannan a bull and a white cow from druim cain  athelstan in 930 received runninghorses as a present from germany and he prohibited the exportation of english horses king john imported one hundred chosen stallions from flanders 2042 col hamilton smith nat library volume 12 horses pages 135 140 on june 16th 1305 the prince of wales wrote to the archbishop of canterbury begging for the loan of any choice stallion and promising its return at the end of the season 2043 michel des haras page 90 there are numerous records at ancient periods in english history of the importation of choice animals of various kinds and of foolish laws against their exportation in the reigns of henry vii and viii it was ordered that the magistrates at michaelmas should scour the heaths and commons and destroy all mares beneath a certain size 2044 mr baker history of the horse veterinary volume 13 page 423 some of our earlier kings passed laws against the slaughtering rams of any good breed before they were seven years old so that they might have time to breed in spain cardinal ximenes issued in 1509 regulations on the selection of good rams for breeding 2045 m labbe carlier in journal de physique volume 24 1784 page 181 this memoir contains much information on the ancient selection of sheep and is my authority for rams not being killed young in england  the emperor akbar khan before the year l600 is said to have wonderfully improved his pigeons by crossing the breeds and this necessarily implies careful selection about the same period the dutch attended with the greatest care to the breeding of these birds belon in 1555 says that good managers in france examined the colour of their goslings in order to get geese of a white colour and better kinds markham in 1631 tells the breeder to elect the largest and goodliest conies and enters into minute details even with respect to seeds of plants for the flowergarden sir j hanmer writing about the year 1660 2046 gardeners chronicle 1843 page 389 says in choosing seed the best seed is the most weighty and is had from the lustiest and most vigorous stems and he then gives rules about leaving only a few flowers on plants for seed so that even such details were attended to in our flowergardens two hundred years ago in order to show that selection has been silently carried on in places where it would not have been expected i may add that in the middle of the last century in a remote part of north america mr cooper improved by careful selection all his vegetables so that they were greatly superior to those of any other person when his radishes for instance are fit for use he takes ten or twelve that he most approves and plants them at least 100 yards from others that blossom at the same time in the same manner he treats all his other plants varying the circumstances according to their nature 2047 communications to board of agriculture quoted in dr darwin phytologia 1800 page 451  in the great work on china published in the last century by the jesuits and which is chiefly compiled from ancient chinese encyclopaedias it is said that with sheep improving the breed consists in choosing with particular care the lambs which are destined for propagation in nourishing them well and in keeping the flocks separate the same principles were applied by the chinese to various plants and fruittrees 2048 memoire sur les chinois 1786 tome 11 page 55 tome 5 page 507 an imperial edict recommends the choice of seed of remarkable size and selection was practised even by imperial hands for it is said that the yami or imperial rice was noticed at an ancient period in a field by the emperor khanghi was saved and cultivated in his garden and has since become valuable from being the only kind which will grow north of the great wall 2049 recherches sur lagriculture des chinois par l dhervey saintdenys 1850 page 229 with respect to khanghi see hucs chinese empire page 311 even with flowers the tree paeony p moutan has been cultivated according to chinese traditions for 1400 years between 200 and 300 varieties have been raised which are cherished like tulips formerly were by the dutch 2050 anderson in linn transact volume 12 page 253  turning now to semicivilised people and to savages it occurred to me from what i had seen of several parts of south america where fences do not exist and where the animals are of little value that there would be absolutely no care in breeding or selecting them and this to a large extent is true roulin 2051 mem de lacad divers savants tome 6 1835 page 333 however describes in columbia a naked race of cattle which are not allowed to increase on account of their delicate constitution according to azara 2052 des quadrupedes du paraguay 1801 tome 2 pages 333 371 horses are often born in paraguay with curly hair but as the natives do not like them they are destroyed on the other hand azara states that a hornless bull born in 1770 was preserved and propagated its race i was informed of the existence in banda oriental of a breed with reversed hair and the extraordinary niata cattle first appeared and have since been kept distinct in la plata hence certain conspicuous variations have been preserved and others have been habitually destroyed in these countries which are so little favourable for careful selection we have also seen that the inhabitants sometimes introduce fresh cattle on their estates to prevent the evil effects of close interbreeding on the other hand i have heard on reliable authority that the gauchos of the pampas never take any pains in selecting the best bulls or stallions for breeding and this probably accounts for the cattle and horses being remarkably uniform in character throughout the immense range of the argentine republic  looking to the old world in the sahara desert the touareg is as careful in the selection of his breeding mahari a fine race of the dromedary as the arab is in that of his horse the pedigrees are handed down and many a dromedary can boast a genealogy far longer than the descendants of the darley arabian 2053 the great sahara by the rev hb tristram 1860 page 238 according to pallas the mongolians endeavour to breed the yaks or horsetailed buffaloes with white tails for these are sold to the chinese mandarins as flyflappers and moorcroft about seventy years after pallas found that whitetailed animals were still selected for breeding 2054 pallas act acad st petersburg 1777 page 249 moorcroft and trebeck travels in the himalayan provinces 1841  we have seen in the chapter on the dog that savages in different parts of north america and in guiana cross their dogs with wild canidae as did the ancient gauls according to pliny this was done to give their dogs strength and vigour in the same way as the keepers in large warrens now sometimes cross their ferrets as i have been informed by mr yarrell with the wild polecat to give them more devil according to varro the wild ass was formerly caught and crossed with the tame animal to improve the breed in the same manner as at the present day the natives of java sometimes drive their cattle into the forests to cross with the wild banteng bos sondaicus 2055 quoted from raffles in the indian field 1859 page 196 for varro see pallas ut supra in northern siberia among the ostyaks the dogs vary in markings in different districts but in each place they are spotted black and white in a remarkably uniform manner 2056 erman travels in siberia english translation volume 1 page 453 and from this fact alone we may infer careful breeding more especially as the dogs of one locality are famed throughout the country for their superiority i have heard of certain tribes of esquimaux who take pride in their teams of dogs being uniformly coloured in guiana as sir h schomburgk informs me 2057 see also journal of r geograph soc volume 13 part 1 page 65 the dogs of the turuma indians are highly valued and extensively bartered the price of a good one is the same as that given for a wife they are kept in a sort of cage and the indians take great care when the female is in season to prevent her uniting with a dog of an inferior description the indians told sir robert that if a dog proved bad or useless he was not killed but was left to die from sheer neglect hardly any nation is more barbarous than the fuegians but i hear from mr bridges the catechist to the mission that when these savages have a large strong and active bitch they take care to put her to a fine dog and even take care to feed her well that her young may be strong and well favoured  in the interior of africa negroes who have not associated with white men show great anxiety to improve their animals they always choose the larger and stronger males for stock the malakolo were much pleased at livingstones promise to send them a bull and some bakalolo carried a live cock all the way from loanda into the interior 2058 livingstone first travels pages 191 439 565 see also expedition to the zambesi 1865 page 495 for an analogous case respecting a good breed of goats at falaba mr winwood reade noticed an unusually fine horse and the negro king informed him that the owner was noted for his skill in breeding horses further south on the same continent andersson states that he has known a damara give two fine oxen for a dog which struck his fancy the damaras take great delight in having whole droves of cattle of the same colour and they prize their oxen in proportion to the size of their horns the namaquas have a perfect mania for a uniform team and almost all the people of southern africa value their cattle next to their women and take a pride in possessing animals that look highbred they rarely or never make use of a handsome animal as a beast of burden 2059 andersson travels in south africa pages 232 318 319 the power of discrimination which these savages possess is wonderful and they can recognise to which tribe any cattle belong mr andersson further informs me that the natives frequently match a particular bull with a particular cow  the most curious case of selection by semicivilised people or indeed by any people which i have found recorded is that given by garcilazo de la vega a descendant of the incas as having been practised in peru before the country was subjugated by the spaniards 2060 dr vavasseur in bull de la soc dacclimat tome 8 1861 page 136 the incas annually held great hunts when all the wild animals were driven from an immense circuit to a central point the beasts of prey were first destroyed as injurious the wild guanacos and vicunas were sheared the old males and females killed and the others set at liberty the various kinds of deer were examined the old males and females were likewise killed but the young females with a certain number of males selected from the most beautiful and strong were given their freedom here then we have selection by man aiding natural selection so that the incas followed exactly the reverse system of that which our scottish sportsman are accused of following namely of steadily killing the finest stags thus causing the whole race to degenerate 2061 the natural history of dee side 1855 page 476 in regard to the domesticated llamas and alpacas they were separated in the time of the incas according to colour and if by chance one in a flock was born of the wrong colour it was eventually put into another flock  in the genus auchenia there are four formsthe guanaco and vicuna found wild and undoubtedly distinct species the llama and alpaca known only in a domesticated condition these four animals appear so different that most naturalists especially those who have studied these animals in their native country maintain that they are specifically distinct notwithstanding that no one pretends to have seen a wild llama or alpaca mr ledger however who has closely studied these animals both in peru and during their exportation to australia and who has made many experiments on their propagation adduces arguments 2062 bull de la soc dacclimat tome 7 1860 page 457 which seem to me conclusive that the llama is the domesticated descendant of the guanaco and the alpaca of the vicuna and now that we know that these animals were systematically bred and selected many centuries ago there is nothing surprising in the great amount of change which they have undergone  it appeared to me at one time probable that though ancient and semicivilised people might have attended to the improvement of their more useful animals in essential points yet that they would have disregarded unimportant characters but human nature is the same throughout the world fashion everywhere reigns supreme and man is apt to value whatever he may chance to possess we have seen that in south america the niata cattle which certainly are not made useful by their shortened faces and upturned nostrils have been preserved the damaras of south africa value their cattle for uniformity of colour and enormously long horns and i will now show that there is hardly any peculiarity in our most useful animals which from fashion superstition or some other motive has not been valued and consequently preserved with respect to cattle an early record according to youatt 2063 cattle page 48 speaks of a hundred white cows with red ears being demanded as a compensation by the princes of north and south wales if the cattle were of a dark or black colour 150 were to be presented so that colour was attended to in wales before its subjugation by england in central africa an ox that beats the ground with its tail is killed and in south africa some of the damaras will not eat the flesh of a spotted ox the kaffirs value an animal with a musical voice and at a sale in british kaffraria the low of a heifer excited so much admiration that a sharp competition sprung up for her possession and she realised a considerable price 2064 livingstone travels page 576 andersson lake ngami 1856 page 222 with respect to the sale in kaffraria see quarterly review 1860 page 139 with respect to sheep the chinese prefer rams without horns the tartars prefer them with spirally wound horns because the hornless are thought to lose courage 2065 memoire sur les chinois by the jesuits 1786 tome 11 page 57 some of the damaras will not eat the flesh of hornless sheep in regard to horses at the end of the fifteenth century animals of the colour described as liart pomme were most valued in france the arabs have a proverb never buy a horse with four white feet for he carries his shroud with him 2066 f michel des haras pages 47 50 the arabs also as we have seen despise dun coloured horses so with dogs xenophon and others at an ancient period were prejudiced in favour of certain colours and white or slatecoloured hunting dogs were not esteemed 2067 col hamilton smith dogs in nat lib volume 10 page 103  turning to poultry the old roman gourmands thought that the liver of a white goose was the most savoury in paraguay blackskinned fowls are kept because they are thought to be more productive and their flesh the most proper for invalids 2068 azara quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 324 in guiana as i am informed by sir r schomburgk the aborigines will not eat the flesh or eggs of the fowl but two races are kept distinct merely for ornament in the philippines no less than nine subvarieties of the gamecock are kept and named so that they must be separately bred  at the present time in europe the smallest peculiarities are carefully attended to in our most useful animals either from fashion or as a mark of purity of blood many examples could be given two will suffice in the western counties of england the prejudice against a white pig is nearly as strong as against a black one in yorkshire in one of the berkshire sub breeds it is said the white should be confined to four white feet a white spot between the eyes and a few white hairs behind each shoulder mr saddler possessed three hundred pigs every one of which was marked in this manner 2069 sidneys edition of youatt 1860 pages 24 25 marshall towards the close of the last century in speaking of a change in one of the yorkshire breeds of cattle says the horns have been considerably modified as a clean small sharp horn has been fashionable for the last twenty years 2070 rural economy of yorkshire volume 2 page 182 in a part of germany the cattle of the race de gfoehl are valued for many good qualities but they must have horns of a particular curvature and tint so much so that mechanical means are applied if they take a wrong direction but the inhabitants consider it of the highest importance that the nostrils of the bull should be fleshcoloured and the eyelashes light this is an indispensable condition a calf with blue nostrils would not be purchased or purchased at a very low price 2071 moll et gayot du boeuf 1860 page 547 therefore let no man say that any point or character is too trifling to be methodically attended to and selected by breeders  unconscious selection  by this term i mean as already more than once explained the preservation by man of the most valued and the destruction of the least valued individuals without any conscious intention on his part of altering the breed it is difficult to offer direct proofs of the results which follow from this kind of selection but the indirect evidence is abundant in fact except that in the one case man acts intentionally and in the other unintentionally there is little difference between methodical and unconscious selection in both cases man preserves the animals which are most useful or pleasing to him and destroys or neglects the others but no doubt a far more rapid result follows from methodical than from unconscious selection the roguing of plants by gardeners and the destruction by law in henry viiis reign of all under sized mares are instances of a process the reverse of selection in the ordinary sense of the word but leading to the same general result the influence of the destruction of individuals having a particular character is well shown by the necessity of killing every lamb with a trace of black about it in order to keep the flock white or again by the effects on the average height of the men of france of the destructive wars of napoleon by which many tall men were killed the short ones being left to be the fathers of families this at least is the conclusion of some of those who have closely studied the effects of the conscription and it is certain that since napoleons time the standard for the army has been lowered two or three times  unconscious selection blends with methodical so that it is scarcely possible to separate them when a fancier long ago first happened to notice a pigeon with an unusually short beak or one with the tailfeathers unusually developed although he bred from these birds with the distinct intention of propagating the variety yet he could not have intended to make a shortfaced tumbler or a fantail and was far from knowing that he had made the first step towards this end if he could have seen the final result he would have been struck with astonishment but from what we know of the habits of fanciers probably not with admiration our english carriers barbs and shortfaced tumblers have been greatly modified in the same manner as we may infer both from the historical evidence given in the chapters on the pigeon and from the comparison of birds brought from distant countries  so it has been with dogs our present foxhounds differ from the old english hound our greyhounds have become lighter the scotch deerhound has been modified and is now rare our bulldogs differ from those which were formerly used for baiting bulls our pointers and newfoundlands do not closely resemble any native dog now found in the countries whence they were brought these changes have been effected partly by crosses but in every case the result has been governed by the strictest selection nevertheless there is no reason to suppose that man intentionally and methodically made the breeds exactly what they now are as our horses became fleeter and the country more cultivated and smoother fleeter foxhounds were desired and produced but probably without any one distinctly foreseeing what they would become our pointers and setters the latter almost certainly descended from large spaniels have been greatly modified in accordance with fashion and the desire for increased speed wolves have become extinct and so has the wolfdog deer have become rarer bulls are no longer baited and the corresponding breeds of the dog have answered to the change but we may feel almost sure that when for instance bulls were no longer baited no man said to himself i will now breed my dogs of smaller size and thus create the present race as circumstances changed men unconsciously and slowly modified their course of selection  with racehorses selection for swiftness has been followed methodically and our horses now easily surpass their progenitors the increased size and different appearance of the english racehorse led a good observer in india to ask could any one in this year of 1856 looking at our racehorses conceive that they were the result of the union of the arab horse and the african mare 2072 the india sporting review volume 2 page 181 the stud farm by cecil page 58 this change has it is probable been largely effected through unconscious selection that is by the general wish to breed as fine horses as possible in each generation combined with training and high feeding but without any intention to give to them their present appearance according to youatt 2073 the horse page 22 the introduction in oliver cromwells time of three celebrated eastern stallions speedily affected the english breed so that lord harleigh one of the old school complained that the great horse was fast disappearing this is an excellent proof how carefully selection must have been attended to for without such care all traces of so small an infusion of eastern blood would soon have been absorbed and lost notwithstanding that the climate of england has never been esteemed particularly favourable to the horse yet longcontinued selection both methodical and unconscious together with that practised by the arabs during a still longer and earlier period has ended in giving us the best breed of horses in the world macaulay 2074 history of england volume 1 page 316 remarks two men whose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem the duke of newcastle and sir john fenwick pronounced that the meanest hack ever imported from tangier would produce a finer progeny than could be expected from the best sire of our native breed they would not readily have believed that a time would come when the princes and nobles of neighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses from england as ever the english had been to obtain horses from barbary  the london drayhorse which differs so much in appearance from any natural species and which from its size has so astonished many eastern princes was probably formed by the heaviest and most powerful animals having been selected during many generations in flanders and england but without the least intention or expectation of creating a horse such as we now see if we go back to an early period of history we behold in the antique greek statues as schaaffhausen has remarked 2075 ueber bestandigkeit der arten a horse equally unlike a race or dray horse and differing from any existing breed  the results of unconscious selection in an early stage are well shown in the difference between the flocks descended from the same stock but separately reared by careful breeders youatt gives an excellent instance of this fact in the sheep belonging to messrs buckley and burgess which have been purely bred from the original stock of mr bakewell for upwards of fifty years there is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either flock has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of mr bakewells flock yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties 2076 youatt on sheep page 315 i have seen several analogous and well marked cases with pigeons for instance i had a family of barbs descended from those long bred by sir j sebright and another family long bred by another fancier and the two families plainly differed from each other nathusiusand a more competent witness could not be citedobserves that though the shorthorns are remarkably uniform in appearance except in colour yet the individual character and wishes of each breeder become impressed on his cattle so that different herds differ slightly from one another 2077 ueber shorthorn rindvieh 1857 s 51 the hereford cattle assumed their present wellmarked character soon after the year 1769 through careful selection by mr tomkins 2078 low domesticated animals 1845 page 363 and the breed has lately split into two strainsone strain having a white face and differing slightly it is said 2079 quarterly review 1849 page 392 in some other points but there is no reason to believe that this split the origin of which is unknown was intentionally made it may with much more probability be attributed to different breeders having attended to different points so again the berkshire breed of swine in the year 1810 had greatly changed from what it was in 1780 and since 1810 at least two distinct subbreeds have arisen bearing the same name 2080 h von nathusius vorstudienschweineschadel 1864 s 140 keeping in mind how rapidly all animals increase and that some must be annually slaughtered and some saved for breeding then if the same breeder during a long course of years deliberately settles which shall be saved and which shall be killed it is almost inevitable that his individual turn of mind will influence the character of his stock without his having had any intention to modify the breed  unconscious selection in the strictest sense of the word that is the saving of the more useful animals and the neglect or slaughter of the less useful without any thought of the future must have gone on occasionally from the remotest period and amongst the most barbarous nations savages often suffer from famines and are sometimes expelled by war from their own homes in such cases it can hardly be doubted that they would save their most useful animals when the fuegians are hard pressed by want they kill their old women for food rather than their dogs for as we were assured old women no usedogs catch otters the same sound sense would surely lead them to preserve their more useful dogs when still harder pressed by famine mr oldfield who has seen so much of the aborigines of australia informs me that they are all very glad to get a european kangaroo dog and several instances have been known of the father killing his own infant that the mother might suckle the muchprized puppy different kinds of dogs would be useful to the australian for hunting opossums and kangaroos and to the fuegian for catching fish and otters and the occasional preservation in the two countries of the most useful animals would ultimately lead to the formation of two widely distinct breeds  with plants from the earliest dawn of civilisation the best variety which was known would generally have been cultivated at each period and its seeds occasionally sown so that there will have been some selection from an extremely remote period but without any prefixed standard of excellence or thought of the future we at the present day profit by a course of selection occasionally and unconsciously carried on during thousands of years this is proved in an interesting manner by oswald heers researches on the lake inhabitants of switzerland as given in a former chapter for he shows that the grain and seed of our present varieties of wheat barley oats peas beans lentils and poppy exceed in size those which were cultivated in switzerland during the neolithic and bronze periods these ancient people during the neolithic period possessed also a crab considerably larger than that now growing wild on the jura 2081 see also dr christ in rutimeyers pfahlbauten 1861 s 226 the pears described by pliny were evidently extremely inferior in quality to our present pears we can realise the effects of longcontinued selection and cultivation in another way for would any one in his senses expect to raise a firstrate apple from the seed of a truly wild crab or a luscious melting pear from the wild pear alphonse de candolle informs me that he has lately seen on an ancient mosaic at rome a representation of the melon and as the rotnans who were such gourmands are silent on this fruit he infers that the melon has been greatly ameliorated since the classical period  coming to later times buffon 2082 the passage is given bull soc dacclimat 1858 page 11 on comparing the flowers fruit and vegetables which were then cultivated with some excellent drawings made a hundred and fifty years previously was struck with surprise at the great improvement which had been effected and remarks that these ancient flowers and vegetables would now be rejected not only by a florist but by a village gardener since the time of buffon the work of improvement has steadily and rapidly gone on every florist who compares our present flowers with those figured in books published not long since is astonished at the change a wellknown amateur 2083 journal of horticulture 1862 page 394 in speaking of the varieties of pelargonium raised by mr garth only twentytwo years before remarks what a rage they excited surely we had attained perfection it was said and now not one of the flowers of those days will be looked at but none the less is the debt of gratitude which we owe to those who saw what was to be done and did it mr paul the wellknown horticulturist in writing of the same flower 2084 gardeners chronicle 1857 page 85 says he remembers when young being delighted with the portraits in sweets work but what are they in point of beauty compared with the pelargoniums of this day here again nature did not advance by leaps the improvement was gradual and if we had neglected those very gradual advances we must have foregone the present grand results how well this practical horticulturist appreciates and illustrates the gradual and accumulative force of selection the dahlia has advanced in beauty in a like manner the line of improvement being guided by fashion and by the successive modifications which the flower slowly underwent 2085 see mr wildmans address to the floricult soc in gardeners chronicle 1843 page 86 a steady and gradual change has been noticed in many other flowers thus an old florist 2086 journal of horticulture october 24 1865 page 239 after describing the leading varieties of the pink which were grown in 1813 adds the pinks of those days would now be scarcely grown as border flowers the improvement of so many flowers and the number of the varieties which have been raised is all the more striking when we hear that the earliest known flowergarden in europe namely at padua dates only from the year 1545 2087 prescott hist of mexico volume 2 page 61  effects of selection as shown by the parts most valued by man presenting the greatest amount of difference  the power of longcontinued selection whether methodical or unconscious or both combined is well shown in a general way namely by the comparison of the differences between the varieties of distinct species which are valued for different parts such as for the leaves or stems or tubers the seed or fruit or flowers whatever part man values most that part will be found to present the greatest amount of difference with trees cultivated for their fruit sageret remarks that the fruit is larger than in the parentspecies whilst with those cultivated for the seed as with nuts walnuts almonds chestnuts etc it is the seed itself which is larger and he accounts for this fact by the fruit in the one case and by the seed in the other having been carefully attended to and selected during many ages gallesio has made the same observation godron insists on the diversity of the tuber in the potato of the bulb in the onion and of the fruit in the melon and on the close similarity of the other parts in these same plants 2088 sagaret pomologie physiologique 1830 page 47 gallesio teoria della riproduzione 1816 page 88 godron de lespece 1859 tome 2 pages 63 67 70 in my tenth and eleventh chapters i have given details on the potato and i can confirm similar remarks with respect to the onion i have also shown how far naudin concurs in regard to the varieties of the melon  in order to judge how far my own impression on this subject was correct i cultivated numerous varieties of the same species close to one another the comparison of the amount of difference between widely different organs is necessarily vague i will therefore give the results in only a few cases we have previously seen in the ninth chapter how greatly the varieties of the cabbage differ in their foliage and stems which are the selected parts and how closely they resemble one another in their flowers capsules and seeds in seven varieties of the radish the roots differed greatly in colour and shape but no difference whatever could be detected in their foliage flowers or seeds now what a contrast is presented if we compare the flowers of the varieties of these two plants with those of any species cultivated in our flowergardens for ornament or if we compare their seeds with those of the varieties of maize peas beans etc which are valued and cultivated for their seeds in the ninth chapter it was shown that the varieties of the pea differ but little except in the tallness of the plant moderately in the shape of the pod and greatly in the pea itself and these are all selected points the varieties however of the pois sans parchemin differ much more in their pods and these are eaten and valued i cultivated twelve varieties of the common bean one alone the dwarf fan differed considerably in general appearance two differed in the colour of their flowers one being an albino and the other being wholly instead of partially purple several differed considerably in the shape and size of the pod but far more in the bean itself and this is the valued and selected part tokers bean for instance is twiceandahalf as long and broad as the horsebean and is much thinner and of a different shape  the varieties of the gooseberry as formerly described differ much in their fruit but hardly perceptibly in their flowers or organs of vegetation with the plum the differences likewise appear to be greater in the fruit than in the flowers or leaves on the other hand the seed of the strawberry which corresponds with the fruit of the plum differs hardly at all whilst every one knows how greatly the fruitthat is the enlarged receptaclediffers in several varieties in apples pears and peaches the flowers and leaves differ considerably but not as far as i can judge in proportion with the fruit the chinese doubleflowering peaches on the other hand show that varieties of this tree have been formed which differ more in flower than in fruit if as is highly probable the peach is the modified descent of the almond a surprising amount of change has been effected in the same species in the fleshy covering of the former and in the kernels of the latter  when parts stand in close relationship to each other such as the seed and the fleshy covering of the fruit whatever its homological nature may be changes in the one are usually accompanied by modifications in the other though not necessarily to the same degree with the plumtree for instance some varieties produce plums which are nearly alike but include stones extremely dissimilar in shape whilst conversely other varieties produce dissimilar fruit with barely distinguishable stones and generally the stones though they have never been subjected to selection differ greatly in the several varieties of the plum in other cases organs which are not manifestly related through some unknown bond vary together and are consequently liable without any intention on mans part to be simultaneously acted on by selection thus the varieties of the stock matthiola have been selected solely for the beauty of their flowers but the seeds differ greatly in colour and somewhat in size varieties of the lettuce have been selected solely on account of their leaves yet produce seeds which likewise differ in colour generally through the law of correlation when a variety differs greatly from its fellowvarieties in any one character it differs to a certain extent in several other characters i observed this fact when i cultivated together many varieties of the same species for i used first to make a list of the varieties which differed most from each other in their foliage and manner of growth afterwards of those that differed most in their flowers then in their seedcapsules and lastly in their mature seed and i found that the same names generally occurred in two three or four of the successive lists nevertheless the greatest amount of difference between the varieties was always exhibited as far as i could judge by that part or organ for which the plant was cultivated  when we bear in mind that each plant was at first cultivated because useful to man and that its variation was a subsequent often a long subsequent event we cannot explain the greater amount of diversity in the valuable parts by supposing that species endowed with an especial tendency to vary in any particular manner were originally chosen we must attribute the result to the variations in these parts having been successively preserved and thus continually augmented whilst other variations excepting such as inevitably appeared through correlation were neglected and lost we may therefore infer that most plants might be made through longcontinued selection to yield races as different from one another in any character as they now are in those parts for which they are valued and cultivated  with animals we see nothing of the same kind but a sufficient number of species have not been domesticated for a fair comparison sheep are valued for their wool and the wool differs much more in the several races than the hair in cattle neither sheep goats european cattle nor pigs are valued for their fleetness or strength and we do not possess breeds differing in these respects like the racehorse and drayhorse but fleetness and strength are valued in camels and dogs and we have with the former the swift dromedary and heavy camel with the latter the greyhound and mastiff but dogs are valued even in a higher degree for their mental qualities and senses and every one knows how greatly the races differ in these respects on the other hand where the dog is kept solely to serve for food as in the polynesian islands and china it is described as an extremely stupid animal 2089 godron de lespece tome 2 page 27 blumenbach remarks that many dogs such as the badgerdog have a build so marked and so appropriate for particular purposes that i should find it very difficult to persuade myself that this astonishing figure was an accidental consequence of degeneration 2090 the anthropological treatises of blumenbach 1856 page 292 had blumenbach reflected on the great principle of selection he would not have used the term degeneration and he would not have been astonished that dogs and other animals should become excellently adapted for the service of man  on the whole we may conclude that whatever part or character is most valued whether the leaves stems tubers bulbs flowers fruit or seed of plants or the size strength fleetness hairy covering or intellect of animals that character will almost invariably be found to present the greatest amount of difference both in kind and degree and this result may be safely attributed to man having preserved during a long course of generations the variations which were useful to him and neglected the others  i will conclude this chapter by some remarks on an important subject with animals such as the giraffe of which the whole structure is admirably co ordinated for certain purposes it has been supposed that all the parts must have been simultaneously modified and it has been argued that on the principle of natural selection this is scarcely possible but in thus arguing it has been tacitly assumed that the variations must have been abrupt and great no doubt if the neck of a ruminant were suddenly to become greatly elongated the fore limbs and back would have to be simultaneously strengthened and modified but it cannot be denied that an animal might have its neck or head or tongue or forelimbs elongated a very little without any corresponding modification in other parts of the body and animals thus slightly modified would during a dearth have a slight advantage and be enabled to browse on higher twigs and thus survive a few mouthfuls more or less every day would make all the difference between life and death by the repetition of the same process and by the occasional intercrossing of the survivors there would be some progress slow and fluctuating though it would be towards the admirably coordinated structure of the giraffe if the short faced tumblerpigeon with its small conical beak globular head rounded body short wings and small feetcharacters which appear all in harmonyhad been a natural species its whole structure would have been viewed as well fitted for its life but in this case we know that inexperienced breeders are urged to attend to point after point and not to attempt improving the whole structure at the same time look at the greyhound that perfect image of grace symmetry and vigour no natural species can boast of a more admirably coordinated structure with its tapering head slim body deep chest tucked up abdomen ratlike tail and long muscular limbs all adapted for extreme fleetness and for running down weak prey now from what we see of the variability of animals and from what we know of the method which different men follow in improving their stocksome chiefly attending to one point others to another point others again correcting defects by crosses and so forthwe may feel assured that if we could see the long line of ancestors of a firstrate greyhound up to its wild wolflike progenitor we should behold an infinite number of the finest gradations sometimes in one character and sometimes in another but all leading towards our present perfect type by small and doubtful steps such as these nature as we may confidently believe has progressed on her grand march of improvement and development  a similar line of reasoning is as applicable to separate organs as to the whole organisation a writer 2091 mr jj murphy in his opening address to the belfast nat hist soc as given in the belfast northern whig november 19 1866 mr murphy here follows the line of argument against my views previously and more cautiously given by the rev c pritchard pres royal astronomical soc in his sermon appendix page 33 preached before the british association at nottingham 1866 has recently maintained that it is probably no exaggeration to suppose that in order to improve such an organ as the eye at all it must be improved in ten different ways at once and the improbability of any complex organ being produced and brought to perfection in any such way is an improbability of the same kind and degree as that of producing a poem or a mathematical demonstration by throwing letters at random on a table if the eye were abruptly and greatly modified no doubt many parts would have to be simultaneously altered in order that the organ should remain serviceable  but is this the case with smaller changes there are persons who can see distinctly only in a dull light and this condition depends i believe on the abnormal sensitiveness of the retina and is known to be inherited now if a bird for instance receive some great advantage from seeing well in the twilight all the individuals with the most sensitive retina would succeed best and be the most likely to survive and why should not all those which happened to have the eye itself a little larger or the pupil capable of greater dilatation be likewise preserved whether or not these modifications were strictly simultaneous these individuals would subsequently intercross and blend their respective advantages by such slight successive changes the eye of a diurnal bird would be brought into the condition of that of an owl which has often been advanced as an excellent instance of adaptation short sight which is often inherited permits a person to see distinctly a minute object at so near a distance that it would be indistinct to ordinary eyes and here we have a capacity which might be serviceable under certain conditions abruptly gained the fuegians on board the beagle could certainly see distant objects more distinctly than our sailors with all their long practice i do not know whether this depends upon sensitiveness or on the power of adjustment in the focus but this capacity for distant vision might it is probable be slightly augmented by successive modifications of either kind amphibious animals which are enabled to see both in the water and in the air require and possess as m plateau has shown 2092 on the vision of fishes and amphibia translated in annals and mag of nat hist volume 18 1866 page 469 eyes constructed on the following plan the cornea is always flat or at least much flattened in the front of the crystalline and over a space equal to the diameter of that lens whilst the lateral portions may be much curved the crystalline is very nearly a sphere and the humours have nearly the same density as water now as a terrestrial animal became more and more aquatic in its habits very slight changes first in the curvature of the cornea or crystalline and then in the density of the humours or conversely might successively occur and would be advantageous to the animal whilst under water without serious detriment to its power of vision in the air it is of course impossible to conjecture by what steps the fundamental structure of the eye in the vertebrata was originally acquired for we know nothing about this organ in the first progenitors of the class with respect to the lowest animals in the scale the transitional states through which the eye at first probably passed can by the aid of analogy be indicated as i have attempted to show in my origin of species 2093 sixth edition 1872 page 144   chapter 2xxi  selection continued  natural selection as affecting domestic productions characters which appear of trifling value often of real importance circumstances favourable to selection by man facility in preventing crosses and the nature of the conditions close attention and perseverance indispensable the production of a large number of individuals especially favourable when no selection is applied distinct races are not formed highlybred animals liable to degeneration tendency in man to carry the selection of each character to an extreme point leading to divergence of character rarely to convergence characters continuing to vary in the same direction in which they have already varied divergence of character with the extinction of intermediate varieties leads to distinctness in our domestic races limit to the power of selection lapse of time important manner in which domestic races have originated summary  natural selection or the survival of the fittest as affecting domestic productions  we know little on this head but as animals kept by savages have to provide throughout the year their own food either entirely or to a large extent it can hardly be doubted that in different countries varieties differing in constitution and in various characters would succeed best and so be naturally selected hence perhaps it is that the few domesticated animals kept by savages partake as has been remarked by more than one writer of the wild appearance of their masters and likewise resemble natural species even in longcivilised countries at least in the wilder parts natural selection must act on our domestic races it is obvious that varieties having very different habits constitution and structure would succeed best on mountains and on rich lowland pastures for example the improved leicester sheep were formerly taken to the lammermuir hills but an intelligent sheepmaster reported that our coarse lean pastures were unequal to the task of supporting such heavy bodied sheep and they gradually dwindled away into less and less bulk each generation was inferior to the preceding one and when the spring was severe seldom more than twothirds of the lambs survived the ravages of the storms 211 quoted by youatt on sheep page 325 see also youatt on cattle pages 62 69 so with the mountain cattle of north wales and the hebrides it has been found that they could not withstand being crossed with the larger and more delicate lowland breeds two french naturalists in describing the horses of circassia remark that subjected as they are to extreme vicissitudes of climate having to search for scanty pasture and exposed to constant danger from wolves the strongest and most vigorous alone survive 212 mm lherbette and de quatrefages in bull soc dacclimat tome 8 1861 page 311  every one must have been struck with the surpassing grace strength and vigour of the gamecock with its bold and confident air its long yet firm neck compact body powerful and closely pressed wings muscular thighs strong beak massive at the base dense and sharp spurs set low on the legs for delivering the fatal blow and its compact glossy and maillike plumage serving as a defence now the english gamecock has not only been improved during many years by mans careful selection but in addition as mr tegetmeier has remarked 213 the poultry book 1866 page 123 mr tegetmeier the homing or carrier pigeon 1871 pages 4558 by a kind of natural selection for the strongest most active and courageous birds have stricken down their antagonists in the cockpit generation after generation and have subsequently served as the progenitors of their race the same kind of double selection has come into play with the carrier pigeon for during their training the inferior birds fail to return home and are lost so that even without selection by man only the superior birds propagate their race  in great britain in former times almost every district had its own breed of cattle and sheep they were indigenous to the soil climate and pasturage of the locality on which they grazed they seemed to have been formed for it and by it 214 youatt on sheep page 312 but in this case we are quite unable to disentangle the effects of the direct action of the conditions of lifeof use or habitof natural selectionand of that kind of selection which we have seen is occasionally and unconsciously followed by man even during the rudest periods of history  let us now look to the action of natural selection on special characters although nature is difficult to resist yet man often strives against her power and sometimes with success from the facts to be given it will also be seen that natural selection would powerfully affect many of our domestic productions if left unprotected this is a point of much interest for we thus learn that differences apparently of very slight importance would certainly determine the survival of a form when forced to struggle for its own existence it may have occurred to some naturalists as it formerly did to me that though selection acting under natural conditions would determine the structure of all important organs yet that it could not affect characters which are esteemed by us of little importance but this is an error to which we are eminently liable from our ignorance of what characters are of real value to each living creature  when man attempts to make a breed with some serious defect in structure or in the mutual relation of the several parts he will partly or completely fail or encounter much difficulty he is in fact resisted by a form of natural selection we have seen that an attempt was once made in yorkshire to breed cattle with enormous buttocks but the cows perished so often in bringing forth their calves that the attempt had to be given up in rearing short faced tumblers mr eaton says 215 treatise on the almond tumbler 1851 page 33 i am convinced that better head and beak birds have perished in the shell than ever were hatched the reason being that the amazingly short faced bird cannot reach and break the shell with its beak and so perishes here is a more curious case in which natural selection comes into play only at long intervals of time during ordinary seasons the niata cattle can graze as well as others but occasionally as from 1827 to 1830 the plains of la plata suffer from longcontinued droughts and the pasture is burnt up at such times common cattle and horses perish by the thousand but many survive by browsing on twigs reeds etc this the niata cattle cannot so well effect from their upturned jaws and the shape of their lips consequently if not attended to they perish before the other cattle in columbia according to roulin there is a breed of nearly hairless cattle called pelones these succeed in their native hot district but are found too tender for the cordillera in this case however natural selection determines only the range of the variety it is obvious that a host of artificial races could never survive in a state of naturesuch as italian greyhoundshairless and almost toothless turkish dogsfantail pigeons which cannot fly well against a strong windbarbs and polish fowls with their vision impeded by their eye wattles and great topknotshornless bulls and rams which consequently cannot cope with other males and thus have a poor chance of leaving offspringseedless plants and many other such cases  colour is generally esteemed by the systematic naturalist as unimportant let us therefore see how far it indirectly affects our domestic productions and how far it would affect them if they were left exposed to the full force of natural selection in a future chapter i shall have to show that constitutional peculiarities of the strangest kind entailing liability to the action of certain poisons are correlated with the colour of the skin i will here give a single case on the high authority of professor wyman he informs me that being surprised at all the pigs in a part of virginia being black he made inquiries and ascertained that these animals feed on the roots of the lachnanthes tinctoria which colours their bones pink and excepting in the case of the black varieties causes the hoofs to drop off hence as one of the squatters remarked we select the black members of the litter for raising as they alone have a good chance of living so that here we have artificial and natural selection working hand in hand i may add that in the tarentino the inhabitants keep black sheep alone because the hypericum crispum abounds there and this plant does not injure black sheep but kills the white ones in about a fortnights time 216 dr heusinger wochenschrift fur die hei1kunde berlin 1846 s 279  complexion and liability to certain diseases are believed to run together in man and the lower animals thus white terriers suffer more than those of any other colour from the fatal distemper 217 youatt on the dog page 232 in north america plumtrees are liable to a disease which downing 218 the fruittrees of america 1845 page 270 for peaches page 466 believes is not caused by insects the kinds bearing purple fruit are most affected and we have never known the green or yellow fruited varieties infected until the other sorts had first become filled with the knots on the other hand peaches in north america suffer much from a disease called the yellows which seems to be peculiar to that continent and more than ninetenths of the victims when the disease first appeared were the yellowfleshed peaches the whitefleshed kinds are much more rarely attacked in some parts of the country never in mauritius the white sugarcanes have of late years been so severely attacked by a disease that many planters have been compelled to give up growing this variety although fresh plants were imported from china for trial and cultivate only red canes 219 proc royal soc of arts and sciences of mauritius 1852 page 135 now if these plants had been forced to struggle with other competing plants and enemies there cannot be a doubt that the colour of the flesh or skin of the fruit unimportant as these characters are considered would have rigorously determined their existence  liability to the attacks of parasites is also connected with colour white chickens are certainly more subject than darkcoloured chickens to the gapes which is caused by a parasitic worm in the trachea 2110 gardeners chronicle 1856 page 379 on the other hand experience has shown that in france the caterpillars which produce white cocoons resist the deadly fungus better than those producing yellow cocoons 2111 quatrefages maladies actuelles du ver a soie 1859 pages 12 214 analogous facts have been observed with plants a new and beautiful white onion imported from france though planted close to other kinds was alone attacked by a parasitic fungus 2112 gardeners chronicle 1851 page 595 white verbenas are especially liable to mildew 2113 journal of horticulture 1862 page 476 near malaga during an early period of the vinedisease the green sorts suffered most and red and black grapes even when interwoven with the sick plants suffered not at all in france whole groups of varieties were comparatively free and others such as the chasselas did not afford a single fortunate exception but i do not know whether any correlation between colour and liability to disease was here observed 2114 gardeners chronicle 1852 pages 435 691 in a former chapter it was shown how curiously liable one variety of the strawberry is to mildew  it is certain that insects regulate in many cases the range and even the existence of the higher animals whilst living under their natural conditions under domestication lightcoloured animals suffer most in thuringia 2115 bechstein naturgesch deutschlands 1801 b 1 s 310 the inhabitants do not like grey white or pale cattle because they are much more troubled by various kinds of flies than the brown red or black cattle an albino negro it has been remarked 2116 prichard phys hist of mankind 1851 volume 1 page 224 was peculiarly sensitive to the bites of insects in the west indies 2117 g lewis journal of residence in west indies home and col library page 100 it is said that the only horned cattle fit for work are those which have a good deal of black in them the white are terribly tormented by the insects and they are weak and sluggish in proportion to the white  in devonshire there is a prejudice against white pigs because it is believed that the sun blisters them when turned out 2118 sidneys edition of youatt on the pig page 24 i have given analogous facts in the case of mankind in my descent of man 2nd edition page 195 and i knew a man who would not keep white pigs in kent for the same reason the scorching of flowers by the sun seems likewise to depend much on colour thus dark pelargoniums suffer most and from various accounts it is clear that the clothofgold variety will not withstand a degree of exposure to sunshine which other varieties enjoy another amateur asserts that not only all darkcoloured verbenas but likewise scarlets suffer from the sun the paler kinds stand better and pale blue is perhaps the best of all so again with the heartsease viola tricolor hot weather suits the blotched sorts whilst it destroys the beautiful markings of some other kinds 2119 journal of horticulture 1862 pages 476 498 1865 page 460 with respect to the heartsease gardeners chronicle 1863 page 628 during one extremely cold season in holland all redflowered hyacinths were observed to be very inferior in quality it is believed by many agriculturists that red wheat is hardier in northern climates than white wheat 2120 des jacinthes de leur culture 1768 page 53 on wheat gardeners chronicle 1846 page 653  with animals white varieties from being conspicuous are the most liable to be attacked by beasts and birds of prey in parts of france and germany where hawks abound persons are advised not to keep white pigeons for as parmentier says it is certain that in a flock the white always first fall victims to the kite in belgium where so many societies have been established for the flight of carrierpigeons white is the one colour which for the same reason is disliked 2021 wb

whilst fishing found four pigeons which had been killed by hawks and all were white on another occasion he examined the eyrie of a hawk and the feathers of the pigeons which had been caught were all of a white or yellow colour on the other hand it is said that the seaeagle falco ossifragus linn on the west coast of ireland picks out the black fowls so that the villagers avoid as much as possible rearing birds of that colour m daudin 2023 bull de la soc dacclimat tome 7 1860 page 359 speaking of white rabbits kept in warrens in russia remarks that their colour is a great disadvantage as they are thus more exposed to attack and can be seen during bright nights from a distance a gentleman in kent who failed to stock his woods with a nearly white and hardy kind of rabbit accounted in the same manner for their early disappearance any one who will watch a white cat prowling after her prey will soon perceive under what a disadvantage she lies  the white tartarian cherry owing either to its colour being so much like that of the leaves or to the fruit always appearing from a distance unripe is not so readily attacked by birds as other sorts the yellowfruited raspberry which generally comes nearly true by seed is very little molested by birds who evidently are not fond of it so that nets may be dispensed with in places where nothing else will protect the red fruit 2124 transact hort soc volume 1 2nd series 1835 page 275 for raspberries see gardeners chronicle 1855 page 154 and 1863 page 245 this immunity though a benefit to the gardener would be a disadvantage in a state of nature both to the cherry and raspberry as dissemination depends on birds i noticed during several winters that some trees of the yellowberried holly which were raised from seed from a tree found wild by my father remained covered with fruit whilst not a scarlet berry could be seen on the adjoining trees of the common kind a friend informs me that a mountainash pyrus aucuparia growing in his garden bears berries which though not differently coloured are always devoured by birds before those on the other trees this variety of the mountainash would thus be more freely disseminated and the yellowberried variety of the holly less freely than the common varieties of these two trees  independently of colour trifling differences are sometimes found to be of importance to plants under cultivation and would be of paramount importance if they had to fight their own battle and to struggle with many competitors the thinshelled peas called pois sans parchemin are attacked by birds 2125 gardeners chronicle 1843 page 806 much more commonly than ordinary peas on the other hand the purplepodded pea which has a hard shell escaped the attacks of tomtits parus major in my garden far better than any other kind the thinshelled walnut likewise suffers greatly from the tomtit 2126 ibid 1850 page 732 these same birds have been observed to pass over and thus favour the filbert destroying only the other kinds of nuts which grew in the same orchard 2127 ibid 1860 page 956  certain varieties of the pear have soft bark and these suffer severely from woodboring beetles whilst other varieties are known to resist their attacks much better 2128 j de jonghe in gardeners chronicle 1860 page 120 in north america the smoothness or absence of down on the fruit makes a great difference in the attacks of the weevil which is the uncompromising foe of all smooth stonefruits and the cultivator has the frequent mortification of seeing nearly all or indeed often the whole crop fall from the trees when half or twothirds grown hence the nectarine suffers more than the peach a particular variety of the morello cherry raised in north america is without any assignable cause more liable to be injured by this same insect than other cherrytrees 2129 downing fruittrees of north america pages 266 501 in regard to the cherry page 198 from some unknown cause certain varieties of the apple enjoy as we have seen the great advantage in various parts of the world of not being infested by the coccus on the other hand a particular case has been recorded in which aphides confined themselves to the winter nelis pear and touched no other kind in an extensive orchard 2130 gardeners chronicle 1849 page 755 the existence of minute glands on the leaves of peaches nectarines and apricots would not be esteemed by botanists as a character of the least importance for they are present or absent in closelyrelated subvarieties descended from the same parenttree yet there is good evidence 2131 journal of horticulture september 26 1865 page 254 see other references given in chapter 10 that the absence of glands leads to mildew which is highly injurious to these trees  a difference either in flavour or in the amount of nutriment in certain varieties causes them to be more eagerly attacked by various enemies than other varieties of the same species bullfinches pyrrhula vulgaris injure our fruittrees by devouring the flowerbuds and a pair of these birds have been seen to denude a large plumtree in a couple of days of almost every bud but certain varieties 2132 mr selby in mag of zoology and botany edinburgh volume 2 1838 page 393 of the apple and thorn crataegus oxyacantha are more especially liable to be attacked a striking instance of this was observed in mr riverss garden in which two rows of a particular variety of plum 2133 the reine claude de bavay journal of horticulture december 27 1864 page 511 had to be carefully protected as they were usually stripped of all their buds during the winter whilst other sorts growing near them escaped the root or enlarged stem of laings swedish turnip is preferred by hares and therefore suffers more than other varieties hares and rabbits eat down common rye before st johnsdayrye when both grow together 2134 mr pusey in journal of r agricult soc volume 6 page 179 for swedish turnips see gardeners chronicle 1847 page 91 in the south of france when an orchard of almondtrees is formed the nuts of the bitter variety are sown in order that they may not be devoured by field mice 2135 godron de lespece tome 2 page 98 so we see the use of the bitter principle in almonds  other slight differences which would be thought quite unimportant are no doubt sometimes of great service both to plants and animals the whitesmiths gooseberry as formerly stated produces its leaves later than other varieties and as the flowers are thus left unprotected the fruit often fails in one variety of the cherry according to mr rivers 2136 gardeners chronicle 1866 page 732 the petals are much curled backwards and in consequence of this the stigmas were observed to be killed by a severe frost whilst at the same time in another variety with incurved petals the stigmas were not in the least injured the straw of the fenton wheat is remarkably unequal in height and a competent observer believes that this variety is highly productive partly because the ears from being distributed at various heights above the ground are less crowded together the same observer maintains that in the upright varieties the divergent awns are serviceable by breaking the shocks when the ears are dashed together by the wind 2137 gardeners chronicle 1862 pages 820 821 if several varieties of a plant are grown together and the seed is indiscriminately harvested it is clear that the hardier and more productive kinds will by a sort of natural selection gradually prevail over the others this takes place as colonel le couteur believes 2138 on the varieties of wheat page 59 in our wheatfields for as formerly shown no variety is quite uniform in character the same thing as i am assured by nurserymen would take place in our flowergardens if the seed of the different varieties were not separately saved when the eggs of the wild and tame duck are hatched together the young wild ducks almost invariably perish from being of smaller size and not getting their fair share of food 2139 mr hewitt and others in journal of hort 1862 page 773  facts in sufficient number have now been given showing that natural selection often checks but occasionally favours mans power of selection these facts teach us in addition a valuable lesson namely that we ought to be extremely cautious in judging what characters are of importance in a state of nature to animals and plants which have to struggle for existence from the hour of their birth to that of their deaththeir existence depending on conditions about which we are profoundly ignorant  circumstances favourable to selection by man  the possibility of selection rests on variability and this as we shall see in the following chapters mainly depends on changed conditions of life but is governed by infinitely complex and unknown laws domestication even when long continued occasionally causes but a small amount of variability as in the case of the goose and turkey the slight differences however which characterise each individual animal and plant would in most probably in all cases suffice for the production of distinct races through careful and prolonged selection we see what selection though acting on mere individual differences can effect when families of cattle sheep pigeons etc of the same race have been separately bred during a number of years by different men without any wish on their part to modify the breed we see the same fact in the difference between hounds bred for hunting in different districts 2140 encyclop of rural sports page 405 and in many other such cases  in order that selection should produce any result it is manifest that the crossing of distinct races must be prevented hence facility in pairing as with the pigeon is highly favourable for the work and difficulty in pairing as with cats prevents the formation of distinct breeds on nearly the same principle the cattle of the small island of jersey have been improved in their milking qualities with a rapidity that could not have been obtained in a widely extended country like france 2141 col le couteur journal roy agricult soc volume 4 page 43 although free crossing is a danger on the one side which every one can see too close interbreeding is a hidden danger on the other side unfavourable conditions of life overrule the power of selection our improved heavy breeds of cattle and sheep could not have been formed on mountainous pastures nor could drayhorses have been raised on a barren and inhospitable land such as the falkland islands where even the light horses of la plata rapidly decrease in size it seems impossible to preserve several english breeds of sheep in france for as soon as the lambs are weaned their vigour decays as the heat of the summer increases 2142 malingienouel journal r agricult soc volume 14 1853 pages 215 217 it would be impossible to give great length of wool to sheep within the tropics yet selection has kept the merino breed nearly true under diversified and unfavourable conditions the power of selection is so great that breeds of the dog sheep and poultry of the largest and smallest size long and short beaked pigeons and other breeds with opposite characters have had their characteristic qualities augmented though treated in every way alike being exposed to the same climate and fed on the same food selection however is either checked or favoured by the effects of use or habit our wonderfully improved pigs could never have been formed if they had been forced to search for their own food the english racehorse and greyhound could not have been improved up to their present high standard of excellence without constant training  as conspicuous deviations of structure occur rarely the improvement of each breed is generally the result of the selection of slight individual differences hence the closest attention the sharpest powers of observation and indomitable perseverance are indispensable it is also highly important that many individuals of the breed which is to be improved should be raised for thus there will be a better chance of the appearance of variations in the right direction and individuals varying in an unfavourable manner may be freely rejected or destroyed but that a large number of individuals should be raised it is necessary that the conditions of life should favour the propagation of the species had the peacock been reared as easily as the fowl we should probably ere this have had many distinct races we see the importance of a large number of plants from the fact of nursery gardeners almost always beating amateurs in the exhibition of new varieties in 1845 it was estimated 2143 gardeners chronicle 1845 page 273 that between 4000 and 5000 pelargoniums were annually raised from seed in england yet a decidedly improved variety is rarely obtained at messrs carters grounds in essex where such flowers as the lobelia nemophila mignonette etc are grown by the acre for seed scarcely a season passes without some new kinds being raised or some improvement effected on old kinds 2144 journal of horticulture 1862 page 157 at kew as mr beaton remarks where many seedlings of common plants are raised you see new forms of laburnums spiraeas and other shrubs 2145 cottage gardener 1860 page 368 so with animals marshall 2146 a review of reports 1808 page 406 in speaking of the sheep in one part of yorkshire remarks as they belong to poor people and are mostly in small lots they never can be improved lord rivers when asked how he succeeded in always having firstrate greyhounds answered i breed many and hang many this as another man remarks was the secret of his success and the same will be found in exhibiting fowls successful competitors breed largely and keep the best 2147 gardeners chronicle 1853 page 45  it follows from this that the capacity of breeding at an early age and at short intervals as with pigeons rabbits etc facilitates selection for the result is thus soon made visible and perseverance in the work encouraged it can hardly be an accident that the great majority of the culinary and agricultural plants which have yielded numerous races are annuals or biennials which therefore are capable of rapid propagation and thus of improvement seakale asparagus common and jerusalem artichokes potatoes and onions must be excepted as they are perennials but onions are propagated like annuals and of the other plants just specified none with the exception of the potato have yielded in this country more than one or two varieties in the mediterranean region where artichokes are often raised from seed there are several kinds as i hear from mr bentham no doubt fruit trees which cannot be propagated quickly by seed have yielded a host of varieties though not permanent races but these judging from prehistoric remains have been produced at a comparatively late period  a species may be highly variable but distinct races will not be formed if from any cause selection be not applied it would be difficult to select slight variations in fishes from their place of habitation and though the carp is extremely variable and is much attended to in germany only one well marked race has been formed as i hear from lord a russell namely the spiegelcarpe and this is carefully secluded from the common scaly kind on the other hand a closely allied species the goldfish from being reared in small vessels and from having been carefully attended to by the chinese has yielded many races neither the bee which has been semidomesticated from an extremely remote period nor the cochineal insect which was cultivated by the aboriginal mexicans 2148 isidore geoffroy sainthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 49 on the cochineal insect page 46 has yielded races and it would be impossible to match the queenbee with any particular drone and most difficult to match cochineal insects silkmoths on the other hand have been subjected to rigorous selection and have produced a host of races cats which from their nocturnal habits cannot be selected for breeding do not as formerly remarked yield distinct races within the same country dogs are held in abomination in the east and their breeding is neglected consequently as prof moritz wagner 2149 die darwinsche theorie und das migrationsgesetz der organismen 1868 page 19 remarks one kind alone exists there the ass in england varies much in colour and size but as it is an animal of little value and bred by poor people there has been no selection and distinct races have not been formed we must not attribute the inferiority of our asses to climate for in india they are of even smaller size than in europe but when selection is brought to bear on the ass all is changed near cordova as i am informed february 1860 by mr we webb ce they are carefully bred as much as 200 pounds having been paid for a stallion ass and they have been immensely improved in kentucky asses have been imported for breeding mules from spain malta and france these seldom averaged more than fourteen hands high but the kentuckians by great care have raised them up to fifteen hands and sometimes even to sixteen the prices paid for these splendid animals for such they really are will prove how much they are in request one male of great celebrity was sold for upwards of one thousand pounds sterling these choice asses are sent to cattleshows a day being given for their exhibition 2150 capt marryat quoted by blyth in journ asiatic soc of bengal volume 28 page 229  analogous facts have been observed with plants the nutmegtree in the malay archipelago is highly variable but there has been no selection and there are no distinct races 2151 mr oxley journal of the indian archipelago volume 2 1848 page 645 the common mignonette reseda odorata from bearing inconspicuous flowers valued solely for their fragrance remains in the same unimproved condition as when first introduced 2152 mr abbey journal of horticulture december 1 1863 page 430 our common foresttrees are very variable as may be seen in every extensive nurseryground but as they are not valued like fruittrees and as they seed late in life no selection has been applied to them consequently as mr patrick matthews remarks 2153 on naval timber 1831 page 107 they have not yielded distinct races leafing at different periods growing to different sizes and producing timber fit for different purposes we have gained only some fanciful and semi monstrous varieties which no doubt appeared suddenly as we now see them  some botanists have argued that plants cannot have so strong a tendency to vary as is generally supposed because many species long grown in botanic gardens or unintentionally cultivated year after year mingled with our corn crops have not produced distinct races but this is accounted for by slight variations not having been selected and propagated let a plant which is now grown in a botanic garden or any common weed be cultivated on a large scale and let a sharpsighted gardener look out for each slight variety and sow the seed and then if distinct races are not produced the argument will be valid  the importance of selection is likewise shown by considering special characters for instance with most breeds of fowls the form of the comb and the colour of the plumage have been attended to and are eminently characteristic of each race but in dorkings fashion has never demanded uniformity of comb or colour and the utmost diversity in these respects prevails rosecombs doublecombs cupcombs etc and colours of all kinds may be seen in purely bred and closely related dorking fowls whilst other points such as the general form of body and the presence of an additional toe have been attended to and are invariably present it has also been ascertained that colour can be fixed in this breed as well as in any other 2154 mr baily in the poultry chronicle volume 2 1854 page 150 also volume 1 page 342 volume 3 page 245  during the formation or improvement of a breed its members will always be found to vary much in those characters to which especial attention is directed and of which each slight improvement is eagerly sought and selected thus with shortfaced tumblerpigeons the shortness of the beak shape of head and plumagewith carriers the length of the beak and wattlewith fantails the tail and carriagewith spanish fowls the white face and combwith longeared rabbits the length of ear are all points which are eminently variable so it is in every case and the large price paid for firstrate animals proves the difficulty of breeding them up to the highest standard of excellence this subject has been discussed by fanciers 2155 cottage gardener 1855 december page 171 1856 january pages 248 323 and the greater prizes given for highly improved breeds in comparison with those given for old breeds which are not now undergoing rapid improvement have been fully justified nathusius makes 2156 ueber shorthorn rindvieh 1857 s 51 a similar remark when discussing the less uniform character of improved shorthorn cattle and of the english horse in comparison for example with the unennobled cattle of hungary or with the horses of the asiatic steppes this want of uniformity in the parts which at the time are undergoing selection chiefly depends on the strength of the principle of reversion but it likewise depends to a certain extent on the continued variability of the parts which have recently varied that the same parts do continue varying in the same manner we must admit for if it were not so there could be no improvement beyond an early standard of excellence and we know that such improvement is not only possible but is of general occurrence  as a consequence of continued variability and more especially of reversion all highly improved races if neglected or not subjected to incessant selection soon degenerate youatt gives a curious instance of this in some cattle formerly kept in glamorganshire but in this case the cattle were not fed with sufficient care mr baker in his memoir on the horse sums up it must have been observed in the preceding pages that whenever there has been neglect the breed has proportionally deteriorated 2157 the veterinary volume 13 page 720 for the glamorganshire cattle see youatt on cattle page 51 if a considerable number of improved cattle sheep or other animals of the same race were allowed to breed freely together with no selection but with no change in their condition of life there can be no doubt that after a score or hundred generations they would be very far from excellent of their kind but from what we see of the many common races of dogs cattle fowls pigeons etc which without any particular care have long retained nearly the same character we have no grounds for believing that they would altogether depart from their type  it is a general belief amongst breeders that characters of all kinds become fixed by longcontinued inheritance but i have attempted to show in the fourteenth chapter that this belief apparently resolves itself into the following proposition namely that all characters whatever whether recently acquired or ancient tend to be transmitted but that those which have already long withstood all counteracting influences will as a general rule continue to withstand them and consequently be faithfully transmitted  tendency in man to carry the practice of selection to an extreme point  it is an important principle that in the process of selection man almost invariably wishes to go to an extreme point thus there is no limit to his desire to breed certain kinds of horses and dogs as fleet as possible and others as strong as possible certain kinds of sheep for extreme fineness and others for extreme length of wool and he wishes to produce fruit grain tubers and other useful parts of plants as large and excellent as possible with animals bred for amusement the same principle is even more powerful for fashion as we see in our dress always runs to extremes this view has been expressly admitted by fanciers instances were given in the chapters on the pigeon but here is another mr eaton after describing a comparatively new variety namely the archangel remarks what fanciers intend doing with this bird i am at a loss to know whether they intend to breed it down to the tumblers head and beak or carry it out to the carriers head and beak leaving it as they found it is not progressing ferguson speaking of fowls says their peculiarities whatever they may be must necessarily be fully developed a little peculiarity forms nought but ugliness seeing it violates the existing laws of symmetry so mr brent in discussing the merits of the subvarieties of the belgian canarybird remarks fanciers always go to extremes they do not admire indefinite properties 2158 jm eaton a treatise on fancy pigeons page 82 ferguson on rare and prize poultry page 162 mr brent in cottage gardener october 1860 page 13  this principle which necessarily leads to divergence of character explains the present state of various domestic races we can thus see how it is that racehorses and drayhorses greyhounds and mastiffs which are opposed to each other in every characterhow varieties so distinct as cochinchina fowls and bantams or carrierpigeons with very long beaks and tumblers with excessively short beaks have been derived from the same stock as each breed is slowly improved the inferior varieties are first neglected and finally lost in a few cases by the aid of old records or from intermediate varieties still existing in countries where other fashions have prevailed we are enabled partially to trace the graduated changes through which certain breeds have passed selection whether methodical or unconscious always tending towards an extreme point together with the neglect and slow extinction of the intermediate and lessvalued forms is the key which unlocks the mystery of how man has produced such wonderful results  in a few instances selection guided by utility for a single purpose has led to convergence of character all the improved and different races of the pig as nathusius has well shown 2159 die racen des schweines 1860 s 48 closely approach each other in character in their shortened legs and muzzles their almost hairless large rounded bodies and small tusks we see some degree of convergence in the similar outline of the body in wellbred cattle belonging to distinct races 2160 see some good remarks on this head by m de quatrefages unite de lespece humaine 1861 page 119 i know of no other such cases  continued divergence of character depends on and is indeed a clear proof as previously remarked of the same parts continuing to vary in the same direction the tendency to mere general variability or plasticity of organisation can certainly be inherited even from one parent as has been shown by gartner and kolreuter in the production of varying hybrids from two species of which one alone was variable it is in itself probable that when an organ has varied in any manner it will again vary in the same manner if the conditions which first caused the being to vary remain as far as can be judged the same this is either tacitly or expressly admitted by all horticulturists if a gardener observes one or two additional petals in a flower he feels confident that in a few generations he will be able to raise a double flower crowded with petals some of the seedlings from the weeping moccas oak were so prostrate that they only crawled along the ground a seedling from the fastigiate or upright irish yew is described as differing greatly from the parentform by the exaggeration of the fastigiate habit of its branches 2161 verlot des varietes 1865 page 94 mr shirreff who has been highly successful in raising new kinds of wheat remarks a good variety may safely be regarded as the forerunner of a better one 2162 mr patrick shirreff gardeners chronicle 1858 page 771 a great rosegrower mr rivers has made the same remark with respect to roses sageret 2163 pomologie physiolog 1830 page 106 who had large experience in speaking of the future progress of fruittrees observes that the most important principle is that the more plants have departed from their original type the more they tend to depart from it there is apparently much truth in this remark for we can in no other way understand the surprising amount of difference between varieties in the parts or qualities which are valued whilst other parts retain nearly their original character  the foregoing discussion naturally leads to the question what is the limit to the possible amount of variation in any part or quality and consequently is there any limit to what selection can effect will a racehorse ever be reared fleeter than eclipse can our prizecattle and sheep be still further improved will a gooseberry ever weigh more than that produced by london in 1852 will the beetroot in france yield a greater percentage of sugar will future varieties of wheat and other grain produce heavier crops than our present varieties these questions cannot be positively answered but it is certain that we ought to be cautious in answering them by a negative in some lines of variation the limit has probably been reached youatt believes that the reduction of bone in some of our sheep has already been carried so far that it entails great delicacy of constitution 2164 youatt on sheep page 521 but seeing the great improvement within recent times in our cattle and sheep and especially in our pigs seeing the wonderful increase in weight in our poultry of all kinds during the last few years he would be a bold man who would assert that perfection has been reached it has often been said that eclipse never was and never will be beaten in speed by any other horse but on making inquiries i find that the best judges believe that our present racehorses are fleeter 2165 see also stonehenge british rural sports edition of 1871 page 384 the attempt to raise a new variety of wheat more productive than the many old kinds might have been thought until lately quite hopeless but this has been effected by major hallett by careful selection with respect to almost all our animals and plants those who are best qualified to judge do not believe that the extreme point of perfection has yet been reached even in the characters which have already been carried to a high standard for instance the shortfaced tumblerpigeon has been greatly modified nevertheless according to mr eaton 2166 a treatise on the almond tumbler page 1 the field is still as open for fresh competitors as it was one hundred years ago over and over again it has been said that perfection had been attained with our flowers but a higher standard has soon been reached hardly any fruit has been more improved than the strawberry yet a great authority remarks 2167 m j de jonghe in gardeners chronicle 1858 page 173 it must not be concealed that we are far from the extreme limits at which we may arrive  no doubt there is a limit beyond which the organisation cannot be modified compatibly with health or life the extreme degree of fleetness for instance of which a terrestrial animal is capable may have been acquired by our present racehorses but as mr wallace has well remarked 2168 contributions to the theory of natural selection 2nd edition 1871 page 292 the question that interests us is not whether indefinite and unlimited change in any or all directions is possible but whether such differences as do occur in nature could have been produced by the accumulation of varieties by selection and in the case of our domestic productions there can be no doubt that many parts of the organisation to which man has attended have been thus modified to a greater degree than the corresponding parts in the natural species of the same genera or even families we see this in the form and size of our light and heavy dogs or horsesin the beak and many other characters of our pigeonsin the size and quality of many fruitsin comparison with the species belonging to the same natural groups  time is an important element in the formation of our domestic races as it permits innumerable individuals to be born and these when exposed to diversified conditions are rendered variable methodical selection has been occasionally practised from an ancient period to the present day even by semicivilised people and during former times will have produced some effect unconscious selection will have been still more effective for during a lengthened period the more valuable individual animals will occasionally have been saved and the less valuable neglected in the course of time different varieties especially in the less civilised countries will also have been more or less modified through natural selection it is generally believed though on this head we have little or no evidence that new characters in time become fixed and after having long remained fixed it seems possible that under new conditions they might again be rendered variable  how great the lapse of time has been since man first domesticated animals and cultivated plants we begin dimly to see when the lakedwellings of switzerland were inhabited during the neolithic period several animals were already domesticated and various plants cultivated the science of language tells us that the art of ploughing and sowing the land was followed and the chief animals had been already domesticated at an epoch so immensely remote that the sanskrit greek latin gothic celtic and sclavonic languages had not as yet diverged from their common parenttongue 2169 max muller science of language 1861 page 223  it is scarcely possible to overrate the effects of selection occasionally carried on in various ways and places during thousands of generations all that we know and in a still stronger degree all that we do not know 2170 youatt on cattle pages 116 128 of the history of the great majority of our breeds even of our more modern breeds agrees with the view that their production through the action of unconscious and methodical selection has been almost insensibly slow when a man attends rather more closely than is usual to the breeding of his animals he is almost sure to improve them to a slight extent they are in consequence valued in his immediate neighbourhood and are bred by others and their characteristic features whatever these may be will then slowly but steadily be increased sometimes by methodical and almost always by unconscious selection at last a strain deserving to be called a subvariety becomes a little more widely known receives a local name and spreads the spreading will have been extremely slow during ancient and less civilised times but now is rapid by the time that the new breed had assumed a somewhat distinct character its history hardly noticed at the time will have been completely forgotten for as low remarks 2171 domesticated animals page 188 we know how quickly the memory of such events is effaced  as soon as a new breed is thus formed it is liable through the same process to break up into new strains and subvarieties for different varieties are suited for and are valued under different circumstances fashion changes but should a fashion last for even a moderate length of time so strong is the principle of inheritance that some effect will probably be impressed on the breed thus varieties go on increasing in number and history shows us how wonderfully they have increased since the earliest records 2172 volz beitrage zur kulturgeschichte 1852 s 99 et passim as each new variety is produced the earlier intermediate and less valuable forms will be neglected and perish when a breed from not being valued is kept in small numbers its extinction almost inevitably follows sooner or later either from accidental causes of destruction or from close interbreeding and this is an event which in the case of wellmarked breeds excites attention the birth or production of a new domestic race is so slow a process that it escapes notice its death or destruction is comparatively sudden is often recorded and when too late sometimes regretted  several authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and natural races the latter are more uniform in character possessing in a high degree the appearance of natural species and are of ancient origin they are generally found in less civilised countries and have probably been largely modified by natural selection and only to a small extent by mans unconscious and methodical selection they have also during a long period been directly acted on by the physical conditions of the countries which they inhabit the socalled artificial races on the other hand are not so uniform in character some have a semimonstrous character such as the wrylegged terriers so useful in rabbitshooting 2173 blaine encyclop of rural sports page 213 turnspit dogs ancon sheep niata oxen polish fowls fantailpigeons etc their characteristic features have generally been acquired suddenly though subsequently increased by careful selections in many cases other races which certainly must be called artificial for they have been largely modified by methodical selection and by crossing as the english racehorse terrierdogs the english gamecock antwerp carrierpigeons etc nevertheless cannot be said to have an unnatural appearance and no distinct line as it seems to me can be drawn between natural and artificial races  it is not surprising that domestic races should generally present a different aspect from natural species man selects and propagates modifications solely for his own use or fancy and not for the creatures own good his attention is struck by strongly marked modifications which have appeared suddenly due to some great disturbing cause in the organisation he attends almost exclusively to external characters and when he succeeds in modifying internal organswhen for instance he reduces the bones and offal or loads the viscera with fat or gives early maturity etcthe chances are strong that he will at the same time weaken the constitution on the other hand when an animal has to struggle throughout its life with many competitors and enemies under circumstances inconceivably complex and liable to change modifications of the most varied nature in the internal organs as well as in external characters in the functions and mutual relations of parts will be rigorously tested preserved or rejected natural selection often checks mans comparatively feeble and capricious attempts at improvement and if it were not so the result of his work and of natures work would be even still more different nevertheless we must not overrate the amount of difference between natural species and domestic races the most experienced naturalists have often disputed whether the latter are descended from one or from several aboriginal stocks and this clearly shows that there is no palpable difference between species and races  domestic races propagate their kind far more truly and endure for munch longer periods than most naturalists are willing to admit breeders feel no doubt on this head ask a man who has long reared shorthorn or hereford cattle leicester or southdown sheep spanish or game poultry tumbler or carrierpigeons whether these races may not have been derived from common progenitors and he will probably laugh you to scorn the breeder admits that he may hope to produce sheep with finer or longer wool and with better carcases or handsomer fowls or carrierpigeons with beaks just perceptibly longer to the practised eye and thus be successful at an exhibition thus far he will go but no farther he does not reflect on what follows from adding up during a long course of time many slight successive modifications nor does he reflect on the former existence of numerous varieties connecting the links in each divergent line of descent he concludes as was shown in the earlier chapters that all the chief breeds to which he has long attended are aboriginal productions the systematic naturalist on the other hand who generally knows nothing of the art of breeding who does not pretend to know how and when the several domestic races were formed who cannot have seen the intermediate gradations for they do not now exist nevertheless feels no doubt that these races are sprung from a single source but ask him whether the closely allied natural species which he has studied may not have descended from a common progenitor and he in his turn will perhaps reject the notion with scorn thus the naturalist and breeder may mutually learn a useful lesson from each other  summary on selection by man  there can be no doubt that methodical selection has effected and will effect wonderful results it was occasionally practised in ancient times and is still practised by semicivilised people characters of the highest importance and others of trifling value have been attended to and modified i need not here repeat what has been so often said on the part which unconscious selection has played we see its power in the difference between flocks which have been separately bred and in the slow changes as circumstances have slowly changed which many animals have undergone in the same country or when transported into a foreign land we see the combined effects of methodical and unconscious selection in the great amount of difference in those parts or qualities which are valued by man in comparison with the parts which are not valued and consequently have not been attended to natural selection often determines mans power of selection we sometimes err in imagining that characters which are considered as unimportant by the systematic naturalist could not be affected by the struggle for existence and could not be acted on by natural selection but striking cases have been given showing how great an error this is  the possibility of selection coming into action rests on variability and this is mainly caused as we shall hereafter see by changes in the conditions of life selection is sometimes rendered difficult or even impossible by the conditions being opposed to the desired character or quality it is sometimes checked by the lessened fertility and weakened constitution which follow from longcontinued close interbreeding that methodical selection may be successful the closest attention and discernment combined with unwearied patience are absolutely necessary and these same qualities though not indispensable are highly serviceable in the case of unconscious selection it is almost necessary that a large number of individuals should be reared for thus there will be a fair chance of variations of the desired nature arising and of every individual with the slightest blemish or in any degree inferior being freely rejected hence length of time is an important element of success thus also reproduction at an early age and at short intervals favours the work facility in pairing animals or their inhabiting a confined area is advantageous as a check to free crossing whenever and wherever selection is not practised distinct races are not formed within the same country when any one part of the body or one quality is not attended to it remains either unchanged or varies in a fluctuating manner whilst at the same time other parts and other qualities may become permanently and greatly modified but from the tendency to reversion and to continued variability those parts or organs which are now undergoing rapid improvement through selection are likewise found to vary much consequently highlybred animals when neglected soon degenerate but we have no reason to believe that the effects of longcontinued selection would if the conditions of life remained the same be soon and completely lost  man always tends to go to an extreme point in the selection whether methodical or unconscious of all useful and pleasing qualities this is an important principle as it leads to continued divergence and in some rare cases to convergence of character the possibility of continued divergence rests on the tendency in each part or organ to go on varying in the same manner in which it has already varied and that this occurs is proved by the steady and gradual improvement of many animals and plants during lengthened periods the principle of divergence of character combined with the neglect and final extinction of all previous lessvalued and intermediate varieties explains the amount of difference and the distinctness of our several races although we may have reached the utmost limit to which certain characters can be modified yet we are far from having reached as we have good reason to believe the limit in the majority of cases finally from the difference between selection as carried on by man and by nature we can understand how it is that domestic races often though by no means always differ in general aspect from closely allied natural species  throughout this chapter and elsewhere i have spoken of selection as the paramount power yet its action absolutely depends on what we in our ignorance call spontaneous or accidental variability let an architect be compelled to build an edifice with uncut stones fallen from a precipice the shape of each fragment may be called accidental yet the shape of each has been determined by the force of gravity the nature of the rock and the slope of the precipiceevents and circumstances all of which depend on natural laws but there is no relation between these laws and the purpose for which each fragment is used by the builder in the same manner the variations of each creature are determined by fixed and immutable laws but these bear no relation to the living structure which is slowly built up through the power of selection whether this be natural or artificial selection  if our architect succeeded in rearing a noble edifice using the rough wedge shaped fragments for the arches the longer stones for the lintels and so forth we should admire his skill even in a higher degree than if he had used stones shaped for the purpose so it is with selection whether applied by man or by nature for although variability is indispensably necessary yet when we look at some highly complex and excellently adapted organism variability sinks to a quite subordinate position in importance in comparison with selection in the same manner as the shape of each fragment used by our supposed architect is unimportant in comparison with his skill   chapter 2xxii  causes of variability  variability does not necessarily accompany reproduction causes assigned by various authors individual differences variability of every kind due to changed conditions of life on the nature of such changes climate food excess of nutriment slight changes sufficient effects of grafting on the variability of seedlingtrees domestic productions become habituated to changed conditions on the accumulative action of changed conditions close interbreeding and the imagination of the mother supposed to cause variability crossing as a cause of the appearance of new characters variability from the commingling of characters and from reversion on the manner and period of action of the causes which either directly or indirectly through the reproductive system induce variability  we will now consider as far as we can the causes of the almost universal variability of our domesticated productions the subject is an obscure one but it may be useful to probe our ignorance some authors for instance dr prosper lucas look at variability as a necessary contingent on reproduction and as much an aboriginal law as growth or inheritance others have of late encouraged perhaps unintentionally this view by speaking of inheritance and variability as equal and antagonistic principles pallas maintained and he has had some followers that variability depends exclusively on the crossing of primordially distinct forms other authors attribute variability to an excess of food and with animals to an excess relatively to the amount of exercise taken or again to the effects of a more genial climate that these causes are all effective is highly probable but we must i think take a broader view and conclude that organic beings when subjected during several generations to any change whatever in their conditions tend to vary the kind of variation which ensues depending in most cases in a far higher degree on the nature or constitution of the being than on the nature of the changed conditions  those authors who believe that it is a law of nature that each individual should differ in some slight degree from every other may maintain apparently with truth that this is the fact not only with all domesticated animals and cultivated plants but likewise with all organic beings in a state of nature the laplander by long practice knows and gives a name to each reindeer though as linnaeus remarks to distinguish one from another among such multitudes was beyond my comprehension for they were like ants on an anthill in germany shepherds have won wagers by recognising each sheep in a flock of a hundred which they had never seen until the previous fortnight this power of discrimination however is as nothing compared to that which some florists have acquired verlot mentions a gardener who could distinguish 150 kinds of camellia when not in flower and it has been positively asserted that the famous old dutch florist voorhelm who kept above 1200 varieties of the hyacinth was hardly ever deceived in knowing each variety by the bulb alone hence we must conclude that the bulbs of the hyacinth and the branches and leaves of the camellia though appearing to an unpractised eye absolutely undistinguishable yet really differ 221 des jacinthes etc amsterdam 1768 page 43 verlot des varietes etc page 86 on the reindeer see linnaeus tour in lapland translated by sir je smith volume 1 page 314 the statement in regard to german shepherds is given on the authority of dr weinland  as linnaeus has compared the reindeer in number to ants i may add that each ant knows its fellow of the same community several times i carried ants of the same species formica rufa from one anthill to another inhabited apparently by tens of thousands of ants but the strangers were instantly detected and killed i then put some ants taken from a very large nest into a bottle strongly perfumed with assafoetida and after an interval of twenty four hours returned them to their home they were at first threatened by their fellows but were soon recognised and allowed to pass hence each ant certainly recognised independently of odour its fellow and if all the ants of the same community have not some countersign or watchword they must present to each others senses some distinguishable character  the dissimilarity of brothers or sisters of the same family and of seedlings from the same capsule may be in part accounted for by the unequal blending of the characters of the two parents and by the more or less complete recovery through reversion of ancestral characters on either side but we thus only push the difficulty further back in time for what made the parents or their progenitors different hence the belief 222 muller physiology english translation volume 2 page 1662 with respect to the similarity of twins in constitution dr william ogle has given me the following extract from professor trousseaus lectures clinique medicale tome 1 page 523 in which a curious case is recordedjai donne mes soins a deux freres jumeaux tous deux si extraordinairement ressemblants quil metait impossible de les reconnaitre a moin de les voir lun a cote de lautre cette ressemblance physique setendait plus loin ils avaient permettezmoi lexpression une similitude pathologique plus remarquable encore ainsi lun deux que je voyais aux neothermes a paris malade dune ophthalmie rhumatismale me disait en ce moment mon frere doit avoir une ophthalmie comme la mienne et comme je metais recrie il me montrait quelques jours apres une lettre quil venait de recevoir de ce frere alors a vienne et qui lui ecrivait en effetjai mon ophthalmie tu dois avoir la tienne quelque singulier que ceci puisse paraitre le fait nen est pas moins exact on ne me la pas raconte je lai vu et jen ai vu dautres analogues dans ma pratique ces deux jumeaux etaient aussi tous deux asthmatiques et asthmatiques a un effroyable degre originaires de marseille ils nont jamais pu demeurer dans cette ville ou leurs interets les appelaient souvent sans etre pris de leurs acces jamais ils nen eprouvaient a paris bien mieux il leur suffisait de gagner toulon pour etre gueris de leurs attaques de marseille voyageant sans cesse et dans tous pays pour leurs affaires ils avaient remarque que certaines localites leur etaient funestes que dans dautres ils etaient exempts de tout phenomene doppression that an innate tendency to vary exists independently of external differences seems at first sight probable but even the seeds nurtured in the same capsule are not subjected to absolutely uniform conditions as they draw their nourishment from different points and we shall see in a future chapter that this difference sometimes suffices to affect the character of the future plant the greater dissimilarity of the successive children of the same family in comparison with twins which often resemble each other in external appearance mental disposition and constitution in so extraordinary a manner apparently proves that the state of the parents at the exact period of conception or the nature of the subsequent embryonic development has a direct and powerful influence on the character of the offspring nevertheless when we reflect on the individual differences between organic beings in a state of nature as shown by every wild animal knowing its mate and when we reflect on the infinite diversity of the many varieties of our domesticated productions we may well be inclined to exclaim though falsely as i believe that variability must be looked at as an ultimate fact necessarily contingent on reproduction  those authors who adopt this latter view would probably deny that each separate variation has its own proper exciting cause although we can seldom trace the precise relation between cause and effect yet the considerations presently to be given lead to the conclusion that each modification must have its own distinct cause and is not the result of what we blindly call accident the following striking case has been communicated to me by dr william ogle two girls born as twins and in all respects extremely alike had their little fingers on both hands crooked and in both children the second bicuspid tooth of the second dentition on the right side in the upper jaw was misplaced for instead of standing in a line with the others it grew from the roof of the mouth behind the first bicuspid neither the parents nor any other members of the family were known to have exhibited any similar peculiarity but a son of one of these girls had the same tooth similarly misplaced now as both the girls were affected in exactly the same manner the idea of accident is at once excluded and we are compelled to admit that there must have existed some precise and sufficient cause which if it had occurred a hundred times would have given crooked fingers and misplaced bicuspid teeth to a hundred children it is of course possible that this case may have been due to reversion to some longforgotten progenitor and this would much weaken the value of the argument i have been led to think of the probability of reversion from having been told by mr galton of another case of twin girls born with their little fingers slightly crooked which they inherited from their maternal grandmother  we will now consider the general arguments which appear to me to have great weight in favour of the view that variations of all kinds and degrees are directly or indirectly caused by the conditions of life to which each being and more especially its ancestors have been exposed  no one doubts that domesticated productions are more variable than organic beings which have never been removed from their natural conditions monstrosities graduate so insensibly into mere variations that it is impossible to separate them and all those who have studied monstrosities believe that they are far commoner with domesticated than with wild animals and plants 223 isid geoffroy sthilaire hist des anomalies tome 3 page 352 moquintandon teratologie vegetale 1841 page 115 and in the case of plants monstrosities would be equally noticeable in the natural as in the cultivated state under nature the individuals of the same species are exposed to nearly uniform conditions for they are rigorously kept to their proper places by a host of competing animals and plants they have also long been habituated to their conditions of life but it cannot be said that they are subject to quite uniform conditions and they are liable to a certain amount of variation the circumstances under which our domestic productions are reared are widely different they are protected from competition they have not only been removed from their natural conditions and often from their native land but they are frequently carried from district to district where they are treated differently so that they rarely remain during any considerable length of time exposed to closely similar conditions in conformity with this all our domesticated productions with the rarest exceptions vary far more than natural species the hivebee which feeds itself and follows in most respects its natural habits of life is the least variable of all domesticated animals and probably the goose is the next least variable but even the goose varies more than almost any wild bird so that it cannot be affiliated with perfect certainty to any natural species hardly a single plant can be named which has long been cultivated and propagated by seed that is not highly variable common rye secale cereale has afforded fewer and less marked varieties than almost any other cultivated plant 224 metzger die getreidarten 1841 s 39 but it may be doubted whether the variations of this the least valuable of all our cereals have been closely observed  budvariation which was fully discussed in a former chapter shows us that variability may be quite independent of seminal reproduction and likewise of reversion to longlost ancestral characters no one will maintain that the sudden appearance of a mossrose on a provencerose is a return to a former state for mossiness of the calyx has been observed in no natural species the same argument is applicable to variegated and laciniated leaves nor can the appearance of nectarines on peachtrees be accounted for on the principle of reversion but budvariations more immediately concern us as they occur far more frequently on plants which have been highly cultivated during a length of time than on other and less highly cultivated plants and very few well marked instances have been observed with plants growing under strictly natural conditions i have given one instance of an ashtree growing in a gentlemans pleasuregrounds and occasionally there may be seen on beech and other trees twigs leafing at a different period from the other branches but our forest trees in england can hardly be considered as living under strictly natural conditions the seedlings are raised and protected in nurserygrounds and must often be transplanted into places where wild trees of the kind would not naturally grow it would be esteemed a prodigy if a dogrose growing in a hedge produced by budvariation a mossrose or a wild bullace or wild cherry tree yielded a branch bearing fruit of a different shape and colour from the ordinary fruit the prodigy would be enhanced if these varying branches were found capable of propagation not only by grafts but sometimes by seed yet analogous cases have occurred with many of our highly cultivated trees and herbs  these several considerations alone render it probable that variability of every kind is directly or indirectly caused by changed conditions of life or to put the case under another point of view if it were possible to expose all the individuals of a species during many generations to absolutely uniform conditions of life there would be no variability  on the nature of the changes in the conditions of life which induce variability  from a remote period to the present day under climates and circumstances as different as it is possible to conceive organic beings of all kinds when domesticated or cultivated have varied we see this with the many domestic races of quadrupeds and birds belonging to different orders with goldfish and silkworms with plants of many kinds raised in various quarters of the world in the deserts of northern africa the datepalm has yielded thirtyeight varieties in the fertile plains of india it is notorious how many varieties of rice and of a host of other plants exist in a single polynesian island twentyfour varieties of the breadfruit the same number of the banana and twentytwo varieties of the arum are cultivated by the natives the mulberry tree in india and europe has yielded many varieties serving as food for the silkworm and in china sixtythree varieties of the bamboo are used for various domestic purposes 225 on the datepalm see vogel annals and mag of nat hist 1854 page 460 on indian varieties dr f hamilton

innumerable others which could be added indicate that a change of almost any kind in the conditions of life suffices to cause variabilitydifferent changes acting on different organisms  andrew knight 226 treatise on the culture of the apple etc page 3 attributed the variation of both animals and plants to a more abundant supply of nourishment or to a more favourable climate than that natural to the species a more genial climate however is far from necessary the kidney bean which is often injured by our spring frosts and peaches which require the protection of a wall have varied much in england as has the orangetree in northern italy where it is barely able to exist 227 gallesio teoria della riproduzione veg page 125 nor can we overlook the fact though not immediately connected with our present subject that the plants and shells of the arctic regions are eminently variable 228 see dr hookers memoir on arctic plants in linn transact volume 23 part 2 mr woodward and a higher authority cannot be quoted speaks of the arctic mollusca in his rudimentary treatise 1856 page 355 as remarkably subject to variation moreover it does not appear that a change of climate whether more or less genial is one of the most potent causes of variability for in regard to plants alph de candolle in his geographie botanique repeatedly shows that the native country of a plant where in most cases it has been longest cultivated is that where it has yielded the greatest number of varieties  it is doubtful whether a change in the nature of the food is a potent cause of variability scarcely any domesticated animal has varied more than the pigeon or the fowl but their food especially that of highlybred pigeons is generally the same nor can our cattle and sheep have been subjected to any great change in this respect but in all these cases the food probably is much less varied in kind than that which was consumed by the species in its natural state 229 bechstein in his naturgeschichte der stubenvogel 1840 s 238 has some good remarks on this subject he states that his canarybirds varied in colour though kept on uniform food  of all the causes which induce variability excess of food whether or not changed in nature is probably the most powerful this view was held with regard to plants by andrew knight and is now held by schleiden more especially in reference to the inorganic elements of the food 2210 the plant by schleiden translated by henfrey 1848 page 169 see also alex braun in bot memoirs ray soc 1853 page 313 in order to give a plant more food it suffices in most cases to grow it separately and thus prevent other plants robbing its roots it is surprising as i have often seen how vigorously our common wild species flourish when planted by themselves though not in highly manured land separate growth is in fact the first step in cultivation we see the converse of the belief that excess of food induces variability in the following statement by a great raiser of seeds of all kinds 2211 messrs hardy and son of maldon in gardeners chronicle 1856 page 458 carriere production et fixation des varietes 1865 page 31 it is a rule invariably with us when we desire to keep a true stock of any one kind of seed to grow it on poor land without dung but when we grow for quantity we act contrary and sometimes have dearly to repent of it according also to carriere who has had great experience with flowergarden seeds on remarque en general les plantes de vigeur moyenne sont celles qui conservent le mieux leurs caracteres  in the case of animals the want of a proper amount of exercise as bechstein remarked has perhaps played independently of the direct effects of the disuse of any particular organ an important part in causing variability we can see in a vague manner that when the organised and nutrient fluids of the body are not used during growth or by the wear and tear of the tissues they will be in excess and as growth nutrition and reproduction are intimately allied processes this superfluity might disturb the due and proper action of the reproductive organs and consequently affect the character of the future offspring but it may be argued that neither an excess of food nor a superfluity in the organised fluids of the body necessarily induces variability the goose and the turkey have been well fed for many generations yet have varied very little our fruittrees and culinary plants which are so variable have been cultivated from an ancient period and though they probably still receive more nutriment than in their natural state yet they must have received during many generations nearly the same amount and it might be thought that they would have become habituated to the excess nevertheless on the whole knights view that excess of food is one of the most potent causes of variability appears as far as i can judge probable  whether or not our various cultivated plants have received nutriment in excess all have been exposed to changes of various kinds fruittrees are grafted on different stocks and grown in various soils the seeds of culinary and agricultural plants are carried from place to place and during the last century the rotation of our crops and the manures used have been greatly changed  slight changes of treatment often suffice to induce variability the simple fact of almost all our cultivated plants and domesticated animals having varied in all places and at all times leads to this conclusion seeds taken from common english foresttrees grown under their native climate not highly manured or otherwise artificially treated yield seedlings which vary much as may be seen in every extensive seedbed i have shown in a former chapter what a number of wellmarked and singular varieties the thorn crataegus oxycantha has produced yet this tree has been subjected to hardly any cultivation in staffordshire i carefully examined a large number of two british plants namely geranium phaeum and pyrenaicum which have never been highly cultivated these plants had spread spontaneously by seed from a common garden into an open plantation and the seedlings varied in almost every single character both in their flower and foliage to a degree which i have never seen exceeded yet they could not have been exposed to any great change in their conditions  with respect to animals azara has remarked with much surprise 2212 quadrupedes du paraguay 1801 tome 2 page 319 that whilst the feral horses on the pampas are always of one of three colours and the cattle always of a uniform colour yet these animals when bred on the unenclosed estancias though kept in a state which can hardly be called domesticated and apparently exposed to almost identically the same conditions as when they are feral nevertheless display a great diversity of colour so again in india several species of freshwater fish are only so far treated artificially that they are reared in great tanks but this small change is sufficient to induce much variability 2213 mclelland on indian cyprinidae asiatic researches volume 19 part 2 1839 pages 266 268 313  some facts on the effects of grafting in regard to the variability of trees deserve attention cabanis asserts that when certain pears are grafted on the quince their seeds yield a greater number of varieties than do the seeds of the same variety of pear when grafted on the wild pear 2214 quoted by sageret pom phys 1830 page 43 this statement however is not believed by decaisne but as the pear and quince are distinct species though so closely related that the one can be readily grafted and succeeds admirably on the other the fact of variability being thus caused is not surprising as we are here enabled to see the cause namely the very different nature of the stock and graft several north american varieties of the plum and peach are well known to reproduce themselves truly by seed but downing asserts 2215 the fruits of america 1845 page 5 that when a graft is taken from one of these trees and placed upon another stock this grafted tree is found to lose its singular property of producing the same variety by seed and becomes like all other worked treesthat is its seedlings become highly variable another case is worth giving the lalande variety of the walnuttree leafs between april 20th and may 15th and its seedlings invariably inherit the same habit whilst several other varieties of the walnut leaf in june now if seedlings are raised from the mayleafing lalande variety grafted on another mayleafing variety though both stock and graft have the same early habit of leafing yet the seedlings leaf at various times even as late as the 5th of june 2216 m cardan in comptes rendus december 1848 quoted in gardeners chronicle 1849 page 101 such facts as these are well fitted to show on what obscure and slight causes variability depends  i may here just allude to the appearance of new and valuable varieties of fruittrees and of wheat in woods and waste places which at first sight seems a most anomalous circumstance in france a considerable number of the best pears have been discovered in woods and this has occurred so frequently that poiteau asserts that improved varieties of our cultivated fruits rarely originate with nurserymen 2217 m alexis jordan mentions four excellent pears found in woods in france and alludes to others mem acad de lyon tome 2 1852 page 159 poiteaus remark is quoted in gardeners mag volume 4 1828 page 385 see gardeners chronicle 1862 page 335 for another case of a new variety of the pear found in a hedge in france also for another case see loudons encyclop of gardening page 901 mr rivers has given me similar information in england on the other hand no instance of a good pear having been found wild has been recorded and mr rivers informs me that he knows of only one instance with apples namely the bess poole which was discovered in a wood in nottinghamshire this difference between the two countries may be in part accounted for by the more favourable climate of france but chiefly from the great number of seedlings which spring up there in the woods i infer that this is the case from a remark made by a french gardener 2218 duval hist du poirier 1849 page 2 who regards it as a national calamity that such a number of peartrees are periodically cut down for firewood before they have borne fruit the new varieties which thus spring up in the woods though they cannot have received any excess of nutriment will have been exposed to abruptly changed conditions but whether this is the cause of their production is very doubtful these varieties however are probably all descended 2219 i infer that this is the fact from van mons statement arbres fruitiers 1835 tome 1 page 446 that he finds in the woods seedlings resembling all the chief cultivated races of both the pear and apple van mons however looked at these wild varieties as aboriginal species from old cultivated kinds growing in adjoining orchards a circumstance which will account for their variability and out of a vast number of varying trees there will always be a good chance of the appearance of a valuable kind in north america where fruittrees frequently spring up in waste places the washington pear was found in a hedge and the emperor peach in a wood 2220 downing fruittrees of north america page 422 foley in transact hort soc volume 6 page 412  with respect to wheat some writers have spoken 2221 gardeners chronicle 1847 page 244 as if it were an ordinary event for new varieties to be found in waste places the fenton wheat was certainly discovered growing on a pile of basaltic detritus in a quarry but in such a situation the plant would probably receive a sufficient amount of nutriment the chidham wheat was raised from an ear found on a hedge and hunters wheat was discovered by the roadside in scotland but it is not said that this latter variety grew where it was found 2222 gardeners chronicle 1841 page 383 1850 page 700 1854 page 650  whether our domestic productions would ever become so completely habituated to the conditions under which they now live as to cease varying we have no sufficient means for judging but in fact our domestic productions are never exposed for a great length of time to uniform conditions and it is certain that our most anciently cultivated plants as well as animals still go on varying for all have recently undergone marked improvement in some few cases however plants have become habituated to new conditions thus metzger who cultivated in germany during many years numerous varieties of wheat brought from different countries 2223 die getreidearten 1843 s 66 116 117 states that some kinds were at first extremely variable but gradually in one   instance after an interval of twentyfive years became constant and it does not appear that this resulted from the selection of the more constant forms  on the accumulative action of changed conditions of life  we have good grounds for believing that the influence of changed conditions accumulates so that no effect is produced on a species until it has been exposed during several generations to continued cultivation or domestication universal experience shows us that when new flowers are first introduced into our gardens they do not vary but ultimately all with the rarest exceptions vary to a greater or less extent in a few cases the requisite number of generations as well as the successive steps in the progress of variation have been recorded as in the often quoted instance of the dahlia 2224 sabine in hort transact volume 3 page 225 bronn geschichte der natur b 2 s 119 after several years culture the zinnia has only lately 1860 begun to vary in any great degree in the first seven or eight years of high cultivation the swan river daisy brachycome iberidifolia kept to its original colour it then varied into lilac and purple and other minor shades 2225 journal of horticulture 1861 page 112 on zinnia gardeners chronicle 1860 page 852 analogous facts have been recorded with the scotch rose in discussing the variability of plants several experienced horticulturists have spoken to the same general effect mr salter 2226 the chrysanthemum its history etc 1865 page 3 remarks every one knows that the chief difficulty is in breaking through the original form and colour of the species and every one will be on the lookout for any natural sport either from seed or branch that being once obtained however trifling the change may be the result depends upon himself m de jonghe who has had so much success in raising new varieties of pears and strawberries 2227 gardeners chronicle 1855 page 54 journal of horticulture may 9 1865 page 363 remarks with respect to the former there is another principle namely that the more a type has entered into a state of variation the greater is its tendency to continue doing so and the more it has varied from the original type the more it is disposed to vary still farther we have indeed already discussed this latter point when treating of the power which man possesses through selection of continually augmenting in the same direction each modification for this power depends on continued variability of the same general kind the most celebrated horticulturist in france namely vilmorin 2228 quoted by verlot des varietes etc 1865 page 28 even maintains that when any particular variation is desired the first step is to get the plant to vary in any manner whatever and to go on selecting the most variable individuals even though they vary in the wrong direction for the fixed character of the species being once broken the desired variation will sooner or later appear  as nearly all our animals were domesticated at an extremely remote epoch we cannot of course say whether they varied quickly or slowly when first subjected to new conditions but dr bachman 2229 examination of the characteristics of genera and species charleston 1855 page 14 states that he has seen turkeys raised from the eggs of the wild species lose their metallic tints and become spotted with white in the third generation mr yarrell many years ago informed me that the wild ducks bred on the ponds in st jamess park which had never been crossed as it is believed with domestic ducks lost their true plumage after a few generations an excellent observer 2230 mr hewitt journal of hort 1863 page 39 who has often reared ducks from the eggs of the wild bird and who took precautions that there should be no crossing with domestic breeds has given as previously stated full details on the changes which they gradually undergo he found that he could not breed these wild ducks true for more than five or six generations as they then proved so much less beautiful the white collar round the neck of the mallard became much broader and more irregular and white feathers appeared in the ducklings wings they increased also in size of body their legs became less fine and they lost their elegant carriage fresh eggs were then procured from wild birds but again the same result followed in these cases of the duck and turkey we see that animals like plants do not depart from their primitive type until they have been subjected during several generations to domestication on the other hand mr yarrell informed me that the australian dingos bred in the zoological gardens almost invariably produced in the first generation puppies marked with white and other colours but these introduced dingos had probably been procured from the natives who keep them in a semidomesticated state it is certainly a remarkable fact that changed conditions should at first produce as far as we can see absolutely no effect but that they should subsequently cause the character of the species to change in the chapter on pangenesis i shall attempt to throw a little light on this fact  returning now to the causes which are supposed to induce variability some authors 2231 devay mariages consanguins pages 97 125 in conversation i have found two or three naturalists of the same opinion believe that close interbreeding gives this tendency and leads to the production of monstrosities in the seventeenth chapter some few facts were advanced showing that monstrosities are as it appears occasionally thus induced and there can be no doubt that close interbreeding causes lessened fertility and a weakened constitution hence it may lead to variability but i have not sufficient evidence on this head on the other hand close interbreeding if not carried to an injurious extreme far from causing variability tends to fix the character of each breed  it was formerly a common belief still held by some persons that the imagination of the mother affects the child in the womb 2232 muller has conclusively argued against this belief elements of phys english translation volume 2 1842 page 1405 this view is evidently not applicable to the lower animals which lay unimpregnated eggs or to plants dr william hunter in the last century told my father that during many years every woman in a large london lyingin hospital was asked before her confinement whether anything had specially affected her mind and the answer was written down and it so happened that in no one instance could a coincidence be detected between the womans answer and any abnormal structure but when she knew the nature of the structure she frequently suggested some fresh cause the belief in the power of the mothers imagination may perhaps have arisen from the children of a second marriage resembling the previous father as certainly sometimes occurs in accordance with the facts given in the eleventh chapter  crossing as a cause of variability  in an early part of this chapter it was stated that pallas 2233 act acad st petersburg 1780 part 2 page 84 etc and a few other naturalists maintain that variability is wholly due to crossing if this means that new characters never spontaneously appear in our domestic races but that they are all directly derived from certain aboriginal species the doctrine is little less than absurd for it implies that animals like italian greyhounds pugdogs bulldogs pouter and fantail pigeons etc were able to exist in a state of nature but the doctrine may mean something widely different namely that the crossing of distinct species is the sole cause of the first appearance of new characters and that without this aid man could not have formed his various breeds as however new characters have appeared in certain cases by bud variation we may conclude with certainty that crossing is not necessary for variability it is moreover certain that the breeds of various animals such as of the rabbit pigeon duck etc and the varieties of several plants are the modified descendants of a single wild species nevertheless it is probable that the crossing of two forms when one or both have long been domesticated or cultivated adds to the variability of the offspring independently of the commingling of the characters derived from the two parentforms and this implies that new characters actually arise but we must not forget the facts advanced in the thirteenth chapter which clearly prove that the act of crossing often leads to the reappearance or reversion of long lost characters and in most cases it would be impossible to distinguish between the reappearance of ancient characters and the first appearance of absolutely new characters practically whether new or old they would be new to the breed in which they reappeared  gartner declares 2234 bastarderzeugung s 249 255 295 and his experience is of the highest value on such a point that when he crossed native plants which had not been cultivated he never once saw in the offspring any new character but that from the odd manner in which the characters derived from the parents were combined they sometimes appeared as if new when on the other hand he crossed cultivated plants he admits that new characters occasionally appeared but he is strongly inclined to attribute their appearance to ordinary variability not in any way to the cross an opposite conclusion however appears to me the more probable according to kolreuter hybrids in the genus mirabilis vary almost infinitely and he describes new and singular characters in the form of the seeds in the colour of the anthers in the cotyledons being of immense size in new and highly peculiar odours in the flowers expanding early in the season and in their closing at night with respect to one lot of these hybrids he remarks that they presented characters exactly the reverse of what might have been expected from their parentage 2235 nova acta st petersburg 1794 page 378 1795 pages 307 313 316 1787 page 407  prof lecoq 2236 de la fecondation 1862 page 311 speaks strongly to the same effect in regard to this same genus and asserts that many of the hybrids from mirabilis jalapa and multiflora might easily be mistaken for distinct species and adds that they differed in a greater degree than the other species of the genus from m jalapa herbert also has described 2237 amaryllidaceae 1837 page 362 certain hybrid rhododendrons as being as unlike all others in foliage as if they had been a separate species the common experience of floriculturists proves that the crossing and recrossing of distinct but allied plants such as the species of petunia calceolaria fuchsia verbena etc induces excessive variability hence the appearance of quite new characters is probable m carriere 2238 abstracted in gardeners chronicle 1860 page 1081 has lately discussed this subject he states that erythrina cristagalli had been multiplied by seed for many years but had not yielded any varieties it was then crossed with the allied e herbacea and the resistance was now overcome and varieties were produced with flowers of extremely different size form and colour  from the general and apparently wellfounded belief that the crossing of distinct species besides commingling their characters adds greatly to their variability it has probably arisen that some botanists have gone so far as to maintain 2239 this was the opinion of the elder de candolle as quoted in dic class dhist nat tome 8 page 405 puvis in his work de la degeneration 1837 page 37 has discussed this same point that when a genus includes only a single species this when cultivated never varies the proposition made so broadly cannot be admitted but it is probably true that the variability of monotypic genera when cultivated is generally less than that of genera including numerous species and this quite independently of the effects of crossing i have shown in my origin of species that the species belonging to small genera generally yield a less number of varieties in a state of nature than those belonging to large genera hence the species of small genera would it is probable produce fewer varieties under cultivation than the already variable species of larger genera  although we have not at present sufficient evidence that the crossing of species which have never been cultivated leads to the appearance of new characters this apparently does occur with species which have been already rendered in some degree variable through cultivation hence crossing like any other change in the conditions of life seems to be an element probably a potent one in causing variability but we seldom have the means of distinguishing as previously remarked between the appearance of really new characters and the reappearance of longlost characters evoked through the act of crossing i will give an instance of the difficulty in distinguishing such cases the species of datura may be divided into two sections those having white flowers with green stems and those having purple flowers with brown stems now naudin 2240 comptes rendus novembre 21 1864 page 838 crossed datura laevis and ferox both of which belong to the white section and raised from them 205 hybrids of these hybrids every one had brown stems and bore purple flowers so that they resembled the species of the other section of the genus and not their own two parents naudin was so much astonished at this fact that he was led carefully to observe both parent species and he discovered that the pure seedlings of d ferox immediately after germination had dark purple stems extending from the young roots up to the cotyledons and that this tint remained ever afterwards as a ring round the base of the stem of the plant when old now i have shown in the thirteenth chapter that the retention or exaggeration of an early character is so intimately related to reversion that it evidently comes under the same principle hence probably we ought to look at the purple flowers and brown stems of these hybrids not as new characters due to variability but as a return to the former state of some ancient progenitor  independently of the appearance of new characters from crossing a few words may be added to what has been said in former chapters on the unequal combination and transmission of the characters proper to the two parentforms when two species or races are crossed the offspring of the first generation are generally uniform but those subsequently produced display an almost infinite diversity of character he who wishes says kolreuter 2241 nova acta st petersburg 1794 page 391 to obtain an endless number of varieties from hybrids should cross and recross them there is also much variability when hybrids or mongrels are reduced or absorbed by repeated crosses with either pure parentform and a still higher degree of variability when three distinct species and most of all when four species are blended together by successive crosses beyond this point gartner 2242 bastarderzeugung s 507 516 572 on whose authority the foregoing statements are made never succeeded in effecting a union but max wichura 2243 die bastardbefruchtung etc 1865 s 24 united six distinct species of willows into a single hybrid the sex of the parent species affects in an inexplicable manner the degree of variability of hybrids for gartner 2244 bastarderzeugung s 452 507 repeatedly found that when a hybrid was used as a father and either one of the pure parentspecies or a third species was used as the mother the offspring were more variable than when the same hybrid was used as the mother and either pure parent or the same third species as the father thus seedlings from dianthus barbatus crossed by the hybrid d chinensibarbatus were more variable than those raised from this latter hybrid fertilised by the pure d barbatus max wichura 2245 die bastardbefruchtung s 56 insists strongly on an analogous result with his hybrid willows again gartner 2246 bastarderzeugung s 423 asserts that the degree of variability sometimes differs in hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses between the same two species and here the sole difference is that the one species is first used as the father and then as the mother on the whole we see that independently of the appearance of new characters the variability of successive crossed generations is extremely complex partly from the offspring partaking unequally of the characters of the two parent forms and more especially from their unequal tendency to revert to such characters or to those of more ancient progenitors  on the manner and on the period of action of the causes which induce variability  this is an extremely obscure subject and we need here only consider whether inherited variations are due to certain parts being acted on after they have been formed or through the reproductive system being affected before their formation and in the former case at what period of growth or development the effect is produced we shall see in the two following chapters that various agencies such as an abundant supply of food exposure to a different climate increased use or disuse of parts etc prolonged during several generations certainly modify either the whole organisation or certain organs and it is clear at least in the case of budvariation that the action cannot have been through the reproductive system  with respect to the part which the reproductive system takes in causing variability we have seen in the eighteenth chapter that even slight changes in the conditions of life have a remarkable power in causing a greater or less degree of sterility hence it seems not improbable that beings generated through a system so easily affected should themselves be affected or should fail to inherit or inherit in excess characters proper to their parents we know that certain groups of organic beings but with exceptions in each group have their reproductive systems much more easily affected by changed conditions than other groups for instance carnivorous birds more readily than carnivorous mammals and parrots more readily than pigeons and this fact harmonises with the apparently capricious manner and degree in which various groups of animals and plants vary under domestication  kolreuter 2247 dritte fortsetzung etc 1766 s 85 was struck with the parallelism between the excessive variability of hybrids when crossed and recrossed in various waysthese hybrids having their reproductive powers more or less affectedand the variability of anciently cultivated plants max wichura 2248 die bastardbefruchtung etc 1865 s 92 see also the rev mj berkeley on the same subject in journal of royal hort soc 1866 page 80 has gone one step farther and shows that with many of our highly cultivated plants such as the hyacinth tulip auricula snapdragon potato cabbage etc which there is no reason to believe have been hybridised the anthers contain many irregular pollengrains in the same state as in hybrids he finds also in certain wild forms the same coincidence between the state of the pollen and a high degree of variability as in many species of rubus but in r caesius and idaeus which are not highly variable species the pollen is sound it is also notorious that many cultivated plants such as the banana pineapple breadfruit and others previously mentioned have their reproductive organs so seriously affected as to be generally quite sterile and when they do yield seed the seedlings judging from the large number of cultivated races which exist must be variable in an extreme degree these facts indicate that there is some relation between the state of the reproductive organs and a tendency to variability but we must not conclude that the relation is strict although many of our highly cultivated plants may have their pollen in a deteriorated condition yet as we have previously seen they yield more seeds and our anciently domesticated animals are more prolific than the corresponding species in a state of nature the peacock is almost the only bird which is believed to be less fertile under domestication than in its native state and it has varied in a remarkably small degree from these considerations it would seem that changes in the conditions of life lead either to sterility or to variability or to both and not that sterility induces variability on the whole it is probable that any cause affecting the organs of reproduction would likewise affect their productthat is the offspring thus generated  the period of life at which the causes that induce variability act is likewise an obscure subject which has been discussed by various authors 2249 dr p lucas has given a history of opinion on this subject hered nat 1847 tome 1 page 175 in some of the cases to be given in the following chapter of modifications from the direct action of changed conditions which are inherited there can be no doubt that the causes have acted on the mature or nearly mature animal on the other hand monstrosities which cannot be distinctly separated from lesser variations are often caused by the embryo being injured whilst in the mothers womb or in the egg thus i geoffroy sainthilaire 2250 hist des anomalies tome 3 page 499 asserts that poor women who work hard during their pregnancy and the mothers of illegitimate children troubled in their minds and forced to conceal their state are far more liable to give birth to monsters than women in easy circumstances the eggs of the fowl when placed upright or otherwise treated unnaturally frequently produce monstrous chickens it would however appear that complex monstrosities are induced more frequently during a rather late than during a very early period of embryonic life but this may partly result from some one part which has been injured during an early period affecting by its abnormal growth other parts subsequently developed and this would be less likely to occur with parts injured at a later period 2251 ibid tome 3 pages 392 502 the several memoirs by m dareste hereafter referred to are of special value on this whole subject when any part or organ becomes monstrous through abortion a rudiment is generally left and this likewise indicates that its development had already commenced  insects sometimes have their antennae or legs in a monstrous condition the larvae of which do not possess either antennae or legs and in these cases as quatrefages 2252 see his interesting work metamorphoses de lhomme etc 1862 page 129 believes we are enabled to see the precise period at which the normal progress of development was troubled but the nature of the food given to a caterpillar sometimes affects the colours of the moth without the caterpillar itself being affected therefore it seems possible that other characters in the mature insect might be indirectly modified through the larvae there is no reason to suppose that organs which have been rendered monstrous have always been acted on during their development the cause may have acted on the organisation at a much earlier stage it is even probable that either the male or female sexual elements or both before their union may be affected in such a manner as to lead to modifications in organs developed at a late period of life in nearly the same manner as a child may inherit from his father a disease which does not appear until old age  in accordance with the facts above given which prove that in many cases a close relation exists between variability and the sterility following from changed conditions we may conclude that the exciting cause often acts at the earliest possible period namely on the sexual elements before impregnation has taken place that an affection of the female sexual element may induce variability we may likewise infer as probable from the occurrence of bud variations for a bud seems to be the analogue of an ovule but the male element is apparently much oftener affected by changed conditions at least in a visible manner than the female element or ovule and we know from gartners and wichuras statements that a hybrid used as the father and crossed with a pure species gives a greater degree of variability to the offspring than does the same hybrid when used as the mother lastly it is certain that variability may be transmitted through either sexual element whether or not originally excited in them for kolreuter and gartner 2253 dritte fortsetzung etc s 123 bastarderzeugung s 249 found that when two species were crossed if either one was variable the offspring were rendered variable  summary  from the facts given in this chapter we may conclude that the variability of organic beings under domestication although so general is not an inevitable contingent on life but results from the conditions to which the parents have been exposed changes of any kind in the conditions of life even extremely slight changes often suffice to cause variability excess of nutriment is perhaps the most efficient single exciting cause animals and plants continue to be variable for an immense period after their first domestication but the conditions to which they are exposed never long remain quite constant in the course of time they can be habituated to certain changes so as to become less variable and it is possible that when first domesticated they may have been even more variable than at present there is good evidence that the power of changed conditions accumulates so that two three or more generations must be exposed to new conditions before any effect is visible the crossing of distinct forms which have already become variable increases in the offspring the tendency to further variability by the unequal commingling of the characters of the two parents by the reappearance of longlost characters and by the appearance of absolutely new characters some variations are induced by the direct action of the surrounding conditions on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone other variations appear to be induced indirectly through the reproductive system being affected as we know is often the case with various beings which when removed from their natural conditions become sterile the causes which induce variability act on the mature organism on the embryo and probably on the sexual elements

change in the conditions budvariation monstrosities produced by unnatural treatment summary  if we ask ourselves why this or that character has been modified under domestication we are in most cases lost in utter darkness many naturalists especially of the french school attribute every modification to the monde ambiant that is to changed climate with all its diversities of heat and cold dampness and dryness light and electricity to the nature of the soil and to varied kinds and amount of food by the term definite action as used in this chapter i mean an action of such a nature that when many individuals of the same variety are exposed during several generations to any particular change in their conditions of life all or nearly all the individuals are modified in the same manner the effects of habit or of the increased use and disuse of various organs might have been included under this head but it will be convenient to discuss this subject in a separate chapter by the term indefinite action i mean an action which causes one individual to vary in one way and another individual in another way as we often see with plants and animals after they have been subjected for some generations to changed conditions of life but we know far too little of the causes and laws of variation to make a sound classification the action of changed conditions whether leading to definite or indefinite results is a totally distinct consideration from the effects of selection for selection depends on the preservation by man of certain individuals or on their survival under various and complex natural circumstances and has no relation whatever to the primary cause of each particular variation  i will first give in detail all the facts which i have been able to collect rendering it probable that climate food etc have acted so definitely and powerfully on the organisation of our domesticated productions that new sub varieties or races have been thus formed without the aid of selection by man or nature i will then give the facts and considerations opposed to this conclusion and finally we will weigh as fairly as we can the evidence on both sides  when we reflect that distinct races of almost all our domesticated animals exist in each kingdom of europe and formerly even in each district of england we are at first strongly inclined to attribute their origin to the definite action of the physical conditions of each country and this has been the conclusion of many authors but we should bear in mind that man annually has to choose which animals shall be preserved for breeding and which shall be slaughtered we have also seen that both methodical and unconscious selection were formerly practised and are now occasionally practised by the most barbarous races to a much greater extent than might have been anticipated hence it is difficult to judge how far differences in the conditions between for instance the several districts in england have sufficed to modify the breeds which have been reared in each it may be argued that as numerous wild animals and plants have ranged during many ages throughout great britain and still retain the same character the difference in conditions between the several districts could not have modified in a marked manner the various native races of cattle sheep pigs and horses the same difficulty of distinguishing between the effects of natural selection and the definite action of external conditions is encountered in a still higher degree when we compare closely allied species inhabiting two countries such as north america and europe which do not differ greatly in climate nature of soil etc for in this case natural selection will inevitably and rigorously have acted during a long succession of ages  prof weismann has suggested 231 ueber den einfluss der isolirung auf die artbildung 1872 that when a variable species enters a new and isolated country although the variations may be of the same general nature as before yet it is improbable that they should occur in the same proportional numbers after a longer or shorter period the species will tend to become nearly uniform in character from the incessant crossing of the varying individuals but owing to the proportion of the individuals varying in different ways not being the same in the two cases the final result will be the production of two forms somewhat different from one another in cases of this kind it would falsely appear as if the conditions had induced certain definite modifications whereas they had only excited indefinite variability but with the variations in slightly different proportional numbers this view may throw some light on the fact that the domestic animals which formerly inhabited the several districts in great britain and the half wild cattle lately kept in several british parks differed slightly from one another for these animals were prevented from wandering over the whole country and intercrossing but would have crossed freely within each district or park  from the difficulty of judging how far changed conditions have caused definite modifications of structure it will be advisable to give as large a body of facts as possible showing that extremely slight differences within the same country or during different seasons certainly produce an appreciable effect at least on varieties which are already in an unstable condition ornamental flowers are good for this purpose as they are highly variable and are carefully observed all floriculturists are unanimous that certain varieties are affected by very slight differences in the nature of the artificial compost in which they are grown and by the natural soil of the district as well as by the season thus a skilful judge in writing on carnations and picotees 232 gardeners chronicle 1853 page 183 asks where can admiral curzon be seen possessing the colour size and strength which it has in derbyshire where can floras garland be found equal to those at slough where do highcoloured flowers revel better than at woolwich and birmingham yet in no two of these districts do the same varieties attain an equal degree of excellence although each may be receiving the attention of the most skilful cultivators the same writer then recommends every cultivator to keep five different kinds of soil and manure and to endeavour to suit the respective appetites of the plants you are dealing with for without such attention all hope of general success will be vain so it is with the dahlia 233 mr wildman floricultural soc february 7 1843 reported in gardeners chronicle 1843 page 86 the lady cooper rarely succeeds near london but does admirably in other districts the reverse holds good with other varieties and again there are others which succeed equally well in various situations a skilful gardener 234 mr robson in journal of horticulture february 13 1866 page 122 states that he procured cuttings of an old and wellknown variety pulchella of verbena which from having been propagated in a different situation presented a slightly different shade of colour the two varieties were afterwards multiplied by cuttings being carefully kept distinct but in the second year they could hardly be distinguished and in the third year no one could distinguish them  the nature of the season has an especial influence on certain varieties of the dahlia in 1841 two varieties were preeminently good and the next year these same two were preeminently bad a famous amateur 235 journal of horticulture 1861 page 24 asserts that in 1861 many varieties of the rose came so untrue in character that it was hardly possible to recognise them and the thought was not seldom entertained that the grower had lost his tally the same amateur 236 ibid 1862 page 83 states that in 1862 two thirds of his auriculas produced central trusses of flowers and such trusses are liable not to keep true and he adds that in some seasons certain varieties of this plant all prove good and the next season all prove bad whilst exactly the reverse happens with other varieties in 1845 the editor of the gardeners chronicle 237 gardeners chronicle 1845 page 660 remarked how singular it was that this year many calceolarias tended to assume a tubular form with heartsease 238 ibid 1863 page 628 the blotched sorts do not acquire their proper character until hot weather sets in whilst other varieties lose their beautiful marks as soon as this occurs  analogous facts have been observed with leaves mr beaton asserts 239 journal of hort 1861 pages 64 309 that he raised at shrubland during six years twenty thousand seedlings from the punch pelargonium and not one had variegated leaves but at surbiton in surrey onethird or even a greater proportion of the seedlings from this same variety were more or less variegated the soil of another district in surrey has a strong tendency to cause variegation as appears from information given me by sir f pollock verlot 2310 des varietes etc page 76 states that the variegated strawberry retains its character as long as grown in a dryish soil but soon loses it when planted in fresh and humid soil mr salter who is well known for his success in cultivating variegated plants informs me that rows of strawberries were planted in his garden in 1859 in the usual way and at various distances in one row several plants simultaneously became variegated and what made the case more extraordinary all were variegated in precisely the same manner these plants were removed but during the three succeeding years other plants in the same row became variegated and in no instance were the plants in any adjoining row affected  the chemical qualities odours and tissues of plants are often modified by a change which seems to us slight the hemlock is said not to yield conicine in scotland the root of the aconitum napellus becomes innocuous in frigid climates the medicinal properties of the digitalis are easily affected by culture as the pistacia lentiscus grows abundantly in the south of france the climate must suit it but it yields no mastic the laurus sassafras in europe loses the odour proper to it in

it might have been thought that definite chemical compounds would have been little liable to change either in quality or quantity  the wood of the american locusttree robinia when grown in england is nearly worthless as is that of the oaktree when grown at the cape of good hope 2312 hooker flora indica page 32 hemp and flax as i hear from dr falconer flourish and yield plenty of seed on the plains of india but their fibres are brittle and useless hemp on the other hand fails to produce in england that resinous matter which is so largely used in india as an intoxicating drug  the fruit of the melon is greatly influenced by slight differences in culture and climate hence it is generally a better plan according to naudin to improve an old kind than to introduce a new one into any locality the seed of the persian melon produces near paris fruit inferior to the poorest market kinds but at bordeaux yields delicious fruit 2313 naudin annales des sc nat 4th series bot tome 11 1859 page 81

next year from seed saved in kashmir give fruit weighing only from two to three pounds it is well known that american varieties of the apple produce in their native land magnificent and brightly coloured fruit but these in england are of poor quality and a dull colour in hungary there are many varieties of the kidneybean remarkable for the beauty of their seeds but the rev mj berkeley 2315 gardeners chronicle 1861 page 1113 found that their beauty could hardly ever be preserved in england and in some cases the colour was greatly changed we have seen in the ninth chapter with respect to wheat what a remarkable effect transportal from the north to the south of france and conversely produced on the weight of the grain  when man can perceive no change in plants or animals which have been exposed to a new climate or to different treatment insects can sometimes perceive a marked change a cactus has been imported into india from canton manilla mauritius and from the hothouses of kew and there is likewise a socalled native kind which was formerly introduced from south america all these plants belong to the same species and are alike in appearance but the cochineal insect flourishes only on the native kind on which it thrives prodigiously 2316 royle productive resources of india page 59 humboldt remarks 2317 personal narrative english translation volume 5 page 101 this statement has been confirmed by karsten beitrag zur kenntniss der rhynchoprion moscow 1864 s 39 and by others that white men born in the torrid zone walk barefoot with impunity in the same apartment where a european recently landed is exposed to the attacks of the pulex penetrans this insect the too wellknown chigoe must therefore be able to perceive what the most delicate chemical analysis fails to discover namely a difference between the blood or tissues of a european and those of a white man born in the tropics but the discernment of the chigoe is not so surprising as it at first appears for according to liebig 2318 organic chemistry english translation 1st edition page 369 the blood of men with different complexions though inhabiting the same country emits a different odour  diseases peculiar to certain localities heights or climates may be here briefly noticed as showing the influence of external circumstances on the human body diseases confined to certain races of man do not concern us for the constitution of the race may play the more important part and this may have been determined by unknown causes the plica polonica stands in this respect in a nearly intermediate position for it rarely affects germans who inhabit the neighbourhood of the vistula where so many poles are grievously affected neither does it affect russians who are said to belong to the same original stock as the poles 2319 prichard phys hist of mankind 1851 volume 1 page 155 the elevation of a district often governs the appearance of diseases in mexico the yellow fever does not extend above 924 metres and in peru people are affected with the verugas only between 600 and 1600 metres above the sea many other such cases could be given a peculiar cutaneous complaint called the bouton dalep affects in aleppo and some neighbouring districts almost every native infant and some few strangers and it seems fairly well established that this singular complaint depends on drinking certain waters in the healthy little island of st helena the scarletfever is dreaded like the plague analogous facts have been observed in chili and mexico 2320 darwin journal of researches 1845 page 434 even in the different departments of france it is found that the various infirmities which render the conscript unfit for serving in the army prevail with remarkable inequality revealing as boudin observes that many of them are endemic which otherwise would never have been suspected 2321 these statements on disease are taken from dr boudin geographie et statistique medicale 1857 tome 1 pages 44 and 52 tome 2 page 315 any one who will study the distribution of disease will be struck with surprise at what slight differences in the surrounding circumstances govern the nature and severity of the complaints by which man is at least temporarily affected  the modifications as yet referred to are extremely slight and in most cases have been caused as far as we can judge by equally slight differences in the conditions but such conditions acting during a series of generations would perhaps produce a marked effect  with plants a considerable change of climate sometimes produces a conspicuous result i have given in the ninth chapter the most remarkable case known to me namely that of varieties of maize which were greatly modified in the course of only two or three generations when taken from a tropical country to a cooler one or conversely dr falconer informs me that he has seen the english ribstonpippin apple a himalayan oak prunus and pyrus all assume in the hotter parts of india a fastigiate or pyramidal habit and this fact is the more interesting as a chinese tropical species of pyrus naturally grows thus although in these cases the changed manner of growth seems to have been directly caused by the great heat we know that many fastigiate trees have originated in their temperate homes in the botanic gardens of ceylon the appletree 2322 ceylon by sir je tennent volume 1 1859 page 89 sends out numerous runners under ground which continually rise into small stems and form a growth around the parenttree the varieties of the cabbage which produce heads in europe fail to do so in certain tropical countries 2323 godron de lespece tome 2 page 52 the rhododendron ciliatum produced at kew flowers so much larger and palercoloured than those which it bears on its native himalayan mountain that dr hooker 2324 journal of horticultural soc volume 7 1852 page 117 would hardly have recognised the species by the flowers alone many similar facts with respect to the colour and size of flowers could be given  the experiments of vilmorin and buckman on carrots and parsnips prove that abundant nutriment produces a definite and inheritable effect on the roots with scarcely any change in other parts of the plant alum directly influences the colour of the flowers of the hydrangea 2325 journal of hort soc volume 1 page 160 dryness seems generally to favour the hairiness or villosity of plants gartner found that hybrid verbascums became extremely woolly when grown in pots mr masters on the other hand states that the opuntia leucotricha is well clothed with beautiful white hairs when grown in a damp heat but in a dry heat exhibits none of this peculiarity 2326 see lecoq on the villosity of plants geograph bot tome 3 pages 287 291 gartner bastarderz s 261 mr masters on the opuntia in gardeners chronicle 1846 page 444 slight variations of many kinds not worth specifying in detail are retained only as long as plants are grown in certain soils of which sageret 2327 pom phys page 136 gives some instances from his own experience odart who insists strongly on the permanence of the varieties of the grape admits 2328 ampelographie 1849 page 19 that some varieties when grown under a different climate or treated differently vary in a slight degree as in the tint of the fruit and in the period of ripening some authors have denied that grafting causes even the slightest difference in the scion but there is sufficient evidence that the fruit is sometimes slightly affected in size and flavour the leaves in duration and the flowers in appearance 2329 gartner bastarderz s 606 has collected nearly all recorded facts andrew knight in transact hort soc volume 2 page 160 goes so far as to maintain that few varieties are absolutely permanent in character when propagated by buds or grafts  there can be no doubt from the facts given in the first chapter that european dogs deteriorate in india not only in their instincts but in structure but the changes which they undergo are of such a nature that they may be partly due to reversion to a primitive form as in the case of feral animals in parts of india the turkey becomes reduced in size with the pendulous appendage over the beak enormously developed 2330 mr blyth annals and mag of nat hist volume 20 1847 page 391 we have seen how soon the wild duck when domesticated loses its true character from the effects of abundant or changed food or from taking little exercise from the direct action of a humid climate and poor pasture the horse rapidly decreases in size in the falkland islands from information which i have received this seems likewise to be the case to a certain extent with sheep in australia  climate definitely influences the hairy covering of animals in the west indies a great change is produced in the fleece of sheep in about three generations dr falconer states 2331 natural history review 1862 page 113 that the thibet mastiff and goat when brought down from the himalaya to kashmir lose their fine wool at angora not only goats but shepherddogs and cats have fine fleecy hair and mr ainsworth 2332 journal of roy geographical soc volume 9 1839 page 275 attributes the thickness of the fleece to the severe winters and its silky lustre to the hot summers burnes states positively 2333 travels in bokhara volume 3 page 151 that the karakool sheep lose their peculiar black curled fleeces when removed into any other country even within the limits of england i have been assured that the wool of two breeds of sheep was slightly changed by the flocks being pastured in different localities 2334 see also on the influence of marshy pastures on the wool godron lespece tome 2 page 22 it has been asserted on good authority 2335 isidore geoffroy sainthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 page 438 that horses kept during several years in the deep coalmines of belgium become covered with velvety hair almost like that on the mole these cases probably stand in close relation to the natural change of coat in winter and summer naked varieties of several domestic animals have occasionally appeared but there is no reason to believe that this is in any way related to the nature of the climate to which they have been exposed 2336 azara has made some good remarks on this subject quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 337 see an account of a family of naked mice produced in england proc zoolog soc 1856 page 38  it appears at first sight probable that the increased size the tendency to fatten the early maturity and altered forms of our improved cattle sheep and pigs have directly resulted from their abundant supply of food this is the opinion of many competent judges and probably is to a great extent true but as far as form is concerned we must not overlook the more potent influence of lessened use on the limbs and lungs we see moreover as far as size is concerned that selection is apparently a more powerful agent than a large supply of food for we can thus only account for the existence as remarked to me by mr blyth of the largest and smallest breeds of sheep in the same country of cochinchina fowls and bantams of small tumbler and large runt pigeons all kept together and supplied with abundant nourishment nevertheless there can be little doubt that our domesticated animals have been modified independently of the increased or lessened use of parts by the conditions to which they have been subjected without the aid of selection for instance prof rutimeyer 2337 die fauna der pfahlbauten 1861 s 15 shows that the bones of domesticated quadrupeds can be distinguished from those of wild animals by the state of their surface and general appearance it is scarcely possible to read nathusiuss excellent vorstudien 2338 schweineschadel 1864 s 99 and doubt that with the highly improved races of the pig abundant food has produced a conspicuous effect on the general form of the body on the breadth of the head and face and even on the teeth nathusius rests much on the case of a purely bred berkshire pig which when two months old became diseased in its digestive organs and was preserved for observation until nineteen months old at this age it had lost several characteristic features of the breed and had acquired a long narrow head of large size relatively to its small body and elongated legs but in this case and in some others we ought not to assume that because certain characters are lost perhaps through reversion under one course of treatment therefore that they were at first directly produced by an opposite treatment  in the case of the rabbit which has become feral on the island of porto santo we are at first strongly tempted to attribute the whole changethe greatly reduced size the altered tints of the fur and the loss of certain characteristic marksto the definite action of the new conditions to which it has been exposed but in all such cases we have to consider in addition the tendency to reversion to progenitors more or less remote and the natural selection of the finest shades of difference  the nature of the food sometimes either definitely induces certain peculiarities or stands in some close relation with them pallas long ago asserted that the fattailed sheep of siberia degenerate and lose their enormous tails when removed from certain saline pastures and recently erman 2339 travels in siberia english translation volume 1 page 228 states that this occurs with the kirgisian sheep when brought to orenburgh  it is well known that hempseed causes bullfinches and certain other birds to become black mr wallace has communicated to me some much more remarkable facts of the same nature the natives of the amazonian region feed the common green parrot chrysotis festiva linn with the fat of large siluroid fishes and the birds thus treated become beautifully variegated with red and yellow feathers in the malayan archipelago the natives of gilolo alter in an analogous manner the colours of another parrot namely the lorius garrulus linn and thus produce the lori rajah or kinglory these parrots in the malay islands and south america when fed by the natives on natural vegetable food such as rice and plaintains retain their proper colours mr wallace has also recorded 2340 ar wallace travels on the amazon and rio negro page 294 a still more singular fact the indians of s america have a curious art by which they change the colours of the feathers of many birds they pluck out those from the part they wish to paint and inoculate the fresh wound with the milky secretion from the skin of a small toad the feathers grow of a brilliant yellow colour and on being plucked out it is said grow again of the same colour without any fresh operation  bechstein 2341 naturgeschichte der stubenvogel 1840 s 262 308 does not entertain any doubt that seclusion from light affects at least temporarily the colours of cagebirds  it is well known that the shells of

from spain to the south of france and to the rio plata and in both countries now presents a distinct appearance but whether this has resulted from food or climate is not known with respect to the common oyster mr f buckland informs me that he can generally distinguish the shells from different districts young oysters brought from wales and laid down in beds where natives are indigenous in the short space of two months begin to assume the native character m costa 2343 bull de la soc imp dacclimat tome 8 page 351 has recorded a much more remarkable case of the same nature namely that young shells taken from the shores of england and placed in the mediterranean at once altered their manner of growth and formed prominent diverging rays like those on the shells of the proper mediterranean oyster the same individual shell showing both forms of growth was exhibited before a society in paris lastly it is well known that caterpillars fed on different food sometimes either themselves acquire a different colour or produce moths differing in colour 2344 see an account of mr gregsons experiments on the abraxus grossulariata proc entomolog soc january 6 1862 these experiments have

proper limits here to discuss how far organic beings in a state of nature are definitely modified by changed conditions in my origin of species i have given a brief abstract of the facts bearing on this point and have shown the influence of light on the colours of birds and of residence near the sea on the lurid tints of insects and on the succulency of plants mr herbert spencer 2345 the principles of biology volume 2 1866 the present chapters were written before i had read mr herbert spencers work so that i have not been able to make so much use of it as i should otherwise probably have done has recently discussed with much ability this whole subject on general grounds he argues for instance that with all animals the external and internal tissues are differently acted on by the surrounding conditions and they invariably differ in intimate structure so again the upper and lower surfaces of true leaves as well as of stems and petioles when these assume the function and occupy the position of leaves are differently circumstanced with respect to light etc and apparently in consequence differ in structure but as mr herbert spencer admits it is most difficult in all such cases to distinguish between the effects of the definite action of physical conditions and the accumulation through natural selection of inherited variations which are serviceable to the organism and which have arisen independently of the definite action of these conditions  although we are not here concerned with the definite action of the conditions of life on organisms in a state of nature i may state that much evidence has been gained during the last few years on this subject in the united states for instance it has been clearly proved more especially by mr ja allen that with birds many species differ in tint size of body and of beak and in length of tail in proceeding from the north to the south and it appears that these differences must be attributed to the direct action of temperature 2346 professor weismann comes to the same conclusion with respect to certain european butterflies in his valuable essay ueber den saison dimorphismus 1875 i might also refer to the recent works of several other authors on the present subject for instance to kerners gute und schlechte arten 1866 with respect to plants i will give a somewhat analogous case mr meehan 2347 proc acad nat soc of philadelphia january 28 1862 has compared twentynine kinds of american trees with their nearest european allies all grown in close proximity and under as nearly as possible the same conditions in the american species he finds with the rarest exceptions that the leaves fall earlier in the season and assume before their fall a brighter tint that they are less deeply toothed or serrated that the buds are smaller that the trees are more diffuse in growth and have fewer branchlets and lastly that the seeds are smallerall in comparison with the corresponding european species now considering that these corresponding trees belong to several distinct orders and that they are adapted to widely different stations it can hardly be supposed that their differences are of any special service to them in the new and old worlds and if so such differences cannot have been gained through natural selection and must be attributed to the long continued action of a different climate  galls  another class of facts not relating to cultivated plants deserves attention i allude to the production of galls every one knows the curious brightred hairy productions on the wild rosetree and the various different galls produced by the oak some of the latter resemble fruit with one face as rosy as the rosiest apple these bright colours can be of no service either to the gallforming insect or to the tree and probably are the direct result of the action of the light in the same manner as the apples of nova scotia or canada are brighter coloured than english apples according to osten sackens latest revision no less than fiftyeight kinds of galls are produced on the several species of oak by cynips with its subgenera and mr bd walsh 2348 see mr bd walshs excellent papers in proc entomolog soc philadelphia december 1866 page 284 with respect to the willow see ibid 1864 page 546 states that he can add many others to the list one american species of willow the salix humilis bears ten distinct kinds of galls the leaves which spring from the galls of various english willows differ completely in shape from the natural leaves the young shoots of junipers and firs when punctured by certain insects yield monstrous growths resembling flowers and fircones and the flowers of some plants become from the same cause wholly changed in appearance galls are produced in every quarter of the world of several sent to me by mr thwaites from ceylon some were as symmetrical as a composite flower when in bud others smooth and spherical like a berry some protected by long spines others clothed with yellow wool formed of long cellular hairs others with regularly tufted hairs in some galls the internal structure is simple but in others it is highly complex thus m lacazeduthiers 2349 see his admirable histoire des galles in annal des sc nat bot 3rd series tome 19 1853 page 273 has figured in the common inkgall no less than seven concentric layers composed of distinct tissue namely the epidermic subepidermic spongy intermediate and the hard protective layer formed of curiously thickened woody cells and lastly the central mass abounding with starchgranules on which the larvae feed  galls are produced by insects of various orders but the greater number by species of cynips it is impossible to read m lacazeduthiers discussion and doubt that the poisonous secretion of the insect causes the growth of the gall and every one knows how virulent is the poison secreted by wasps and bees which belong to the same group with cynips galls grow with extraordinary rapidity and it is said that they attain their full size in a few days 2350 kirby and spence entomology 1818 volume 1 page 450 lacaze duthiers ibid page 284 it is certain that they are almost completely developed before the larvae are hatched considering that many gallinsects are extremely small the drop of secreted poison must be excessively minute it probably acts on one or two cells alone which being abnormally stimulated rapidly increase by a process of selfdivision galls as mr walsh 2351 proc entomolog soc philadelphia 1864 page 558 remarks afford good constant and definite characters each kind keeping as true to form as does any independent organic being this fact becomes still more remarkable when we hear that for instance seven out of the ten different kinds of galls produced on salix humilis are formed by gallgnats cecidomyidae which though essentially distinct species yet resemble one another so closely that in almost all cases it is difficult and in most cases impossible to distinguish the fullgrown insects one from the other 2352 mr bd walsh ibid page 633 and december 1866 page 275 for in accordance with a widespread analogy we may safely infer that the poison secreted by insects so closely allied would not differ much in nature yet this slight difference is sufficient to induce widely different results in some few cases the same species of gallgnat produces on distinct species of willows galls which cannot be distinguished the cynips fecundatrix also has been known to produce on the turkish oak to which it is not properly attached exactly the same kind of gall as on the european oak 2353 mr bd walsh ibid 1864 pages 545 411 495 and december 1866 page 278 see also lacazeduthiers these latter facts apparently prove that the nature of the poison is a more powerful agent in determining the form of the gall than the specific character of the tree which is acted on  as the poisonous secretion of insects belonging to various orders has the special power of affecting the growth of various plants as a slight difference in the nature of the poison suffices to produce widely different results and lastly as we know that the chemical compounds secreted by plants are eminently liable to be modified by changed conditions of life we may believe it possible that various parts of a plant might be modified through the agency of its own altered secretions compare for instance the mossy and viscid calyx of a mossrose which suddenly appears through budvariation on a provencerose with the gall of red moss growing from the inoculated leaf of a wild rose with each filament symmetrically branched like a microscopical sprucefir bearing a glandular tip and secreting odoriferous gummy matter 2354 lacazeduthiers ibid pages 325 328 or compare on the one hand the fruit of the peach with its hairy skin fleshy covering hard shell and kernel and on the other hand one of the more complex galls with its epidermic spongy and woody layers surrounding tissue loaded with starch granules these normal and abnormal structures manifestly present a certain degree of resemblance or again reflect on the cases above given of parrots which have had their plumage brightly decorated through some change in their blood caused by having been fed on certain fishes or locally inoculated with the poison of a toad i am far from wishing to maintain that the mossrose or the hard shell of the peachstone or the bright colours of birds are actually due to any chemical change in the sap or blood but these cases of galls and of parrots are excellently adapted to show us how powerfully and singularly external agencies may affect structure with such facts before us we need feel no surprise at the appearance of any modification in any organic being  i may also here allude to the remarkable effects which parasitic fungi sometimes produce on plants reissek 2355 linnaea volume 17 1843 quoted by dr mt masters royal institution march 16 1860 has described a thesium affected by an oecidium which was greatly modified and assumed some of the characteristic features of certain allied species or even genera suppose says reissek the condition originally caused by the fungus to become constant in the course of time the plant would if found growing wild be considered as a distinct species or even as belonging to a new genus i quote this remark to show how profoundly yet in how natural a manner this plant must have been modified by the parasitic fungus mr meehan 2356 proc acad nat sc philadelphia june 16 1874 and july 23 1875 also states that three species of euphorbia and portulaca olereacea which naturally grow prostrate become erect when they are attacked by the oecidium euphorbia maculata in this case also becomes nodose with the branchlets comparatively smooth and the leaves modified in shape approaching in these respects to a distinct species namely the e hypericifolia  facts and considerations opposed to the belief that the conditions of life act in a potent manner in causing definite modifications of structure  i have alluded to the slight differences in species naturally living in distinct countries under different conditions and such differences we feel at first inclined to attribute probably often with justice to the definite action of the surrounding conditions but it must be borne in mind that there exist many animals and plants which range widely and have been exposed to great diversities of climate yet remain uniform in character some authors as previously remarked account for the varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants by the definite action of the conditions to which they have been exposed in the different parts of great britain but there are about 200 plants 2357 hewett c watson cybele britannica volume 1 1847 page 11 which are found in every single english county and these plants must have been exposed for an immense period to considerable differences of climate and soil yet do not differ so again some animals and plants range over a large portion of the world yet retain the same character  notwithstanding the facts previously given on the occurrence of highly peculiar local diseases and on the strange modifications of structure in plants caused by the inoculated poison of insects and other analogous cases still there are a multitude of variationssuch as the modified skull of the niata ox and bulldog the long horns of caffre cattle the conjoined toes of the solidhoofed swine the immense crest and protuberant skull of polish fowls the crop of the pouterpigeon and a host of other such caseswhich we can hardly attribute to the definite action in the sense before specified of the external conditions of life no doubt in every case there must have been some exciting cause but as we see innumerable individuals exposed to nearly the same conditions and one alone is affected we may conclude that the constitution of the individual is of far higher importance than the conditions to which it has been exposed it seems indeed to be a general rule that conspicuous variations occur rarely and in one individual alone out of millions though all may have been exposed as far as we can judge to nearly the same conditions as the most strongly marked variations graduate insensibly into the most trifling we are led by the same train of thought to attribute each slight variation much more to innate differences of constitution however caused than to the definite action of the surrounding conditions  we are led to the same conclusion by considering the cases formerly alluded to of fowls and pigeons which have varied and will no doubt go on varying in directly opposite ways though kept during many generations under nearly the same conditions some for instance are born with their beaks wings tails legs etc a little longer and others with these same parts a little shorter by the longcontinued selection of such slight individual differences which occur in birds kept in the same aviary widely different races could certainly be formed and longcontinued selection important as is the result does nothing but preserve the variations which arise as it appears to us spontaneously  in these cases we see that domesticated animals vary in an indefinite number of particulars though treated as uniformly as is possible on the other hand there are instances of animals and plants which though they have been exposed to very different conditions both under nature and domestication have varied in nearly the same manner mr layard informs me that he has observed amongst the caffres of south africa a dog singularly like an arctic esquimaux dog pigeons in india present nearly the same wide diversities of colour as in europe and i have seen chequered and simply barred pigeons and pigeons with blue and white loins from sierra leone madeira england and india new varieties of flowers are continually raised in different parts of great britain but many of these are found by the judges at our exhibitions to be almost identical with old varieties a vast number of new fruittrees and culinary vegetables have been produced in north america these differ from european varieties in the same general manner as the several varieties raised in europe differ from one another and no one has ever pretended that the climate of america has given to the many american varieties any general character by which they can be recognised nevertheless from the facts previously advanced on the authority of mr meehan with respect to american and european foresttrees it would be rash to affirm that varieties raised in the two countries would not in the course of ages assume a distinctive character dr m masters has recorded a striking fact 2358 gardeners chronicle 1857 page 629 bearing on this subject he raised numerous plants of hybiscus syriacus from seed collected in south carolina and the holy land where the parentplants must have been exposed to considerably different conditions yet the seedlings from both localities broke into two similar strains one with obtuse leaves and purple or crimson flowers and the other with elongated leaves and more or less pink flowers  we may also infer the prepotent influence of the constitution of the organism over the definite action of the conditions of life from the several cases given in the earlier chapters of parallel series of varietiesan important subject hereafter to be more fully discussed subvarieties of the several kinds of wheat gourds peaches and other plants and to a limited extent subvarieties of the fowl pigeon and dog have been shown either to resemble or to differ from one another in a closely corresponding or parallel manner in other cases a variety of one species resembles a distinct species or the varieties of two distinct species resemble one another although these parallel resemblances no doubt often result from reversion to the former characters of a common progenitor yet in other cases when new characters first appear the resemblance must be attributed to the inheritance of a similar constitution and consequently to a tendency to vary in the same manner we see something of a similar kind in the same monstrosity appearing and reappearing many times in the same species of animal and as dr maxwell masters has remarked to me in the same species of plant  we may at least conclude that the amount of modification which animals and plants have undergone under domestication does not correspond with the degree to which they have been subjected to changed circumstances as we know the parentage of domesticated birds far better than of most quadrupeds we will glance through the list the pigeon has varied in europe more than almost any other bird yet it is a native species and has not been exposed to any extraordinary change of conditions the fowl has varied equally or almost equally with the pigeon and is a native of the hot jungles of india neither the peacock a native of the same country nor the guineafowl an inhabitant of the dry deserts of africa has varied at all or only in colour the turkey from mexico has varied but little the duck on the other hand a native of europe has yielded some wellmarked races and as this is an aquatic bird it must have been subjected to a far more serious change in its habits than the pigeon or even the fowl which nevertheless have varied in a much higher degree the goose a native of europe and aquatic like the duck has varied less than any other domesticated bird except the peacock  budvariation is also important under our present point of view in some few cases as when all the eyes on the same tuber of the potato or all the fruit on the same plumtree or all the flowers on the same plant have suddenly varied in the same manner it might be argued that the variation had been definitely caused by some change in the conditions to which the plants had been exposed yet in other cases such an admission is extremely difficult as new characters sometimes appear by budvariation which do not occur in the parentspecies or in any allied species we may reject at least in these cases the idea that they are due to reversion now it is well worth while to reflect maturely on some striking case of budvariation for instance that of the peach this tree has been cultivated by the million in various parts of the world has been treated differently grown on its own roots and grafted on various stocks planted as a standard trained against a wall or under glass yet each bud of each subvariety keeps true to its kind but occasionally at long intervals of time a tree in england or under the widely different climate of virginia produces a single bud and this yields a branch which ever afterwards bears nectarines nectarines differ as every one knows from peaches in their smoothness size and flavour and the difference is so great that some botanists have maintained that they are specifically distinct so permanent are the characters thus suddenly acquired that a nectarine produced by budvariation has propagated itself by seed to guard against the supposition that there is some fundamental distinction between bud and seminal variation it is well to bear in mind that nectarines have likewise been produced from the stone of the peach and reversely peaches from the stone of the nectarine now is it possible to conceive external conditions more closely alike than those to which the buds on the same tree are exposed yet one bud alone out of the many thousands borne by the same tree has suddenly without any apparent cause produced a nectarine but the case is even stronger than this for the same flowerbud has yielded a fruit onehalf or onequarter a nectarine and the other half or threequarters a peach again seven or eight varieties of the peach have yielded by budvariation nectarines the nectarines thus produced no doubt differ a little from one another but still they are nectarines of course there must be some cause internal or external to excite the peachbud to change its nature but i cannot imagine a class of facts better adapted to force on our minds the conviction that what we call the external conditions of life are in many cases quite insignificant in relation to any particular variation in comparison with the organisation or constitution of the being which varies  it is known from the labours of geoffroy sainthilaire and recently from those of dareste and others that eggs of the fowl if shaken placed upright perforated covered in part with varnish etc produce monstrous chickens now these monstrosities may be said to be directly caused by such unnatural conditions but the modifications thus induced are not of a definite nature an excellent observer m camille dareste 2359 memoire sur la production artificielle des monstruosites 1862 pages 812 recherches sur les conditions etc chez les monstres 1863 page 6 an abstract is given of geoffroys experiments by his son in his vie travaux etc 1847 page 290 remarks that the various species of monstrosities are not determined by specific causes the external agencies which modify the development of the embryo act solely in causing a perturbationa perversion in the normal course of development he compares the result to what we see in illness a sudden chill for instance affects one individual alone out of many causing either a cold or sorethroat rheumatism or inflammation of the lungs or pleura contagious matter acts in an analogous manner 2360 paget lectures on surgical pathology 1853 volume 1 page 483 we may take a still more specific instance seven pigeons were struck by rattlesnakes 2361 researches upon the venom of the rattlesnake january 1861 by dr mitchell page 67 some suffered from convulsions some had their blood coagulated in others it was perfectly fluid some showed ecchymosed spots on the heart others on the intestines etc others again showed no visible lesion in any organ it is well known that excess in drinking causes different diseases in different men but in the tropics the effects of intemperance differ from those caused in a cold climate 2362 mr sedgwick british and foreign medicochirurg review july 1863 page 175 and in this case we see the definite influence of opposite conditions the foregoing facts apparently give us as good an idea as we are likely for a long time to obtain how in many cases external conditions act directly though not definitely in causing modifications of structure  summary  there can be no doubt from the facts given in this chapter that extremely slight changes in the conditions of life sometimes probably often act in a definite manner on our domesticated productions and as the action of changed conditions in causing indefinite variability is accumulative so it may be with their definite action hence considerable and definite modifications of structure probably follow from altered conditions acting during a long series of generations in some few instances a marked effect has been produced quickly on all or nearly all the individuals which have been exposed to a marked change of climate food or other circumstance this has occurred with european men in the united states with european dogs in india with horses in the falkland islands apparently with various animals at angora with foreign oysters in the mediterranean and with maize transported from one climate to another we have seen that the chemical compounds of some plants and the state of their tissues are readily affected by changed conditions a relation apparently exists between certain characters and certain conditions so that if the latter be changed the character is lostas with the colours of flowers the state of some culinary plants the fruit of the melon the tail of fattailed sheep and the peculiar fleeces of other sheep  the production of galls and the change of plumage in parrots when fed on peculiar food or when inoculated by the poison of a toad prove to us what great and mysterious changes in structure and colour may be the definite result of chemical changes in the nutrient fluids or tissues  we now almost certainly know that organic beings in a state of nature may be modified in various definite ways by the conditions to which they have been long exposed as in the case of the birds and other animals in the northern and southern united states and of american trees in comparison with their representatives in europe but in many cases it is most difficult to distinguish between the definite result of changed conditions and the accumulation through natural selection of indefinite variations which have proved serviceable if it profited a plant to inhabit a humid instead of an arid station a fitting change in its constitution might possibly result from the direct action of the environment though we have no grounds for believing that variations of the right kind would occur more frequently with plants inhabiting a station a little more humid than usual than with other plants whether the station was unusually dry or humid variations adapting the plant in a slight degree for directly opposite habits of life would occasionally arise as we have good reason to believe from what we actually see in other cases  the organisation or constitution of the being which is acted on is generally a much more important element than the nature of the changed conditions in determining the nature of the variation we have evidence of this in the appearance of nearly similar modifications under different conditions and of different modifications under apparently nearly the same conditions we have still better evidence of this in closely parallel varieties being frequently produced from distinct races or even distinct species and in the frequent recurrence of the same monstrosity in the same species we have also seen that the degree to which domesticated birds have varied does not stand in any close relation with the amount of change to which they have been subjected  to recur once again to budvariations when we reflect on the millions of buds which many trees have produced before some one bud has varied we are lost in wonder as to what the precise cause of each variation can be let us recall the case given by andrew knight of the fortyyearold tree of the yellow magnum bonum plum an old variety which has been propagated by grafts on various stocks for a very long period throughout europe and north america and on which a single bud suddenly produced the red magnum bonum we should also bear in mind that distinct varieties and even distinct speciesas in the case of peaches nectarines and apricotsof certain roses and camellias although separated by a vast number of generations from any progenitor in common and although cultivated under diversified conditions have yielded by budvariation closely analogous varieties when we reflect on these facts we become deeply impressed with the conviction that in such cases the nature of the variation depends but little on the conditions to which the plant has been exposed and not in any especial manner on its individual character but much more on the inherited nature or constitution of the whole group of allied beings to which the plant in question belongs we are thus driven to conclude that in most cases the conditions of life play a subordinate part in causing any particular modification like that which a spark plays when a mass of combustibles bursts into flamethe nature of the flame depending on the combustible matter and not on the spark 2363 professor weismann argues strongly in favour of this view in his saisondimorphismus der schmetterlinge 1875 pages 4043  no doubt each slight variation must have its efficient cause but it is as hopeless an attempt to discover the cause of each as to say why a chill or a poison affects one man differently from another even with modifications resulting from the definite action of the conditions of life when all or nearly all the individuals which have been similarly exposed are similarly affected we can rarely see the precise relation between cause and effect in the next chapter it will be shown that the increased use or disuse of various organs produces an inherited effect it will further be seen that certain variations are bound together by correlation as well as by other laws beyond this we cannot at present explain either the causes or nature of the variability of organic beings   chapter 2xxiv  laws of variationuse and disuse etc  nisus formativus or the coordinating power of the organisation on the effects of the increased use and disuse of organs changed habits of life acclimatisation with animals and plants various methods by which this can be effected arrests of development rudimentary organs  in this and the two following chapters i shall discuss as well as the difficulty of the subject permits the several laws which govern variability these may be grouped under the effects of use and disuse including changed habits and acclimatisationarrest of developmentcorrelated variationthe cohesion of homologous partsthe variability of multiple partscompensation of growththe position of buds with respect to the axis of the plantand lastly analogous variation these several subjects so graduate into one another that their distinction is often arbitrary  it may be convenient first briefly to discuss that coordinating and reparative power which is common in a higher or lower degree to all organic beings and which was formerly designated by physiologists as nisus formativus  blumenbach and others 241 an essay on generation english translation page 18 paget lectures on surgical pathology 1853 volume 1 page 209 have insisted that the principle which permits a hydra when cut into fragments to develop itself into two or more perfect animals is the same with that which causes a wound in the higher animals to heal by a cicatrice such cases as that of the hydra are evidently analogous to the spontaneous division or fissiparous generation of the lowest animals and likewise to the budding of plants between these extreme cases and that of a mere cicatrice we have every gradation spallanzani 242 an essay on animal reproduction english translation 1769 page 79 by cutting off the legs and tail of a salamander got in the course of three months six crops of these members so that 687 perfect bones were reproduced by one animal during one season at whatever point the limb was cut off the deficient part and no more was exactly reproduced when a diseased bone has been removed a new one sometimes gradually assumes the regular form and all the attachments of muscles ligaments etc become as complete as before 243 carpenter principles of comp physiology 1854 page 479  this power of regrowth does not however always act perfectly the reproduced tail of a lizard differs in the form of the scales from the normal tail with certain orthopterous insects the large hind legs are reproduced of smaller size 244 charlesworth mag of nat hist volume 1 1837 page 145 the white cicatrice which in the higher animals unites the edges of a deep wound is not formed of perfect skin for elastic tissue is not produced till long afterwards 245 paget lectures on surgical pathology volume 1 page 239 the activity of the nisus formativus says blumenbach is in an inverse ratio to the age of the organised body its power is also greater with animals the lower they stand in the scale of organisation and animals low in the scale correspond with the embryos of higher animals belonging to the same class newports observations 246 quoted by carpenter comp phys page 479 afford a good illustration of this fact for he found that myriapods whose highest development scarcely carries them beyond the larva of perfect insects can regenerate limbs and antennae up to the time of their last moult and so can the larvae of true insects but except in one order not in the mature insect salamanders correspond in development with the tadpoles or larvae of the tailless batrachians and both possess to a large extent the power of regrowth but not so the mature tailless batrachians  absorption often plays an important part in the repair of injuries when a bone is broken and does not unite the ends are absorbed and rounded so that a false joint is formed or if the ends unite but overlap the projecting parts are removed 247 prof mareys discussion on the power of co adaptation in all parts of the organisation is excellent la machine animale 1873 chapter 9 see also paget lectures etc page 257 a dislocated bone will form for itself a new socket displaced tendons and varicose veins excavate new channels in the bones against which they press but absorption comes into action as virchow remarks during the normal growth of bones parts which are solid during youth become hollowed out for the medullary tissue as the bone increases in size in trying to understand the many well adapted cases of regrowth when aided by absorption we should remember that almost all parts of the organisation even whilst retaining the same form undergo constant renewal so that a part which is not renewed would be liable to absorption  some cases usually classed under the socalled nisus formativus at first appear to come under a distinct head for not only are old structures reproduced but new structures are formed thus after inflammation false membranes furnished with bloodvessels lymphatics and nerves are developed or a foetus escapes from the fallopian tubes and falls into the abdomen nature pours out a quantity of plastic lymph which forms itself into organised membrane richly supplied with bloodvessels and the foetus is nourished for a time in certain cases of hydrocephalus the open and dangerous spaces in the skull are filled up with new bones which interlock by perfect serrated sutures 248 these cases are given by blumenbach in his essay on generation pages 52 54 but most physiologists especially on the continent have now given up the belief in plastic lymph or blastema and virchow 249 cellular pathology translation by dr chance 1860 pages 27 441 maintains that every structure new or old is formed by the proliferation of preexisting cells on this view false membranes like cancerous or other tumours are merely abnormal developments of normal growths and we can thus understand how it is that they resemble adjoining structures for instance that a false membrane in the serous cavities acquires a covering of epithelium exactly like that which covers the original serous membrane adhesions of the iris may become black apparently from the production of pigmentcells like those of the uvea 2410 paget lectures on pathology volume 1 1853 page 357  no doubt the power of reparation though not always perfect is an admirable provision ready for various emergencies even for such as occur only at long intervals of time 2411 paget ibid page 150 yet this power is not more wonderful than the growth and development of every single creature more especially of those which are propagated by fissiparous generation this subject has been here noticed because we may infer that when any part or organ is either greatly increased in size or wholly suppressed through variation and continued selection the coordinating power of the organisation will continually tend to bring again all the parts into harmony with one another  on the effects of the increased use and disuse of organs  it is notorious and we shall immediately adduce proofs that increased use or action strengthens muscles glands senseorgans etc and that disuse on the other hand weakens them it has been experimentally proved by ranke 2412 die blutvertheilung etc der organe 1871 as quoted by jaeger in sachen darwins 1874 page 48 see also h spencer the principles of biology volume 2 1866 chapters 35 that the flow of blood is greatly increased towards any part which is performing work and sinks again when the part is at rest consequently if the work is frequent the vessels increase in size and the part is better nourished paget 2413 lectures on pathology 1853 volume 1 page 71 also accounts for the long thick darkcoloured hairs which occasionally grow even in young children near oldstanding inflamed surfaces or fractured bones by an increased flow of blood to the part when hunter inserted the spur of a cock into the comb which is well supplied with bloodvessels it grew in one case spirally to a length of six inches and in another case forward like a horn so that the bird could not touch the ground with its beak according to the interesting observations of m sedillot 2414 comptes rendus september 26 1864 page 539 when a portion of one of the bones of the leg of an animal is removed the associated bone enlarges till it attains a bulk equal to that of the two bones of which it has to perform the functions this is best exhibited in dogs in which the tibia has been removed the companion bone which is naturally almost filiform and not onefifth the size of the other soon acquires a size equal to or greater than that of the tibia now it is at first difficult to believe that increased weight acting on a straight bone could by alternately increasing and diminishing the pressure cause the blood to flow more freely in the vessels which permeate the periosteum and thus supply more nutriment to the bone nevertheless the observations adduced by mr spencer 2415 h spencer the principles of biology volume 2 page 243 on the strengthening of the bowed bones of rickety children along their concave sides leads to the belief that this is possible  the rocking of the stem of a tree increases in a marked manner the growth of the woody tissue in the parts which are strained prof sachs believes from reasons which he assigns that this is due to the pressure of the bark being relaxed in such parts and not as knight and h spencer maintain to an increased flow of sap caused by the movement of the trunk 2416 ibid volume 2 page 269 sachs textbook of botany 1875 page 734 but hard woody tissue may be developed without the aid of any movement as we see with ivy closely attached to an old wall in all such cases it is very difficult to distinguish between the effects of longcontinued selection and those which follow from the increased action of the part or directly from some other cause mr h spencer 2417 ibid volume 2 page 273 acknowledges this difficulty and gives as an instance the thorns on trees and the shells of nuts here we have extremely hard woody tissue without the possibility of any movement and without as far as we can see any other directly exciting cause and as the hardness of these parts is of manifest service to the plant we may look at the result as probably due to the selection of socalled spontaneous variations every one knows that hard work thickens the epidermis on the hands and when we hear that with infants long before birth the epidermis is thicker on the palms and soles of the feet than on any other part of the body as was observed with admiration by albinus 2418 paget lectures on pathology volume 2 page 209 we are naturally inclined to attribute this to the inherited effects of longcontinued use or pressure we are tempted to extend the same view even to the hoofs of quadrupeds but who will pretend to determine how far natural selection may have aided in the formation of structures of such obvious importance to the animal  that use strengthens the muscles may be seen in the limbs of artisans who follow different trades and when a muscle is strengthened the tendons and the crests of bone to which they are attached become enlarged and this must likewise be the case with the bloodvessels and nerves on the other hand when a limb is not used as by eastern fanatics or when the nerve supplying it with nervous power is effectually destroyed the muscles wither so again when the eye is destroyed the optic nerve becomes atrophied sometimes even in the course of a few months 2419 muller phys english translation pages 54 791 prof reed has given physiological and anat researches page 10 a curious account of the atrophy of the limbs of rabbits after the destruction of the nerve the proteus is furnished with branchiae as well as with lungs and schreibers 2420 quoted by lecoq in geograph bot tome 1 1854 page 182 found that when the animal was compelled to live in deep water the branchiae were developed to thrice their ordinary size and the lungs were partially atrophied when on the other hand the animal was compelled to live in shallow water the lungs became larger and more vascular whilst the branchiae disappeared in a more or less complete degree such modifications as these are however of comparatively little value for us as we do not actually know that they tend to be inherited  in many cases there is reason to believe that the lessened use of various organs has affected the corresponding parts in the offspring but there is no good evidence that this ever follows in the course of a single generation it appears as in the case of general or indefinite variability that several generations must be subjected to changed habits for any appreciable result our domestic fowls ducks and geese have almost lost not only in the individual but in the race their power of flight for we do not see a young fowl when frightened take flight like a young pheasant hence i was led carefully to compare the limbbones of fowls ducks pigeons and rabbits with the same bones in the wild parentspecies as the measurements and weights were fully given in the earlier chapters i need here only recapitulate the results with domestic pigeons the length of the sternum the prominence of its crest the length of the scapulae and furculum the length of the wings as measured from tip to tip of the radii are all reduced relatively to the same parts in the wild pigeon the wing and tail feathers however are increased in length but this may have as little connection with the use of the wings or tail as the lengthened hair on a dog with the amount of exercise which it has habitually taken the feet of pigeons except in the longbeaked races are reduced in size with fowls the crest of the sternum is less prominent and is often distorted or monstrous the wingbones have become lighter relatively to the legbones and are apparently a little shorter in comparison with those of the parentform the gallus bankiva with ducks the crest of the sternum is affected in the same manner as in the foregoing cases the furculum coracoids and scapulae are all reduced in weight relatively to the whole skeleton the bones of the wings are shorter and lighter and the bones of the legs longer and heavier relatively to each other and relatively to the whole skeleton in comparison with the same bones in the wildduck the decreased weight and size of the bones in the foregoing cases is probably the indirect result of the reaction of the weakened muscles on the bones i failed to compare the feathers of the wings of the tame and wild duck but gloger 2421 das abandern der vogel 1833 s 74 asserts that in the wild duck the tips of the wingfeathers reach almost to the end of the tail whilst in the domestic duck they often hardly reach to its base he remarks also on the greater thickness of the legs and says that the swimming membrane between the toes is reduced but i was not able to detect this latter difference  with the domesticated rabbit the body together with the whole skeleton is generally larger and heavier than in the wild animal and the legbones are heavier in due proportion but whatever standard of comparison be taken neither the legbones nor the scapulae have increased in length proportionally with the increased dimensions of the rest of the skeleton the skull has become in a marked manner narrower and from the measurements of its capacity formerly given we may conclude that this narrowness results from the decreased size of the brain consequent on the mentally inactive life led by these closelyconfined animals  we have seen in the eighth chapter that silkmoths which have been kept during many centuries closely confined emerge from their cocoons with their wings distorted incapable of flight often greatly reduced in size or even according to quatrefages quite rudimentary this condition of the wings may be largely owing to the same kind of monstrosity which often affects wild lepidoptera when artificially reared from the cocoon or it may be in part due to an inherent tendency which is common to the females of many bombycidae to have their wings in a more or less rudimentary state but part of the effect may be attributed to longcontinued disuse  from the foregoing facts there can be no doubt that with our anciently domesticated animals certain bones have increased or decreased in size and weight owing to increased or decreased use but they have not been modified as shown in the earlier chapters in shape or structure with animals living a free life and occasionally exposed to severe competition the reduction would tend to be greater as it would be an advantage to them to have the development of every superfluous part saved with highlyfed domesticated animals on the other hand there seems to be no economy of growth nor any tendency to the elimination of superfluous details but to this subject i shall recur  turning now to more general observations nathusius has shown that with the improved races of the pig the shortened legs and snout the form of the articular condyles of the occiput and the position of the jaws with the upper canine teeth projecting in a most anomalous manner in front of the lower canines may be attributed to these parts not having been fully exercised for the highlycultivated races do not travel in search of food nor root up the ground with their ringed muzzles 2422 nathusius die racen des schweines 1860 s 53 57 vorstudienschweineschadel 1864 s 103 130 133 prof lucae supports and extends the conclusions of von nathusius der schadel des maskenschweines 1870 these modifications of structure which are all strictly inherited characterise several improved breeds so that they cannot have been derived from any single domestic stock with respect to cattle professor tanner has remarked that the lungs and liver in the improved breeds are found to be considerably reduced in size when compared with those possessed by animals having perfect liberty 2423 journal of agriculture of highland soc july 1860 page 321 and the reduction of these organs affects the general shape of the body the cause of the reduced lungs in highlybred animals which take little exercise is obvious and perhaps the liver may be affected by the nutritious and artificial food on which they largely subsist again dr wilckens asserts 2424 landwirth wochenblatt no 10 that various parts of the body certainly differ in alpine and lowland breeds of several domesticated animals owing to their different habits of life for instance the neck and forelegs in length and the hoofs in shape  it is well known that when an artery is tied the anastomosing branches from being forced to transmit more blood increase in diameter and this increase cannot be accounted for by mere extension as their coats gain in strength with respect to glands sir j paget observes that when one kidney is destroyed the other often becomes much larger and does double work 2425 lectures on surgical pathology 1853 volume 1 page 27 if we compare the size of the udders and their power of secretion in cows which have been long domesticated and in certain breeds of the goat in which the udders nearly touch the ground with these organs in wild or halfdomesticated animals the difference is great a good cow with us daily yields more than five gallons or forty pints of milk whilst a firstrate animal kept for instance by the damaras of south africa 2426 andersson travels in south africa page 318 for analogous cases in south america see aug sthilaire voyage dans la province de goyaz tome 1 page 71 rarely gives more than two or three pints of milk daily and should her calf be taken from her she absolutely refuses to give any we may attribute the excellence of our cows and of certain goats partly to the continued selection of the best milking animals and partly to the inherited effects of the increased action through mans art of the secreting glands  it is notorious that shortsight is inherited and we have seen in the twelfth chapter from the statistical researches of m giraudteulon that the habit of viewing near objects gives a tendency to shortsight veterinarians are unanimous that horses are affected with spavins splints ringbones etc from being shod and from travelling on hard roads and they are almost equally unanimous that a tendency to these malformations is transmitted formerly horses were not shod in north carolina and it has been asserted that they did not then suffer from these diseases of the legs and feet 2427 brickell nat hist of north carolina 1739 page 53  our domesticated quadrupeds are all descended as far as is known from species having erect ears yet few kinds can be named of which at least one race has not drooping ears cats in china horses in parts of russia sheep in italy and elsewhere the guineapig formerly in germany goats and cattle in india rabbits pigs and dogs in all longcivilised countries have dependent ears with wild animals which constantly use their ears like funnels to catch every passing sound and especially to ascertain the direction whence it comes there is not as mr blyth has remarked any species with drooping ears except the elephant hence the incapacity to erect the ears is certainly in some manner the result of domestication and this incapacity has been attributed by various authors 2428 livingstone quoted by youatt on sheep page 142 hodgson in journal of asiatic soc of bengal volume 16 1847 page 1006 etc etc on the other hand dr wilckens argues strongly against the belief that the drooping of the ears is the result of disuse jahrbuch der deutschen viehzucht 1866 to disuse for animals protected by man are not compelled habitually to use their ears col hamilton smith 2429 naturalists library dogs volume 2 1840 page 104 states that in ancient effigies of the dog with the exception of one egyptian instance no sculpture of the earlier grecian era produces representations of hounds with completely drooping ears those with them half pendulous are missing in the most ancient and this character increases by degrees in the works of the roman period godron also has remarked that the pigs of the ancient egyptians had not their ears enlarged and pendent 2430 de lespece tome 1 1859 page 367 but it is remarkable that the drooping of the ear is not accompanied by any decrease in size on the contrary animals so different as fancy rabbits certain indian breeds of the goat our petted spaniels blood hounds and other dogs have enormously elongated ears so that it would appear as if their weight had caused them to droop aided perhaps by disuse with rabbits the drooping of the much elongated ears has affected even the structure of the skull  the tail of no wild animal as remarked to me by mr blyth is curled whereas pigs and some races of dogs have their tails much curled this deformity therefore appears to be the result of domestication but whether in any way connected with the lessened use of the tail is doubtful  the epidermis on our hands is easily thickened as every one knows by hard work in a district of ceylon the sheep have horny callosities that defend their knees and which arise from their habit of kneeling down to crop the short herbage and this distinguishes the jaffna flocks from those of other portions of the island but it is not stated whether this peculiarity is inherited 2431 ceylon by sir je tennent 1859 volume 2 page 531  the mucous membrane which lines the stomach is continuous with the external skin of the body therefore it is not surprising that its texture should be affected by the nature of the food consumed but other and more interesting changes likewise follow hunter long ago observed that the muscular coat of the stomach of a gull larus tridactylus which had been fed for a year chiefly on grain was thickened and according to dr edmondston a similar change periodically occurs in the shetland islands in the stomach of the larus argentatus which in the spring frequents the cornfields and feeds on the seed the same careful observer has noticed a great change in the stomach of a raven which had been long fed on vegetable food in the case of an owl strix grallaria similarly treated menetries states that the form of the stomach was changed the inner coat became leathery and the liver increased in size whether these modifications in the digestive organs would in the course of generations become inherited is not known 2432 for the foregoing statements see hunter essays and observations 1861 volume 2 page 329 dr edmondston as quoted in macgillivray british birds volume 5 page 550 menetries as quoted in bronn geschichte der natur b 2 s 110  the increased or diminished length of the intestines which apparently results from changed diet is a more remarkable case because it is characteristic of certain animals in their domesticated condition and therefore must be inherited the complex absorbent system the bloodvessels nerves and muscles are necessarily all modified together with the intestines according to daubenton the intestines of the domestic cat are onethird longer than those of the wild cat of europe and although this species is not the parent stock of the domestic animal yet as isidore geoffroy has remarked the several species of cats are so closely allied that the comparison is probably a fair one the increased length appears to be due to the domestic cat being less strictly carnivorous in its diet than any wild feline species for instance i have seen a french kitten eating vegetables as readily as meat according to cuvier the intestines of the domesticated pig exceed greatly in proportionate length those of the wild boar in the tame and wild rabbit the change is of an opposite nature and probably results from the nutritious food given to the tame rabbit 2433 these statements on the intestines are taken from isidore geoffroy sainthilaire hist nat gen tome 3 pages 427 441  changed and inherited habits of life  this subject as far as the mental powers of animals are concerned so blends into instinct that i will here only remind the reader of such cases as the tameness of our domesticated animalsthe pointing or retrieving of dogs their not attacking the smaller animals kept by manand so forth how much of these changes ought to be attributed to mere habit and how much to the selection of individuals which have varied in the desired manner irrespectively of the special circumstances under which they have been kept can seldom be told  we have already seen that animals may be habituated to a changed diet but some additional instances may be given in the polynesian islands and in china the dog is fed exclusively on vegetable matter and the taste for this kind of food is to a certain extent inherited 2434 gilbert white nat hist selborne 1825 volume 2 page 121 our sporting dogs will not touch the bones of game birds whilst most other dogs devour them with greediness in some parts of the world sheep have been largely fed on fish the domestic hog is fond of barley the wild boar is said to disdain it and the disdain is partially inherited for some young wild pigs bred in captivity showed an aversion for this grain whilst others of the same brood relished it 2435 burdach traite de phys tome 2 page 267 as quoted by dr p lucas lhered nat tome 1 page 388 one of my relations bred some young pigs from a chinese sow by a wild alpine boar they lived free in the park and were so tame that they came to the house to be fed but they would not touch swill which was devoured by the other pigs an animal when once accustomed to an unnatural diet which can generally be effected only during youth dislikes its proper food as spallanzani found to be the case with a pigeon which had been long fed on meat individuals of the same species take to new food with different degrees of readiness one horse it is stated soon learned to eat meat whilst another would have perished from hunger rather than have partaken of it 2436 this and several other cases are given by colin physiologie comp des animaux dom 1854 tome 1 page 426 the caterpillars of the bombyx hesperus feed in a state of nature on the leaves of the cafe diable but after having been reared on the ailanthus they would not touch the cafe diable and actually died of hunger 2437 m michely de cayenne in bull soc dacclimat tome 8 1861 page 563  it has been found possible to accustom marine fish to live in fresh water but as such changes in fish and other marine animals have been chiefly observed in a state of nature they do not properly belong to our present subject the period of gestation and of maturity as shown in the earlier chaptersthe season and the frequency of the act of breedinghave all been greatly modified under domestication with the egyptian goose the rate of change with respect to the season has been recorded 2438 quatrefages unite de lespece humaine 1861 page 79 the wild drake pairs with one female the domestic drake is polygamous certain breeds of fowls have lost the habit of incubation the paces of the horse and the manner of flight of certain breeds of the pigeon have been modified and are inherited cattle horses and pigs have learnt to browse under water in the st johns river east florida where the vallisneria has been largely naturalised the cows were observed by prof wyman to keep their heads immersed for a period varying from fifteen to thirtyfive seconds 2439 the american naturalist april 1874 page 237 the voice differs much in certain kinds of fowls and pigeons some varieties are clamorous and others silent as the call and common duck or the spitz and pointer dog every one knows how the breeds of the dog differ from one another in their manner of hunting and in their ardour after different kinds of game or vermin  with plants the period of vegetation is easily changed and is inherited as in the case of summer and winter wheat barley and vetches but to this subject we shall immediately return under acclimatisation annual plants sometimes become perennial under a new climate as i hear from dr hooker is the case with the stock and mignonette in tasmania on the other hand perennials sometimes become annuals as with the ricinus in england and as according to captain mangles with many varieties of the heartsease von berg 2440 flora 1835 b 2 page 504 raised from seed of verbascum phoeniceum which is usually a biennial both annual and perennial varieties some deciduous bushes become evergreen in hot countries 2441 alph de candolle geograph bot tome 2 page 1078 rice requires much water but there is one variety in india which can be grown without irrigation 2442 royle illustrations of the botany of the himalaya page 19 certain varieties of the oat and of our other cereals are best fitted for certain soils 2443 gardeners chronicle 1850 pages 204 219 endless similar facts could be given in the animal and vegetable kingdoms they are noticed here because they illustrate analogous differences in closely allied natural species and because such changed habits of life whether due to habit or to the direct action of external conditions or to socalled spontaneous variability would be apt to lead to modifications of structure  acclimatisation  from the previous remarks we are naturally led to the much disputed subject of acclimatisation there are two distinct questions do varieties descended from the same species differ in their power of living under different climates and secondly if they so differ how have they become thus adapted we have seen that european dogs do not succeed well in india and it is asserted 2444 rev r everest journal as soc of bengal volume 3 page 19 that no one has there succeeded in keeping the newfoundland long alive but then it may be argued and probably with truth that these northern breeds are specifically distinct from the native dogs which flourish in india the same remark may be made with respect to different breeds of sheep of which according to youatt 2445 youatt on sheep 1838 page 491 not one brought from a torrid climate lasts out the second year in the zoological gardens but sheep are capable of some degree of acclimatisation for merino sheep bred at the cape of good hope have been found far better adapted for india than those imported from england 2446 royle prod resources of india page 153 it is almost certain that all the breeds of the fowl are descended from one species but the spanish breed which there is good reason to believe originated near the mediterranean 2447 tegetmeier poultry book 1866 page 102 though so fine and vigorous in england suffers more from frost than any other breed the arrindy silk moth introduced from bengal and the ailanthus moth from the temperate province of shan tung in china belong to the same species as we may infer from their identity in the caterpillar cocoon and mature states 2448 dr r paterson in a paper communicated to bot soc of canada quoted in the reader 1863 november 13 yet they differ much in constitution the indian form will flourish only in warm latitudes the other is quite hardy and withstands cold and rain  plants are more strictly adapted to climate than are animals the latter when domesticated withstand such great diversities of climate that we find nearly the same species in tropical and temperate countries whilst the cultivated plants are widely dissimilar hence a larger field is open for inquiry in regard to the acclimatisation of plants than of animals it is no exaggeration to say that with almost every plant which has long been cultivated varieties exist which are endowed with constitutions fitted for very different climates i will select only a few of the more striking cases as it would be tedious to give all in north america numerous fruittrees have been raised and in horticultural publicationsfor instance in that by downinglists are given of the varieties which are best able to withstand the severe climate of the northern states and canada many american varieties of the pear plum and peach are excellent in their own country but until recently hardly one was known that succeeded in england and with apples 2449 see remarks by editor in gardeners chronicle 1848 page 5 not one succeeds though the american varieties can withstand a severer winter than ours the summer here is not hot enough fruittrees have also originated in europe with different constitutions but they are not much noticed because nurserymen here do not supply wide areas the forelle pear flowers early and when the flowers have just set and this is the critical period they have been observed both in france and england to withstand with complete impunity a frost of 18 deg and even 14 deg fahr which killed the flowers whether fully expanded or in bud of all other kinds of pears 2450 gardeners chronicle 1860 page 938 remarks by editor and quotation from decaisne this power in the flower of resisting cold and afterwards producing fruit does not invariably depend as we know on good authority 2451 j de jonghe of brussels in gardeners chronicle 1857 page 612 on general constitutional vigour in proceeding northward the number of varieties which are found capable of resisting the climate rapidly decreases as may be seen in the list of the varieties of the cherry apple and pear which can be cultivated in the neighbourhood of stockholm 2452 ch martius voyage bot cotes sept de la norvege page 26 near moscow prince troubetzkoy planted for experiment in the open ground several varieties of the pear but one alone the poire sans pepins withstood the cold of winter 2453 journal de lacad hort de gand quoted in gardeners chronicle 1859 page 7 we thus see that our fruittrees like distinct species of the same genus certainly differ from each other in their constitutional adaptation to different climates  with the varieties of many plants the adaptation to climate is often very close thus it has been proved by repeated trials that few if any of the english varieties of wheat are adapted for cultivation in scotland 2454 gardeners chronicle 1851 page 396 but the failure in this case is at first only in the quantity though ultimately in the quality of the grain produced the rev mj berkeley sowed wheatseed from india and got the most meagre ears on land which would certainly have yielded a good crop from english wheat 2455 ibid 1862 page 235 in these cases varieties have been carried from a warmer to a cooler climate in the reverse case as when wheat was imported directly from france into the west indian islands it produced either wholly barren spikes or furnished with only two or three miserable seeds while west indian seed by its side yielded an enormous harvest 2456 on the authority of labat quoted in gardeners chronicle 1862 page 235 here is another case of close adaptation to a slightly cooler climate a kind of wheat which in england may be used indifferently either as a winter or summer variety when sown under the warmer climate of grignan in france behaved exactly as if it had been a true winter wheat 2457 mm edwards and colin annal des sc nat 2nd series bot tome 5 page 22  botanists believe that all the varieties of maize belong to the same species and we have seen that in north america in proceeding northward the varieties cultivated in each zone produce their flowers and ripen their seed within shorter and shorter periods so that the tall slowly maturing southern varieties do not succeed in new england and the new english varieties do not succeed in canada i have not met with any statement that the southern varieties are actually injured or killed by a degree of cold which the northern varieties can withstand with impunity though this is probable but the production of early flowering and early seeding varieties deserves to be considered as one form of acclimatisation hence it has been found possible according to kalm to cultivate maize further and further northwards in america in europe also as we learn from the evidence given by alph de candolle the culture of maize has extended since the end of the last century thirty leagues north of its former boundary 2458 geograph bot page 337 on the authority of linnaeus 2459 swedish acts english translation 173940 volume 1 kalm in his travels volume 2 page 166 gives an analogous case with cottonplants raised in new jersey from carolina seed i may quote an analogous case namely that in sweden tobacco raised from homegrown seed ripens its seed a month sooner and is less liable to miscarry than plants raised from foreign seed  with the vine differently from the maize the line of practical culture has retreated a little southward since the middle ages 2460 de candolle geograph bot page 339 but this seems due to commerce being now easier so that it is better to import wine from the south than to make it in northern districts nevertheless the fact of the vine not having spread northward shows that acclimatisation has made no progress during several centuries there is however a marked difference in the constitution of the several varieties some being hardy whilst others like the muscat of alexandria require a very high temperature to come to perfection according to labat 2461 gardeners chronicle 1862 page 235 vines taken from france to the west indies succeed with extreme difficulty whilst those imported from madeira or the canary islands thrive admirably  gallesio gives a curious account of the naturalisation of the orange in italy during many centuries the sweet orange was propagated exclusively by grafts and so often suffered from frosts that it required protection after the severe frost of 1709 and more especially after that of 1763 so many trees were destroyed that seedlings from the sweet orange were raised and to the surprise of the inhabitants their fruit was found to be sweet the trees thus raised were larger more productive and hardier than the old kinds and seedlings are now continually raised hence gallesio concludes that much more was effected for the naturalisation of the orange in italy by the accidental production of new kinds during a period of about sixty years than had been effected by grafting old varieties during many ages 2462 gallesio teoria della riproduzione veg 1816 page 125 and traite du citrus 1811 page 359 i may add that risso 2463 essai sur lhist des orangers 1813 page 20 etc describes some portuguese varieties of the orange as extremely sensitive to cold and as much tenderer than certain other varieties  the peach was known to theophrastus 322 bc 2464 alph de candolle geograph bot page 882 according to the authorities quoted by dr f rolle 2465 ch darwins lehre von der entstehung etc 1862 s 87 it was tender when first introduced into greece and even in the island of rhodes only occasionally bore fruit if this be correct the peach in spreading during the last two thousand years over the middle parts of europe must have become much hardier at the present day different varieties differ much in hardiness some french varieties will not succeed in england and near paris the pavie de bonneuil does not ripen its fruit till very late in the season even when grown on a wall it is therefore only fit for a very hot southern climate 2466 decaisne quoted in gardeners chronicle 1865 page 271  i will briefly give a few other cases a variety of magnolia grandiflora raised by m roy withstands a temperature several degrees lower than that which any other variety can resist with camellias there is much difference in hardiness one particular variety of the noisette rose withstood the severe frost of 1860 untouched and hale amidst a universal destruction of other noisettes in new york the irish yew is quite hardy but the common yew is liable to be cut down i may add that there are varieties of the sweet potato convolvulus batatas which are suited for warmer as well as for colder climates 2467 for the magnolia see loudons gardeners mag volume 13 1837 page 21 for camellias and roses see gardeners chronicle 1860 page 384 for the yew journal of hort march 3 1863 p 174 for sweet potatoes see col von siebold in gardeners chronicle 1855 page 822  the plants as yet mentioned have been found capable of resisting an unusual degree of cold or heat when fully grown the following cases refer to plants whilst young in a large bed of young araucarias of the same age growing close together and equally exposed it was observed 2468 the editor gardeners chronicle 1861 page 239 after the unusually severe winter of 186061 that in the midst of the dying numerous individuals remained on which the frost had absolutely made no kind of impression dr lindley after alluding to this and other similar cases remarks among the lessons which the late formidable winter has taught us is that even in their power of resisting cold individuals of the same species of plants are remarkably different near salisbury there was a sharp frost on the night of may 24 1836 and all the french beans phaseolus vulgaris in a bed were killed except about one in thirty which completely escaped 2469 loudons gardeners mag volume 12 1836 page 378 on the same day of the month but in the year 1864 there was a severe frost in kent and two rows of scarlet runners p multiflorus in my garden containing 390 plants of the same age and equally exposed were all blackened and killed except about a dozen plants in an adjoining row of fulmers dwarf bean p vulgaris one single plant escaped a still more severe frost occurred four days afterwards and of the dozen plants which had previously escaped only three survived these were not taller or more vigorous than the other young plants but they escaped completely with not even the tips of their leaves browned it was impossible to behold these three plants with their blackened withered and dead brethren all around and not see at a glance that they differed widely in constitutional power of resisting frost  this work is not the proper place to show that wild plants of the same species naturally growing at different altitudes or under different latitudes become to a certain extent acclimatised as is proved by the different behaviour of their seedlings when raised in another country in my origin of species i have alluded to some cases and i could add many others one instance must suffice mr grigor of forres 2470 gardeners chronicle 1865 page 699 mr g maw gives gardeners chronicle 1870 page 895 a number of striking cases he brought home from southern spain and northern africa several plants which he cultivated in england alongside specimens from northern districts and he found a great difference not only in their hardiness during the winter but in the behaviour of some of them during the summer states that seedlings of the scotch fir pinus sylvestris raised from seed from the continent and from the forests of scotland differ much the difference is perceptible in oneyearold and more so in twoyear old seedlings but the effects of the winter on the second years growth almost uniformly make those from the continent quite brown and so damaged that by the month of march they are quite unsaleable while the plants from the native scotch pine under the same treatment and standing alongside although considerably shorter are rather stouter and quite green so that the beds of the one can be known from the other when seen from the distance of a mile closely similar facts have been observed with seedling larches  hardy varieties would alone be valued or noticed in europe whilst tender varieties requiring more warmth would generally be neglected but such occasionally arise thus loudon 2471 arboretum et fruticetum volume 3 page 1376 describes a cornish variety of the elm which is almost an evergreen and of which the shoots are often killed by the autumnal frosts so that its timber is of little value horticulturists know that some varieties are much more tender than others thus all the varieties of the broccoli are more tender than cabbages but there is much difference in this respect in the subvarieties of the broccoli the pink and purple kinds are a little hardier than the white cape broccoli but they are not to be depended on after the thermometer falls below 24 deg fahr the walcheren broccoli is less tender than the cape and there are several varieties which will stand much severer cold than the walcheren 2472 mr robson in journal of horticulture 1861 page 23 cauliflowers seed more freely in india than cabbages 2473 dr bonavia report of the agrihort soc of oudh 1866 to give one instance with flowers eleven plants raised from a hollyhock called the queen of the whites 2474 cottage gardener 1860 april 24 page 57 were found to be much more tender than various other seedlings it may be presumed that all tender varieties would succeed better under a climate warmer than ours with fruittrees it is well known that certain varieties for instance of the peach stand forcing in a hothouse better than others and this shows either pliability of organisation or some constitutional difference the same individual cherrytree when forced has been observed during successive years gradually to change its period of vegetation 2475 gardeners chronicle 1841 page 291 few pelargoniums can resist the heat of a stove but alba multiflora will as a most skilful gardener asserts stand pineapple top and bottom heat the whole winter without looking any more drawn than if it had stood in a common greenhouse and blanche fleur seems as if it had been made on purpose for growing in winter like many bulbs and to rest all summer 2476 mr beaton in cottage gardener march 20 1860 page 377 queen mab will also stand stove heat see gardeners chronicle 1845 page 226 there can hardly be a doubt that the alba multiflora pelargonium must have a widely different constitution from that of most other varieties of this plant it would probably withstand even an equatorial climate  we have seen that according to labat the vine and wheat require acclimatisation in order to succeed in the west indies similar facts have been observed at madras two parcels of mignonetteseed one direct from europe the other saved at bangalore of which the mean temperature is much below that of madras were sown at the same time they both vegetated equally favourably but the former all died off a few days after they appeared above ground the latter still survive and are vigorous healthy plants so again turnip and carrot seed saved at hyderabad are found to answer better at madras than seed from europe or from the cape of good hope 2477 gardeners chronicle 1841 page 439 mr j scott of the calcutta botanic gardens informs me that seeds of the sweetpea lathyrus odoratus imported from england produce plants with thick rigid stems and small leaves which rarely blossom and never yield seed plants raised from french seed blossom sparingly but all the flowers are sterile on the other hand plants raised from sweetpeas grown near darjeeling in upper india but originally derived from england can be successfully cultivated on the plains of india for they flower and seed profusely and their stems are lax and scandent in some of the foregoing cases as dr hooker has remarked to me the greater success may perhaps be attributed to the seeds having been more fully ripened under a more favourable climate but this view can hardly be extended to so many cases including plants which from being cultivated under a climate hotter than their native one become fitted for a still hotter climate we may therefore safely conclude that plants can to a certain extent become accustomed to a climate either hotter or colder than their own although the latter cases have been more frequently observed  we will now consider the means by which acclimatisation may be effected namely through the appearance of varieties having a different constitution and through the effects of habit in regard to new varieties there is no evidence that a change in the constitution of the offspring necessarily stands in any direct relation with the nature of the climate inhabited by the parents on the contrary it is certain that hardy and tender varieties of the same species appear in the same country new varieties thus spontaneously arising become fitted to slightly different climates in two different ways firstly they may have the power either as seedlings or when fullgrown of resisting intense cold as with the moscow pear or of resisting intense heat as with some kinds of pelargonium or the flowers may withstand severe frost as with the forelle pear secondly plants may become adapted to climates widely different from their own from flowering and fruiting either earlier or later in the season in both these cases the power of acclimatisation by man consists simply in the selection and preservation of new varieties but without any direct intention on his part of securing a hardier variety acclimatisation may be unconsciously effected by merely raising tender plants from seed and by occasionally attempting their cultivation further and further northwards as in the case of maize the orange and the peach  how much influence ought to be attributed to inherited habit or custom in the acclimatisation of animals and plants is a much more difficult question in many cases natural selection can hardly have failed to have come into play and complicated the result it is notorious that mountain sheep resist severe weather and storms of snow which would destroy lowland breeds but then mountain sheep have been thus exposed from time immemorial and all delicate individuals will have been destroyed and the hardiest preserved so with the arrindy silkmoths of china and india who can tell how far natural selection may have taken a share in the formation of the two races which are now fitted for such widely different climates it seems at first probable that the many fruittrees which are so well fitted for the hot summers and cold winters of north america in contrast with their poor success under our climate have become adapted through habit but when we reflect on the multitude of seedlings annually raised in that country and that none would succeed unless born with a fitting constitution it is possible that mere habit may have done nothing towards their acclimatisation on the other hand when we hear that merino sheep bred during no great number of generations at the cape of good hopethat some european plants raised during only a few generations in the cooler parts of india withstand the hotter parts of that country much better than the sheep or seeds imported directly from england we must attribute some influence to habit we are led to the same conclusion when we hear from naudin 2478 quoted by asa gray in am journ of sc 2nd series january 1865 page 106 that the races of melons squashes and gourds which have long been cultivated in northern europe are comparatively more precocious and need much less heat for maturing their fruit than the varieties of the same species recently brought from tropical regions in the reciprocal conversion of summer and winter wheat barley and vetches into each other habit produces a marked effect in the course of a very few generations the same thing apparently occurs with the varieties of maize which when carried from the southern states of america or into germany soon became accustomed to their new homes with vineplants taken to the west indies from madeira which are said to succeed better than plants brought directly from france we have some degree of acclimatisation in the individual independently of the production of new varieties by seed  the common experience of agriculturists is of some value and they often advise persons to be cautious in trying the productions of one country in another the ancient agricultural writers of china recommend the preservation and cultivation of the varieties peculiar to each country during the classical period columella wrote vernaculum pecus peregrino longe praestantius est 2479 for china see memoire sur les chinois tome 11 1786 page 60 columella is quoted by carlier in journal de physique tome 24 1784  i am aware that the attempt to acclimatise either animals or plants has been called a vain chimera no doubt the attempt in most cases deserves to be thus called if made independently of the production of new varieties endowed with a different constitution with plants propagated by buds habit rarely produces any effect it apparently acts only through successive seminal generations the laurel bay laurestinus etc and the jerusalem artichoke which are propagated by cuttings or tubers are probably now as tender in england as when first introduced and this appears to be the case with the potato which until recently was seldom multiplied by seed with plants propagated by seed and with animals there will be little or no acclimatisation unless the hardier individuals are either intentionally or unconsciously preserved the kidneybean has often been advanced as an instance of a plant which has not become hardier since its first introduction into britain we hear however on excellent authority 2480 messrs hardy and son in gardeners chronicle 1856 page 589 that some very fine seed imported from abroad produced plants which blossomed most profusely but were nearly all but abortive whilst plants grown alongside from english seed podded abundantly and this apparently shows some degree of acclimatisation in our english plants we have also seen that seedlings of the kidneybean occasionally appear with a marked power of resisting frost but no one as far as i can hear has ever separated such hardy seedlings so as to prevent accidental crossing and then gathered their seed and repeated the process year after year it may however be objected with truth that natural selection ought to have had a decided effect on the hardiness of our kidney beans for the tenderest individuals must have been killed during every severe spring and the hardier preserved but it should be borne in mind that the result of increased hardiness would simply be that gardeners who are always anxious for as early a crop as possible would sow their seed a few days earlier than formerly now as the period of sowing depends much on the soil and elevation of each district and varies with the season and as new varieties have often been imported from abroad can we feel sure that our kidneybeans are not somewhat hardier i have not been able by searching old horticultural works to answer this question satisfactorily  on the whole the facts now given show that though habit does something towards acclimatisation yet that the appearance of constitutionally different individuals is a far more effective agent as no single instance has been recorded either with animals or plants of hardier individuals having been long and steadily selected though such selection is admitted to be indispensable for the improvement of any other character it is not surprising that man has done little in the acclimatisation of domesticated animals and cultivated plants we need not however doubt that under nature new races and new species would become adapted to widely different climates by variation aided by habit and regulated by natural selection  arrests of development rudimentary and aborted organs  modifications of structure from arrested development so great or so serious as to deserve to be called monstrosities are not infrequent with domesticated animals but as they differ much from any normal structure they require only a passing notice thus the whole head may be represented by a soft nipplelike projection and the limbs by mere papillae these rudiments of limbs are sometimes inherited as has been observed in a dog 2481 isid geoffroy sainthilaire hist nat des anomalies 1836 tome 2 pages 210 223 224 395 philosoph transact 1775 page 313  many lesser anomalies appear to be due to arrested development what the cause of the arrest may be we seldom know except in the case of direct injury to the embryo that the cause does not generally act at an extremely early embryonic period we may infer from the affected organ seldom being wholly aborteda rudiment being generally preserved the external ears are represented by mere vestiges in a chinese breed of sheep and in another breed the tail is reduced to a little button suffocated in a manner by fat 2482 pallas quoted by youatt on sheep page 25 in tailless dogs and cats a stump is left in certain breeds of fowls the comb and wattles are reduced to rudiments in the cochinchina breed scarcely more than rudiments of spurs exist with polled suffolk cattle rudiments of horns can often be felt at an early age 2483 youatt on cattle 1834 page 174 and with species in a state of nature the relatively great development of rudimentary organs at an early period of life is highly characteristic of such organs with hornless breeds of cattle and sheep another and singular kind of rudiment has been observed namely minute dangling horns attached to the skin alone and which are often shed and grow again with hornless goats according to desmarest 2484 encyclop method 1820 page 483 see page 500 on the indian zebu casting its horns similar cases in european cattle were given in the third chapter the bony protuberance which properly supports the horn exists as a mere rudiment  with cultivated plants it is far from rare to find the petals stamens and pistils represented by rudiments like those observed in natural species so it is with the whole seed in many fruits thus near astrakhan there is a grape with mere traces of seeds so small and lying so near the stalk that they are not perceived in eating the grape 2485 pallas travels english translat volume 1 page 243 in certain varieties of the gourd the tendrils according to naudin are represented by rudiments or by various monstrous growths in the broccoli and cauliflower the greater number of the flowers are incapable of expansion and include rudimentary organs in the feather hyacinth muscari comosum in its natural state the upper and central flowers are brightly coloured but rudimentary under cultivation the tendency to abortion travels downwards and outwards and all the flowers become rudimentary but the abortive stamens and pistils are not so small in the lower as in the upper flowers in the viburnum opulus on the other hand the outer flowers naturally have their organs of fructification in a rudimentary state and the corolla is of large size under cultivation the change spreads to the centre and all the flowers become affected in the compositae the so called doubling of the flowers consists in the greater development of the corolla of the central florets generally accompanied with some degree of sterility and it has been observed 2486 mr beaton in journal of horticulture may 21 1861 page 133 that the progressive doubling invariably spreads from the circumference to the centrethat is from the ray florets which so often include rudimentary organs to those of the disc i may add as bearing on this subject that with asters seeds taken from the florets of the circumference have been found to yield the greatest number of double flowers 2487 lecoq de la fecondation 1862 page 233 in the above cases we have a natural tendency in certain parts to be rudimentary and this under culture spreads either to or from the axis of the plant it deserves notice as showing how the same laws govern the changes which natural species and artificial varieties undergo that in the species of carthamus one of the compositae a tendency to the abortion of the pappus may be traced extending from the circumference to the centre of the disc as in the socalled doubling of the flowers in the members of the same family thus according to a de jussieu 2488 annales du museum tome 6 page 319 the abortion is only partial in carthamus creticus but more extended in c lanatus for in this species only two or three of the central seeds are furnished with a pappus the surrounding seeds being either quite naked or furnished with a few hairs and lastly in c tinctorius even the central seeds are destitute of pappus and the abortion is complete  with animals and plants under domestication when an organ disappears leaving only a rudiment the loss has generally been sudden as with hornless and tailless breeds and such cases may be ranked as inherited monstrosities but in some few cases the loss has been gradual and has been effected partly by selection as with the rudimentary combs and wattles of certain fowls we have also seen that the wings of some domesticated birds have been slightly reduced by disuse and the great reduction of the wings in certain silkmoths with mere rudiments left has probably been aided by disuse  with species in a state of nature rudimentary organs are extremely common such organs are generally variable as several naturalists have observed for being useless they are not regulated by natural selection and they are more or less liable to reversion the same rule certainly holds good with parts which have become rudimentary under domestication we do not know through what steps under nature rudimentary organs have passed in being reduced to their present condition but we so incessantly see in species of the same group the finest gradations between an organ in a rudimentary and perfect state that we are led to believe that the passage must have been extremely gradual it may be doubted whether a change of structure so abrupt as the sudden loss of an organ would ever be of service to a species in a state of nature for the conditions to which all organisms are closely adapted usually change very slowly even if an organ did suddenly disappear in some one individual by an arrest of development intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species would tend to cause its partial reappearance so that its final reduction could only be effected by some other means the most probable view is that a part which is now rudimentary was formerly owing to changed habits of life used less and less being at the same time reduced in size by disuse until at last it became quite useless and superfluous but as most parts or organs are not brought into action during an early period of life disuse or decreased action will not lead to their reduction until the organism arrives at a somewhat advanced age and from the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages the reduction will be transmitted to the offspring at the same advanced stage of growth the part or organ will thus retain its full size in the embryo as we know to be the case with most rudiments as soon as a part becomes useless another principle that of economy of growth will come into play as it would be an advantage to an organism exposed to severe competition to save the development of any useless part and individuals having the part less developed will have a slight advantage over others but as mr mivart has justly remarked as soon as a part is much reduced the saving from its further reduction will be utterly insignificant so that this cannot be effected by natural selection this manifestly holds good if the part be formed of mere cellular tissue entailing little expenditure of nutriment how then can the further reduction of an already somewhat reduced part be effected that this has occurred repeatedly under nature is shown by the many gradations which exist between organs in a perfect state and the merest vestiges of them mr romanes 2489 i suggested in nature volume 8 pages 432 505 that with organisms subjected to unfavourable conditions all the parts would tend towards reduction and that under such circumstances any part which was not kept up to its standard size by natural selection would owing to intercrossing slowly but steadily decrease in three subsequent communications to nature march 12 april 9 and july 2 1874 mr romanes gives his improved view has i think thrown much light on this difficult problem his view as far as it can be given in a few words is as follows all parts are somewhat variable and fluctuate in size round an average point now when a part has already begun from any cause to decrease it is very improbable that the variations should be as great in the direction of increase as of diminution for the previous reduction shows that circumstances have not been favourable for its development whilst there is nothing to check variations in the opposite direction if this be so the long continued crossing of many individuals furnished with an organ which fluctuates in a greater degree towards decrease than towards increase will slowly but steadily lead to its diminution with respect to the complete and absolute abortion of a part a distinct principle which will be discussed in the chapter on pangenesis probably comes into action  with animals and plants reared by man there is no severe or recurrent struggle for existence and the principle of economy will not come into action so that the reduction of an organ will not thus be aided so far indeed is this from being the case that in some few instances organs which are naturally rudimentary in the parentspecies become partially redeveloped in the domesticated descendants thus cows like most other ruminants properly have four active and two rudimentary mamma but in our domesticated animals the latter occasionally become considerably developed and yield milk the atrophied mammae which in male domesticated animals including man have in some rare cases grown to full size and secreted milk perhaps offer an analogous case the hind feet of dogs naturally include rudiments of a fifth toe and in certain large breeds these toes though still rudimentary become considerably developed and are furnished with claws in the common hen the spurs and comb are rudimentary but in certain breeds these become independently of age or disease of the ovaria well developed the stallion has canine teeth but the mare has only traces of the alveoli which as i am informed by the eminent veterinarian mr gt brown frequently contain minute irregular nodules of bone these nodules however sometimes become developed into imperfect teeth protruding through the gums and coated with enamel and occasionally they grow to a fourth or even a third of the length of the canines in the stallion with plants i do not know whether the redevelopment of rudimentary organs occurs more frequently under culture than under nature perhaps the peartree may be a case in point for when wild it bears thorns which consist of branches in a rudimentary condition and serve as a protection but when the tree is cultivated they are reconverted into branches   chapter 2xxv  laws of variation continuedcorrelated variability  explanation of term correlation connected with development modifications correlated with the increased or decreased size of parts correlated variation of homologous parts feathered feet in birds assuming the structure of the wings correlation between the head and the extremities between the skin and dermal appendages between the organs of sight and hearing correlated modifications in the organs of plants correlated monstrosities correlation between the skull and ears skull and crest of feathers skull and horns correlation of growth complicated by the accumulated effects of natural selection colour as correlated with constitutional peculiarities  all parts of the organisation are to a certain extent connected together but the connection may be so slight that it hardly exists as with compound animals or the buds on the same tree even in the higher animals various parts are not at all closely related for one part may be wholly suppressed or rendered monstrous without any other part of the body being affected but in some cases when one part varies certain other parts always or nearly always simultaneously vary they are then subject to the law of correlated variation the whole body is admirably coordinated for the peculiar habits of life of each organic being and may be said as the duke of argyll insists in his reign of law to be correlated for this purpose again in large groups of animals certain structures always coexist for instance a peculiar form of stomach with teeth of peculiar form and such structures may in one sense be said to be correlated but these cases have no necessary connection with the law to be discussed in the present chapter for we do not know that the initial or primary variations of the several parts were in any way related slight modifications or individual differences may have been preserved first in one and then in another part until the final and perfectly coadapted structure was acquired but to this subject i shall presently recur again in many groups of animals the males alone are furnished with weapons or are ornamented with gay colours and these characters manifestly stand in some sort of correlation with the male reproductive organs for when the latter are destroyed these characters disappear but it was shown in the twelfth chapter that the very same peculiarity may become attached at any age to either sex and afterwards be exclusively transmitted to the same sex at a corresponding age in these cases we have inheritance limited by both sex and age but we have no reason for supposing that the original cause of the variation was necessarily connected with the reproductive organs or with the age of the affected being  in cases of true correlated variation we are sometimes able to see the nature of the connection but in most cases it is hidden from us and certainly differs in different cases we can seldom say which of two correlated parts first varies and induces a change in the other or whether the two are the effects of some common cause correlated variation is an important subject for us for when one part is modified through continued selection either by man or under nature other parts of the organisation will be unavoidably modified from this correlation it apparently follows that with our domesticated animals and plants varieties rarely or never differ from one another by a single character alone  one of the simplest cases of correlation is that a modification which arises during an early stage of growth tends to influence the subsequent development of the same part as well as of other and intimately connected parts isidore geoffroy sainthilaire states 251 hist des anomalies tome 3 page 392 prof huxley applies the same principle in accounting for the remarkable though normal differences in the arrangement of the nervous system in the mollusca in his paper on the morphology of the cephalous mollusca in phil transact 1853 page 56 that this may constantly be observed with monstrosities in the animal kingdom and moquintandon 252 elements de teratologie veg 1841 page 13 remarks that as with plants the axis cannot become monstrous without in some way affecting the organs subsequently produced from it so axial anomalies are almost always accompanied by deviations of structure in the appended parts we shall presently see that with shortmuzzled races of the dog certain histological changes in the basal elements of the bones arrest their development and shorten them and this affects the position of the subsequently developed molar teeth it is probable that certain modifications in the larvae of insects would affect the structure of the mature insects but we must be careful not to extend this view too far for during the normal course of development certain species pass through an extraordinary course of change whilst other and closely allied species arrive at maturity with little change of structure  another simple case of correlation is that with the increased or decreased dimensions of the whole body or of any particular part certain organs are increased or diminished in number or are otherwise modified thus pigeon fanciers have gone on selecting pouters for length of body and we have seen that their vertebrae are generally increased not only in size but in number and their ribs in breadth tumblers have been selected for their small bodies and their ribs and primary wingfeathers are generally lessened in number fantails have been selected for their large widelyexpanded tails with numerous tailfeathers and the caudal vertebrae are increased in size and number carriers have been selected for length of beak and their tongues have become longer but not in strict accordance with the length of beak in this latter breed and in others having large feet the number of the scutellae on the toes is greater than in the breeds with small feet many similar cases could be given in germany it has been observed that the period of gestation is longer in large than in small breeds of cattle with our highlyimproved breeds of all kinds the periods of maturity and of reproduction have advanced with respect to the age of the animal and in correspondence with this the teeth are now developed earlier than formerly so that to the surprise of agriculturists the ancient rules for judging of the age of an animal by the state of its teeth are no longer trustworthy 253 prof jb simonds on the age of the ox sheep etc quoted in gardeners chronicle 1854 page 588  correlated variation of homologous parts  parts which are homologous tend to vary in the same manner and this is what might have been expected for such parts are identical in form and structure during an early period of embryonic development and are exposed in the egg or womb to similar conditions the symmetry in most kinds of animals of the corresponding or homologous organs on the right and left sides of the body is the simplest case in point but this symmetry sometimes fails as with rabbits having only one ear or stags with one horn or with manyhorned sheep which sometimes carry an additional horn on one side of their heads with flowers which have regular corollas all the petals generally vary in the same manner as we see in the complicated and symmetrical pattern on the flowers for instance of the chinese pink but with irregular flowers though the petals are of course homologous this symmetry often fails as with the varieties of the antirrhinum or snapdragon or that variety of the kidneybean phaseolus which has a white standardpetal  in the vertebrata the front and hind limbs are homologous and they tend to vary in the same manner as we see in long and short legged or in thick and thin legged races of the horse and dog isidore geoffroy 254 hist des anomalies tome 1 page 674 has remarked on the tendency of supernumerary digits in man to appear not only on the right and left sides but on the upper and lower extremities meckel has insisted 255 quoted by isid geoffroy ibid tome 1 page 635 that when the muscles of the arm depart in number or arrangement from their proper type they almost always imitate those of the leg and so conversely the varying muscles of the leg imitate the normal muscles of the arm  in several distinct breeds of the pigeon and fowl the legs and the two outer toes are heavily feathered so that in the trumpeter pigeon they appear like little wings in the featherlegged bantam the boots or feathers which grow from the outside of the leg and generally from the two outer toes have according to the excellent authority of mr hewitt 256 the poultry book by wb tegetmeier 1866 page 250 been seen to exceed the wingfeathers in length and in one case were actually nine and a half inches long as mr blyth has remarked to me these legfeathers resemble the primary wing feathers and are totally unlike the fine down which naturally grows on the legs of some birds such as grouse and owls hence it may be suspected that excess of food has first given redundancy to the plumage and then that the law of homologous variation has led to the development of feathers on the legs in a position corresponding with those on the wing namely on the outside of the tarsi and toes i am strengthened in this belief by the following curious case of correlation which for a long time seemed to me utterly inexplicable namely that in pigeons of any breed if the legs are feathered the two outer toes are partially connected by skin these two outer toes correspond with our third and fourth toes 257 naturalists differ with respect to the homologies of the digits of birds but several uphold the view above advanced see on this subject dr es morse in annals of the lyceum of nat hist of new york volume 10 1872 page 16 now in the wing of the pigeon or of any other bird the first and fifth digits are aborted the second is rudimentary and carries the socalled bastardwing whilst the third and fourth digits are completely united and enclosed by skin together forming the extremity of the wing so that in featherfooted pigeons not only does the exterior surface support a row of long feathers like wingfeathers but the very same digits which in the wing are completely united by skin become partially united by skin in the feet and thus by the law of the correlated variation of homologous parts we can understand the curious connection of feathered legs and membrane between the two outer toes  andrew knight 248 a walker on intermarriage 1838 page 160 has remarked that the face or head and the limbs usually vary together in general proportions compare for instance the limbs of a dray and race horse or of a greyhound and mastiff what a monster a greyhound would appear with the head of a mastiff the modern bulldog however has fine limbs but this is a recentlyselected character from the measurements given in the sixth chapter we see that in several breeds of the pigeon the length of the beak and the size of the feet are correlated the view which as before explained seems the most probable is that disuse in all cases tends to diminish the feet the beak becoming at the same time shorter through correlation but that in some few breeds in which length of beak has been a selected point the feet notwithstanding disuse have increased in size through correlation in the following case some kind of correlation is seen to exist between the feet and beak several specimens have been sent to mr bartlett at different times as hybrids between ducks and fowls and i have seen one these were as might be expected ordinary ducks in a semimonstrous condition and in all of them the swimmingweb between the toes was quite deficient or much reduced and in all the beak was narrow and illshaped  with the increased length of the beak in pigeons not only the tongue increases in length but likewise the orifice of the nostrils but the increased length of the orifice of the nostrils perhaps stands in closer correlation with the development of the corrugated skin or wattle at the base of the beak for when there is much wattle round the eyes the eyelids are greatly increased or even doubled in length  there is apparently some correlation even in colour between the head and the extremities thus with horses a large white star or blaze on the forehead is generally accompanied by white feet 259 the farrier and naturalist volume 1 1828 page 456 a gentleman who has attended to this point tells me that about threefourths of whitefaced horses have white legs with white rabbits and cattle dark marks often coexist on the tips of the ears and on the feet in black and tan dogs of different breeds tancoloured spots over the eyes and tancoloured feet almost invariably go together these latter cases of connected colouring may be due either to reversion or to analogous variationsubjects to which i shall hereafter returnbut this does not necessarily determine the question of their original correlation mr hw jackson informs me that he has observed many hundred whitefooted cats and he finds that all are more or less conspicuously marked with white on the front of the neck or chest  the lopping forwards and downwards of the immense ears of fancy rabbits seems partly due to the disuse of the muscles and partly to the weight and length of the ears which have been increased by selection during many generations now with the increased size and changed direction of the ears not only has the bony auditory meatus become changed in outline direction and greatly in size but the whole skull has been slightly modified this could be clearly seen in halflopsthat is in rabbits with only one ear lopping forward for the opposite sides of their skulls were not strictly symmetrical this seems to me a curious instance of correlation between hard bones and organs so soft and flexible as well as so unimportant under a physiological point of view as the external ears the result no doubt is largely due to mere mechanical action that is to the weight of the ears on the same principle that the skull of a human infant is easily modified by pressure  the skin and the appendages of hair feathers hoofs horns and teeth are homologous over the whole body every one knows that the colour of the skin and that of the hair usually vary together so that virgil advises the shepherd to look whether the mouth and tongue of the ram are black lest the lambs should not be purely white the colour of the skin and hair and the odour emitted by the glands of the skin are said 2510 godron sur lespece tome 2 page 217 to be connected even in the same race of men generally the hair varies in the same way all over the body in length fineness and curliness the same rule holds good with feathers as we see with the laced and frizzled breeds both of fowls and pigeons in the common cock the feathers on the neck and loins are always of a particular shape called hackles now in the polish breed both sexes are characterised by a tuft of feathers on the head and through correlation these feathers in the male always assume the form of hackles the wing and tailfeathers though arising from parts not homologous vary in length together so that long or short winged pigeons generally have long or short tails the case of the jacobinpigeon is more curious for the wing and tail feathers are remarkably long and this apparently has arisen in correlation with the elongated and reversed feathers on the back of the neck which form the hood  the hoofs and hair are homologous appendages and a careful observer namely azara 2511 quadrupedes du paraguay tome 2 page 333 states that in paraguay horses of various colours are often born with their hair curled and twisted like that on the head of a negro this peculiarity is strongly inherited but what is remarkable is that the hoofs of these horses are absolutely like those of a mule the hair also of their manes and tails is invariably much shorter than usual being only from four to twelve inches in length so that curliness and shortness of the hair are here as with the negro apparently correlated  with respect to the horns of sheep youatt 2512 on sheep page 142 remarks that multiplicity of horns is not found in any breed of much value it is generally accompanied by great length and coarseness of the fleece several tropical breeds of sheep which are clothed with hair instead of wool have horns almost like those of a goat sturm 2513 ueber racen kreuzungen etc 1825 s 24 expressly declares that in different races the more the wool is curled the more the horns are spirally twisted we have seen in the third chapter where other analogous facts have been given that the parent of the mauchamp breed so famous for its fleece had peculiarly shaped horns the inhabitants of angora assert 2514 quoted from conolly in the indian field february 1859 volume 2 page 266 that only the white goats which have horns wear the fleece in the long curly locks that are so much admired those which are not horned having a comparatively close coat from these cases we may infer that the hair or wool and the horns tend to vary in a correlated manner 2515 in the third chapter i have said that the hair and horns are so closely related to each other that they are apt to vary together dr wilckens darwins theorie jahrbuch der deutschen viehzucht 1866 1 heft translates my words into lang und grobhaarige thiere sollen geneigter sein lange und viele horner zu bekommen and he then justly disputes this proposition but what i have really said in accordance with the authorities just quoted may i think be trusted those who have tried hydropathy are aware that the frequent application of cold water stimulates the skin and whatever stimulates the skin tends to increase the growth of the hair as is well shown in the abnormal growth of hair near old inflamed surfaces now professor low 2516 domesticated animals of the british islands pages 307 368 dr wilckens argues landwirth wochenblatt nr 10 1869 to the same effect with respect to domestic animals in germany is convinced that with the different races of british cattle thick skin and long hair depend on the humidity of the climate which they inhabit we can thus see how a humid climate might act on the hornsin the first place directly on the skin and hair and secondly by correlation on the horns the presence or absence of horns moreover both in the case of sheep and cattle acts as will presently be shown by some sort of correlation on the skull  with respect to hair and teeth mr yarrell 2517 proceedings zoolog soc 1833 page 113 found many of the teeth deficient in three hairless egyptian dogs and in a hairless terrier the incisors canines and the premolars suffered most but in one case all the teeth except the large tubercular molar on each side were deficient with man several striking cases have been recorded 2518 sedgwick brit and foreign medicochirurg review april 1863 page 453 of inherited baldness with inherited deficiency either complete or partial of the teeth i may give an analogous case communicated to me by mr w wedderburn of a hindoo family in scinde in which ten men in the course of four generations were furnished in both jaws taken together with only four small and weak incisor teeth and with eight posterior molars the men thus affected have very little hair on the body and become bald early in life they also suffer much during hot weather from excessive dryness of the skin it is remarkable that no instance has occurred of a daughter being thus affected and this fact reminds us how much more liable men are in england to become bald than women though the daughters in the above family are never affected they transmit the tendency to their sons and no case has occurred of a son transmitting it to his sons the affection thus appears only in alternate generations or after longer intervals there is a similar connection between hair and teeth according to mr sedgwick in those rare cases in which the hair has been renewed in old age for this has usually been accompanied by a renewal of the teeth i have remarked in a former part of this volume that the great reduction in the size of the tusks in domestic boars probably stands in close relation with their diminished bristles due to a certain amount of protection and that the reappearance of the tusks in boars which have become feral and are fully exposed to the weather probably depends on the reappearance of the bristles i may add though not strictly connected with our present point that an agriculturist 2519 gardeners chronicle 1849 page 205 asserts that pigs with little hair on their bodies are most liable to lose their tails showing a weakness of the tegumental structure it may be prevented by crossing with a more hairy breed  in the previous cases deficient hair and teeth deficient in number or size are apparently connected in the following cases abnormally redundant hair and teeth either deficient or redundant are likewise connected mr crawfurd 2520 embassy to the court of ava volume 1 page 320 saw at the burmese court a man thirty years old with his whole body except the hands and feet covered with straight silky hair which on the shoulders and spine was five inches in length at birth the ears alone were covered he did not arrive at puberty or shed his milk teeth until twenty years old and at this period he acquired five teeth in the upper jaw namely four incisors and one canine and four incisor teeth in the lower jaw all the teeth were small this man had a daughter who was born with hair within her ears and the hair soon extended over her body when captain yule 2521 narrative of a mission to the court of ava in 1855 page 94 visited the court he found this girl grown up and she presented a strange appearance with even her nose densely covered with soft hair like her father she was furnished with incisor teeth alone the king had with difficulty bribed a man to marry her and of her two children one a boy fourteen months old had hair growing out of his ears with a beard and moustache this strange peculiarity has therefore been inherited for three generations with the molar teeth deficient in the grandfather and mother whether these teeth would likewise fail in the infant could not then be told  a parallel case of a man fiftyfive years old and of his son with their faces covered with hair has recently occurred in russia dr alex brandt has sent me an account of this case together with specimens of the extremely fine hair from the cheeks the man is deficient in teeth possessing only four incisors in the lower and two in the upper jaw his son about three years old has no teeth except four lower incisors the case as dr brandt remarks in his letter no doubt is due to an arrest of development in the hair and teeth we here see how independent of the ordinary conditions of existence such arrests must be for the lives of a russian peasant and of a native of burmah are as different as possible 2522 i owe to the kindness of m chauman of st petersburg excellent photographs of this man and his son both of whom have since been exhibited in paris and london  here is another and somewhat different case communicated to me by mr wallace on the authority of dr purland a dentist julia pastrana a spanish dancer was a remarkably fine woman but she had a thick masculine beard and a hairy forehead she was photographed and her stuffed skin was exhibited as a show but what concerns us is that she had in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth one row being placed within the other of which dr purland took a cast from the redundancy of teeth her mouth projected and her face had a gorillalike appearance these cases and those of the hairless dogs forcibly call to mind the fact that the two orders of mammalsnamely the edentata and cetaceawhich are the most abnormal in their dermal covering are likewise the most abnormal either by deficiency or redundancy of teeth  the organs of sight and hearing are generally admitted to be homologous with one another and with various dermal appendages hence these parts are liable to be abnormally affected in conjunction mr white cowper says that in all cases of double microphthalmia brought under his notice he has at the same time met with defective development of the dental system certain forms of blindness seem to be associated with the colour of the hair a man with black hair and a woman with lightcoloured hair both of sound constitution married and had nine children all of whom were born blind of these children five with dark hair and brown iris were afflicted with amaurosis the four others with lightcoloured hair and blue iris had amaurosis and cataract conjoined several cases could be given showing that some relation exists between various affections of the eyes and ears thus liebreich states that out of 241 deafmutes in berlin no less than fourteen suffered from the rare disease called pigmentary retinitis mr white cowper and dr earle have remarked that inability to distinguish different colours or colourblindness is often associated with a corresponding inability to distinguish musical sounds 2523 these statements are taken from mr sedgwick in the medicochirurg review july 1861 page 198 april 1863 pages 455 and 458 liebreich is quoted by professor devay in his mariages consanguins 1862 page 116  here is a more curious case white cats if they have blue eyes are almost always deaf i formerly thought that the rule was invariable but i have heard of a few authentic exceptions the first two notices were published in 1829 and relate to english and persian cats of the latter the rev wt bree possessed a female and he states that of the offspring produced at one and the same birth such as like the mother were entirely white with blue eyes were like her invariably deaf while those that had the least speck of colour on their fur as invariably possessed the usual faculty of hearing 2524 loudons mag of nat hist volume 1 1829 pages 66 178 see also dr p lucas lhered nat tome 1 page 428 on the inheritance of deafness in cats mr lawson tait states nature 1873 page 323 that only male cats are thus affected but this must be a hasty generalisation the first case recorded in england by mr bree related to a female and mr fox informs me that he has bred kittens from a white female with blue eyes which was completely deaf he has also observed other females in the same condition the rev w darwin fox informs me that he has seen more than a dozen instances of this correlation in english persian and danish cats but he adds that if one eye as i have several times observed be not blue the cat hears on the other hand i have never seen a white cat with eyes of the common colour that was deaf in france dr sichel 2525 annales des sc nat zoolog 3rd series 1847 tome 8 page 239 has observed during twenty years similar facts he adds the remarkable case of the iris beginning at the end of four months to grow darkcoloured and then the cat first began to hear  this case of correlation in cats has struck many persons as marvellous there is nothing unusual in the relation between blue eyes and white fur and we have already seen that the organs of sight and hearing are often simultaneously affected in the present instance the cause probably lies in a slight arrest of development in the nervous system in connection with the senseorgans kittens during the first nine days whilst their eyes are closed appear to be completely deaf i have made a great clanging noise with a poker and shovel close to their heads both when they were asleep and awake without producing any effect the trial must not be made by shouting close to their ears for they are even when asleep extremely sensitive to a breath of air now as long as the eyes continue closed the iris is no doubt blue for in all the kittens which i have seen this colour remains for some time after the eyelids open hence if we suppose the development of the organs of sight and hearing to be arrested at the stage of the closed eyelids the eyes would remain permanently blue and the ears would be incapable of perceiving sound and we should thus understand this curious case as however the colour of the fur is determined long before birth and as the blueness of the eyes and the whiteness of the fur are obviously connected we must believe that some primary cause acts at a much earlier period  the instances of correlated variability hitherto given have been chiefly drawn from the animal kingdom and we will now turn to plants leaves sepals petals stamens and pistils are all homologous in double flowers we see that the stamens and pistils vary in the same manner and assume the form and colour of the petals in the double columbine aquilegia vulgaris the successive whorls of stamens are converted into cornucopias which are enclosed within one another and resemble the true petals in hoseinhose flowers the sepals mock the petals in some cases the flowers and leaves vary together in tint in all the varieties of the common pea which have purple flowers a purple mark may be seen on the stipules  m faivre states that with the varieties of primula sinensis the colour of the flower is evidently correlated with the colour of the under side of the leaves and he adds that the varieties with fimbriated flowers almost always have voluminous balloonlike calyces 2526 revue des cours scientifiques june 5 1869 page 430 with other plants the leaves and fruit or seeds vary together in colour as in a curious paleleaved variety of the sycamore which has recently been described in france 2527 gardeners chronicle 1864 page 1202 and as in the purpleleaved hazel in which the leaves the husk of the nut and the pellicle round the kernel are all coloured purple 2528 verlot gives several other instances des varietes 1865 page 72 pomologists can predict to a certain extent from the size and appearance of the leaves of their seedlings the probable nature of the fruit for as van mons remarks 2529 arbres fruitiers 1836 tome 2 pages 204 226 variations in the leaves are generally accompanied by some modification in the flower and consequently in the fruit in the serpent melon which has a narrow tortuous fruit above a yard in length the stem of the plant the peduncle of the female flower and the middle lobe of the leaf are all elongated in a remarkable manner on the other hand several varieties of cucurbita which have dwarfed stems all produce as naudin remarks leaves of the same peculiar shape mr g maw informs me that all the varieties of the scarlet pelargoniums which have contracted or imperfect leaves have contracted flowers the difference between brilliant and its parent tom thumb is a good instance of this it may be suspected that the curious case described by risso 2530 annales du museum tome 20 page 188 of a variety of the orange which produces on the young shoots rounded leaves with winged petioles and afterwards elongated leaves on long but wingless petioles is connected with the remarkable change in form and nature which the fruit undergoes during its development  in the following instance we have the colour and the form of the petals apparently correlated and both dependent on the nature of the season an observer skilled in the subject writes 2531 gardeners chronicle 1843 page 877 i noticed during the year 1842 that every dahlia of which the colour had any tendency to scarlet was deeply notchedindeed to so great an extent as to give the petals the appearance of a saw the indentures were in some instances more than a quarter of an inch deep again dahlias which have their petals tipped with a different colour from the rest of the flower are very inconstant and during certain years some or even all the flowers become uniformly coloured and it has been observed with several varieties 2532 ibid 1845 page 102 that when this happens the petals grow much elongated and lose their proper shape this however may be due to reversion both in colour and form to the aboriginal species  in this discussion on correlation we have hitherto treated of cases in which we can partly understand the bond of connection but i will now give cases in which we cannot even conjecture or can only very obscurely see the nature of the bond isidore geoffroy sainthilaire in his work on monstrosities insists 2533 hist des anomalies tome 3 page 402 see also m camille dareste recherches sur les conditions etc 1863 pages 16 48 que certaines anomalies coexistent rarement entrelles dautres frequemment dautres enfin presque constamment malgre la difference tresgrande de leur nature et quoiquelles puissent paraitre completement independantes les unes des autres we see something analogous in certain diseases thus in a rare affection of the renal capsules of which the functions are unknown the skin becomes bronzed and in hereditary syphilis as i hear from sir j paget both the milk and the second teeth assume a peculiar and characteristic form professor rolleston also informs me that the incisor teeth are sometimes furnished with a vascular rim in correlation with intrapulmonary deposition of tubercles in other cases of phthisis and of cyanosis the nails and finger ends become clubbed like acorns i believe that no explanation has been offered of these and of many other cases of correlated disease  what can be more curious and less intelligible than the fact previously given on the authority of mr tegetmeier that young pigeons of all breeds which when mature have white yellow silverblue or duncoloured plumage come out of the egg almost naked whereas pigeons of other colours when first born are clothed with plenty of down white peafowls as has been observed both in england and france 2534 rev es dixon ornamental poultry 1848 page 111 isidore geoffroy hist anomalies tome 1 page 211 and as i have myself seen are inferior in size to the common coloured kind and this cannot be accounted for by the belief that albinism is always accompanied by constitutional weakness for white or albino moles are generally larger than the common kind  to turn to more important characters the niata cattle of the pampas are remarkable from their short foreheads upturned muzzles and curved lower jaws in the skull the nasal and premaxillary bones are much shortened the maxillaries are excluded from any junction with the nasals and all the bones are slightly modified even to the plane of the occiput from the analogous case of the dog hereafter to be given it is probable that the shortening of the nasal and adjoining bones is the proximate cause of the other modifications in the skull including the upward curvature of the lower jaw though we cannot follow out the steps by which these changes have been effected  polish fowls have a large tuft of feathers on their heads and their skulls are perforated by numerous holes so that a pin can be driven into the brain without touching any bone that this deficiency of bone is in some way connected with the tuft of feathers is clear from tufted ducks and geese likewise having perforated skulls the case would probably be considered by some authors as one of balancement or compensation in the chapter on fowls i have shown that with polish fowls the tuft of feathers was probably at first small by continued selection it became larger and then rested on a fibrous mass and finally as it became still larger the skull itself became more and more protuberant until it acquired its present extraordinary structure through correlation with the protuberance of the skull the shape and even the relative connection of the premaxillary and nasal bones the shape of the orifice of the nostrils the breadth of the frontal bone the shape of the postlateral processes of the frontal and squamosal bones and the direction of the bony cavity of the ear have all been modified the internal configuration of the skull and the whole shape of the brain have likewise been altered in a truly marvellous manner  after this case of the polish fowl it would be superfluous to do more than refer to the details previously given on the manner in which the changed form of the comb has affected the skull in various breeds of the fowl causing by correlation crests protuberances and depressions on its surface  with our cattle and sheep the horns stand in close connection with the size of the skull and with the shape of the frontal bones thus cline 2535 on the breeding of domestic animals 1829 page 6 found that the skull of a horned ram weighed five times as much as that of a hornless ram of the same age when cattle become hornless the frontal bones are materially diminished in breadth towards the poll and the cavities between the bony plates are not so deep nor do they extend beyond the frontals 2536 youatt on cattle 1834 page 283  it may be well here to pause and observe how the effects of correlated variability of the increased use of parts and of the accumulation of so called spontaneous variations through natural selection are in many cases inextricably commingled we may borrow an illustration from mr herbert spencer who remarks that when the irish elk acquired its gigantic horns weighing above one hundred pounds numerous coordinated changes of structure would have been indispensablenamely a thickened skull to carry the horns strengthened cervical vertebrae with strengthened ligaments enlarged dorsal vertebrae to support the neck with powerful forelegs and feet all these parts being supplied with proper muscles bloodvessels and nerves how then could these admirably coordinated modifications of structure have been acquired according to the doctrine which i maintain the horns of the male elk were slowly gained through sexual selectionthat is by the bestarmed males conquering the worsearmed and leaving a greater number of descendants but it is not at all necessary that the several parts of the body should have simultaneously varied each stag presents individual characteristics and in the same district those which had slightly heavier horns or stronger necks or stronger bodies or were the most courageous would secure the greater number of does and consequently have a greater number of offspring the offspring would inherit in a greater or less degree these same qualities would occasionally intercross with one another or with other individuals varying in some favourable manner and of their offspring those which were the best endowed in any respect would continue multiplying and so onwards always progressing sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another towards the excellently coordinated structure of the male elk to make this clear let us reflect on the probable steps as shown in the twentieth chapter by which our race and dray horses have arrived at their present state of excellence if we could view the whole series of intermediate forms between one of these animals and an early unimproved progenitor we should behold a vast number of animals not equally improved in each generation throughout their entire structure but sometimes a little more in one point and sometimes in another yet on the whole gradually approaching in character to our present race or dray horses which are so admirably fitted in the one case for fleetness and in the other for draught  although natural selection would thus 2537 mr herbert spencer principles of biology 1864 volume 1 pages 452 468 takes a different view and in one place remarks we have seen reason to think that as fast as essential faculties multiply and as fast as the number of organs that cooperate in any given function increases indirect equilibration through natural selection becomes less and less capable of producing specific adaptations and remains fully capable only of maintaining the general fitness of constitution to conditions this view that natural selection can do little in modifying the higher animals surprises me seeing that mans selection has undoubtedly effected much with our domesticated quadrupeds and birds tend to give to the male elk its present structure yet it is probable that the inherited effects of use and of the mutual action of part on part have been equally or more important as the horns gradually increased in weight the muscles of the neck with the bones to which they are attached would increase in size and strength and these parts would react on the body and legs nor must we overlook the fact that certain parts of the skull and the extremities would judging by analogy tend from the first to vary in a correlated manner the increased weight of the horns would also act directly on the skull in the same manner as when one bone is removed in the leg of a dog the other bone which has to carry the whole weight of the body increases in thickness but from the fact given with respect to horned and hornless cattle it is probable that the horns and skull would immediately act on each other through the principle of correlation lastly the growth and subsequent wear and tear of the augmented muscles and bones would require an increased supply of blood and consequently increased supply of food and this again would require increased powers of mastication digestion respiration and excretion  colour as correlated with constitutional peculiarities  it is an old belief that with man there is a connection between complexions and constitution and i find that some of the best authorities believe in this to the present day 2538 dr prosper lucas apparently disbelieves in any such connection lhered nat tome 2 pages 8894 thus dr beddoe by his tables shows 2539 british medical journal 1862 page 433 that a relation exists between liability to consumption and the colour of the hair eyes and skin it has been affirmed 2540 boudin geograph medicale tome 1 page 406 that in the french army which invaded russia soldiers having a dark complexion from the southern parts of europe withstood the intense cold better than those with lighter complexions from the north but no doubt such statements are liable to error  in the second chapter on selection i have given several cases proving that with animals and plants differences in colour are correlated with constitutional differences as shown by greater or less immunity from certain diseases from the attacks of parasitic plants and animals from scorching by the sun and from the action of certain poisons when all the individuals of any one variety possess an immunity of this nature we do not know that it stands in any sort of correlation with their colour but when several similarly coloured varieties of the same species are thus characterised whilst other coloured varieties are not thus favoured we must believe in the existence of a correlation of this kind thus in the united states purple fruited plums of many kinds are far more affected by a certain disease than green or yellowfruited varieties on the other hand yellowfleshed peaches of various kinds suffer from another disease much more than the whitefleshed varieties in the mauritius red sugarcanes are much less affected by a particular disease than the white canes white onions and verbenas are the most liable to mildew and in spain the greenfruited grapes suffered from the vinedisease more than other coloured varieties darkcoloured pelargoniums and verbenas are more scorched by the sun than varieties of other colours red wheats are believed to be hardier than white and redflowered hyacinths were more injured during one particular winter in holland than other coloured varieties with animals white terriers suffer most from the distemper white chickens from a parasitic worm in their tracheae white pigs from scorching by the sun and white cattle from flies but the caterpillars of the silkmoth which yield white cocoons suffered in france less from the deadly parasitic fungus than those producing yellow silk  the cases of immunity from the action of certain vegetable poisons in connexion with colour are more interesting and are at present wholly inexplicable i have already given a remarkable instance on the authority of professor wyman of all the hogs excepting those of a black colour suffering severely in virginia from eating the root of the lachnanthes tinctoria according to spinola and others 2541 this fact and the following cases when not stated to the contrary are taken from a very curious paper by prof heusinger in wochenschrift fur heilkunde may 1846 s 277 settegast die thierzucht 1868 page 39 says that white or whitespotted sheep suffer like pigs or even die from eating buckwheat whilst black or darkwoolled individuals are not in the least affected buckwheat po1ygonum fagopyrum when in flower is highly injurious to white or whitespotted pigs if they are exposed to the heat of the sun but is quite innocuous to black pigs according to two accounts the hypericum crispum in sicily is poisonous to white sheep alone their heads swell their wool falls off and they often die but this plant according to lecce is poisonous only when it grows in swamps nor is this improbable as we know how readily the poisonous principle in plants is influenced by the conditions under which they grow  three accounts have been published in eastern prussia of white and white spotted horses being greatly injured by eating mildewed and honeydewed vetches every spot of skin bearing white hairs becoming inflamed and gangrenous the rev j rodwell informs me that his father turned out about fifteen carthorses into a field of tares which in parts swarmed with black aphides and which no doubt were honeydewed and probably mildewed the horses with two exceptions were chestnuts and bays with white marks on their faces and pasterns and the white parts alone swelled and became angry scabs the two bay horses with no white marks entirely escaped all injury in guernsey when horses eat fools parsley aethusa cynapium they are sometimes violently purged and this plant has a peculiar effect on the nose and lips causing deep cracks and ulcers particularly on horses with white muzzles 2542 mr mogford in the veterinarian quoted in the field january 22 1861 page 545 with cattle independently of the action of any poison cases have been published by youatt and erdt of cutaneous diseases with much constitutional disturbance in one instance after exposure to a hot sun affecting every single point which bore a white hair but completely passing over other parts of the body similar cases have been observed with horses 2543 edinburgh veterinary journal october 1860 page 347  we thus see that not only do those parts of the skin which bear white hair differ in a remarkable manner from those bearing hair of any other colour but that some great constitutional difference must be correlated with the colour of the hair for in the abovementioned cases vegetable poisons caused fever swelling of the head as well as other symptoms and even death to all the white or whitespotted animals   chapter 2xxvi  laws of variation continuedsummary  the fusion of homologous parts the variability of multiple and homologous parts compensation of growth mechanical pressure relative position of flowers with respect to the axis and of seeds in the ovary as inducing variation analogous or parallel varieties summary of the three last chapters  the fusion of homologous parts  geoffroy sainthilaire formerly propounded what he called la loi de laffinite de soi pour soi which has been discussed and illustrated by his son isidore with respect to monsters in the animal kingdom 261 hist des anomalies 1832 tome 1 pages 22 537556 tome 3 page 462 and by moquintandon with respect to monstrous plants  this law seems to imply that homologous parts actually attract one another and then unite no doubt there are many wonderful cases in which such parts become intimately fused together this is perhaps best seen in monsters with two heads which are united summit to summit or face to face or januslike back to back or obliquely side to side in one instance of two heads united almost face to face but a little obliquely four ears were developed and on one side a perfect face which was manifestly formed by the fusion of two halffaces whenever two bodies or two heads are united each bone muscle vessel and nerve on the line of junction appears as if it had sought out its fellow and had become completely fused with it lereboullet 262 comptes rendus 1855 pages 855 1039 who carefully studied the development of double monsters in fishes observed in fifteen instances the steps by which two heads gradually became united into one in all such cases it is now thought by the greater number of capable judges that the homologous parts do not attract each other but that in the words of mr lowne 263 catalogue of the teratological series in the museum of the r coll of surgeons 1872 page 16 as union takes place before the differentiation of distinct organs occurs these are formed in continuity with each other he adds that organs already differentiated probably in no case become united to homologous ones m dareste does not speak 264 archives de zoolog exper january 1874 page 78 quite decisively against the law of soi pour soi but concludes by saying on se rend parfaitement compte de la formation des monstres si lon admet que les embryons qui se soudent appartiennent a un meme oeuf quils sunissent en meme temps quils se forment et que la soudure ne se produit que pendant la premiere periode de la vie embryonnaire celle ou les organes ne sont encore constitues que par des blastemes homogenes  by whatever means the abnormal fusion of homologous parts is effected such cases throw light on the frequent presence of organs which are double during an embryonic period and throughout life in other and lower members of the same class but which afterwards unite by a normal process into a single medial organ in the vegetable kingdom moquintandon 265 teratologie veg 1841 livre 3 gives a long list of cases showing how frequently homologous parts such as leaves petals stamens and pistils flowers and aggregates of homologous parts such as buds as well as fruit become blended both normally and abnormally with perfect symmetry into one another  the variability of multiple and homologous parts  isidore geoffroy 266 hist des anomalies tome 3 pages 4 5 6 insists that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the same animal it is particularly liable to vary both in number and structure with respect to number the proposition may i think be considered as fully established but the evidence is chiefly derived from organic beings living under their natural conditions with which we are not here concerned whenever such parts as the vertebrae or teeth the rays in the fins of fishes or the feathers in the tails of birds or petals stamens pistils or seeds are very numerous the number is generally variable with respect to the structure of multiple parts the evidence of variability is not so decisive but the fact as far as it may be trusted probably depends on multiple parts being of less physiological importance than single parts consequently their structure has been less rigorously guarded by natural selection  compensation of growth or balancement  this law as applied to natural species was propounded by goethe and geoffroy sainthilaire at nearly the same time it implies that when much organised matter is used in building up some one part other parts are starved and become reduced several authors especially botanists believe in this law others reject it as far as i can judge it occasionally holds good but its importance has probably been exaggerated it is scarcely possible to distinguish between the supposed effects of such compensation and the effects of longcontinued selection which may lead to the augmentation of one part and simultaneously to the diminution of another anyhow there can be no doubt that an organ may be greatly increased without any corresponding diminution of an adjoining part to recur to our former illustration of the irish elk it may be asked what part has suffered in consequence of the immense development of the horns  it has already been observed that the struggle for existence does not bear hard on our domesticated productions and consequently the principle of economy of growth will seldom come into play so that we ought not to expect to find with them frequent evidence of compensation we have however some such cases moquintandon describes a monstrous bean 267 teratologie veg page 156 see also my book on the movements and habits of climbing plants 2nd edition 1875 page 202 in which the stipules were enormously developed and the leaflets apparently in consequence completely aborted this case is interesting as it represents the natural condition of lathyrus aphaca with its stipules of great size and its leaves reduced to mere threads which act as tendrils de candolle 268 memoires du museum etc tome 8 page 178 has remarked that the varieties of raphanus sativus which have small roots yield numerous seed containing much oil whilst those with large roots are not productive in oil and so it is with brassica asperifolia the varieties of cucurbita pepo which bear large fruit yield a small crop according to naudin whilst those producing small fruit yield a vast number lastly i have endeavoured to show in the eighteenth chapter that with many cultivated plants unnatural treatment checks the full and proper action of the reproductive organs and they are thus rendered more or less sterile consequently in the way of compensation the fruit becomes greatly enlarged and in double flowers the petals are greatly increased in number  with animals it has been found difficult to produce cows which yield much milk and are afterwards capable of fattening well with fowls which have large topknots and beards the comb and wattles are generally much reduced in size though there are exceptions to this rule perhaps the entire absence of the oilgland in fantail pigeons may be connected with the great development of their tails  mechanical pressure as a cause of modifications  in some few cases there is reason to believe that mere mechanical pressure has affected certain structures vrolik and weber 269 prichard phys hist of mankind 1851 volume 1 page 324 maintain that the shape of the human head is influenced by the shape of the mothers pelvis the kidneys in different birds differ much in form and st ange 2610 annales des sc nat 1st series tome 19 page 327 believes that this is determined by the form of the pelvis which again no doubt stands in close relation with their power of locomotion in snakes the viscera are curiously displaced in comparison with their position in other vertebrates and this has been attributed by some authors to the elongation of their bodies but here as in so many previous cases it is impossible to disentangle a direct result of this kind from that consequent on natural selection godron has argued 2611 comptes rendus december 1864 page 1039 that the abortion of the spur on the inner side of the flowers in corydalis is caused by the buds at a very early period of growth whilst underground being closely pressed against one another and against the stem some botanists believe that the singular difference in the shape both of the seed and corolla in the interior and exterior florets in certain compositous and umbelliferous plants is due to the pressure to which the inner florets are subjected but this conclusion is doubtful  the facts just given do not relate to domesticated productions and therefore do not strictly concern us but here is a more appropriate case h muller 2612 ueber fotale rachites wurzburger medicin zeitschrift 1860 b 1 s 265 has shown that in shortfaced races of the dog some of the molar teeth are placed in a slightly different position to that which they occupy in other dogs especially in those having elongated muzzles and as he remarks any inherited change in the arrangement of the teeth deserves notice considering their classificatory importance this difference in position is due to the shortening of certain facial bones and the consequent want of space and the shortening results from a peculiar and abnormal state of the embryonal cartilages of the bones  relative position of flowers with respect to the axis and of seeds in the ovary as inducing variation  in the thirteenth chapter various peloric flowers were described and their production was shown to be due either to arrested development or to reversion to a primordial condition moquintandon has remarked that the flowers which stand on the summit of the main stem or of a lateral branch are more liable to become peloric than those on the sides 2613 teratologie veg page 192 and he adduces amongst other instances that of teucrium campanulatum in another labiate plant grown by me viz the galeobdolon luteum the peloric flowers were always produced on the summit of the stem where flowers are not usually borne in pelargonium a single flower in the truss is frequently peloric and when this occurs i have during several years invariably observed it to be the central flower this is of such frequent occurrence that one observer 2614 journal of horticulture july 2 1861 page 253 gives the names of ten varieties flowering at the same time in every one of which the central flower was peloric occasionally more than one flower in the truss is peloric and then of course the additional ones must be lateral these flowers are interesting as showing how the whole structure is correlated in the common pelargonium the upper sepal is produced into a nectary which coheres with the flowerpeduncle the two upper petals differ a little in shape from the three lower ones and are marked with dark shades of colour the stamens are graduated in length and upturned in the peloric flowers the nectary aborts all the petals become alike both in shape and colour the stamens are generally reduced in number and become straight so that the whole flower resembles that of the allied genus erodium the correlation between these changes is well shown when one of the two upper petals alone loses its dark mark for in this case the nectary does not entirely abort but is usually much reduced in length 2615 it would be worth trial to fertilise with the same pollen the central and lateral flowers of the pelargonium or of other highly cultivated plants protecting them of course from insects then to sow the seed separately and observe whether the one or the other lot of seedlings varied the most  morren has described 2616 quoted in journal of horticulture february 24 1863 page 152 a marvellous flaskshaped flower of the calceolaria nearly four inches in length which was almost completely peloric it grew on the summit of the plant with a normal flower on each side prof westwood also has described 2617 gardeners chronicle 1866 page 612 for the phalaenopsis see ibid 1867 page 211 three similar peloric flowers which all occupied a central position on the flowerbranches in the orchideous genus phalaenopsis the terminal flower has been seen to become peloric  in a laburnumtree i observed that about a fourth part of the racemes produced terminal flowers which had lost their papilionaceous structure these were produced after almost all the other flowers on the same racemes had withered the most perfectly pelorised examples had six petals each marked with black striae like those on the standardpetal the keel seemed to resist the change more than the other petals dutrochet has described 2618 memoiresdes vegetaux 1837 tome 2 page 170 an exactly similar case in france and i believe these are the only two instances of pelorism in the laburnum which have been recorded dutrochet remarks that the racemes on this tree do not properly produce a terminal flower so that as in the case of the galeobdolon their position as well as structure are both anomalies which no doubt are in some manner related dr masters has briefly described another leguminous plant 2619 journal of horticulture july 23 1861 page 311 namely a species of clover in which the uppermost and central flowers were regular or had lost their papilionaceous structure in some of these plants the flowerheads were also proliferous  lastly linaria produces two kinds of peloric flowers one having simple petals and the other having them all spurred the two forms as naudin remarks 2620 nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 137 not rarely occur on the same plant but in this case the spurred form almost invariably stands on the summit of the spike  the tendency in the terminal or central flower to become peloric more frequently than the other flowers probably results from the bud which stands on the end of a shoot receiving the most sap it grows out into a stronger shoot than those situated lower down 2621 hugo von mohl the vegetable cell english translation 1852 page 76 i have discussed the connection between pelorism and a central position partly because some few plants are known normally to produce a terminal flower different in structure from the lateral ones but chiefly on account of the following case in which we see a tendency to variability or to reversion connected with the same position a great judge of auriculas 2622 the rev hh dombrain in journal of horticulture 1861 june 4 page 174 and june 25 page 234 1862 april 29 page 83 states that when one throws up a side bloom it is pretty sure to keep its character but that if it grows from the centre or heart of the plant whatever the colour of the edging ought to be it is just as likely to come in any other class as in the one to which it properly belongs this is so notorious a fact that some florists regularly pinch off the central trusses of flowers whether in the highly improved varieties the departure of the central trusses from their proper type is due to reversion i do not know mr dombrain insists that whatever may be the commonest kind of imperfection in each variety this is generally exaggerated in the central truss thus one variety sometimes has the fault of producing a little green floret in the centre of the flower and in central blooms these become excessive in size in some central blooms sent to me by mr dombrain all the organs of the flower were rudimentary in structure of minute size and of a green colour so that by a little further change all would have been converted into small leaves in this case we clearly see a tendency to prolificationa term which i may explain for those who have never attended to botany to mean the production of a branch or flower or head of flowers out of another flower now dr masters 2623 transact linn soc volume 23 1861 page 360 states that the central or uppermost flower on a plant is generally the most liable to prolification thus in the varieties of the auricula the loss of their proper character and a tendency to prolification also a tendency to prolification with pelorism are all connected together and are due either to arrested development or to reversion to a former condition  the following is a more interesting case metzger 2624 die getreidearten 1845 s 208 209 cultivated in germany several kinds of maize brought from the hotter parts of america and he found as previously described that in two or three generations the grains became greatly changed in form size and colour and with respect to two races he expressly states that in the first generation whilst the lower grains on each head retained their proper character the uppermost grains already began to assume that character which in the third generation all the grains acquired as we do not know the aboriginal parent of the maize we cannot tell whether these changes are in any way connected with reversion  in the two following cases reversion comes into play and is determined by the position of the seed in the capsule the blue imperial pea is the offspring of the blue prussian and has larger seed and broader pods than its parent now mr masters of canterbury a careful observer and a raiser of new varieties of the pea states 2625 gardeners chronicle 1850 page 198 that the blue imperial always has a strong tendency to revert to its parentstock and the reversion occurs in this manner the last or uppermost pea in the pod is frequently much smaller than the rest and if these small peas are carefully collected and sown separately very many more in proportion will revert to their origin than those taken from the other parts of the pod again m chate 2626 quoted in gardeners chronicle 1866 page 74 says that in raising seedling stocks he succeeds in getting eighty per cent to bear double flowers by leaving only a few of the secondary branches to seed but in addition to this at the time of extracting the seeds the upper portion of the pod is separated and placed aside because it has been ascertained that the plants coming from the seeds situated in this portion of the pod give eighty per cent of single flowers now the production of singleflowering plants from the seed of doubleflowering plants is clearly a case of reversion these latter facts as well as the connection between a central position and pelorism and prolification show in an interesting manner how small a differencenamely a little greater or less freedom in the flow of sap towards one part of the plantdetermines important changes of structure  analogous or parallel variation  by this term i mean that similar characters occasionally make their appearance in the several varieties or races descended from the same species and more rarely in the offspring of widely distinct species we are here concerned not as hitherto with the causes of variation but with the results but this discussion could not have been more conveniently introduced elsewhere the cases of analogous variation as far as their origin is concerned may be grouped disregarding minor subdivisions under two main heads firstly those due to unknown causes acting on similarly constituted organisms and which consequently have varied in a similar manner and secondly those due to the reappearance of characters which were possessed by a more or less remote progenitor but these two main divisions can often be separated only conjecturally and graduate as we shall presently see into each other  under the first head of analogous variations not due to reversion we have the many cases of trees belonging to quite different orders which have produced pendulous and fastigiate varieties the beech hazel and barberry have given rise to purpleleaved varieties and as bernhardi remarks 2627 ueber den begriff der pflanzenart 1834 s 14 a multitude of plants as distinct as possible have yielded varieties with deeplycut or laciniated leaves varieties descended from three distinct species of brassica have their stems or socalled roots enlarged into globular masses the nectarine is the offspring of the peach and the varieties of peaches and nectarines offer a remarkable parallelism in the fruit being white red or yellow fleshedin being clingstones or freestonesin the flowers being large or smallin the leaves being serrated or crenated furnished with globose or reniform glands or quite destitute of glands it should be remarked that each variety of the nectarine has not derived its character from a corresponding variety of the peach the several varieties also of a closely allied genus namely the apricot differ from one another in nearly the same parallel manner there is no reason to believe that any of these varieties have merely reacquired long lost characters and in most of them this certainly is not the case  three species of cucurbita have yielded a multitude of races which correspond so closely in character that as naudin insists they may be arranged in almost strictly parallel series several varieties of the melon are interesting from resembling in important characters other species either of the same genus or of allied genera thus one variety has fruit so like both externally and internally the fruit of a perfectly distinct species namely the cucumber as hardly to be distinguished from it another has long cylindrical fruit twisting about like a serpent in another the seeds adhere to portions of the pulp in another the fruit when ripe suddenly cracks and falls into pieces and all these highly remarkable peculiarities are characteristic of species belonging to allied genera we can hardly account for the appearance of so many unusual characters by reversion to a single ancient form but we must believe that all the members of the family have inherited a nearly similar constitution from an early progenitor our cereal and many other plants offer similar cases  with animals we have fewer cases of analogous variation independently of direct reversion we see something of the kind in the resemblance between the shortmuzzled races of the dog such as the pug and bulldog in feather footed races of the fowl pigeon and canarybird in horses of the most different races presenting the same range of colour in all blackandtan dogs having tancoloured eyespots and feet but in this latter case reversion may possibly have played a part low has remarked 2628 domesticated animals 1845 page 351 that several breeds of cattle are sheetedthat is have a broad band of white passing round their bodies like a sheet this character is strongly inherited and sometimes originates from a cross it may be the first step in reversion to an early type for as was shown in the third chapter white cattle with dark ears dark feet and tip of tail formerly existed and now exist in feral or semiferal condition in several quarters of the world  under our second main division namely of analogous variations due to reversion the best cases are afforded by pigeons in all the most distinct breeds subvarieties occasionally appear coloured exactly like the parent rockpigeon with black wingbars white loins banded tail etc and no one can doubt that these characters are due to reversion so with minor details turbits properly have white tails but occasionally a bird is born with a darkcoloured and banded tail pouters properly have their primary wing feathers white but not rarely a swordflighted bird appears that is one with the few first primaries darkcoloured and in these cases we have characters proper to the rockpigeon but new to the breed evidently appearing from reversion in some domestic varieties the wingbars instead of being simply black as in the rockpigeon are beautifully edged with different zones of colour and they then present a striking analogy with the wingbars in certain natural species of the same family such as phaps chalcoptera and this may probably be accounted for by all the species of the family being descended from the same remote progenitor and having a tendency to vary in the same manner thus also we can perhaps understand the fact of some laugherpigeons cooing almost like turtledoves and for several races having peculiarities in their flight since certain natural species viz c torquatrix and palumbus display singular vagaries in this respect in other cases a race instead of imitating a distinct species resembles some other race thus certain runts tremble and slightly elevate their tails like fantails and turbits inflate the upper part of their oesophagus like pouter pigeons  it is a common circumstance to find certain coloured marks persistently characterising all the species of a genus but differing much in tint and the same thing occurs with the varieties of the pigeon thus instead of the general plumage being blue with the wingbars black there are snowwhite varieties with red bars and black varieties with white bars in other varieties the wingbars as we have seen are elegantly zoned with different tints the spot pigeon is characterised by the whole plumage being white excepting a spot on the forehead and the tail but these parts may be red yellow or black in the rockpigeon and in many varieties the tail is blue with the outer edges of the outer feathers white but in the subvariety of the monkpigeon we have a reversed style of coloration for the tail is white except the outer edges of the outer feathers which are black 2629 bechstein naturgeschichte deutschlands b 4 1795 s 31  with some species of birds for instance with gulls certain coloured parts appear as if almost washed out and i have observed exactly the same appearance in the terminal dark tailbar in certain pigeons and in the whole plumage of certain varieties of the duck analogous facts in the vegetable kingdom could be given  many subvarieties of the pigeon have reversed and somewhat lengthened feathers on the back part of their heads and this is certainly not due to reversion to the parentspecies which shows no trace of such structure but when we remember that subvarieties of the fowl turkey canarybird duck and goose all have either topknots or reversed feathers on their heads and when we remember that scarcely a single large natural group of birds can be named in which some members have not a tuft of feathers on their heads we may suspect that reversion to some extremely remote form has come into action  several breeds of the fowl have either spangled or pencilled feathers and these cannot be derived from the parentspecies the gallus bankiva though of course it is possible that one early progenitor of this species may have been spangled and another pencilled but as many gallinaceous birds are either spangled or pencilled it is a more probable view that the several domestic breeds of the fowl have acquired this kind of plumage from all the members of the family inheriting a tendency to vary in a like manner the same principle may account for the ewes in certain breeds of sheep being hornless like the females of some other hollowhorned ruminants it may account for certain domestic cats having slightlytufted ears like those of the lynx and for the skulls of domestic rabbits often differing from one another in the same characters by which the skulls of the various species of the genus lepus differ  i will only allude to one other case already discussed now that we know that the wild parent of the ass commonly has striped legs we may feel confident that the occasional appearance of stripes on the legs of the domestic ass is due to reversion but this will not account for the lower end of the shoulder stripe being sometimes angularly bent or slightly forked so again when we see dun and other coloured horses with stripes on the spine shoulders and legs we are led from reasons formerly given to believe that they reappear through reversion to the wild parenthorse but when horses have two or three shoulderstripes with one of them occasionally forked at the lower end or when they have stripes on their faces or are faintly striped as foals over nearly their whole bodies with the stripes angularly bent one under the other on the forehead or irregularly branched in other parts it would be rash to attribute such diversified characters to the reappearance of those proper to the aboriginal wild horse as three african species of the genus are much striped and as we have seen that the crossing of the unstriped species often leads to the hybrid offspring being conspicuously stripedbearing also in mind that the act of crossing certainly causes the reappearance of longlost charactersit is a more probable view that the abovespecified stripes are due to reversion not to the immediate wild parenthorse but to the striped progenitor of the whole genus  i have discussed this subject of analogous variation at considerable length because it is well known that the varieties of one species frequently resemble distinct speciesa fact in perfect harmony with the foregoing cases and explicable on the theory of descent secondly because these facts are important from showing as remarked in a former chapter that each trifling variation is governed by law and is determined in a much higher degree by the nature of the organisation than by the nature of the conditions to which the varying being has been exposed thirdly because these facts are to a certain extent related to a more general law namely that which mr bd walsh 2630 proc entomolog soc of philadelphia october 1863 page 213 has called the law of equable variability or as he explains it if any given character is very variable in one species of a group it will tend to be variable in allied species and if any given character is perfectly constant in one species of a group it will tend to be constant in allied species  this leads me to recall a discussion in the chapter on selection in which it was shown that with domestic races which are now undergoing rapid improvement those parts or characters vary the most which are the most valued this naturally follows from recently selected characters continually tending to revert to their former less improved standard and from their being still acted on by the same agencies whatever these may be which first caused the characters in question to vary the same principle is applicable to natural species for as stated in my origin of species generic characters are less variable than specific characters and the latter are those which have been modified by variation and natural selection since the period when all the species belonging to the genus branched off from a common progenitor whilst generic characters are those which have remained unaltered from a much more remote epoch and accordingly are now less variable this statement makes a near approach to mr walshs law of equable variability secondary sexual characters it may be added rarely serve to characterise distinct genera for they usually differ much in the species of the same genus and they are highly variable in the individuals of the same species we have also seen in the earlier chapters of this work how variable secondary sexual characters become under domestication  summary of the three previous chapters on the laws of variation  in the twentythird chapter we saw that changed conditions occasionally or even often act in a definite manner on the organisation so that all or nearly all the individuals thus exposed become modified in the same manner but a far more frequent result of changed conditions whether acting directly on the organisation or indirectly through the reproductive system is indefinite and fluctuating variability in the three last chapters some of the laws by which such variability is regulated have been discussed  increased use adds to the size of muscles together with the bloodvessels nerves ligaments the crests of bone and the whole bones to which they are attached increased functional activity increases the size of various glands and strengthens the senseorgans increased and intermittent pressure thickens the epidermis a change in the nature of the food sometimes modifies the coats of the stomach and augments or decreases the length of the intestines continued disuse on the other hand weakens and diminishes all parts of the organisation animals which during many generations have taken but little exercise have their lungs reduced in size and as a consequence the bony fabric of the chest and the whole form of the body become modified with our anciently domesticated birds the wings have been little used and they are slightly reduced with their decrease the crest of the sternum the scapulae coracoids and furculum have all been reduced  with domesticated animals the reduction of a part from disuse is never carried so far that a mere rudiment is left whereas we have reason to believe that this has often occurred under nature the effects of disuse in this latter case being aided by economy of growth together with the intercrossing of many varying individuals the cause of this difference between organisms in a state of nature and under domestication probably is that in the latter case there has not been time sufficient for any very great change and that the principle of economy of growth does not come into action on the contrary structures which are rudimentary in the parentspecies sometimes become partially redeveloped in our domesticated productions such rudiments as occasionally make their appearance under domestication seem always to be the result of a sudden arrest of development nevertheless they are of interest as showing that rudiments are the relics of organs once perfectly developed  corporeal periodical and mental habits though the latter have been almost passed over in this work become changed under domestication and the changes are often inherited such changed habits in an organic being especially when living a free life would often lead to the augmented or diminished use of various organs and consequently to their modification from longcontinued habit and more especially from the occasional birth of individuals with a slightly different constitution domestic animals and cultivated plants become to a certain extent acclimatised or adapted to a climate different from that proper to the parentspecies  through the principle of correlated variability taken in its widest sense when one part varies other parts vary either simultaneously or one after the other thus an organ modified during an early embryonic period affects other parts subsequently developed when an organ such as the beak increases or decreases in length adjoining or correlated parts as the tongue and the orifice of the nostrils tend to vary in the same manner when the whole body increases or decreases in size various parts become modified thus with pigeons the ribs increase or decrease in number and breadth homologous parts which are identical during their early development and are exposed to similar conditions tend to vary in the same or in some connected manneras in the case of the right and left sides of the body and of the front and hind limbs so it is with the organs of sight and hearing for instance white cats with blue eyes are almost always deaf there is a manifest relation throughout the body between the skin and various dermal appendages such as hair feathers hoofs horns and teeth in paraguay horses with curly hair have hoofs like those of a mule the wool and the horns of sheep often vary together hairless dogs are deficient in their teeth men with redundant hair have abnormal teeth either by deficiency or excess birds with long wingfeathers usually have long tailfeathers when long feathers grow from the outside of the legs and toes of pigeons the two outer toes are connected by membrane for the whole leg tends to assume the structure of the wing there is a manifest relation between a crest of feathers on the head and a marvellous amount of change in the skull of various fowls and in a lesser degree between the greatly elongated lopping ears of rabbits and the structure of their skulls with plants the leaves various parts of the flower and the fruit often vary together to a correlated manner  in some cases we find correlation without being able even to conjecture what is the nature of the connection as with various monstrosities and diseases this is likewise the case with the colour of the adult pigeon in connection with the presence of down on the young bird numerous curious instances have been given of peculiarities of constitution in correlation with colour as shown by the immunity of individuals of one colour from certain diseases from the attacks of parasites and from the action of certain vegetable poisons  correlation is an important subject for with species and in a lesser degree with domestic races we continually find that certain parts have been greatly modified to serve some useful purpose but we almost invariably find that other parts have likewise been more or less modified without our being able to discover any advantage in the change no doubt great caution is necessary with respect to this latter point for it is difficult to overrate our ignorance on the use of various parts of the organisation but from what we have seen we may believe that many modifications are of no direct service having arisen in correlation with other and useful changes  homologous parts during their early development often become fused together multiple and homologous organs are especially liable to vary in number and probably in form as the supply of organised matter is not unlimited the principle of compensation sometimes comes into action so that when one part is greatly developed adjoining parts are apt to be reduced but this principle is probably of much less importance than the more general one of the economy of growth through mere mechanical pressure hard parts occasionally affect adjoining parts with plants the position of the flowers on the axis and of the seeds in the ovary sometimes leads through a more or less free flow of sap to changes of structure but such changes are often due to reversion modifications in whatever manner caused will be to a certain extent regulated by that coordinating power or socalled nisus formativus which is in fact a remnant of that simple form of reproduction displayed by many lowly organised beings in their power of fissiparous generation and budding finally the effects of the laws which directly or indirectly govern variability may be largely regulated by mans selection and will so far be determined by natural selection that changes advantageous to any race will be favoured and disadvantageous changes will be checked  domestic races descended from the same species or from two or more allied species are liable to revert to characters derived from their common progenitor and as they inherit a somewhat similar constitution they are liable to vary in the same manner from these two causes analogous varieties often arise when we reflect on the several foregoing laws imperfectly as we understand them and when we bear in mind how much remains to be discovered we need not be surprised at the intricate and to us unintelligible manner in which our domestic productions have varied and still go on varying   chapter 2xxvii  provisional hypothesis of pangenesis  preliminary remarks first part the facts to be connected under a single point of view namely the various kinds of reproduction regrowth of amputated parts grafthybrids the direct action of the male element on the female development the functional independence of the units of the body variability inheritance reversion  second part statement of the hypothesis how far the necessary assumptions are improbable explanation by aid of the hypothesis of the several classes of facts specified in the first part conclusion  in the previous chapters large classes of facts such as those bearing on bud variation the various forms of inheritance the causes and laws of variation have been discussed and it is obvious that these subjects as well as the several modes of reproduction stand in some sort of relation to one another i have been led or rather forced to form a view which to a certain extent connects these facts by a tangible method every one would wish to explain to himself even in an imperfect manner how it is possible for a character possessed by some remote ancestor suddenly to reappear in the offspring how the effects of increased or decreased use of a limb can be transmitted to the child how the male sexual element can act not solely on the ovules but occasionally on the motherform how a hybrid can be produced by the union of the cellular tissue of two plants independently of the organs of generation how a limb can be reproduced on the exact line of amputation with neither too much nor too little added how the same organism may be produced by such widely different processes as budding and true seminal generation and lastly how of two allied forms one passes in the course of its development through the most complex metamorphoses and the other does not do so though when mature both are alike in every detail of structure i am aware that my view is merely a provisional hypothesis or speculation but until a better one be advanced it will serve to bring together a multitude of facts which are at present left disconnected by any efficient cause as whewell the historian of the inductive sciences remarkshypotheses may often be of service to science when they involve a certain portion of incompleteness and even of error under this point of view i venture to advance the hypothesis of pangenesis which implies that every separate part of the whole organisation reproduces itself so that ovules spermatozoa and pollengrainsthe fertilised egg or seed as well as budsinclude and consist of a multitude of germs thrown off from each separate part or unit 271 this hypothesis has been severely criticised by many writers and it will be fair to give references to the more important articles the best essay which i have seen is by prof delpino entitled sulla darwiniana teoria della pangenesi 1869 of which a translation appeared in scientific opinion september 29 1869 and the succeeding numbers he rejects the hypothesis but criticises it fairly and i have found his criticisms very useful mr mivart genesis of species 1871 chapter 10 follows delpino but adds no new objections of any weight dr bastian the beginnings of life 1872 volume 2 page 98 says that the hypothesis looks like a relic of the old rather than a fitting appanage of the new evolution philosophy he shows that i ought not to have used the term pangenesis as it had been previously used by dr gros in another sense dr lionel beale nature may 11 1871 page 26 sneers at the whole doctrine with much acerbity and some justice prof wigand schriften der gesell der gesammt naturwissen zu marburg b 9 1870 considers the hypothesis as unscientific and worthless mr gh lewes fortnightly review november 1 1868 page 503 seems to consider that it may be useful he makes many good criticisms in a perfectly fair spirit mr f galton after describing his valuable experiments proc royal soc volume 19 page 393 on the intertransfusion of the blood of distinct varieties of the rabbit concludes by saying that in his opinion the results negative beyond all doubt the doctrine of pangenesis he informs me that subsequently to the publication of his paper he continued his experiments on a still larger scale for two more generations without any sign of mongrelism showing itself in the very numerous offspring i certainly should have expected that gemmules would have been present in the blood but this is no necessary part of the hypothesis which manifestly applies to plants and the lowest animals mr galton in a letter to nature april 27 1871 page 502 also criticises various incorrect expressions used by me on the other hand several writers have spoken favourably of the hypothesis but there would be no use in giving references to their articles i may however refer to dr ross work the graft theory of disease being an application of mr darwins hypothesis of pangenesis 1872 as he gives several original and ingenious discussions  in the first part i will enumerate as briefly as i can the groups of facts which seem to demand connection but certain subjects not hitherto discussed must be treated at disproportionate length in the second part the hypothesis will be given and after considering how far the necessary assumptions are in themselves improbable we shall see whether it serves to bring under a single point of view the various facts  part i  reproduction may be divided into two main classes namely sexual and asexual the latter is effected in many waysby the formation of buds of various kinds and by fissiparous generation that is by spontaneous or artificial division it is notorious that some of the lower animals when cut into many pieces reproduce so many perfect individuals lyonnet cut a nais or freshwater worm into nearly forty pieces and these all reproduced perfect animals 272 quoted by paget lectures on pathology 1853 page 159 it is probable that segmentation could be carried much further in some of the protozoa and with some of the lowest plants each cell will reproduce the parentform johannes muller thought that there was an important distinction between gemmation and fission for in the latter case the divided portion however small is more fully developed than a bud which also is a younger formation but most physiologists are now convinced that the two processes are essentially alike 273 dr lachmann also observes annals and mag of nat history 2nd series volume 19 1857 page 231 with respect to infusoria that fissation and gemmation pass into each other almost imperceptibly again mr wc minor annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series volume 11 page 328 shows that with annelids the distinction that has been made between fission and budding is not a fundamental one see also professor clarks work mind in nature new york 1865 pages 62 94 prof huxley remarks fission is little more than a peculiar mode of budding and prof hj clark shows in detail that there is sometimes a compromise between selfdivision and budding when a limb is amputated or when the whole body is bisected the cut extremities are said to bud forth 274 see bonnet oeuvres dhist nat tome 5 1781 page 339 for remarks on the buddingout of the amputated limbs of salamanders and as the papilla which is first formed consists of undeveloped cellular tissue like that forming an ordinary bud the expression is apparently correct we see the connection of the two processes in another way for trembley observed with the hydra that the reproduction of the head after amputation was checked as soon as the animal put forth reproductive gemmae 275 paget lectures on pathology 1853 page 158  between the production by fissiparous generation of two or more complete individuals and the repair of even a very slight injury there is so perfect a gradation that it is impossible to doubt that the two processes are connected as at each stage of growth an amputated part is replaced by one in the same state of development we must also follow sir j paget in admitting that the powers of development from the embryo are identical with those exercised for the restoration from injuries in other words that the powers are the same by which perfection is first achieved and by which when lost it is recovered 276 ibid pages 152 164 finally we may conclude that the several forms of budding fissiparous generation the repair of injuries and development are all essentially the results of one and the same power  sexual generation  the union of the two sexual elements seems at first sight to make a broad distinction between sexual and asexual generation but the conjugation of algae by which process the contents of two cells unite into a single mass capable of development apparently gives us the first step towards sexual union and pringsheim in his memoir on the pairing of zoospores 277 translated in annals and mag of nat hist april 1870 page 272 shows that conjugation graduates into true sexual reproduction moreover the now wellascertained cases of parthenogenesis prove that the distinction between sexual and asexual generation is not nearly so great as was formerly thought for ova occasionally and even in some cases frequently become developed into perfect beings without the concourse of the male with most of the lower animals and even with mammals the ova show a trace of parthenogenetic power for without being fertilised they pass through the first stages of segmentation 278 bischoff as quoted by von siebold ueber parthenogenesis sitzung der math phys classe munich november 4 1871 page 240 see also quatrefages annales des sc nat zoolog 3rd series 1850 page 138 nor can pseudova which do not need fertilisation be distinguished from true ova as was first shown by sir j lubbock and is now admitted by siebold so again the germballs in the larvae of cecidomyia are said by leuckart 279 on the asexual reproduction of cecidomyide larvae translated in annals and mag of nat hist march 1866 pages 167 171 to be formed within the ovarium but they do not require to be fertilised it should also be observed that in sexual generation the ovules and the male element have equal power of transmitting every single character possessed by either parent to their offspring we see this clearly when hybrids are paired inter se for the characters of both grandparents often appear in the progeny either perfectly or by segments it is an error to suppose that the male transmits certain characters and the female other characters although no doubt from unknown causes one sex sometimes has a much stronger power of transmission than the other  it has however been maintained by some authors that a bud differs essentially from a fertilised germ in always reproducing the perfect character of the parentstock whilst fertilised germs give birth to variable beings but there is no such broad distinction as this in the eleventh chapter numerous cases were advanced showing that buds occasionally grow into plants having quite new characters and the varieties thus produced can be propagated for a length of time by buds and occasionally by seed nevertheless it must be admitted that beings produced sexually are much more liable to vary than those produced asexually and of this fact a partial explanation will hereafter be attempted the variability in both cases is determined by the same general causes and is governed by the same laws hence new varieties arising from buds cannot be distinguished from those arising from seed although budvarieties usually retain their character during successive budgenerations yet they occasionally revert even after a long series of budgenerations to their former character this tendency to reversion in buds is one of the most remarkable of the several points of agreement between the offspring from bud and seminal reproduction  but there is one difference between organisms produced sexually and asexually which is very general the former pass in the course of their development from a very low stage to their highest stage as we see in the metamorphoses of insects and of many other animals and in the concealed metamorphoses of the vertebrata animals propagated asexually by buds or fission on the other hand commence their development at that stage at which the budding or self dividing animal may happen to be and therefore do not pass through some of the lower developmental stages 2710 prof allman speaks transact r soc of edinburgh volume 26 1870 page 102 decisively on this head with respect to the hydroida he says it is a universal law in the succession of zooids that no retrogression ever takes place in the series afterwards they often advance in organisation as we see in the many cases of alternate generation in thus speaking of alternate generation i follow those naturalists who look at this process as essentially one of internal budding or of fissiparous generation some of the lower plants however such as mosses and certain algae according to dr l radlkofer 2711 annals and mag of nat hist 2nd series volume 20 1857 pages 153455 when propagated asexually do undergo a retrogressive metamorphosis as far as the final cause is concerned we can to a certain extent understand why beings propagated by buds should not pass through all the early stages of development for with each organism the structure acquired at each stage must be adapted to its peculiar habits and if there are places for the support of many individuals at some one stage the simplest plan will be that they should be multiplied at this stage and not that they should first retrograde in their development to an earlier or simpler structure which might not be fitted for the then surrounding conditions  from the several foregoing considerations we may conclude that the difference between sexual and asexual generation is not nearly so great as at first appears the chief difference being that an ovule cannot continue to live and to be fully developed unless it unites with the male element but even this difference is far from invariable as shown by the many cases of parthenogenesis we are therefore naturally led to inquire what the final cause can be of the necessity in ordinary generation for the concourse of the two sexual elements  seeds and ova are often highly serviceable as the means of disseminating plants and animals and of preserving them during one or more seasons in a dormant state but unimpregnated seeds or ova and detached buds would be equally serviceable for both purposes we can however indicate two important advantages gained by the concourse of the two sexes or rather of two individuals belonging to opposite sexes for as i have shown in a former chapter the structure of every organism appears to be especially adapted for the concurrence at least occasionally of two individuals when species are rendered highly variable by changed conditions of life the free intercrossing of the varying individuals tends to keep each form fitted for its proper place in nature and crossing can be effected only by sexual generation but whether the end thus gained is of sufficient importance to account for the first origin of sexual intercourse is extremely doubtful secondly i have shown from a large body of facts that as a slight change in the conditions of life is beneficial to each creature so in an analogous manner is the change effected in the germ by sexual union with a distinct individual and i have been led from observing the many widelyextended provisions throughout nature for this purpose and from the greater vigour of crossed organisms of all kinds as proved by direct experiments as well as from the evil effects of close interbreeding when long continued to believe that the advantage thus gained is very great  why the germ which before impregnation undergoes a certain amount of development ceases to progress and perishes unless it be acted on by the male element and why conversely the male element which in the case of some insects is enabled to keep alive for four or five years and in the case of some plants for several years likewise perishes unless it acts on or unites with the germ are questions which cannot be answered with certainty it is however probable that both sexual elements perish unless brought into union simply from including too little formative matter for independent development quatrefages has shown in the case of the teredo 2712 annales des sc nat 3rd series 1850 tome 13 as did formerly prevost and dumas with other animals that more than one spermatozoon is requisite to fertilise an ovum this has likewise been shown by newport 2713 transact phil soc 1851 pages 196 208 210 1853 pages 245 247 who proved by numerous experiments that when a very small number of spermatozoa are applied to the ova of batrachians they are only partially impregnated and an embryo is never fully developed the rate also of the segmentation of the ovum is determined by the number of the spermatozoa with respect to plants nearly the same results were obtained by kolreuter and gartner this last careful observer after making successive trials on a malva with more and more pollen grains found 2714 beitrage zur kenntniss etc 1844 s 345 that even thirty grains did not fertilise a single seed but when forty grains were applied to the stigma a few seeds of small size were formed in the case of mirabilis the pollen grains are extraordinarily large and the ovarium contains only a single ovule and these circumstances led naudin 2715 nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 27 to make the following experiments a flower was fertilised by three grains and succeeded perfectly twelve flowers were fertilised by two grains and seventeen flowers by a single grain and of these one flower alone in each lot perfected its seed and it deserves especial notice that the plants produced by these two seeds never attained their proper dimensions and bore flowers of remarkably small size from these facts we clearly see that the quantity of the peculiar formative matter which is contained within the spermatozoa and pollengrains is an allimportant element in the act of fertilisation not only for the full development of the seed but for the vigour of the plant produced from such seed we see something of the same kind in certain cases of parthenogenesis that is when the male element is wholly excluded for m jourdan 2716 as quoted by sir j lubbock in nat hist review 1862 page 345 weijenbergh also raised nature december 21 1871 page 149 two successive generations from unimpregnated females of another lepidopterous insect liparis dispar these females did not produce at most onetwentieth of their full complement of eggs and many of the eggs were worthless moreover the caterpillars raised from these unfertilised eggs possessed far less vitality than those from fertilised eggs in the third parthenogenetic generation not a single egg yielded a caterpillar found that out of about 58000 eggs laid by unimpregnated silkmoths many passed through their early embryonic stages showing that they were capable of selfdevelopment but only twentynine out of the whole number produced caterpillars the same principle of quantity seems to hold good even in artificial fissiparous reproduction for hackel 2717 entwickelungsgeschichte der siphonophora 1869 page 73 found that by cutting the segmented and fertilised ova or larva of siphonophorae jelly fishes into pieces the smaller the pieces were the slower was the rate of development and the larvae thus produced were by so much the more imperfect and inclined to monstrosity it seems therefore probable that with the separate sexual elements deficient quantity of formative matter is the main cause of their not having the capacity for prolonged existence and development unless they combine and thus increase each others bulk the belief that it is the function of the spermatozoa to communicate life to the ovule seems a strange one seeing that the unimpregnated ovule is already alive and generally undergoes a certain amount of independent development sexual and asexual reproduction are thus seen not to differ essentially and we have already shown that asexual reproduction the power of regrowth and development are all parts of one and the same great law  regrowth of amputated parts  this subject deserves a little further discussion a multitude of the lower animals and some vertebrates possess this wonderful power for instance spallanzani cut off the legs and tail of the same salamander six times successively and bonnet 2718 spallanzani an essay on animal reproduction translated by dr maty 1769 page 79 bonnet oeuvres dhist nat tome 5 part 1 4to edition 1781 pages 343 350 did so eight times and on each occasion the limbs were reproduced on the exact line of amputation with no part deficient or in excess an allied animal the axolotl had a limb bitten off which was reproduced in an abnormal condition but when this was amputated it was replaced by a perfect limb 2719 vulpian as quoted by prof faivre la variabilite des especes 1868 page 112 the new limbs in these cases bud forth and are developed in the same manner as during the regular development of a young animal for instance with the amblystoma lurida three toes are first developed then the fourth and on the hindfeet the fifth and so it is with a reproduced limb 2720 dr p hoy the american naturalist september 1871 page 579  the power of regrowth is generally much greater during the youth of an animal or during the earlier stages of its development than during maturity the larvae or tadpoles of the batrachians are capable of reproducing lost members but not so the adults 2721 dr gunther in owen anatomy of vertebrates volume 1 1866 page 567 spallanzani has made similar observations mature insects have no power of regrowth excepting in one order whilst the larvae of many kinds have this power animals low in the scale are able as a general rule to reproduce lost parts far more easily than those which are more highly organised the myriapods offer a good illustration of this rule but there are some strange exceptions to itthus nemerteans though lowly organised are said to exhibit little power of regrowth with the higher vertebrata such as birds and mammals the power is extremely limited 2722 a thrush was exhibited before the british association at hull in 1853 which had lost its tarsus and this member it was asserted had been thrice reproduced having been lost i presume each time by disease sir j paget informs me that he feels some doubt about the facts recorded by sir j simpson monthly journal of medical science edinburgh 1848 new series volume 2 page 890 of the regrowth of limbs in the womb in the case of man  in the case of those animals which may be bisected or chopped into pieces and of which every fragment will reproduce the whole the power of regrowth must be diffused throughout the whole body nevertheless there seems to be much truth in the view maintained by prof lessona 2723 atti della soc ital di sc nat volume 11 1869 page 493 that this capacity is generally a localised and special one serving to replace parts which are eminently liable to be lost in each particular animal the most striking case in favour of this view is that the terrestrial salamander according to lessona cannot reproduce lost parts whilst another species of the same genus the aquatic salamander has extraordinary powers of regrowth as we have just seen and this animal is eminently liable to have its limbs tail eyes and jaws bitten off by other tritons 2724 lessona states that this is so in the paper just referred to see also the american naturalist september 1871 page 579 even with the aquatic salamander the capacity is to a certain extent localised for when m philipeaux 2725 comptes rendus october 1 1866 and june 1867 extirpated the entire fore limb together with the scapula the power of regrowth was completely lost it is also a remarkable fact standing in opposition to a very general rule that the young of the aquatic salamander do not possess the power of repairing their limbs in an equal degree with the adults 2726 bonnet oeuvres hist nat volume 5 page 294 as quoted by prof rolleston in his remarkable address to the 36th annual meeting of the british medical association but i do not know that they are more active or can otherwise better escape the loss of their limbs than the adults the walkingstick insect diapheromera femorata like other insects of the same order can reproduce its legs in the mature state and these from their great length must be liable to be lost but the capacity is localised as in the case of the salamander for dr scudder found 2727 proc boston soc of nat hist volume 12 186869 page 1 that if the limb was removed within the trochantofemoral articulation it was never renewed when a crab is seized by one of its legs this is thrown off at the basal joint being afterwards replaced by a new leg and it is generally admitted that this is a special provision for the safety of the animal lastly with gasteropod molluscs which are well known to have the power of reproducing their heads lessona shows that they are very liable to have their heads bitten off by fishes the rest of the body being protected by the shell even with plants we see something of the same kind for nondeciduous leaves and young stems have no power of regrowth these parts being easily replaced by growth from new buds whilst the bark and subjacent tissues of the trunks of trees have great power of regrowth probably on account of their increase in diameter and of their liability to injury from being gnawed by animals  grafthybrids  it is well known from innumerable trials made in all parts of the world that buds may be inserted into a stock and that the plants thus raised are not affected in a greater degree than can be accounted for by changed nutrition nor do the seedlings raised from such inserted buds partake of the character of the stock though they are more liable to vary than are seedlings from the same variety growing on its own roots a bud also may sport into a new and stronglymarked variety without any other bud on the same plant being in the least degree affected we may therefore infer in accordance with the common view that each bud is a distinct individual and that its formative elements do not spread beyond the parts subsequently developed from it nevertheless we have seen in the abstract on grafthybridisation in the eleventh chapter that buds certainly include formative matter which can occasionally combine with that included in the tissues of a distinct variety or species a plant intermediate between the two parentforms being thus produced in the case of the potato we have seen that the tubers produced from a bud of one kind inserted into another are intermediate in colour size shape and state of surface that the stems foliage and even certain constitutional peculiarities such as precocity are likewise intermediate with these well established cases the evidence that grafthybrids have also been produced with the laburnum orange vine rose etc seems sufficient but we do not know under what conditions this rare form of reproduction is possible from these several cases we learn the important fact that formative elements capable of blending with those of a distinct individual and this is the chief characteristic of sexual generation are not confined to the reproductive organs but are present in the buds and cellular tissue of plants and this is a fact of the highest physiological importance  direct action of the male element on the female  in the eleventh chapter abundant proofs were given that foreign pollen occasionally affects in a direct manner the motherplant thus when gallesio fertilised an orangeflower with pollen from the lemon the fruit bore stripes of perfectly characterised lemonpeel with peas several observers have seen the colour of the seedcoats and even of the pod directly affected by the pollen of a distinct variety so it has been with the fruit of the apple which consists of the modified calyx and upper part of the flowerstalk in ordinary cases these parts are wholly formed by the motherplant we here see that the formative elements included within the male element or pollen of one variety can affect and hybridise not the part which they are properly adapted to affect namely the ovules but the partiallydeveloped tissues of a distinct variety or species we are thus brought halfway towards a graft hybrid in which the formative elements included within the tissues of one individual combine with those included in the tissues of a distinct variety or species thus giving rise to a new and intermediate form independently of the male or female sexual organs  with animals which do not breed until nearly mature and of which all the parts are then fully developed it is hardly possible that the male element should directly affect the female but we have the analogous and perfectly wellascertained case of the male element affecting as with the quagga and lord mortons mare the female or her ova in such a manner that when she is impregnated by another male her offspring are affected and hybridised by the first male the explanation would be simple if the spermatozoa could keep alive within the body of the female during the long interval which has sometimes elapsed between the two acts of impregnation but no one will suppose that this is possible with the higher animals  development  the fertilised germ reaches maturity by a vast number of changes these are either slight and slowly effected as when the child grows into the man or are great and sudden as with the metamorphoses of most insects between these extremes we have every gradation even within the same class thus as sir j lubbock has shown 2728 transact linn soc volume 24 1863 page 62 there is an ephemerous insect which moults above twenty times undergoing each time a slight but decided change of structure and these changes as he further remarks probably reveal to us the normal stages of development which are concealed and hurried through or suppressed in most other insects in ordinary metamorphoses the parts and organs appear to become changed into the corresponding parts in the next stage of development but there is another form of development which has been called by professor owen metagenesis in this case the new parts are not moulded upon the inner surface of the old ones the plastic force has changed its course of operation the outer case and all that gave form and character to the precedent individual perish and are cast off they are not changed into the corresponding parts of the new individual these are due to a new and distinct developmental process etc 2729 parthenogenesis 1849 pages 25 26 prof huxley has some excellent remarks medical times 1856 page 637 on this subject in reference to the development of starfishes and shows how curiously metamorphosis graduates into gemmation or zoidformation which is in fact the same as metagenesis metamorphosis however graduates so insensibly into metagenesis that the two processes cannot be distinctly separated for instance in the last change which cirripedes undergo the alimentary canal and some other organs are moulded on preexisting parts but the eyes of the old and the young animal are developed in entirely different parts of the body the tips of the mature limbs are formed within the larval limbs and may be said to be metamorphosed from them but their basal portions and the whole thorax are developed in a plane at right angles to the larval limbs and thorax and this may be called metagenesis the metagenetic process is carried to an extreme point in the development of some echinoderms for the animal in the second stage of development is formed almost like a bud within the animal of the first stage the latter being then cast off like an old vestment yet sometimes maintaining for a short period an independent vitality 2730 prof j reay greene in gunthers record of zoolog lit 1865 page 625 if instead of a single individual several were to be thus developed metagenetically within a pre existing form the process would be called one of alternate generation the young thus developed may either closely resemble the encasing parentform as with the larvae of cecidomyia or may differ to an astonishing degree as with many parasitic worms and jellyfishes but this does not make any essential difference in the process any more than the greatness or abruptness of the change in the metamorphoses of insects  the whole question of development is of great importance for our present subject when an organ the eye for instance is metagenetically formed in a part of the body where during the previous stage of development no eye existed we must look at it as a new and independent growth the absolute independence of new and old structures although corresponding in structure and function is still more obvious when several individuals are formed within a previous form as in the cases of alternate generation the same important principle probably comes largely into play even in the case of apparently continuous growth as we shall see when we consider the inheritance of modifications at corresponding ages  we are led to the same conclusion namely the independence of parts successively developed by another and quite distinct group of facts it is well known that many animals belonging to the same order and therefore not differing widely from each other pass through an extremely different course of development thus certain beetles not in any way remarkably different from others of the same order undergo what has been called a hypermetamorphosis that is they pass through an early stage wholly different from the ordinary grublike larva in the same suborder of crabs namely the macroura as fritz muller remarks the river crayfish is hatched under the same form which it ever afterwards retains the young lobster has divided legs like a mysis the palaemon appears under the form of a zoea and peneus under the nauplius form and how wonderfully these larval forms differ from one another is known to every naturalist 2731 fritz muller fur darwin 1864 s 65 71 the highest authority on crustaceans prof milneedwards insists annal des sci nat 2nd series zoolog tome 3 page 322 on the difference in the metamorphosis of closelyallied genera some other crustaceans as the same author observes start from the same point and arrive at nearly the same end but in the middle of their development are widely different from one another still more striking cases could be given with respect to the echinodermata with the medusae or jellyfishes professor allman observes the classification of the hydroida would be a comparatively simple task if as has been erroneously asserted genericallyidentical medusoids always arose from genericallyidentical polypoids and on the other hand that generically identical polypoids always gave origin to genericallyidentical medusoids so again dr strethill wright remarks in the lifehistory of the hydroidae any phase planuloid polypoid or medusoid may be absent 2732 prof allman annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series volume 13 1864 page 348 dr s wright ibid volume 8 1861 page 127 see also page 358 for analogous statements by sars  according to the belief now generally accepted by our best naturalists all the members of the same order or class for instance the medusae or the macrourous crustaceans are descended from a common progenitor during their descent they have diverged much in structure but have retained much in common and this has occurred though they have passed through and still pass through marvellously different metamorphoses this fact well illustrates how independent each structure is from that which precedes and that which follows it in the course of development  the functional independence of the elements or units of the body  physiologists agree that the whole organism consists of a multitude of elemental parts which are to a great extent independent of one another each organ says claude bernard 2733 tissus vivants 1866 page 22 has its proper life its autonomy it can develop and reproduce itself independently of the adjoining tissues a great german authority virchow 2734 cellular pathology translated by dr chance 1860 pages 14 18 83 460 asserts still more emphatically that each system consists of an enormous mass of minute centres of actionevery element has its own special action and even though it derive its stimulus to activity from other parts yet alone effects the actual performance of dutiesevery single epithelial and muscular fibre cell leads a sort of parasitical existence in relation to the rest of the bodyevery single bonecorpuscle really possesses conditions of nutrition peculiar to itself each element as sir j paget remarks lives its appointed time and then dies and is replaced after being cast off or absorbed 2735 paget surgical pathology volume 1 1853 pages 1214 i presume that no physiologist doubts that for instance each bonecorpuscle of the finger differs from the corresponding corpuscle in the corresponding joint of the toe and there can hardly be a doubt that even those on the corresponding sides of the body differ though almost identical in nature this near approach to identity is curiously shown in many diseases in which the same exact points on the right and left sides of the body are similarly affected thus sir j paget 2736 ibid page 19 gives a drawing of a diseased pelvis in which the bone has grown into a most complicated pattern but there is not one spot or line on one side which is not represented as exactly as it would be in a mirror on the other  many facts support this view of the independent life of each minute element of the body virchow insists that a single bonecorpuscle or a single cell in the skin may become diseased the spur of a cock after being inserted into the ear of an ox lived for eight years and acquired a weight of 396 grammes nearly fourteen ounces and the astonishing length of twentyfour centimetres or about nine inches so that the head of the ox appeared to bear three horns 2737 see prof mantegazzas interesting work degli innesti

diseases of the ovaries 1874 pages 61 62 are facts leading to the same conclusion mr lawson tait refers to a tumour in which over 300 teeth were found resembling in many respects milkteeth and to another tumour full of hair which had grown and been shed from one little spot of skin not bigger than the tip of my little finger the amount of hair in the sac had it grown from a similarly sized area of the scalp would have taken almost a lifetime to grow and be shed  whether each of the innumerable autonomous elements of the body is a cell or the modified product of a cell is a more doubtful question even if so wide a definition be given to the term as to include celllike bodies without walls and without nuclei 2740 for the most recent classification of cells see ernst hackel generelle morpholog b 2 1866 s 275 the doctrine of omnis cellula e cellula is admitted for plants and widely prevails with respect to animals 2741 dr w turner the present aspect of cellular pathology edinburgh medical journal april 1863 thus virchow the great supporter of the cellular theory whilst allowing that difficulties exist maintains that every atom of tissue is derived from cells and these from preexisting cells and these primarily from the egg which he regards as a great cell that cells still retaining the same nature increase by selfdivision or proliferation is admitted by every one but when an organism undergoes great changes of structure during development the cells which at each stage are supposed to be directly derived from previously existing cells must likewise be greatly changed in nature this change is attributed by the supporters of the cellular doctrine to some inherent power which the cells possess and not to any external agency others maintain that cells and tissues of all kinds may be formed independently of preexisting cells from plastic lymph or blastema whichever view may be correct every one admits that the body consists of a multitude of organic units all of which possess their own proper attributes and are to a certain extent independent of all others hence it will be convenient to use indifferently the terms cells or organic units or simply units  variability and inheritance  we have seen in the twentysecond chapter that variability is not a principle coordinate with life or reproduction but results from special causes generally from changed conditions acting during successive generations the fluctuating variability thus induced is apparently due in part to the sexual system being easily affected so that it is often rendered impotent and when not so seriously affected it often fails in its proper function of transmitting truly the characters of the parents to the offspring but variability is not necessarily connected with the sexual system as we see in the cases of budvariation although we are seldom able to trace the nature of the connection many deviations of structure no doubt result from changed conditions acting directly on the organisation independently of the reproductive system in some instances we may feel sure of this when all or nearly all the individuals which have been similarly exposed are similarly and definitely affected of which several instances have been given but it is by no means clear why the offspring should be affected by the exposure of the parents to new conditions and why it is necessary in most cases that several generations should have been thus exposed  how again can we explain the inherited effects of the use or disuse of particular organs the domesticated duck flies less and walks more than the wild duck and its limbbones have become diminished and increased in a corresponding manner in comparison with those of the wild duck a horse is trained to certain paces and the colt inherits similar consensual movements the domesticated rabbit becomes tame from close confinement the dog intelligent from associating with man the retriever is taught to fetch and carry and these mental endowments and bodily powers are all inherited nothing in the whole circuit of physiology is more wonderful how can the use or disuse of a particular limb or of the brain affect a small aggregate of reproductive cells seated in a distant part of the body in such a manner that the being developed from these cells inherits the characters of either one or both parents even an imperfect answer to this question would be satisfactory  in the chapters devoted to inheritance it was shown that a multitude of newly acquired characters whether injurious or beneficial whether of the lowest or highest vital importance are often faithfully transmittedfrequently even when one parent alone possesses some new peculiarity and we may on the whole conclude that inheritance is the rule and noninheritance the anomaly in some instances a character is not inherited from the conditions of life being directly opposed to its development in many instances from the conditions incessantly inducing fresh variability as with grafted fruittrees and highlycultivated flowers in the remaining cases the failure may be attributed to reversion by which the child resembles its grandparents or more remote progenitors instead of its parents  inheritance is governed by various laws characters which first appear at any particular age tend to reappear at a corresponding age they often become associated with certain seasons of the year and reappear in the offspring at a corresponding season if they appear rather late in life in one sex they tend to reappear exclusively in the same sex at the same period of life  the principle of reversion recently alluded to is one of the most wonderful of the attributes of inheritance it proves to us that the transmission of a character and its development which ordinarily go together and thus escape discrimination are distinct powers and these powers in some cases are even antagonistic for each acts alternately in successive generations reversion is not a rare event depending on some unusual or favourable combination of circumstances but occurs so regularly with crossed animals and plants and so frequently with uncrossed breeds that it is evidently an essential part of the principle of inheritance we know that changed conditions have the power of evoking longlost characters as in the case of animals becoming feral the act of crossing in itself possesses this power in a high degree what can be more wonderful than that characters which have disappeared during scores or hundreds or even thousands of generations should suddenly reappear perfectly developed as in the case of pigeons and fowls both when purely bred and especially when crossed or as with the zebrine stripes on duncoloured horses and other such cases many monstrosities come under this same head as when rudimentary organs are redeveloped or when an organ which we must believe was possessed by an early progenitor of the species but of which not even a rudiment is left suddenly reappears as with the fifth stamen in some scrophulariaceae we have already seen that reversion acts in bud reproduction and we know that it occasionally acts during the growth of the same individual animal especially but not exclusively if of crossed parentageas in the rare cases described of fowls pigeons cattle and rabbits which have reverted to the colours of one of their parents or ancestors as they advanced in years  we are led to believe as formerly explained that every character which occasionally reappears is present in a latent form in each generation in nearly the same manner as in male and female animals the secondary characters of the opposite sex lie latent and ready to be evolved when the reproductive organs are injured this comparison of the secondary sexual characters which lie latent in both sexes with other latent characters is the more appropriate from the case recorded of a hen which assumed some of the masculine characters not of her own race but of an early progenitor she thus exhibited at the same time the redevelopment of latent characters of both kinds in every living creature we may feel assured that a host of longlost characters lie ready to be evolved under proper conditions how can we make intelligible and connect with other facts this wonderful and common capacity of reversionthis power of calling back to life longlost characters  part ii  i have now enumerated the chief facts which every one would desire to see connected by some intelligible bond this can be done if we make the following assumptions and much may be advanced in favour of the chief one the secondary assumptions can likewise be supported by various physiological considerations it is universally admitted that the cells or units of the body increase by selfdivision or proliferation retaining the same nature and that they ultimately become converted into the various tissues and substances of the body but besides this means of increase i assume that the units throw off minute granules which are dispersed throughout the whole system that these when supplied with proper nutriment multiply by selfdivision and are ultimately developed into units like those from which they were originally derived these granules may be called gemmules they are collected from all parts of the system to constitute the sexual elements and their development in the next generation forms a new being but they are likewise capable of transmission in a dormant state to future generations and may then be developed their development depends on their union with other partially developed or nascent cells which precede them in the regular course of growth why i use the term union will be seen when we discuss the direct action of pollen on the tissues of the motherplant gemmules are supposed to be thrown off by every unit not only during the adult state but during each stage of development of every organism but not necessarily during the continued existence of the same unit lastly i assume that the gemmules in their dormant state have a mutual affinity for each other leading to their aggregation into buds or into the sexual elements hence it is not the reproductive organs or buds which generate new organisms but the units of which each individual is composed these assumptions constitute the provisional hypothesis which i have called pangenesis views in many respects similar have been propounded by various authors 2742 mr gh lewes fortnightly review november 1 1868 page 506 remarks on the number of writers who have advanced nearly similar views more than two thousand years ago aristotle combated a view of this kind which as i hear from dr w ogle was held by hippocrates and others ray in his wisdom of god 2nd edition 1692 page 68 says that every part of the body seems to club and contribute to the seed the organic molecules of buffon hist nat gen edition of 1749 tome 2 pages 54 62 329 333 420 425 appear at first sight to be the same as the gemmules of my hypothesis but they are essentially different bonnet oeuvres dhist nat tome 5 part 1 1781 4to edition page 334 speaks of the limbs having germs adapted for the reparation of all possible losses but whether these germs are supposed to be the same with those within buds and the sexual organs is not clear prof owen says anatomy of vertebrates volume 3 1868 page 813 that he fails to see any fundamental difference between the views which he propounded in his parthenogenesis 1849 pages 5 8 and which he now considers as erroneous and my hypothesis of pangenesis but a reviewer journal of anat and phys may 1869 page 441 shows how different they really are i formerly thought that the physiological units of herbert spencer principles of biology volume 1 chapters 4 and 8 186364 were the same as my gemmules but i now know that this is not the case lastly it appears from a review of the present work by prof mantegazza nuova antologia maggio 1868 that he in his elementi di igiene ediz 3 page 540 clearly foresaw the doctrine of pangenesis  before proceeding to show firstly how far these assumptions are in themselves probable and secondly how far they connect and explain the various groups of facts with which we are concerned it may be useful to give an illustration as simple as possible of the hypothesis if one of the protozoa be formed as it appears under the microscope of a small mass of homogeneous gelatinous matter a minute particle or gemmule thrown off from any part and nourished under favourable circumstances would reproduce the whole but if the upper and lower surfaces were to differ in texture from each other and from the central portion then all three parts would have to throw off gemmules which when aggregated by mutual affinity would form either buds or the sexual elements and would ultimately be developed into a similar organism precisely the same view may be extended to one of the higher animals although in this case many thousand gemmules must be thrown off from the various parts of the body at each stage of development these gemmules being developed in union with preexisting nascent cells in due order of succession  physiologists maintain as we have seen that each unit of the body though to a large extent dependent on others is likewise to a certain extent independent or autonomous and has the power of increasing by selfdivision i go one step further and assume that each unit casts off free gemmules which are dispersed throughout the system and are capable under proper conditions of being developed into similar units nor can this assumption be considered as gratuitous and improbable it is manifest that the sexual elements and buds include formative matter of some kind capable of development and we now know from the production of grafthybrids that similar matter is dispersed throughout the tissues of plants and can combine with that of another and distinct plant giving rise to a new being intermediate in character we know also that the male element can act directly on the partially developed tissues of the motherplant and on the future progeny of female animals the formative matter which is thus dispersed throughout the tissues of plants and which is capable of being developed into each unit or part must be generated there by some means and my chief assumption is that this matter consists of minute particles or gemmules cast off from each unit or cell 2743 mr lowne has observed journal of queckett microscopical club september 23 1870 certain remarkable changes in the tissues of the larva of a fly which makes him believe it possible that organs and organisms are sometimes developed by the aggregation of excessively minute gemmules such as those which mr darwins hypothesis demands  but i have further to assume that the gemmules in their undeveloped state are capable of largely multiplying themselves by selfdivision like independent organisms delpino insists that to admit of multiplication by fissiparity in corpuscles analogous to seeds or budsis repugnant to all analogy but this seems a strange objection as thuret 2744 annales des sc nat 3rd series bot tome 14 1850 page 244 has seen the zoospore of an alga divide itself and each half germinated haeckel divided the segmented ovum of a siphonophora into many pieces and these were developed nor does the extreme minuteness of the gemmules which can hardly differ much in nature from the lowest and simplest organisms render it improbable that they should grow and multiply a great authority dr beale 2745 disease germs page 20 says that minute yeast cells are capable of throwing off buds or gemmules much less than the 1100000 of an inch in diameter and these he thinks are capable of subdivision

scarlet fever 2746 see some very interesting papers on this subject by dr beale in medical times and gazette september 9 1865 pages 273 330 it has recently been ascertained 2747 third report of the r comm on the cattle plague as quoted in gardeners chronicle 1866 page 446 that a minute portion of the mucous discharge from an animal affected with rinderpest if placed in the blood of a healthy ox increases so fast that in a short space of time the whole mass of blood weighing many pounds is infected and every small particle of that blood contains enough poison to give within less than fortyeight hours the disease to another animal  the retention of free and undeveloped gemmules in the same body from early youth to old age will appear improbable but we should remember how long seeds lie dormant in the earth and buds in the bark of a tree their transmission from generation to generation will appear still more improbable but here again we should remember that many rudimentary and useless organs have been transmitted during an indefinite number of generations we shall presently see how well the longcontinued transmission of undeveloped gemmules explains many facts  as each unit or group of similar units throughout the body casts off its gemmules and as all are contained within the smallest ovule and within each spermatozoon or pollengrain and as some animals and plants produce an astonishing number of pollengrains and ovules 2748 mr f buckland found 6867840 eggs in a codfish land and water 1868 page 62 an ascaris produces about 64000000 eggs carpenters comp phys 1854 page 590 mr j scott of the royal botanic garden of edinburgh calculated in the same manner as i have done for some british orchids fertilisation of orchids page 344 the number of seeds in a capsule of an acropera and found the number to be 371250 now this plant produces several flowers on a raceme and many racemes during a season in an allied genus gongora mr scott has seen twenty capsules produced on a single raceme ten such racemes on the acropera would yield above seventyfour millions of seed the number and minuteness of the gemmules must be something inconceivable but considering how minute the molecules are and how many go to the formation of the smallest granule of any ordinary substance this difficulty with respect to the gemmules is not insuperable from the data arrived at by sir w thomson my son george finds that a cube of 110000 of an inch of glass or water must consist of between 16 million millions and 131 thousand million million molecules no doubt the molecules of which an organism is formed are larger from being more complex than those of an inorganic substance and probably many molecules go to the formation of a gemmule but when we bear in mind that a cube of 110000 of an inch is much smaller than any pollengrain ovule or bud we can see what a vast number of gemmules one of these bodies might contain  the gemmules derived from each part or organ must be thoroughly dispersed throughout the whole system we know for instance that even a minute fragment of a leaf of a begonia will reproduce the whole plant and that if a freshwater worm is chopped into small pieces each will reproduce the whole animal considering also the minuteness of the gemmules and the permeability of all organic tissues the thorough dispersion of the gemmules is not surprising that matter may be readily transferred without the aid of vessels from part to part of the body we have a good instance in a case recorded by sir j paget of a lady whose hair lost its colour at each successive attack of neuralgia and recovered it again in the course of a few days with plants however and probably with compound animals such as corals the gemmules do not ordinarily spread from bud to bud but are confined to the parts developed from each separate bud and of this fact no explanation can be given  the assumed elective affinity of each gemmule for that particular cell which precedes it in due order of development is supported by many analogies in all ordinary cases of sexual reproduction the male and female elements certainly have a mutual affinity for each other thus it is believed that about ten thousand species of compositae exist and there can be no doubt that if the pollen of all these species could be simultaneously or successively placed on the stigma of any one species this one would elect with unerring certainty its own pollen this elective capacity is all the more wonderful as it must have been acquired since the many species of this great group of plants branched off from a common progenitor on any view of the nature of sexual reproduction the formative matter of each part contained within the ovules and the male element act on each other by some law of special affinity so that corresponding parts affect one another thus a calf produced from a shorthorned cow by a longhorned bull has its horns affected by the union of the two forms and the offspring from two birds with differently coloured tails have their tails affected  the various tissues of the body plainly show as many physiologists have insisted 2749 paget lectures on pathology page 27 virchow cellular pathology translated by dr chance pages 123 126 294 claude bernard des tissus vivants pages 177 210 337 muller physiology english translation page 290 an affinity for special organic substances whether natural or foreign to the body we see this in the cells of the kidneys attracting urea from the blood in curare affecting certain nerves lytta vesicatoria the kidneys and the poisonous matter of various diseases as smallpox scarlet fever hoopingcough glanders and hydrophobia affecting certain definite parts of the body it has also been assumed that the development of each gemmule depends on its union with another cell or unit which has just commenced its development and which precedes it in due order of growth that the formative matter within the pollen of plants which by our hypothesis consists of gemmules can unite with and modify the partially developed cells of the motherplant we have clearly seen in the section devoted to this subject as the tissues of plants are formed as far as is known only by the proliferation of preexisting cells we must conclude that the gemmules derived from the foreign pollen do not become developed into new and separate cells but penetrate and modify the nascent cells of the motherplant this process may be compared with what takes place in the act of ordinary fertilisation during which the contents of the pollentubes penetrate the closed embryonic sac within the ovule and determine the development of the embryo according to this view the cells of the motherplant may almost literally be said to be fertilised by the gemmules derived from the foreign pollen in this case and in all others the proper gemmules must combine in due order with preexisting nascent cells owing to their elective affinities a slight difference in nature between the gemmules and the nascent cells would be far from interfering with their mutual union and development for we well know in the case of ordinary reproduction that such slight differentiation in the sexual elements favours in a marked manner their union and subsequent development as well as the vigour of the offspring thus produced  thus far we have been able by the aid of our hypothesis to throw some obscure light on the problems which have come before us but it must be confessed that many points remain altogether doubtful thus it is useless to speculate at what period of development each unit of the body casts off its gemmules as the whole subject of the development of the various tissues is as yet far from clear we do not know whether the gemmules are merely collected by some unknown means at certain seasons within the reproductive organs or whether after being thus collected they rapidly multiply there as the flow of blood to these organs at each breeding season seems to render probable nor do we know why the gemmules collect to form buds in certain definite places leading to the symmetrical growth of trees and corals we have no means of deciding whether the ordinary wear and tear of the tissues is made good by means of gemmules or merely by the proliferation of preexisting cells if the gemmules are thus consumed as seems probable from the intimate connection between the repair of waste regrowth and development and more especially from the periodical changes which many male animals undergo in colour and structure then some light would be thrown on the phenomena of old age with its lessened power of reproduction and of the repair of injuries and on the obscure subject of longevity the fact of castrated animals which do not cast off innumerable gemmules in the act of reproduction not being longerlived than perfect males seems opposed to the belief that gemmules are consumed in the ordinary repair of wasted tissues unless indeed the gemmules after being collected in small numbers within the reproductive organs are there largely multiplied 2750 prof ray lankester has discussed several of the points here referred to as bearing on pangenesis in his interesting essay on comparative longevity in man and the lower animals 1870 pages 33 77 etc  that the same cells or units may live for a long period and continue multiplying without being modified by their union with free gemmules of any kind is probable from such cases as that of the spur of a cock which grew to an enormous size when grafted into the ear of an ox how far units are modified during their normal growth by absorbing peculiar nutriment from the surrounding tissues independently of their union with gemmules of a distinct nature is another doubtful point 2751 dr ross refers to this subject in his graft theory of disease 1872 page 53 we shall appreciate this difficulty by calling to mind what complex yet symmetrical growths the cells of plants yield when inoculated by the poison of a gallinsect with animals various polypoid excrescences and tumours are generally admitted 2752 virchow cellular pathology translated by dr chance 1860 pages 60 162 245 441 454 to be the direct product through proliferation of normal cells which have become abnormal in the regular growth and repair of bones the tissues undergo as virchow remarks 2753 ibid pages 412426 a whole series of permutations and substitutions the cartilage cells may be converted by a direct transformation into marrowcells and continue as such or they may first be converted into osseous and then into medullary tissue or lastly they may first be converted into marrow and then into bone so variable are the permutations of these tissues in themselves so nearly allied and yet in their external appearance so completely distinct but as these tissues thus change their nature at any age without any obvious change in their nutrition we must suppose in accordance with our hypothesis that gemmules derived from one kind of tissue combine with the cells of another kind and cause the successive modifications  we have good reason to believe that several gemmules are requisite for the development of one and the same unit or cell for we cannot otherwise understand the insufficiency of a single or even of two or three pollengrains or spermatozoa but we are far from knowing whether the gemmules of all the units are free and separate from one another or whether some are from the first united into small aggregates a feather for instance is a complex structure and as each separate part is liable to inherited variations i conclude that each feather generates a large number of gemmules but it is possible that these may be aggregated into a compound gemmule the same remark applies to the petals of flowers which are sometimes highly complex structures with each ridge and hollow contrived for a special purpose so that each part must have been separately modified and the modifications transmitted consequently separate gemmules according to our hypothesis must have been thrown off from each cell or unit but as we sometimes see half an anther or a small portion of a filament becoming petaliform or parts or mere stripes of the calyx assuming the colour and texture of the corolla it is probable that with petals the gemmules of each cell are not aggregated together into a compound gemmule but are free and separate even in so simple a case as that of a perfect cell with its protoplasmic contents nucleus nucleolus and walls we do not know whether or not its development depends on a compound gemmule derived from each part 2754 see some good criticisms on this head by delpino and by mr gh lewes in the fortnightly review november 1 1868 page 509  having now endeavoured to show that the several foregoing assumptions are to a certain extent supported by analogous facts and having alluded to some of the most doubtful points we will consider how far the hypothesis brings under a single point of view the various cases enumerated in the first part all the forms of reproduction graduate into one another and agree in their product for it is impossible to distinguish between organisms produced from buds from selfdivision or from fertilised germs such organisms are liable to variations of the same nature and to reversions of the same kind and as according to our hypothesis all the forms of reproduction depend on the aggregation of gemmules derived from the whole body we can understand this remarkable agreement parthenogenesis is no longer wonderful and if we did not know that great good followed from the union of the sexual elements derived from two distinct individuals the wonder would be that parthenogenesis did not occur much oftener than it does on any ordinary theory of reproduction the formation of grafthybrids and the action of the male element on the tissues of the motherplant as well as on the future progeny of female animals are great anomalies but they are intelligible on our hypothesis the reproductive organs do not actually create the sexual elements they merely determine the aggregation and perhaps the multiplication of the gemmules in a special manner these organs however together with their accessory parts have high functions to perform they adapt one or both elements for independent temporary existence and for mutual union the stigmatic secretion acts on the pollen of a plant of the same species in a wholly different manner to what it does on the pollen of one belonging to a distinct genus or family the spermatophores of the cephalopoda are wonderfully complex structures which were formerly mistaken for parasitic worms and the spermatozoa of some animals possess attributes which if observed in an independent animal would be put down to instinct guided by senseorgansas when the spermatozoa of an insect find their way into the minute micropyle of the egg  the antagonism which has long been observed 2755 mr herbert spencer principles of biology volume 2 page 430 has fully discussed this antagonism with certain exceptions between growth and the power of sexual reproduction 2756 the male salmon is known to breed at a very early age the triton and siredon whilst retaining their larval branchiae according to filippi and dumeril annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series 1866 page 157 are capable of reproduction ernst haeckel has recently monatsbericht akad wiss berlin february 2 1865 observed the surprising case of a medusa with its reproductive organs active which produces by budding a widely different form of medusa and this latter also has the power of sexual reproduction krohn has shown annals and mag of nat hist 3rd series volume 19 1862 page 6 that certain other medusae whilst sexually mature propagate by gemmae see also kolliker morphologie und entwickelungsgeschichte des pennatulidenstammes 1872 page 12between the repair of injuries and gemmationand with plants between rapid increase by buds rhizomes etc and the production of seed is partly explained by the gemmules not existing in sufficient numbers for these processes to be carried on simultaneously  hardly any fact in physiology is more wonderful than the power of regrowth for instance that a snail should be able to reproduce its head or a salamander its eyes tail and legs exactly at the points where they have been cut off such cases are explained by the presence of gemmules derived from each part and disseminated throughout the body i have heard the process compared with that of the repair of the broken angles of a crystal by re crystallisation and the two processes have this much in common that in the one case the polarity of the molecules is the efficient cause and in the other the affinity of the gemmules for particular nascent cells but we have here to encounter two objections which apply not only to the regrowth of a part or of a bisected individual but to fissiparous generation and budding the first objection is that the part which is reproduced is in the same stage of development as that of the being which has been operated on or bisected and in the case of buds that the new beings thus produced are in the same stage as that of the budding parent thus a mature salamander of which the tail has been cut off does not reproduce a larval tail and a crab does not reproduce a larval leg in the case of budding it was shown in the first part of this chapter that the new being thus produced does not retrograde in developmentthat is does not pass through those earlier stages which the fertilised germ has to pass through nevertheless the organisms operated on or multiplying themselves by buds must by our hypothesis include innumerable gemmules derived from every part or unit of the earlier stages of development and why do not such gemmules reproduce the amputated part or the whole body at a corresponding early stage of development  the second objection which has been insisted on by delpino is that the tissues for instance of a mature salamander or crab of which a limb has been removed are already differentiated and have passed through their whole course of development and how can such tissues in accordance with our hypothesis attract and combine with the gemmules of the part which is to be reproduced in answer to these two objections we must bear in mind the evidence which has been advanced showing that at least in a large number of cases the power of regrowth is a localised faculty acquired for the sake of repairing special injuries to which each particular creature is liable and in the case of buds or fissiparous generation for the sake of quickly multiplying the organism at a period of life when it can be supported in large numbers these considerations lead us to believe that in all such cases a stock of nascent cells or of partially developed gemmules are retained for this special purpose either locally or throughout the body ready to combine with the gemmules derived from the cells which come next in due succession if this be admitted we have a sufficient answer to the above two objections anyhow pangenesis seems to throw a considerable amount of light on the wonderful power of regrowth  it follows also from the view just given that the sexual elements differ from buds in not including nascent cells or gemmules in a somewhat advanced stage of development so that only the gemmules belonging to the earliest stages are first developed as young animals and those which stand low in the scale generally have a much greater capacity for regrowth than older and higher animals it would also appear that they retain cells in a nascent state or partially developed gemmules more readily than do animals which have already passed through a long series of developmental changes i may here add that although ovules can be detected in most or all female animals at an extremely early age there is no reason to doubt that gemmules derived from parts modified during maturity can pass into the ovules  with respect to hybridism pangenesis agrees well with most of the ascertained facts we must believe as previously shown that several gemmules are requisite for the development of each cell or unit but from the occurrence of parthenogenesis more especially from those cases in which an embryo is only partially formed we may infer that the female element generally includes gemmules in nearly sufficient number for independent development so that when united with the male element the gemmules are superabundant now when two species or races are crossed reciprocally the offspring do not commonly differ and this shows that the sexual elements agree in power in accordance with the view that both include the same gemmules hybrids and mongrels are also generally intermediate in character between the two parentforms yet occasionally they closely resemble one parent in one part and the other parent in another part or even in their whole structure nor is this difficult to understand on the admission that the gemmules in the fertilised germ are superabundant in number and that those derived from one parent may have some advantage in number affinity or vigour over those derived from the other parent crossed forms sometimes exhibit the colour or other characters of either parent in stripes or blotches and this occurs in the first generation or through reversion in succeeding bud and seminal generations of which fact several instances were given in the eleventh chapter in these cases we must follow naudin 2757 see his excellent discussion on this subject in nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 151 and admit that the essence or element of the two speciesterms which i should translate into the gemmuleshave an affinity for their own kind and thus separate themselves into distinct stripes or blotches and reasons were given when discussing in the fifteenth chapter the incompatibility of certain characters to unite for believing in such mutual affinity when two forms are crossed one is not rarely found to be prepotent in the transmission of its characters over the other and this we can explain by again assuming that the one form has some advantage over the other in the number vigour or affinity of its gemmules in some cases however certain characters are present in the one form and latent in the other for instance there is a latent tendency in all pigeons to become blue and when a blue pigeon is crossed with one of any other colour the blue tint is generally prepotent the explanation of this form of prepotency will be obvious when we come to the consideration of reversion  when two distinct species are crossed it is notorious that they do not yield the full or proper number of offspring and we can only say on this head that as the development of each organism depends on such nicelybalanced affinities between a host of gemmules and nascent cells we need not feel at all surprised that the commixture of gemmules derived from two distinct species should lead to partial or complete failure of development with respect to the sterility of hybrids produced from the union of two distinct species it was shown in the nineteenth chapter that this depends exclusively on the reproductive organs being specially affected but why these organs should be thus affected we do not know any more than why unnatural conditions of life though compatible with health should cause sterility or why continued close interbreeding or the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants induce the same result the conclusion that the reproductive organs alone are affected and not the whole organisation agrees perfectly with the unimpaired or even increased capacity in hybrid plants for propagation by buds for this implies according to our hypothesis that the cells of the hybrids throw off hybridised gemmules which become aggregated into buds but fail to become aggregated within the reproductive organs so as to form the sexual elements in a similar manner many plants when placed under unnatural conditions fail to produce seed but can readily be propagated by buds we shall presently see that pangenesis agrees well with the strong tendency to reversion exhibited by all crossed animals and plants  each organism reaches maturity through a longer or shorter course of growth and development the former term being confined to mere increase of size and development to changed structure the changes may be small and insensibly slow as when a child grows into a man or many abrupt and slight as in the metamorphoses of certain ephemerous insects or again few and strongly marked as with most other insects each newly formed part may be moulded within a previously existing and corresponding part and in this case it will appear falsely as i believe to be developed from the old part or it may be formed within a distinct part of the body as in the extreme cases of metagenesis an eye for instance may be developed at a spot where no eye previously existed we have also seen that allied organic beings in the course of their metamorphoses sometimes attain nearly the same structure after passing through widely different forms or conversely after passing through nearly the same early forms arrive at widely different mature forms in these cases it is very difficult to accept the common view that the firstformed cells or units possess the inherent power independently of any external agency of producing new structures wholly different in form position and function but all these cases become plain on the hypothesis of pangenesis the units during each stage of development throw off gemmules which multiplying are transmitted to the offspring in the offspring as soon as any particular cell or unit becomes partially developed it unites with or to speak metaphorically is fertilised by the gemmule of the next succeeding cell and so onwards but organisms have often been subjected to changed conditions of life at a certain stage of their development and in consequence have been slightly modified and the gemmules cast off from such modified parts will tend to reproduce parts modified in the same manner this process may be repeated until the structure of the part becomes greatly changed at one particular stage of development but this will not necessarily affect other parts whether previously or subsequently formed in this manner we can understand the remarkable independence of structure in the successive metamorphoses and especially in the successive metageneses of many animals in the case however of diseases which supervene during old age subsequently to the ordinary period of procreation and which nevertheless are sometimes inherited as occurs with brain and heart complaints we must suppose that the organs were affected at an early age and threw off at this period affected gemmules but that the affection became visible or injurious only after the prolonged growth in the strict sense of the word of the part in all the changes of structure which regularly supervene during old age we probably see the effects of deteriorated growth and not of true development  the principle of the independent formation of each part owing to the union of the proper gemmules with certain nascent cells together with the superabundance of the gemmules derived from both parents and the subsequent selfmultiplication of the gemmules throws light on a widely different group of facts which on any ordinary view of development appears very strange i allude to organs which are abnormally transposed or multiplied for instance a curious case has been recorded by dr elliott coues 2758 proc boston soc of nat hist republished in scientific opinion november 10 1869 page 488 of a monstrous chicken with a perfect additional right leg articulated to the left side of the pelvis goldfish often have supernumerary fins placed on various parts of their bodies when the tail of a lizard is broken off a double tail is sometimes reproduced and when the foot

remarks 2760 compte rendus november 14 1865 page 800 cannot be due to the complete fusion of two embryos with the exception of the limbs for the larvae are limbless the same argument is applicable

antennaeless larvae alphonse milneedwards 2762 gunther zoological record 1864 page 279 has described the curious case of a crustacean in which one eyepeduncle supported instead of a complete eye only an imperfect cornea and out of the centre of this a portion of an antenna was developed a case has been recorded 2763 sedgwick medicochirurg review april 1863 page 454 of a man who had during both

pigeons and fowls feathers like those on the wing arise from the outer side of the legs and toes even the elemental parts of the same feather may be transposed for in the sebastopol goose barbules are developed on the divided filaments of the shaft imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps of the amputated fingers of man 2766 muller phys english translation volume 1 1833 page 407 a case of this kind has lately been communicated to me and it is an interesting fact that with the snakelike saurians which present a series with more and more imperfect limbs the terminations of the phalanges first disappear the nails becoming transferred to their proximal remnants or even to parts which are not phalanges 2767 dr furbringer die knochen etc bei den schlangenahnlichen sauriern as reviewed in journal of anat and phys may 1870 page 286  analogous cases are of such frequent occurrence with plants that they do not strike us with sufficient surprise supernumerary petals stamens and pistils are often produced i have seen a leaflet low down in the compound leaf of vicia sativa replaced by a tendril and a tendril possesses many peculiar properties such as spontaneous movement and irritability the calyx sometimes assumes either wholly or by stripes the colour and texture of the corolla stamens are so frequently converted into petals more or less completely that such cases are passed over as not deserving notice but as petals have special functions to perform namely to protect the included organs to attract insects and in not a few cases to guide their entrance by welladapted contrivances we can hardly account for the conversion of stamens into petals merely by unnatural or superfluous nourishment again the edge of a petal may occasionally be found including one of the highest products of the plant namely pollen for instance i have seen the pollenmass of an ophrys which is a very complex structure developed in the edge of an upper petal the segments of the calyx of the common pea have been observed partially converted into carpels including ovules and with their tips converted into stigmas mr salter and dr maxwell masters have found pollen within the ovules of the passionflower and of the rose buds may be developed in the most unnatural positions as on the petal of a flower numerous analogous facts could be given 2768 moquintandon teratologie veg 1841 pages 218 220 353 for the case of the pea see gardeners chronicle 1866 page 897 with respect to pollen within ovules see dr masters in science review october 1873 page 369 the rev jm berkeley describes a bud developed on a petal of a clarkia in gardeners chronicle april 28 1866  i do not know how physiologists look at such facts as the foregoing according to the doctrine of pangenesis the gemmules of the transposed organs become developed in the wrong place from uniting with wrong cells or aggregates of cells during their nascent state and this would follow from a slight modification in their elective affinities nor ought we to feel much surprise at the affinities of cells and gemmules varying when we remember the many curious cases given in the seventeenth chapter of plants which absolutely refuse to be fertilised by their own pollen though abundantly fertile with that of any other individual of the same species and in some cases only with that of a distinct species it is manifest that the sexual elective affinities of such plantsto use the term employed by gartnerhave been modified as the cells of adjoining or homologous parts will have nearly the same nature they will be particularly liable to acquire by variation each others elective affinities and we can thus understand to a certain extent such cases as a crowd of horns on the heads of certain sheep of several spurs on the legs of fowls hacklelike feathers on the heads of the males of other fowls and with the pigeon winglike feathers on their legs and membrane between their toes for the leg is the homologue of the wing as all the organs of plants are homologous and spring from a common axis it is natural that they should be eminently liable to transposition it ought to be observed that when any compound part such as an additional limb or an antenna springs from a false position it is only necessary that the few first gemmules should be wrongly attached for these whilst developing would attract other gemmules in due succession as in the regrowth of an amputated limb when parts which are homologous and similar in structure as the vertebrae of snakes or the stamens of polyandrous flowers etc are repeated many times in the same organism closely allied gemmules must be extremely numerous as well as the points to which they ought to become united and in accordance with the foregoing views we can to a certain extent understand isid geoffroy sainthilaires law that parts which are already multiple are extremely liable to vary in number  variability often depends as i have attempted to show on the reproductive organs being injuriously affected by changed conditions and in this case the gemmules derived from the various parts of the body are probably aggregated in an irregular manner some superfluous and others deficient whether a superabundance of gemmules would lead to the increased size of any part cannot be told but we can see that their partial deficiency without necessarily leading to the entire abortion of the part might cause considerable modifications for in the same manner as plants if their own pollen be excluded are easily hybridised so in the case of cells if the properly succeeding gemmules were absent they would probably combine easily with other and allied gemmules as we have just seen with transposed parts  in variations caused by the direct action of changed conditions of which several instances have been given certain parts of the body are directly affected by the new conditions and consequently throw off modified gemmules which are transmitted to the offspring on any ordinary view it is unintelligible how changed conditions whether acting on the embryo the young or the adult can cause inherited modifications it is equally or even more unintelligible on any ordinary view how the effects of the longcontinued use or disuse of a part or of changed habits of body or mind can be inherited a more perplexing problem can hardly be proposed but on our view we have only to suppose that certain cells become at last structurally modified and that these throw off similarly modified gemmules this may occur at any period of development and the modification will be inherited at a corresponding period for the modified gemmules will unite in all ordinary cases with the proper preceding cells and will consequently be developed at the same period at which the modification first arose with respect to mental habits or instincts we are so profoundly ignorant of the relation between the brain and the power of thought that we do not know positively whether a fixed habit induces any change in the nervous system though this seems highly probable but when such habit or other mental attribute or insanity is inherited we must believe that some actual modification is transmitted 2769 see some remarks to this effect by sir h holland in his medical notes 1839 page 32 and this implies according to our hypothesis that gemmules derived from modified nervecells are transmitted to the offspring  it is generally necessary that an organism should be exposed during several generations to changed conditions or habits in order that any modification thus acquired should appear in the offspring this may be partly due to the changes not being at first marked enough to catch attention but this explanation is insufficient and i can account for the fact only by the assumption which we shall see under the head of reversion is strongly supported that gemmules derived from each unmodified unit or part are transmitted in large numbers to successive generations and that the gemmules derived from the same unit after it has been modified go on multiplying under the same favourable conditions which first caused the modification until at last they become sufficiently numerous to overpower and supplant the old gemmules  a difficulty may be here noticed we have seen that there is an important difference in the frequency though not in the nature of the variations in plants propagated by sexual and asexual generation as far as variability depends on the imperfect action of the reproductive organs under changed conditions we can at once see why plants propagated asexually should be far less variable than those propagated sexually with respect to the direct action of changed conditions we know that organisms produced from buds do not pass through the earlier phases of development they will therefore not be exposed at that period of life when structure is most readily modified to the various causes inducing variability in the same manner as are embryos and young larval forms but whether this is a sufficient explanation i know not  with respect to variations due to reversion there is a similar difference between plants propagated from buds and seeds many varieties can be propagated securely by buds but generally or invariably revert to their parentforms by seed so also hybridised plants can be multiplied to any extent by buds but are continually liable to reversion by seedthat is to the loss of their hybrid or intermediate character i can offer no satisfactory explanation of these facts plants with variegated leaves phloxes with striped flowers barberries with seedless fruit can all be securely propagated by buds taken from the stem or branches but buds from the roots of these plants almost invariably lose their character and revert to their former condition this latter fact is also inexplicable unless buds developed from the roots are as distinct from those on the stem as is one bud on the stem from another and we know that these latter behave like independent organisms  finally we see that on the hypothesis of pangenesis variability depends on at least two distinct groups of causes firstly the deficiency superabundance and transposition of gemmules and the redevelopment of those which have long been dormant the gemmules themselves not having undergone any modification and such changes will amply account for much fluctuating variability secondly the direct action of changed conditions on the organisation and of the increased use or disuse of parts and in this case the gemmules from the modified units will be themselves modified and when sufficiently multiplied will supplant the old gemmules and be developed into new structures  turning now to the laws of inheritance if we suppose a homogeneous gelatinous protozoon to vary and assume a reddish colour a minute separated particle would naturally as it grew to full size retain the same colour and we should have the simplest form of inheritance 2770 this is the view taken by prof hackel in his generelle morphologie b 2 s 171 who says lediglich die partielle identitat der specifisch constituirten materie im elterlichen und im kindlichen organismus die theilung dieser materie bei der fortpflanzung ist die ursache der erblichkeit precisely the same view may be extended to the infinitely numerous and diversified units of which the whole body of one of the higher animals is composed the separated particles being our gemmules we have already sufficiently discussed by implication the important principle of inheritance at corresponding ages inheritance as limited by sex and by the season of the year for instance with animals becoming white in winter is intelligible if we may believe that the elective affinities of the units of the body are slightly different in the two sexes especially at maturity and in one or both sexes at different seasons so that they unite with different gemmules it should be remembered that in the discussion on the abnormal transposition of organs we have seen reason to believe that such elective affinities are readily modified but i shall soon have to recur to sexual and seasonal inheritance these several laws are therefore explicable to a large extent through pangenesis and on no other hypothesis which has as yet been advanced  but it appears at first sight a fatal objection to our hypothesis that a part or organ may be removed during several successive generations and if the operation be not followed by disease the lost part reappears in the offspring dogs and horses formerly had their tails docked during many generations without any inherited effect although as we have seen there is some reason to believe that the tailless condition of certain sheepdogs is due to such inheritance circumcision has been practised by the jews from a remote period and in most cases the effects of the operation are not visible in the offspring though some maintain that an inherited effect does occasionally appear if inheritance depends on the presence of disseminated gemmules derived from all the units of the body why does not the amputation or mutilation of a part especially if effected on both sexes invariably affect the offspring the answer in accordance with our hypothesis probably is that gemmules multiply and are transmitted during a long series of generationsas we see in the reappearance of zebrine stripes on the horsein the reappearance of muscles and other structures in man which are proper to his lowly organised progenitors and in many other such cases therefore the longcontinued inheritance of a part which has been removed during many generations is no real anomaly for gemmules formerly derived from the part are multiplied and transmitted from generation to generation  we have as yet spoken only of the removal of parts when not followed by morbid action but when the operation is thus followed it is certain that the deficiency is sometimes inherited in a former chapter instances were given as of a cow the loss of whose horn was followed by suppuration and her calves were destitute of a horn on the same side of their heads but the evidence which admits of no doubt is that given by brownsequard with respect to guineapigs which after their sciatic nerves had been divided gnawed off their own gangrenous toes and the toes of their offspring were deficient in at least thirteen instances on the corresponding feet the inheritance of the lost part in several of these cases is all the more remarkable as only one parent was affected but we know that a congenital deficiency is often transmitted from one parent alonefor instance the offspring of hornless cattle of either sex when crossed with perfect animals are often hornless how then in accordance with our hypothesis can we account for mutilations being sometimes strongly inherited if they are followed by diseased action the answer probably is that all the gemmules of the mutilated or amputated part are gradually attracted to the diseased surface during the reparative process and are there destroyed by the morbid action  a few words must be added on the complete abortion of organs when a part becomes diminished by disuse prolonged during many generations the principle of economy of growth together with intercrossing will tend to reduce it still further as previously explained but this will not account for the complete or almost complete obliteration of for instance a minute papilla of cellular tissue representing a pistil or of a microscopically minute nodule of bone representing a tooth in certain cases of suppression not yet completed in which a rudiment occasionally reappears through reversion dispersed gemmules derived from this part must according to our view still exist we must therefore suppose that the cells in union with which the rudiment was formerly developed fail in their affinity for such gemmules except in the occasional cases of reversion but when the abortion is complete and final the gemmules themselves no doubt perish nor is this in any way improbable for though a vast number of active and longdormant gemmules are nourished in each living creature yet there must be some limit to their number and it appears natural that gemmules derived from reduced and useless parts would be more liable to perish than those freshly derived from other parts which are still in full functional activity  the last subject that need be discussed namely reversion rests on the principle that transmission and development though generally acting in conjunction are distinct powers and the transmission of gemmules with their subsequent development shows us how this is possible we plainly see the distinction in the many cases in which a grandfather transmits to his grandson through his daughter characters which she does not or cannot possess but before proceeding it will be advisable to say a few words about latent or dormant characters most or perhaps all of the secondary characters which appertain to one sex lie dormant in the other sex that is gemmules capable of development into the secondary male sexual characters are included within the female and conversely female characters in the male we have evidence of this in certain masculine characters both corporeal and mental appearing in the female when her ovaria are diseased or when they fail to act from old age in like manner female characters appear in castrated males as in the shape of the horns of the ox and in the absence of horns in castrated stags even a slight change in the conditions of life due to confinement sometimes suffices to prevent the development of masculine characters in male animals although their reproductive organs are not permanently injured in the many cases in which masculine characters are periodically renewed these are latent at other seasons inheritance as limited by sex and season being here combined again masculine characters generally lie dormant in male animals until they arrive at the proper age for reproduction the curious case formerly given of a hen which assumed the masculine characters not of her own breed but of a remote progenitor illustrates the close connection between latent sexual characters and ordinary reversion  with those animals and plants which habitually produce several forms as with certain butterflies described by mr wallace in which three female forms and one male form coexist or as with the trimorphic species of lythrum and oxalis gemmules capable of reproducing these different forms must be latent in each individual  insects are occasionally produced with one side or one quarter of their bodies like that of the male with the other half or threequarters like that of the female in such cases the two sides are sometimes wonderfully different in structure and are separated from each other by a sharp line as gemmules derived from every part are present in each individual of both sexes it must be the elective affinities of the nascent cells which in these cases differ abnormally on the two sides of the body almost the same principle comes into play with those animals for instance certain gasteropods and verruca amongst cirripedes which normally have the two sides of the body constructed on a very different plan and yet a nearly equal number of individuals have either side modified in the same remarkable manner  reversion in the ordinary sense of the word acts so incessantly that it evidently forms an essential part of the general law of inheritance it occurs with beings however propagated whether by buds or seminal generation and sometimes may be observed with advancing age even in the same individual the tendency to reversion is often induced by a change of conditions and in the plainest manner by crossing crossed forms of the first generation are generally nearly intermediate in character between their two parents but in the next generation the offspring commonly revert to one or both of their grandparents and occasionally to more remote ancestors how can we account for these facts each unit in a hybrid must throw off according to the doctrine of pangenesis an abundance of hybridised gemmules for crossed plants can be readily and largely propagated by buds but by the same hypothesis dormant gemmules derived from both pure parentforms are likewise present and as these gemmules retain their normal condition they would it is probable be enabled to multiply largely during the lifetime of each hybrid consequently the sexual elements of a hybrid will include both pure and hybridised gemmules and when two hybrids pair the combination of pure gemmules derived from the one hybrid with the pure gemmules of the same parts derived from the other would necessarily lead to complete reversion of character and it is perhaps not too bold a supposition that unmodified and undeteriorated gemmules of the same nature would be especially apt to combine pure gemmules in combination with hybridised gemmules would lead to partial reversion and lastly hybridised gemmules derived from both parenthybrids would simply reproduce the original hybrid form 2771 in these remarks i in fact follow naudin who speaks of the elements or essences of the two species which are crossed see his excellent memoir in the nouvelles archives du museum tome 1 page 151 all these cases and degrees of reversion incessantly occur  it was shown in the fifteenth chapter that certain characters are antagonistic to each other or do not readily blend hence when two animals with antagonistic characters are crossed it might well happen that a sufficiency of gemmules in the male alone for the reproduction of his peculiar characters and in the female alone for the reproduction of her peculiar characters would not be present and in this case dormant gemmules derived from the same part in some remote progenitor might easily gain the ascendancy and cause the reappearance of the longlost character for instance when black and white pigeons or black and white fowls are crossedcolours which do not readily blendblue plumage in the one case evidently derived from the rockpigeon and red plumage in the other case derived from the wild junglecock occasionally reappear with uncrossed breeds the same result follows under conditions which favour the multiplication and development of certain dormant gemmules as when animals become feral and revert to their pristine character a certain number of gemmules being requisite for the development of each character as is known to be the case from several spermatozoa or pollen grains being necessary for fertilisation and time favouring their multiplication will perhaps account for the curious cases insisted on by mr sedgwick of certain diseases which regularly appear in alternate generations this likewise holds good more or less strictly with other weakly inherited modifications hence as i have heard it remarked certain diseases appear to gain strength by the intermission of a generation the transmission of dormant gemmules during many successive generations is hardly in itself more improbable as previously remarked than the retention during many ages of rudimentary organs or even only of a tendency to the production of a rudiment but there is no reason to suppose that dormant gemmules can be transmitted and propagated for ever excessively minute and numerous as they are believed to be an infinite number derived during a long course of modification and descent from each unit of each progenitor could not be supported or nourished by the organism but it does not seem improbable that certain gemmules under favourable conditions should be retained and go on multiplying for a much longer period than others finally on the view here given we certainly gain some insight into the wonderful fact that the child may depart from the type of both its parents and resemble its grandparents or ancestors removed by many hundreds of generations  conclusion  the hypothesis of pangenesis as applied to the several great classes of facts just discussed no doubt is extremely complex but so are the facts the chief assumption is that all the units of the body besides having the universally admitted power of growing by selfdivision throw off minute gemmules which are dispersed through the system nor can this assumption be considered as too bold for we know from the cases of grafthybridisation that formative matter of some kind is present in the tissues of plants which is capable of combining with that included in another individual and of reproducing every unit of the whole organism but we have further to assume that the gemmules grow multiply and aggregate themselves into buds and the sexual elements their development depending on their union with other nascent cells or units they are also believed to be capable of transmission in a dormant state like seeds in the ground to successive generations  in a highlyorganised animal the gemmules thrown off from each different unit throughout the body must be inconceivably numerous and minute each unit of each part as it changes during development and we know that some insects undergo at least twenty metamorphoses must throw off its gemmules but the same cells may long continue to increase by selfdivision and even become modified by absorbing peculiar nutriment without necessarily throwing off modified gemmules all organic beings moreover include many dormant gemmules derived from their grandparents and more remote progenitors but not from all their progenitors these almost infinitely numerous and minute gemmules are contained within each bud ovule spermatozoon and pollengrain such an admission will be declared impossible but number and size are only relative difficulties independent organisms exist which are barely visible under the highest powers of the microscope and their germs must be excessively minute particles of infectious matter so small as to be wafted by the wind or to adhere to smooth paper will multiply so rapidly as to infect within a short time the whole body of a large animal we should also reflect on the admitted number and minuteness of the molecules composing a particle of ordinary matter the difficulty therefore which at first appears insurmountable of believing in the existence of gemmules so numerous and small as they must be according to our hypothesis has no great weight  the units of the body are generally admitted by physiologists to be autonomous i go one step further and assume that they throw off reproductive gemmules thus an organism does not generate its kind as a whole but each separate unit generates its kind it has often been said by naturalists that each cell of a plant has the potential capacity of reproducing the whole plant but it has this power only in virtue of containing gemmules derived from every part when a cell or unit is from some cause modified the gemmules derived from it will be in like manner modified if our hypothesis be provisionally accepted we must look at all the forms of asexual reproduction whether occurring at maturity or during youth as fundamentally the same and dependent on the mutual aggregation and multiplication of the gemmules the regrowth of an amputated limb and the healing of a wound is the same process partially carried out buds apparently include nascent cells belonging to that stage of development at which the budding occurs and these cells are ready to unite with the gemmules derived from the next succeeding cells the sexual elements on the other hand do not include such nascent cells and the male and female elements taken separately do not contain a sufficient number of gemmules for independent development except in the cases of parthenogenesis the development of each being including all the forms of metamorphosis and metagenesis depends on the presence of gemmules thrown off at each period of life and on their development at a corresponding period in union with preceding cells such cells may be said to be fertilised by the gemmules which come next in due order of development thus the act of ordinary impregnation and the development of each part in each being are closely analogous processes the child strictly speaking does not grow into the man but includes germs which slowly and successively become developed and form the man in the child as well as in the adult each part generates the same part inheritance must be looked at as merely a form of growth like the self division of a lowlyorganised unicellular organism reversion depends on the transmission from the forefather to his descendants of dormant gemmules which occasionally become developed under certain known or unknown conditions each animal and plant may be compared with a bed of soil full of seeds some of which soon germinate some lie dormant for a period whilst others perish when we hear it said that a man carries in his constitution the seeds of an inherited disease there is much truth in the expression no other attempt as far as i am aware has been made imperfect as this confessedly is to connect under one point of view these several grand classes of facts an organic being is a microcosma little universe formed of a host of selfpropagating organisms inconceivably minute and numerous as the stars in heaven   chapter 2xxviii  concluding remarks  domestication nature and causes of variability selection divergence and distinctness of character extinction of races circumstances favourable to selection by man antiquity of certain races the question whether each particular variation has been specially preordained  as summaries have been added to nearly all the chapters and as in the chapter on pangenesis various subjects such as the forms of reproduction inheritance reversion the causes and laws of variability etc have been recently discussed i will here only make a few general remarks on the more important conclusions which may be deduced from the multifarious details given throughout this work  savages in all parts of the world easily succeed in taming wild animals and those inhabiting any country or island when first visited by man would probably have been still more easily tamed complete subjugation generally depends on an animal being social in its habits and on receiving man as the chief of the herd or family in order that an animal should be domesticated it must be fertile under changed conditions of life and this is far from being always the case an animal would not have been worth the labour of domestication at least during early times unless of service to man from these circumstances the number of domesticated animals has never been large with respect to plants i have shown in the ninth chapter how their varied uses were probably first discovered and the early steps in their cultivation man could not have known when he first domesticated an animal or plant whether it would flourish and multiply when transported to other countries therefore he could not have been thus influenced in his choice we see that the close adaptation of the reindeer and camel to extremely cold and hot countries has not prevented their domestication still less could man have foreseen whether his animals and plants would vary in succeeding generations and thus give birth to new races and the small capacity of variability in the goose has not prevented its domestication from a remote epoch  with extremely few exceptions all animals and plants which have been long domesticated have varied greatly it matters not under what climate or for what purpose they are kept whether as food for man or beast for draught or hunting for clothing or mere pleasureunder all these circumstances races have been produced which differ more from one another than do the forms which in a state of nature are ranked as different species why certain animals and plants have varied more under domestication than others we do not know any more than why some are rendered more sterile than others under changed conditions of life but we have to judge of the amount of variation which our domestic productions have undergone chiefly by the number and amount of difference between the races which have been formed and we can often clearly see why many and distinct races have not been formed namely because slight successive variations have not been steadily accumulated and such variations will never be accumulated if an animal or plant be not closely observed much valued and kept in large numbers  the fluctuating and as far as we can judge neverending variability of our domesticated productionsthe plasticity of almost their whole organisation is one of the most important lessons which we learn from the numerous details given in the earlier chapters of this work yet domesticated animals and plants can hardly have been exposed to greater changes in their conditions of life than have many natural species during the incessant geological geographical and climatal changes to which the world has been subject but domesticated productions will often have been exposed to more sudden changes and to less continuously uniform conditions as man has domesticated so many animals and plants belonging to widely different classes and as he certainly did not choose with prophetic instinct those species which would vary most we may infer that all natural species if exposed to analogous conditions would on an average vary to the same degree few men at the present day will maintain that animals and plants were created with a tendency to vary which long remained dormant in order that fanciers in after ages might rear for instance curious breeds of the fowl pigeon or canarybird  from several causes it is difficult to judge of the amount of modification which our domestic productions have undergone in some cases the primitive parentstock has become extinct or it cannot be recognised with certainty owing to its supposed descendants having been so much modified in other cases two or more closelyallied forms after being domesticated have crossed and then it is difficult to estimate how much of the character of the present descendants ought to be attributed to variation and how much to the influence of the several parentstocks but the degree to which our domesticated breeds have been modified by the crossing of distinct species has probably been much exaggerated by some authors a few individuals of one form would seldom permanently affect another form existing in greater numbers for without careful selection the stain of the foreign blood would soon be obliterated and during early and barbarous times when our animals were first domesticated such care would seldom have been taken  there is good reason to believe in the case of the dog ox pig and of some other animals that several of our races are descended from distinct wild prototypes nevertheless the belief in the multiple origin of our domesticated animals has been extended by some few naturalists and by many breeders to an unauthorised extent breeders refuse to look at the whole subject under a single point of view i have heard it said by a man who maintained that our fowls were descended from at least halfadozen aboriginal species that the evidence of the common origin of pigeons ducks and rabbits was of no avail with respect to fowls breeders overlook the improbability of many species having been domesticated at an early and barbarous period they do not consider the improbability of species having existed in a state of nature which if they resembled our present domestic breeds would have been highly abnormal in comparison with all their congeners they maintain that certain species which formerly existed have become extinct or are now unknown although formerly known the assumption of so much recent extinction is no difficulty in their eyes for they do not judge of its probability by the facility or difficulty of the extinction of other closelyallied wild forms lastly they often ignore the whole subject of geographical distribution as completely as if it were the result of chance  although from the reasons just assigned it is often difficult to judge accurately of the amount of change which our domesticated productions have undergone yet this can be ascertained in the cases in which all the breeds are known to be descended from a single speciesas with the pigeon duck rabbit and almost certainly with the fowl and by the aid of analogy this can be judged of to a certain extent with domesticated animals descended from several wild stocks it is impossible to read the details given in the earlier chapters and in many published works or to visit our various exhibitions without being deeply impressed with the extreme variability of our domesticated animals and cultivated plants no part of the organisation escapes the tendency to vary the variations generally affect parts of small vital or physiological importance but so it is with the differences which exist between closelyallied species in these unimportant characters there is often a greater difference between the breeds of the same species than between the natural species of the same genus as isidore geoffroy has shown to be the case with size and as is often the case with the colour texture form etc of the hair feathers horns and other dermal appendages  it has often been asserted that important parts never vary under domestication but this is a complete error look at the skull of the pig in any one of the highly improved breeds with the occipital condyles and other parts greatly modified or look at that of the niata ox or again in the several breeds of the rabbit observe the elongated skull with the differently shaped occipital foramen atlas and other cervical vertebrae the whole shape of the brain together with the skull has been modified in polish fowls in other breeds of the fowl the number of the vertebrae and the forms of the cervical vertebrae have been changed in certain pigeons the shape of the lower jaw the relative length of the tongue the size of the nostrils and eyelids the number and shape of the ribs the form and size of the oesophagus have all varied in certain quadrupeds the length of the intestines has been much increased or diminished with plants we see wonderful differences in the stones of various fruits in the cucurbitaceae several highly important characters have varied such as the sessile position of the stigmas on the ovarium the position of the carpels and the projection of the ovarium out of the receptacle but it would be useless to run through the many facts given in the earlier chapters  it is notorious how greatly the mental disposition tastes habits consensual movements loquacity or silence and tone of voice have varied and been inherited in our domesticated animals the dog offers the most striking instance of changed mental attributes and these differences cannot be accounted for by descent from distinct wild types  new characters may appear and old ones disappear at any stage of development being inherited at a corresponding stage we see this in the difference between the eggs the down on the chickens and the first plumage of the various breeds of the fowl and still more plainly in the differences between the caterpillars and cocoons of the various breeds of the silkmoth these facts simple as they appear throw light on the differences between the larval and adult states of allied natural species and on the whole great subject of embryology new characters first appearing late in life are apt to become attached exclusively to that sex in which they first arose or they may be developed in a much higher degree in this than in the other sex or again after having become attached to one sex they may be transferred to the opposite sex these facts and more especially the circumstance that new characters seem to be particularly liable from some unknown cause to become attached to the male sex have an important bearing on the acquirement of secondary sexual characters by animals in a state of nature  it has sometimes been said that our domestic races do not differ in constitutional peculiarities but this cannot be maintained in our improved cattle pigs etc the period of maturity including that of the second dentition has been much hastened the period of gestation varies much and has been modified in a fixed manner in one or two cases in some breeds of poultry and pigeons the period at which the down and the first plumage are acquired differs the number of moults through which the larvae of silkmoths pass varies the tendency to fatten to yield much milk to produce many young or eggs at a birth or during life differs in different breeds we find different degrees of adaptation to climate and different tendencies to certain diseases to the attacks of parasites and to the action of certain vegetable poisons with plants adaptation to certain soils the power of resisting frost the period of flowering and fruiting the duration of life the period of shedding the leaves or of retaining them throughout the winter the proportion and nature of certain chemical compounds in the tissues or seeds all vary  there is however one important constitutional difference between domestic races and species i refer to the sterility which almost invariably follows in a greater or less degree when species are crossed and to the perfect fertility of the most distinct domestic races with the exception of a very few plants when similarly crossed it is certainly a most remarkable fact that many closelyallied species which in appearance differ extremely little should yield when crossed only a few more or less sterile offspring or none at all whilst domestic races which differ conspicuously from each other are when united remarkably fertile and yield perfectly fertile offspring but this fact is not in reality so inexplicable as it at first appears in the first place it was clearly shown in the nineteenth chapter that the sterility of crossed species does not depend chiefly on differences in their external structure or general constitution but on differences in the reproductive system analogous to those which cause the lessened fertility of the illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants in the second place the pallasian doctrine that species after having been long domesticated lose their natural tendency to sterility when crossed has been shown to be highly probable or almost certain we cannot avoid this conclusion when we reflect on the parentage and present fertility of the several breeds of the dog of the indian or humped and european cattle and of the two chief kinds of pigs hence it would be unreasonable to expect that races formed under domestication should acquire sterility when crossed whilst at the same time we admit that domestication eliminates the normal sterility of crossed species why with closelyallied species their reproductive systems should almost invariably have been modified in so peculiar a manner as to be mutually incapable of acting on each otherthough in unequal degrees in the two sexes as shown by the difference in fertility between reciprocal crosses of the same specieswe do not know but may with much probability infer the cause to be as follows most natural species have been habituated to nearly uniform conditions of life for an incomparably longer time than have domestic races and we positively know that changed conditions exert an especial and powerful influence on the reproductive system hence this difference may well account for the difference in the power of reproduction between domestic races when crossed and species when crossed it is probably in chief part owing to the same cause that domestic races can be suddenly transported from one climate to another or placed under widely different conditions and yet retain in most cases their fertility unimpaired whilst a multitude of species subjected to lesser changes are rendered incapable of breeding  the offspring of crossed domestic races and of crossed species resemble each other in most respects with the one important exception of fertility they often partake in the same unequal degree of the characters of their parents one of which is often prepotent over the other and they are liable to reversion of the same kind by successive crosses one species may be made to absorb completely another and so it notoriously is with races the latter resemble species in many other ways they sometimes inherit their newly acquired characters almost or even quite as firmly as species the conditions leading to variability and the laws governing its nature appear to be the same in both varieties can be classed in groups under groups like species under genera and these under families and orders and the classification may be either artificialthat is founded on any arbitrary characteror natural with varieties a natural classification is certainly founded and with species is apparently founded on community of descent together with the amount of modification which the forms have undergone the characters by which domestic varieties differ from one another are more variable than those distinguishing species though hardly more so than with certain polymorphic species but this greater degree of variability is not surprising as varieties have generally been exposed within recent times to fluctuating conditions of life and are much more liable to have been crossed they are also in many cases still undergoing or have recently undergone modification by mans methodical or unconscious selection  domestic varieties as a general rule certainly differ from one another in less important parts than do species and when important differences occur they are seldom firmly fixed but this fact is intelligible if we consider mans method of selection in the living animal or plant he cannot observe internal modifications in the more important organs nor does he regard them as long as they are compatible with health and life what does the breeder care about any slight change in the molar teeth of his pigs or for an additional molar tooth in the dog or for any change in the intestinal canal or other internal organ the breeder cares for the flesh of his cattle being well marbled with fat and for an accumulation of fat within the abdomen of his sheep and this he has effected what would the floriculturist care for any change in the structure of the ovarium or of the ovules as important internal organs are certainly liable to numerous slight variations and as these would probably be transmitted for many strange monstrosities are inherited man could undoubtedly effect a certain amount of change in these organs when he has produced any modification in an important part he has generally done so unintentionally in correlation with some other conspicuous part for instance he has given ridges and protuberances to the skulls of fowls by attending to the form of the comb or to the plume of feathers on the head by attending to the external form of the pouterpigeon he has enormously increased the size of the oesophagus and has added to the number of the ribs and given them greater breadth with the carrierpigeon by increasing through steady selection the wattles on the upper mandible he has greatly modified the form of the lower mandible and so in many other cases natural species on the other hand have been modified exclusively for their own good to fit them for infinitely diversified conditions of life to avoid enemies of all kinds and to struggle against a host of competitors hence under such complex conditions it would often happen that modifications of the most varied kinds in important as well as in unimportant parts would be advantageous or even necessary and they would slowly but surely be acquired through the survival of the fittest still more important is the fact that various indirect modifications would likewise arise through the law of correlated variation  domestic breeds often have an abnormal or semimonstrous character as amongst dogs the italian greyhound bulldog blenheim spaniel and bloodhoundsome breeds of cattle and pigsseveral breeds of the fowland the chief breeds of the pigeon in such abnormal breeds parts which differ but slightly or not at all in the allied natural species have been greatly modified this may be accounted for by mans often selecting especially at first conspicuous and semimonstrous deviations of structure we should however be cautious in deciding what deviations ought to be called monstrous there can hardly be a doubt that if the brush of horselike hair on the breast of the turkeycock had first appeared in the domesticated bird it would have been considered as a monstrosity the great plume of feathers on the head of the polish cock has been thus designated though plumes are common on the heads of many kinds of birds we might call the wattle or corrugated skin round the base of the beak of the english carrierpigeon a monstrosity but we do not thus speak of the globular fleshy excrescence at the base of the beak of the carpophaga oceanica  some authors have drawn a wide distinction between artificial and natural breeds although in extreme cases the distinction is plain in many other cases it is arbitrary the difference depending chiefly on the kind of selection which has been applied artificial breeds are those which have been intentionally improved by man they frequently have an unnatural appearance and are especially liable to lose their characters through reversion and continued variability the socalled natural breeds on the other hand are those which are found in semicivilised countries and which formerly inhabited separate districts in nearly all the european kingdoms they have been rarely acted on by mans intentional selection more frequently by unconscious selection and partly by natural selection for animals kept in semicivilised countries have to provide largely for their own wants such natural breeds will also have been directly acted on by the differences though slight in the surrounding conditions  there is a much more important distinction between our several breeds namely in some having originated from a stronglymarked or semimonstrous deviation of structure which however may subsequently have been augmented by selection whilst others have been formed in so slow and insensible a manner that if we could see their early progenitors we should hardly be able to say when or how the breed first arose from the history of the racehorse greyhound gamecock etc and from their general appearance we may feel nearly confident that they were formed by a slow process of improvement and we know that this has been the case with the carrierpigeon as well as with some other pigeons on the other hand it is certain that the ancon and mauchamp breeds of sheep and almost certain that the niata cattle turnspit and pugdogs jumper and frizzled fowls shortfaced tumbler pigeons hook billed ducks etc suddenly appeared in nearly the same state as we now see them so it has been with many cultivated plants the frequency of these cases is likely to lead to the false belief that natural species have often originated in the same abrupt manner but we have no evidence of the appearance or at least of the continued procreation under nature of abrupt modifications of structure and various general reasons could be assigned against such a belief  on the other hand we have abundant evidence of the constant occurrence under nature of slight individual differences of the most diversified kinds and we are thus led to conclude that species have generally originated by the natural selection of extremely slight differences this process may be strictly compared with the slow and gradual improvement of the racehorse greyhound and gamecock as every detail of structure in each species has to be closely adapted to its habits of life it will rarely happen that one part alone will be modified but as was formerly shown the coadapted modifications need not be absolutely simultaneous many variations however are from the first connected by the law of correlation hence it follows that even closelyallied species rarely or never differ from one another by one character alone and the same remark is to a certain extent applicable to domestic races for these if they differ much generally differ in many respects  some naturalists boldly insist 281 godron de lespece 1859 tome 2 page 44 etc that species are absolutely distinct productions never passing by intermediate links into one another whilst they maintain that domestic varieties can always be connected either with one another or with their parentforms but if we could always find the links between the several breeds of the dog horse cattle sheep pigs etc there would not have been such incessant doubts whether they were descended from one or several species the greyhound genus if such a term may be used cannot be closely connected with any other breed unless perhaps we go back to the ancient egyptian monuments our english bulldog also forms a very distinct breed in all these cases crossed breeds must of course be excluded for distinct natural species can thus be likewise connected by what links can the cochin fowl be closely united with others by searching for breeds still preserved in distant lands and by going back to historical records tumblerpigeons carriers and barbs can be closely connected with the parent rockpigeon but we cannot thus connect the turbit or the pouter the degree of distinctness between the various domestic breeds depends on the amount of modification which they have undergone and more especially on the neglect and final extinction of intermediate and lessvalued forms  it has often been argued that no light is thrown on the changes which natural species are believed to undergo from the admitted changes of domestic races as the latter are said to be mere temporary productions always reverting as soon as they become feral to their pristine form this argument has been well combated by mr wallace 282 journal proc linn soc 1858 volume 3 page 60 and full details were given in the thirteenth chapter showing that the tendency to reversion in feral animals and plants has been greatly exaggerated though no doubt it exists to a certain extent it would be opposed to all the principles inculcated in this work if domestic animals when exposed to new conditions and compelled to struggle for their own wants against a host of foreign competitors were not modified in the course of time it should also be remembered that many characters lie latent in all organic beings ready to be evolved under fitting conditions and in breeds modified within recent times the tendency to reversion is particularly strong but the antiquity of some of our breeds clearly proves that they remain nearly constant as long as their conditions of life remain the same  it has been boldly maintained by some authors that the amount of variation to which our domestic productions are liable is strictly limited but this is an assertion resting on little evidence whether or not the amount of change in any particular direction is limited the tendency to general variability is as far as we can judge unlimited cattle sheep and pigs have varied under domestication from the remotest period as shown by the researches of rutimeyer and others yet these animals have been improved to an unparalleled degree within quite recent times and this implies continued variability of structure wheat as we know from the remains found in the swiss lake dwellings is one of the most anciently cultivated plants yet at the present day new and better varieties frequently arise it may be that an ox will never be produced of larger size and finer proportions or a racehorse fleeter than our present animals or a gooseberry larger than the london variety but he would be a bold man who would assert that the extreme limit in these respects has been finally attained with flowers and fruit it has repeatedly been asserted that perfection has been reached but the standard has soon been excelled a breed of pigeons may never be produced with a beak shorter than that of the present shortfaced tumbler or with one longer than that of the english carrier for these birds have weak constitutions and are bad breeders but shortness and length of beak are the points which have been steadily improved during the last 150 years and some of the best judges deny that the goal has yet been reached from reasons which could be assigned it is probable that parts which have now reached their maximum development might after remaining constant during a long period vary again in the direction of increase under new conditions of life but there must be as mr wallace has remarked with much truth 283 the quarterly journal of science october 1867 page 486 a limit to change in certain directions both with natural and domestic productions for instance there must be a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial animal as this will be determined by the friction to be overcome the weight to be carried and the power of contraction in the muscular fibres the english racehorse may have reached this limit but it already surpasses in fleetness its own wild progenitor and all other equine species the shortfaced tumblerpigeon has a beak shorter and the carrier a beak longer relatively to the size of their bodies than that of any natural species of the family our apples pears and gooseberries bear larger fruit than those of any natural species of the same genera and so in many other cases  it is not surprising seeing the great difference between many domestic breeds that some few naturalists have concluded that each is descended from a distinct aboriginal stock more especially as the principle of selection has been ignored and the high antiquity of man as a breeder of animals has only recently become known most naturalists however freely admit that our various breeds however dissimilar are descended from a single stock although they do not know much about the art of breeding cannot show the connecting links nor say where and when the breeds arose yet these same naturalists declare with an air of philosophical caution that they will never admit that one natural species has given birth to another until they behold all the transitional steps fanciers use exactly the same language with respect to domestic breeds thus an author of an excellent treatise on pigeons says he will never allow that the carrier and fantail are the descendants of the wild rockpigeon until the transitions have actually been observed and can be repeated whenever man chooses to set about the task no doubt it is difficult to realise that slight changes added up during long centuries can produce such great results but he who wishes to understand the origin of domestic breeds or of natural species must overcome this difficulty  the causes which excite and the laws which govern variability have been discussed so lately that i need here only enumerate the leading points as domesticated organisms are much more liable to slight deviations of structure and to monstrosities than species living under their natural conditions and as widelyranging species generally vary more than those which inhabit restricted areas we may infer that variability mainly depends on changed conditions of life we must not overlook the effects of the unequal combination of the characters derived from both parents or reversion to former progenitors changed conditions have an especial tendency to render the reproductive organs more or less impotent as shown in the chapter devoted to this subject and these organs consequently often fail to transmit faithfully the parental characters changed conditions also act directly and definitely on the organisation so that all or nearly all the individuals of the same species thus exposed become modified in the same manner but why this or that part is especially affected we can seldom or ever say in most cases however a change in the conditions seems to act indefinitely causing diversified variations in nearly the same manner as exposure to cold or the absorption of the same poison affects different individuals in different ways we have reason to suspect that an habitual excess of highlynutritious food or an excess relatively to the wear and tear of the organisation from exercise is a powerful exciting cause of variability when we see the symmetrical and complex outgrowths caused by a minute drop of the poison of a gallinsect we may believe that slight changes in the chemical nature of the sap or blood would lead to extraordinary modifications of structure  the increased use of a muscle with its various attached parts and the increased activity of a gland or other organ lead to their increased development disuse has a contrary effect with domesticated productions although their organs sometimes become rudimentary through abortion we have no reason to suppose that this has ever followed solely from disuse with natural species on the contrary many organs appear to have been rendered rudimentary through disuse aided by the principle of the economy of growth together with intercrossing complete abortion can be accounted for only by the hypothesis given in the last chapter namely the final destruction of the germs or gemmules of useless parts this difference between species and domestic varieties may be partly accounted for by disuse having acted on the latter for an insufficient length of time and partly from their exemption from any severe struggle for existence entailing rigid economy in the development of each part to which all species under nature are subjected nevertheless the law of compensation or balancement which likewise depends on the economy of growth apparently has affected to a certain extent our domesticated productions  as almost every part of the organisation becomes highly variable under domestication and as variations are easily selected both consciously and unconsciously it is very difficult to distinguish between the effects of the selection of indefinite variations and the direct action of the conditions of life for instance it is possible that the feet of our waterdogs and of the american dogs which have to travel much over the snow may have become partially webbed from the stimulus of widely extending their toes but it is more probable that the webbing like the membrane between the toes of certain pigeons spontaneously appeared and was afterwards increased by the best swimmers and the best snowtravellers being preserved during many generations a fancier who wished to decrease the size of his bantams or tumblerpigeons would never think of starving them but would select the smallest individuals which spontaneously appeared quadrupeds are sometimes born destitute of hair and hairless breeds have been formed but there is no reason to believe that this is caused by a hot climate within the tropics heat often causes sheep to lose their fleeces on the other hand wet and cold act as a direct stimulus to the growth of hair but who will pretend to decide how far the thick fur of arctic animals or their white colour is due to the direct action of a severe climate and how far to the preservation of the bestprotected individuals during a long succession of generations  of all the laws governing variability that of correlation is one of the most important in many cases of slight deviations of structure as well as of grave monstrosities we cannot even conjecture what is the nature of the bond of connexion but between homologous partsbetween the fore and hind limbs between the hair hoofs horns and teethwhich are closely similar during their early development and which are exposed to similar conditions we can see that they would be eminently liable to be modified in the same manner homologous parts from having the same nature are apt to blend together and when many exist to vary in number  although every variation is either directly or indirectly caused by some change in the surrounding conditions we must never forget that the nature of the organisation which is acted on is by far the more important factor in the result we see this in different organisms which when placed under similar conditions vary in a different manner whilst closelyallied organisms under dissimilar conditions often vary in nearly the same manner we see this in the same modification frequently reappearing in the same variety at long intervals of time and likewise in the several striking cases given of analogous or parallel variations although some of these latter cases are due to reversion others cannot thus be accounted for  from the indirect action of changed conditions on the organisation owing to the reproductive organs being thus affectedfrom the direct action of such conditions and these will cause the individuals of the same species either to vary in the same manner or differently in accordance with slight differences in their constitutionfrom the effects of the increased or decreased use of partsand from correlationthe variability of our domesticated productions is complicated to an extreme degree the whole organisation becomes slightly plastic although each modification must have its own exciting cause and though each is subjected to law yet we can so rarely trace the precise relation between cause and effect that we are tempted to speak of variations as if they arose spontaneously we may even call them accidental but this must be only in the sense in which we say that a fragment of rock dropped from a height owes its shape to accident  it may be worth while briefly to consider the result of the exposure to unnatural conditions of a large number of animals of the same species and allowed to cross freely with no selection of any kind and afterwards to consider the result when selection is brought into play let us suppose that 500 wild rockpigeons were confined in their native land in an aviary and fed in the same manner as pigeons usually are and that they were not allowed to increase in number as pigeons propagate so rapidly i suppose that a thousand or fifteen hundred birds would have to be annually killed after several generations had been thus reared we may feel sure that some of the young birds would vary and the variations would tend to be inherited for at the present day slight deviations of structure often occur and are inherited it would be tedious even to enumerate the multitude of points which still go on varying or have recently varied many variations would occur in correlation with one another as the length of the wing and tail feathersthe number of the primary wingfeathers as well as the number and breadth of the ribs in correlation with the size and form of the bodythe number of the scutellae with the size of the feetthe length of the tongue with the length of the beakthe size of the nostrils and eyelids and the form of lower jaw in correlation with the development of wattlethe nakedness of the young with the future colour of the plumagethe size of the feet with that of the beak and other such points lastly as our birds are supposed to be confined in an aviary they would use their wings and legs but little and certain parts of the skeleton such as the sternum scapulae and feet would in consequence become slightly reduced in size  as in our assumed case many birds have to be indiscriminately killed every year the chances are against any new variety surviving long enough to breed and as the variations which arise are of an extremely diversified nature the chances are very great against two birds pairing which have varied in the same manner nevertheless a varying bird even when not thus paired would occasionally transmit its character to its young and these would not only be exposed to the same conditions which first caused the variation in question to appear but would in addition inherit from their modified parent a tendency again to vary in the same manner so that if the conditions decidedly tended to induce some particular variation all the birds might in the course of time become similarly modified but a far commoner result would be that one bird would vary in one way and another bird in another way one would be born with a beak a little longer and another with a shorter beak one would gain some black feathers another some white or red feathers and as these birds would be continually intercrossing the final result would be a body of individuals differing from each other in many ways but only slightly yet more than did the original rockpigeons but there would not be the least tendency towards the formation of several distinct breeds  if two separate lots of pigeons were treated in the manner just described one in england and the other in a tropical country the two lots being supplied with different kinds of food would they after many generations differ when we reflect on the cases given in the twentythird chapter and on such facts as the difference in former times between the breeds of cattle sheep etc in almost every district of europe we are strongly inclined to admit that the two lots would be differently modified through the influence of climate and food but the evidence on the definite action of changed conditions is in most cases insufficient and with respect to pigeons i have had the opportunity of examining a large collection of domesticated kinds sent to me by sir w elliot from india and they varied in a remarkably similar manner with our european birds  if two distinct breeds were mingled together in equal numbers there is reason to suspect that they would to a certain extent prefer pairing with their own kind but they would often intercross from the greater vigour and fertility of the crossed offspring the whole body would by this means become interblended sooner than would otherwise have occurred from certain breeds being prepotent over others it does not follow that the interblended progeny would be strictly intermediate in character i have also proved that the act of crossing in itself gives a strong tendency to reversion so that the crossed offspring would tend to revert to the state of the aboriginal rock pigeon and in the course of time they would probably be not much more heterogeneous in character than in our first case when birds of the same breed were confined together  i have just said that the crossed offspring would gain in vigour and fertility from the facts given in the seventeenth chapter there can be no doubt of this fact and there can be little doubt though the evidence on this head is not so easily acquired that longcontinued close interbreeding leads to evil results with hermaphrodites of all kinds if the sexual elements of the same individual habitually acted on each other the closest possible interbreeding would be perpetual but we should bear in mind that the structure of all hermaphrodite animals as far as i can learn permits and frequently necessitates a cross with a distinct individual with hermaphrodite plants we incessantly meet with elaborate and perfect contrivances for this same end it is no exaggeration to assert that if the use of the talons and tusks of a carnivorous animal or of the plumes and hooks on a seed may be safely inferred from their structure we may with equal safety infer that many flowers are constructed for the express purpose of ensuring a cross with a distinct plant from these various considerations not to mention the result of a long series of experiments which i have tried the conclusion arrived at in the chapter just referred tonamely that great good of some kind is derived from the sexual concourse of distinct individualsmust be admitted  to return to our illustration we have hitherto assumed that the birds were kept down to the same number by indiscriminate slaughter but if the least choice be permitted in their preservation the whole result will be changed should the owner observe any slight variation in one of his birds and wish to obtain a breed thus characterised he would succeed in a surprisingly short time by careful selection as any part which has once varied generally goes on varying in the same direction it is easy by continually preserving the most strongly marked individuals to increase the amount of difference up to a high predetermined standard of excellence this is methodical selection  if the owner of the aviary without any thought of making a new breed simply admired for instance shortbeaked more than longbeaked birds he would when he had to reduce the number generally kill the latter and there can be no doubt that he would thus in the course of time sensibly modify his stock it is improbable if two men were to keep pigeons and act in this manner that they would prefer exactly the same characters they would as we know often prefer directly opposite characters and the two lots would ultimately come to differ this has actually occurred with strains or families of cattle sheep and pigeons which have been long kept and carefully attended to by different breeders without any wish on their part to form new and distinct subbreeds this unconscious kind of selection will more especially come into action with animals which are highly serviceable to man for every one tries to get the best dogs horses cows or sheep without thinking about their future progeny yet these animals would transmit more or less surely their good qualities to their offspring nor is any one so careless as to breed from his worst animals even savages when compelled from extreme want to kill some of their animals would destroy the worst and preserve the best with animals kept for use and not for mere amusement different fashions prevail in different districts leading to the preservation and consequently to the transmission of all sorts of trifling peculiarities of character the same process will have been pursued with our fruittrees and vegetables for the best will always have been the most largely cultivated and will occasionally have yielded seedlings better than their parents  the different strains just alluded to which have been actually produced by breeders without any wish on their part to obtain such a result afford excellent evidence of the power of unconscious selection this form of selection has probably led to far more important results than methodical selection and is likewise more important under a theoretical point of view from closely resembling natural selection for during this process the best or most valued individuals are not separated and prevented from crossing with others of the same breed but are simply preferred and preserved yet this inevitably leads to their gradual modification and improvement so that finally they prevail to the exclusion of the old parentform  with our domesticated animals natural selection checks the production of races with any injurious deviation of structure in the case of animals which from being kept by savages or semicivilised people have to provide largely for their own wants under different circumstances natural selection will have played a more important part hence it probably is that they often closely resemble natural species  as there is no limit to mans desire to possess animals and plants more and more useful in any respect and as the fancier always wishes owing to fashions running into extremes to produce each character more and more strongly pronounced there is through the prolonged action of methodical and unconscious selection a constant tendency in every breed to become more and more different from its parentstock and when several breeds have been produced and are valued for different qualities to differ more and more from each other this leads to divergence of character as improved subvarieties and races are slowly formed the older and less improved breeds are neglected and decrease in number when few individuals of any breed exist within the same locality close interbreeding by lessening their vigour and fertility aids in their final extinction thus the intermediate links are lost and the remaining breeds gain in distinctness of character  in the chapters on the pigeon it was proved by historical evidence and by the existence of connecting subvarieties in distant lands that several breeds have steadily diverged in character and that many old and intermediate sub breeds have been lost other cases could be adduced of the extinction of domestic breeds as of the irish wolfdog the old english hound and of two breeds in france one of which was formerly highly valued 284 m rufz de lavison in bull soc imp dacclimat december 1862 page 1009 mr pickering remarks 285 races of man 1850 page 315 that the sheep figured on the most ancient egyptian monuments is unknown at the present day and at least one variety of the bullock formerly known in egypt has in like manner become extinct so it has been with some animals and with several plants cultivated by the ancient inhabitants of europe during the neolithic period in peru von tschudi 286 travels in peru english translation page 177 found in certain tombs apparently prior to the dynasty of the incas two kinds of maize not now known in the country with our flowers and culinary vegetables the production of new varieties and their extinction has incessantly recurred at the present time improved breeds sometimes displace older breeds at an extraordinarily rapid rate as has recently occurred throughout england with pigs the longhorn cattle in their native home were suddenly swept away as if by some murderous pestilence by the introduction of shorthorns 287 youatt on cattle 1834 page 200 on pigs see gardeners chronicle 1854 page 410  what grand results have followed from the longcontinued action of methodical and unconscious selection regulated to a certain extent by natural selection we see on every side of us compare the many animals and plants which are displayed at our exhibitions with their parentforms when these are known or consult old historical records with respect to their former state most of our domesticated animals have given rise to numerous and distinct races but those which cannot be easily subjected to selection must be exceptedsuch as cats the cochineal insect and the hivebee in accordance with what we know of the process of selection the formation of our many races has been slow and gradual the man who first observed and preserved a pigeon with its oesophagus a little enlarged its beak a little longer or its tail a little more expanded than usual never dreamed that he had made the first step in the creation of a pouter carrier and fantailpigeon man can create not only anomalous breeds but others having their whole structure admirably co ordinated for certain purposes such as the racehorse and drayhorse or the greyhound and bulldog it is by no means necessary that each small change of structure throughout the body leading towards excellence should simultaneously arise and be selected although man seldom attends to differences in organs which are important under a physiological point of view yet he has so profoundly modified some breeds that assuredly if found wild they would be ranked as distinct genera  the best proof of what selection has effected is perhaps afforded by the fact that whatever part or quality in any animal and more especially in any plant is most valued by man that part or quality differs most in the several races this result is well seen by comparing the amount of difference between the fruits produced by the several varieties of fruittrees between the flowers of our flowergarden plants between the seeds roots or leaves of our culinary and agricultural plants in comparison with the other and not valued parts of the same varieties striking evidence of a different kind is afforded by the fact ascertained by oswald heer 288 die pflanzen der pfahlbauten 1865 namely that the seeds of a large number of plantswheat barley oats peas beans lentils poppiescultivated for their seed by the ancient lakeinhabitants of switzerland were all smaller than the seeds of our existing varieties rutimeyer has shown that the sheep and cattle which were kept by the earlier lakeinhabitants were likewise smaller than our present breeds in the middens of denmark the earliest dog of which the remains have been found was the weakest this was succeeded during the bronze age by a stronger kind and this again during the iron age by one still stronger the sheep of denmark during the bronze period had extraordinarily slender limbs and the horse was smaller than our present animal 289 morlot soc vaud des scien nat mars 1860 page 298 no doubt in most of these cases the new and larger breeds were introduced from foreign lands by the immigration of new hordes of men but it is not probable that each larger breed which in the course of time has supplanted a previous and smaller breed was the descendant of a distinct and larger species it is far more probable that the domestic races of our various animals were gradually improved in different parts of the great europaeoasiatic continent and thence spread to other countries this fact of the gradual increase in size of our domestic animals is all the more striking as certain wild or halfwild animals such as reddeer aurochs parkcattle and boars 2810 rutimeyer die fauna der pfahlbauten 1861 s 30 have within nearly the same period decreased in size  the conditions favourable to selection by man arethe closest attention to every characterlongcontinued perseverancefacility in matching or separating animalsand especially a large number being kept so that the inferior individuals may be freely rejected or destroyed and the better ones preserved when many are kept there will also be a greater chance of the occurrence of wellmarked deviations of structure length of time is all important for as each character in order to become strongly pronounced has to be augmented by the selection of successive variations of the same kind this can be effected only during a long series of generations length of time will also allow any new feature to become fixed by the continued rejection of those individuals which revert or vary and by the preservation of those which still inherit the new character hence although some few animals have varied rapidly in certain respects under new conditions of life as dogs in india and sheep in the west indies yet all the animals and plants which have produced strongly marked races were domesticated at an extremely remote epoch often before the dawn of history as a consequence of this no record has been preserved of the origin of our chief domestic breeds even at the present day new strains or subbreeds are formed so slowly that their first appearance passes unnoticed a man attends to some particular character or merely matches his animals with unusual care and after a time a slight difference is perceived by his neighboursthe difference goes on being augmented by unconscious and methodical selection until at last a new subbreed is formed receives a local name and spreads but by this time its history is almost forgotten when the new breed has spread widely it gives rise to new strains and subbreeds and the best of these succeed and spread supplanting other and older breeds and so always onwards in the march of improvement  when a wellmarked breed has once been established if not supplanted by still further improved subbreeds and if not exposed to greatly changed conditions of life inducing further variability or reversion to longlost characters it may apparently last for an enormous period we may infer that this is the case from the high antiquity of certain races but some caution is necessary on this head for the same variation may appear independently after long intervals of time or in distant places we may safely assume that this has occurred with the turnspitdog of which one is figured on the ancient egyptian monumentswith the solidhoofed swine 2811 godron de lespece tome 1 1859 page 368 mentioned by aristotlewith fivetoed fowls described by columellaand certainly with the nectarine the dogs represented on the egyptian monuments about 2000 bc show us that some of the chief breeds then existed but it is extremely doubtful whether any are identically the same with our present breeds a great mastiff sculptured on an assyrian tomb 640 bc is said to be the same with the dog still imported from thibet into the same region the true greyhound existed during the roman classical period coming down to a later period we have seen that though most of the chief breeds of the pigeon existed between two and three centuries ago they have not all retained exactly the same character to the present day but this has occurred in certain cases in which no improvement was desired for instance in the case of the spot and indian groundtumbler  de candolle 2812 geographie botan 1855 page 989 has fully discussed the antiquity of various races of plants he states that the black seeded poppy was known in the time of homer the whiteseeded sesamum by the ancient egyptians and almonds with sweet and bitter kernels by the hebrews but it does not seem improbable that some of these varieties may have been lost and reappeared one variety of barley and apparently one of wheat both of which were cultivated at an immensely remote period by the lakeinhabitants of switzerland still exist it is said 2813 pickering races of man 1850 page 318 that specimens of a small variety of gourd which is still common in the market of lima were exhumed from an ancient cemetery in peru de candolle remarks that in the books and drawings of the sixteenth century the principal races of the cabbage turnip and gourd can be recognised this might have been expected at so late a period but whether any of these plants are absolutely identical with our present subvarieties is not certain it is however said that the brussels sprout a variety which in some places is liable to degeneration has remained genuine for more than four centuries in the district where it is believed to have originated 2814 journal of a horticultural tour by a deputation of the caledonian hist soc 1823 page 293  in accordance with the views maintained by me in this work and elsewhere not only the various domestic races but the most distinct genera and orders within the same great classfor instance mammals birds reptiles and fishesare all the descendants of one common progenitor and we must admit that the whole vast amount of difference between these forms has primarily arisen from simple variability to consider the subject under this point of view is enough to strike one dumb with amazement but our amazement ought to be lessened when we reflect that beings almost infinite in number during an almost infinite lapse of time have often had their whole organisation rendered in some degree plastic and that each slight modification of structure which was in any way beneficial under excessively complex conditions of life has been preserved whilst each which was in any way injurious has been rigorously destroyed and the longcontinued accumulation of beneficial variations will infallibly have led to structures as diversified as beautifully adapted for various purposes and as excellently coordinated as we see in the animals and plants around us hence i have spoken of selection as the paramount power whether applied by man to the formation of domestic breeds or by nature to the production of species i may recur to the metaphor given in a former chapter if an architect were to rear a noble and commodious edifice without the use of cut stone by selecting from the fragments at the base of a precipice wedgeformed stones for his arches elongated stones for his lintels and flat stones for his roof we should admire his skill and regard him as the paramount power now the fragments of stone though indispensable to the architect bear to the edifice built by him the same relation which the fluctuating variations of organic beings bear to the varied and admirable structures ultimately acquired by their modified descendants  some authors have declared that natural selection explains nothing unless the precise cause of each slight individual difference be made clear if it were explained to a savage utterly ignorant of the art of building how the edifice had been raised stone upon stone and why wedgeformed fragments were used for the arches flat stones for the roof etc and if the use of each part and of the whole building were pointed out it would be unreasonable if he declared that nothing had been made clear to him because the precise cause of the shape of each fragment could not be told but this is a nearly parallel case with the objection that selection explains nothing because we know not the cause of each individual difference in the structure of each being  the shape of the fragments of stone at the base of our precipice may be called accidental but this is not strictly correct for the shape of each depends on a long sequence of events all obeying natural laws on the nature of the rock on the lines of deposition or cleavage on the form of the mountain which depends on its upheaval and subsequent denudation and lastly on the storm or earthquake which throws down the fragments but in regard to the use to which the fragments may be put their shape may be strictly said to be accidental and here we are led to face a great difficulty in alluding to which i am aware that i am travelling beyond my proper province an omniscient creator must have foreseen every consequence which results from the laws imposed by him but can it be reasonably maintained that the creator intentionally ordered if we use the words in any ordinary sense that certain fragments of rock should assume certain shapes so that the builder might erect his edifice if the various laws which have determined the shape of each fragment were not predetermined for the builders sake can it be maintained with any greater probability that he specially ordained for the sake of the breeder each of the innumerable variations in our domestic animals and plantsmany of these variations being of no service to man and not beneficial far more often injurious to the creatures themselves did he ordain that the crop and tailfeathers of the pigeon should vary in order that the fancier might make his grotesque pouter and fantail breeds did he cause the frame and mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be formed of indomitable ferocity with jaws fitted to pin down the bull for mans brutal sport but if we give up the principle in one caseif we do not admit that the variations of the primeval dog were intentionally guided in order that the greyhound for instance that perfect image of symmetry and vigour might be formedno shadow of reason can be assigned for the belief that variations alike in nature and the result of the same general laws which have been the groundwork through natural selection of the formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world man included were intentionally and specially guided however much we may wish it we can hardly follow professor asa gray in his belief that variation has been led along certain beneficial lines like a stream along definite and useful lines of irrigation if we assume that each particular variation was from the beginning of all time preordained then that plasticity of organisation which leads to many injurious deviations of structure as well as the redundant power of reproduction which inevitably leads to a struggle for existence and as a consequence to the natural selection or survival of the fittest must appear to us superfluous laws of nature on the other hand an omnipotent and omniscient creator ordains everything and foresees everything thus we are brought face to face with a difficulty as insoluble as is that of free will and
