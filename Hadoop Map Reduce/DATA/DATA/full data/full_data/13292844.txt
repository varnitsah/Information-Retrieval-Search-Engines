13292844	no name   by wilkie collins        editorial note italics are indicated by the underscore      character accent marks in the few words in french are omitted      the umlaut in zurich is omitted     preface   the main purpose of this story is to appeal to the readers interest in a subject which has been the theme of some of the greatest writers living and deadbut which has never been and can never be exhausted because it is a subject eternally interesting to all mankind here is one more book that depicts the struggle of a human creature under those opposing influences of good and evil which we have all felt which we have all known it has been my aim to make the character of magdalen which personifies this struggle a pathetic character even in its perversity and its error and i have tried hard to attain this result by the least obtrusive and the least artificial of all meansby a resolute adherence throughout to the truth as it is in nature this design was no easy one to accomplish and it has been a great encouragement to me during the publication of my story in its periodical form to know on the authority of many readers that the object which i had proposed to myself i might in some degree consider as an object achieved  round the central figure in the narrative other characters will be found grouped in sharp contrastcontrast for the most part in which i have endeavored to make the element of humor mainly predominant i have sought to impart this relief to the more serious passages in the book not only because i believe myself to be justified in doing so by the laws of artbut because experience has taught me what the experience of my readers will doubtless confirm that there is no such moral phenomenon as unmixed tragedy to be found in the world around us look where we may the dark threads and the light cross each other perpetually in the texture of human life  to pass from the characters to the story it will be seen that the narrative related in these pages has been constructed on a plan which differs from the plan followed in my last novel and in some other of my works published at an earlier date the only secret contained in this book is revealed midway in the first volume from that point all the main events of the story are purposely foreshadowed before they take placemy present design being to rouse the readers interest in following the train of circumstances by which these foreseen events are brought about in trying this new ground i am not turning my back in doubt on the ground which i have passed over already my one object in following a new course is to enlarge the range of my studies in the art of writing fiction and to vary the form in which i make my appeal to the reader as attractively as i can  there is no need for me to add more to these few prefatory words than is here written what i might otherwise have wished to say in this place i have endeavored to make the book itself say for me   to  francis carr beard   fellow of the royal college of surgeons of england  in remembrance of the time when  the closing scenes of this story were written     no name     the first scene  comberaven somersetshire    chapter i  the hands on the hallclock pointed to halfpast six in the morning the house was a country residence in west somersetshire called comberaven the day was the fourth of march and the year was eighteen hundred and fortysix  no sounds but the steady ticking of the clock and the lumpish snoring of a large dog stretched on a mat outside the diningroom door disturbed the mysterious morning stillness of hall and staircase who were the sleepers hidden in the upper regions let the house reveal its own secrets and one by one as they descend the stairs from their beds let the sleepers disclose themselves  as the clock pointed to a quarter to seven the dog woke and shook himself after waiting in vain for the footman who was accustomed to let him out the animal wandered restlessly from one closed door to another on the groundfloor and returning to his mat in great perplexity appealed to the sleeping family with a long and melancholy howl  before the last notes of the dogs remonstrance had died away the oaken stairs in the higher regions of the house creaked under slowlydescending footsteps in a minute more the first of the female servants made her appearance with a dingy woolen shawl over her shouldersfor the march morning was bleak and rheumatism and the cook were old acquaintances  receiving the dogs first cordial advances with the worst possible grace the cook slowly opened the hall door and let the animal out it was a wild morning over a spacious lawn and behind a black plantation of firs the rising sun rent its way upward through piles of ragged gray cloud heavy drops of rain fell few and far between the march wind shuddered round the corners of the house and the wet trees swayed wearily  seven oclock struck and the signs of domestic life began to show themselves in more rapid succession  the housemaid came downtall and slim with the state of the spring temperature written redly on her nose the ladysmaid followedyoung smart plump and sleepy the kitchenmaid came nextafflicted with the faceache and making no secret of her sufferings last of all the footman appeared yawning disconsolately the living picture of a man who felt that he had been defrauded of his fair nights rest  the conversation of the servants when they assembled before the slowly lighting kitchen fire referred to a recent family event and turned at starting on this question had thomas the footman seen anything of the concert at clifton at which his master and the two young ladies had been present on the previous night yes thomas had heard the concert he had been paid for to go in at the back it was a loud concert it was a hot concert it was described at the top of the bills as grand whether it was worth traveling sixteen miles to hear by railway with the additional hardship of going back nineteen miles by road at halfpast one in the morningwas a question which he would leave his master and the young ladies to decide his own opinion in the meantime being unhesitatingly no further inquiries on the part of all the female servants in succession elicited no additional information of any sort thomas could hum none of the songs and could describe none of the ladies dresses his audience accordingly gave him up in despair and the kitchen smalltalk flowed back into its ordinary channels until the clock struck eight and startled the assembled servants into separating for their mornings work  a quarter past eight and nothing happened halfpastand more signs of life appeared from the bedroom regions the next member of the family who came downstairs was mr andrew vanstone the master of the house  tall stout and uprightwith bright blue eyes and healthy florid complexionhis brown plush shootingjacket carelessly buttoned awry his vixenish little scotch terrier barking unrebuked at his heels one hand thrust into his waistcoat pocket and the other smacking the banisters cheerfully as he came downstairs humming a tunemr vanstone showed his character on the surface of him freely to all men an easy hearty handsome goodhumored gentleman who walked on the sunny side of the way of life and who asked nothing better than to meet all his fellowpassengers in this world on the sunny side too estimating him by years he had turned fifty judging him by lightness of heart strength of constitution and capacity for enjoyment he was no older than most men who have only turned thirty  thomas cried mr vanstone taking up his old felt hat and his thick walking stick from the hall table breakfast this morning at ten the young ladies are not likely to be down earlier after the concert last nightbytheby how did you like the concert yourself eh you thought it was grand quite right so it was nothing but crashban g varied now and then by bangcrash all the women dressed within an inch of their lives smothering heat blazing gas and no room for anybodyyes yes thomas grands the word for it and comfortable isnt with that expression of opinion mr vanstone whistled to his vixenish terrier flourished his stick at the hall door in cheerful defiance of the rain and set off through wind and weather for his morning walk  the hands stealing their steady way round the dial of the clock pointed to ten minutes to nine another member of the family appeared on the stairsmiss garth the governess  no observant eyes could have surveyed miss garth without seeing at once that she was a northcountrywoman her hard featured face her masculine readiness and decision of movement her obstinate honesty of look and manner all proclaimed her border birth and border training though little more than forty years of age her hair was quite gray and she wore over it the plain cap of an old woman neither hair nor headdress was out of harmony with her faceit looked older than her years the hard handwriting of trouble had scored it heavily at some past time the selfpossession of her progress downstairs and the air of habitual authority with which she looked about her spoke well for her position in mr vanstones family this was evidently not one of the forlorn persecuted pitiably dependent order of governesses here was a woman who lived on ascertained and honorable terms with her employersa woman who looked capable of sending any parents in england to the rightabout if they failed to rate her at her proper value  breakfast at ten repeated miss garth when the footman had answered the bell and had mentioned his masters orders ha i thought what would come of that concert last night when people who live in the country patronize public amusements public amusements return the compliment by upsetting the family afterward for days together youre upset thomas i can see your eyes are as red as a ferrets and your cravat looks as if you had slept in it bring the kettle at a quarter to tenand if you dont get better in the course of the day come to me and ill give you a dose of physic thats a wellmeaning lad if you only let him alone continued miss garth in soliloquy when thomas had retired but hes not strong enough for concerts twenty miles off they wanted me to go with them last night yes catch me  nine oclock struck and the minutehand stole on to twenty minutes past the hour before any more footsteps were heard on the stairs at the end of that time two ladies appeared descending to the breakfastroom togethermrs vanstone and her eldest daughter  if the personal attractions of mrs vanstone at an earlier period of life had depended solely on her native english charms of complexion and freshness she must have long since lost the last relics of her fairer self but her beauty as a young woman had passed beyond the average national limits and she still preserved the advantage of her more exceptional personal gifts although she was now in her fortyfourth year although she had been tried in bygone times by the premature loss of more than one of her children and by long attacks of illness which had followed those bereavements of former yearsshe still preserved the fair proportion and subtle delicacy of feature once associated with the alladorning brightness and freshness of beauty which had left her never to return her eldest child now descending the stairs by her side was the mirror in which she could look back and see again the reflection of her own youth there folded thick on the daughters head lay the massive dark hair which on the mothers was fast turning gray there in the daughters cheek glowed the lovely dusky red which had faded from the mothers to bloom again no more miss vanstone had already reached the first maturity of womanhood she had completed her sixandtwentieth year inheriting the dark majestic character of her mothers beauty she had yet hardly inherited all its charms though the shape of her face was the same the features were scarcely so delicate their proportion was scarcely so true she was not so tall she had the darkbrown eyes of her motherfull and soft with the steady luster in them which mrs vanstones eyes had lostand yet there was less interest less refinement and depth of feeling in her expression it was gentle and feminine but clouded by a certain quiet reserve from which her mothers face was free if we dare to look closely enough may we not observe that the moral force of character and the higher intellectual capacities in parents seem often to wear out mysteriously in the course of transmission to children in these days of insidious nervous exhaustion and subtlyspreading nervous malady is it not possible that the same rule may apply less rarely than we are willing to admit to the bodily gifts as well  the mother and daughter slowly descended the stairs togetherthe first dressed in dark brown with an indian shawl thrown over her shoulders the second more simply attired in black with a plain collar and cuffs and a dark orangecolored ribbon over the bosom of her dress as they crossed the hall and entered the breakfastroom miss vanstone was full of the allabsorbing subject of the last nights concert  i am so sorry mamma you were not with us she said you have been so strong and so well ever since last summeryou have felt so many years younger as you said yourselfthat i am sure the exertion would not have been too much for you  perhaps not my lovebut it was as well to keep on the safe side  quite as well remarked miss garth appearing at the breakfastroom door look at norah goodmorning my dearlook i say at norah a perfect wreck a living proof of your wisdom and mine in staying at home the vile gas the foul air the late hourswhat can you expect shes not made of iron and she suffers accordingly no my dear you neednt deny it i see youve got a headache  norahs dark handsome face brightened into a smilethen lightly clouded again with its accustomed quiet reserve  a very little headache not half enough to make me regret the concert she said and walked away by herself to the window  on the far side of a garden and paddock the view overlooked a stream some farm buildings which lay beyond and the opening of a wooded rocky pass called in somersetshire a combe which here cleft its way through the hills that closed the prospect a winding strip of road was visible at no great distance amid the undulations of the open ground and along this strip the stalwart figure of mr vanstone was now easily recognizable returning to the house from his morning walk he flourished his stick gayly as he observed his eldest daughter at the window she nodded and waved her hand in return very gracefully and prettilybut with something of oldfashioned formality in her manner which looked strangely in so young a woman and which seemed out of harmony with a salutation addressed to her father  the hallclock struck the adjourned breakfasthour when the minute hand had recorded the lapse of five minutes more a door banged in the bedroom regionsa clear young voice was heard singing blithelylight rapid footsteps pattered on the upper stairs descended with a jump to the landing and pattered again faster than ever down the lower flight in another moment the youngest of mr vanstones two daughters and two only surviving children dashed into view on the dingy old oaken stairs with the suddenness of a flash of light and clearing the last three steps into the hall at a jump presented herself breathless in the breakfastroom to make the family circle complete   by one of those strange caprices of nature which science leaves still unexplained the youngest of mr vanstones children presented no recognizable resemblance to either of her parents how had she come by her hair how had she come by her eyes even her father and mother had asked themselves those questions as she grew up to girlhood and had been sorely perplexed to answer them her hair was of that purely lightbrown hue unmixed with flaxen or yellow or redwhich is oftener seen on the plumage of a bird than on the head of a human being it was soft and plentiful and waved downward from her low forehead in regular foldsbut to some tastes it was dull and dead in its absolute want of glossiness in its monotonous purity of plain light color her eyebrows and eyelashes were just a shade darker than her hair and seemed made expressly for those violetblue eyes which assert their most irresistible charm when associated with a fair complexion but it was here exactly that the promise of her face failed of performance in the most startling manner the eyes which should have been dark were incomprehensibly and discordantly light they were of that nearly colorless gray which though little attractive in itself possesses the rare compensating merit of interpreting the finest gradations of thought the gentlest changes of feeling the deepest trouble of passion with a subtle transparency of expression which no darker eyes can rival thus quaintly selfcontradictory in the upper part of her face she was hardly less at variance with established ideas of harmony in the lower her lips had the true feminine delicacy of form her cheeks the lovely roundness and smoothness of youthbut the mouth was too large and firm the chin too square and massive for her sex and age her complexion partook of the pure monotony of tint which characterized her hairit was of the same soft warm creamy fairness all over without a tinge of color in the cheeks except on occasions of unusual bodily exertion or sudden mental disturbance the whole countenanceso remarkable in its strongly opposed characteristicswas rendered additionally striking by its extraordinary mobility the large electric lightgray eyes were hardly ever in repose all varieties of expression followed each other over the plastic everchanging face with a giddy rapidity which left sober analysis far behind in the race the girls exuberant vitality asserted itself all over her from head to foot her figuretaller than her sisters taller than the average of womans height instinct with such a seductive serpentine suppleness so lightly and playfully graceful that its movements suggested not unnaturally the movements of a young cather figure was so perfectly developed already that no one who saw her could have supposed that she was only eighteen she bloomed in the full physical maturity of twenty years or morebloomed naturally and irresistibly in right of her matchless health and strength here in truth lay the mainspring of this strangelyconstituted organization her headlong course down the house stairs the brisk activity of all her movements the incessant sparkle of expression in her face the enticing gayety which took the hearts of the quietest people by stormeven the reckless delight in bright colors which showed itself in her brilliantlystriped morning dress in her fluttering ribbons in the large scarlet rosettes on her smart little shoesall sprang alike from the same source from the overflowing physical health which strengthened every muscle braced every nerve and set the warm young blood tingling through her veins like the blood of a growing child   on her entry into the breakfastroom she was saluted with the customary remonstrance which her flighty disregard of all punctuality habitually provoked from the longsuffering household authorities in miss garths favorite phrase magdalen was born with all the sensesexcept a sense of order  magdalen it was a strange name to have given her strange indeed and yet chosen under no extraordinary circumstances the name had been borne by one of mr vanstones sisters who had died in early youth and in affectionate remembrance of her he had called his second daughter by itjust as he had called his eldest daughter norah for his wifes sake magdalen surely the grand old bible namesuggestive of a sad and somber dignity recalling in its first association mournful ideas of penitence and seclusionhad been here as events had turned out inappropriately bestowed surely this selfcontradictory girl had perversely accomplished one contradiction more by developing into a character which was out of all harmony with her own christian name  late again said mrs vanstone as magdalen breathlessly kissed her  late again chimed in miss garth when magdalen came her way next well she went on taking the girls chin familiarly in her hand with a halfsatirical halffond attention which betrayed that the youngest daughter with all her faults was the governesss favoritewell and what has the concert done for you what form of suffering has dissipation inflicted on your system this morning  suffering repeated magdalen recovering her breath and the use of her tongue with it i dont know the meaning of the word if theres anything the matter with me im too well suffering im ready for another concert tonight and a ball tomorrow and a play the day after oh cried magdalen dropping into a chair and crossing her hands rapturously on the table how i do like pleasure  come thats explicit at any rate said miss garth i think pope must have had you in his mind when he wrote his famous lines  men some to business some to pleasure take but every woman is at heart a rake  the deuce she is cried mr vanstone entering the room while miss garth was making her quotation with the dogs at his heels well live and learn if youre all rakes miss garth the sexes are turned topsyturvy with a vengeance and the men will have nothing left for it but to stop at home and darn the stockingslets have some breakfast  howdyedo papa said magdalen taking mr vanstone as boisterously round the neck as if he belonged to some larger order of newfoundland dog and was made to be romped with at his daughters convenience im the rake miss garth means and i want to go to another concertor a play if you likeor a ball if you prefer itor anything else in the way of amusement that puts me into a new dress and plunges me into a crowd of people and illuminates me with plenty of light and sets me in a tingle of excitement all over from head to foot anything will do as long as it doesnt send us to bed at eleven oclock  mr vanstone sat down composedly under his daughters flow of language like a man who was well used to verbal inundation from that quarter if i am to be allowed my choice of amusements next time said the worthy gentleman i think a play will suit me better than a concert the girls enjoyed themselves amazingly my dear he continued addressing his wife more than i did i must say it was altogether above my mark they played one piece of music which lasted forty minutes it stopped three times bytheway and we all thought it was done each time and clapped our hands rejoiced to be rid of it but on it went again to our great surprise and mortification till we gave it up in despair and all wished ourselves at jericho norah my dear when we had crashbang for forty minutes with three stoppages bytheway what did they call it  a symphony papa replied norah  yes you darling old goth a symphony by the great beethoven added magdalen how can you say you were not amused have you forgotten the yellowlooking foreign woman with the unpronounceable name dont you remember the faces she made when she sang and the way she courtesied and courtesied till she cheated the foolish people into crying encore look here mammalook here miss garth  she snatched up an empty plate from the table to represent a sheet of music held it before her in the established concertroom position and produced an imitation of the unfortunate singers grimaces and courtesyings so accurately and quaintly true to the original that her father roared with laughter and even the footman who came in at that moment with the postbag rushed out of the room again and committed the indecorum of echoing his master audibly on the other side of the door  letters papa i want the key said magdalen passing from the imitation at the breakfasttable to the postbag on the sideboard with the easy abruptness which characterized all her actions  mr vanstone searched his pockets and shook his head though his youngest daughter might resemble him in nothing else it was easy to see where magdalens unmethodical habits came from  i dare say i have left it in the library along with my other keys said mr vanstone go and look for it my dear  you really should check magdalen pleaded mrs vanstone addressing her husband when her daughter had left the room those habits of mimicry are growing on her and she speaks to you with a levity which it is positively shocking to hear  exactly what i have said myself till i am tired of repeating it remarked miss garth she treats mr vanstone as if he was a kind of younger brother of hers  you are kind to us in everything else papa and you make kind allowances for magdalens high spiritsdont you said the quiet norah taking her fathers part and her sisters with so little show of resolution on the surface that few observers would have been sharp enough to detect the genuine substance beneath it  thank you my dear said goodnatured mr vanstone thank you for a very pretty speech as for magdalen he continued addressing his wife and miss garth shes an unbroken filly let her caper and kick in the paddock to her hearts content time enough to break her to harness when she gets a little older  the door opened and magdalen returned with the key she unlocked the postbag at the sideboard and poured out the letters in a heap sorting them gayly in less than a minute she approached the breakfasttable with both hands full and delivered the letters all round with the businesslike rapidity of a london postman  two for norah she announced beginning with her sister three for miss garth none for mamma one for me and the other six all for papa you lazy old darling you hate answering letters dont you pursued magdalen dropping the postmans character and assuming the daughters how you will grumble and fidget in the study and how you will wish there were no such things as letters in the world and how red your nice old bald head will get at the top with the worry of writing the answers and how many of the answers you will leave until tomorrow after all the bristol theaters open papa she whispered slyly and suddenly in her fathers ear i saw it in the newspaper when i went to the library to get the key lets go tomorrow night  while his daughter was chattering mr vanstone was mechanically sorting his letters he turned over the first four in succession and looked carelessly at the addresses when he came to the fifth his attention which had hitherto wandered toward magdalen suddenly became fixed on the postmark of the letter  stooping over him with her head on his shoulder magdalen could see the postmark as plainly as her father saw itnew orleans  an american letter papa she said who do you know at new orleans  mrs vanstone started and looked eagerly at her husband the moment magdalen spoke those words  mr vanstone said nothing he quietly removed his daughters arm from his neck as if he wished to be free from all interruption she returned accordingly to her place at the breakfasttable her father with the letter in his hand waited a little before he opened it her mother looking at him the while with an eager expectant attention which attracted miss garths notice and norahs as well as magdalens  after a minute or more of hesitation mr vanstone opened the letter  his face changed color the instant he read the first lines his cheeks fading to a dull yellowbrown hue which would have been ashy paleness in a less florid man and his expression becoming saddened and overclouded in a moment norah and magdalen watching anxiously saw nothing but the change that passed over their father miss garth alone observed the effect which that change produced on the attentive mistress of the house  it was not the effect which she or any one could have anticipated mrs vanstone looked excited rather than alarmed a faint flush rose on her cheeksher eyes brightenedshe stirred the tea round and round in her cup in a restless impatient manner which was not natural to her  magdalen in her capacity of spoiled child was as usual the first to break the silence  what is the matter papa she asked  nothing said mr vanstone sharply without looking up at her  im sure there must be something persisted magdalen im sure there is bad news papa in that american letter  there is nothing in the letter that concerns you said mr vanstone  it was the first direct rebuff that magdalen had ever received from her father she looked at him with an incredulous surprise which would have been irresistibly absurd under less serious circumstances  nothing more was said for the first time perhaps in their lives the family sat round the breakfasttable in painful silence mr vanstones hearty morning appetite like his hearty morning spirits was gone he absently broke off some morsels of dry toast from the rack near him absently finished his first cup of teathen asked for a second which he left before him untouched  norah he said after an interval you neednt wait for me magdalen my dear you can go when you like  his daughters rose immediately and miss garth considerately followed their example when an easytempered man does assert himself in his family the rarity of the demonstration invariably has its effect and the will of that easytempered man is law  what can have happened whispered norah as they closed the breakfastroom door and crossed the hall  what does papa mean by being cross with me exclaimed magdalen chafing under a sense of her own injuries  may i askwhat right you had to pry into your fathers private affairs retorted miss garth  right repeated magdalen i have no secrets from papawhat business has papa to have secrets from me i consider myself insulted  if you considered yourself properly reproved for not minding your own business said the plainspoken miss garth you would be a trifle nearer the truth ah you are like all the rest of the girls in the present day not one in a hundred of you knows which end of hers uppermost  the three ladies entered the morningroom and magdalen acknowledged miss garths reproof by banging the door  half an hour passed and neither mr vanstone nor his wife left the breakfastroom the servant ignorant of what had happened went in to clear the tablefound his master and mistress seated close together in deep consultationand immediately went out again another quarter of an hour elapsed before the breakfastroom door was opened and the private conference of the husband and wife came to an end  i hear mamma in the hall said norah perhaps she is coming to tell us something  mrs vanstone entered the morningroom as her daughter spoke the color was deeper on her cheeks and the brightness of halfdried tears glistened in her eyes her step was more hasty all her movements were quicker than usual  i bring news my dears which will surprise you she said addressing her daughters your father and i are going to london tomorrow  magdalen caught her mother by the arm in speechless astonishment miss garth dropped her work on her lap even the sedate norah started to her feet and amazedly repeated the words going to london  without us added magdalen  your father and i are going alone said mrs vanstone perhaps for as long as three weeksbut not longer we are goingshe hesitatedwe are going on important family business dont hold me magdalen this is a sudden necessityi have a great deal to do todaymany things to set in order before tomorrow there there my love let me go  she drew her arm away hastily kissed her youngest daughter on the forehead and at once left the room again even magdalen saw that her mother was not to be coaxed into hearing or answering any more questions  the morning wore on and nothing was seen of mr vanstone with the reckless curiosity of her age and character magdalen in defiance of miss garths prohibition and her sisters remonstrances determined to go to the study and look for her father there when she tried the door it was locked on the inside she said its only me papa and waited for the answer im busy now my dear was the answer dont disturb me  mrs vanstone was in another way equally inaccessible she remained in her own room with the female servants about her immersed in endless preparations for the approaching departure the servants little used in that family to sudden resolutions and unexpected orders were awkward and confused in obeying directions they ran from room to room unnecessarily and lost time and patience in jostling each other on the stairs if a stranger had entered the house that day he might have imagined that an unexpected disaster had happened in it instead of an unexpected necessity for a journey to london nothing proceeded in its ordinary routine magdalen who was accustomed to pass the morning at the piano wandered restlessly about the staircases and passages and in and out of doors when there were glimpses of fine weather norah whose fondness for reading had passed into a family proverb took up book after book from table and shelf and laid them down again in despair of fixing her attention even miss garth felt the allpervading influence of the household disorganization and sat alone by the morningroom fire with her head shaking ominously and her work laid aside  family affairs thought miss garth pondering over mrs vanstones vague explanatory words i have lived twelve years at comberaven and these are the first family affairs which have got between the parents and the children in all my experience what does it mean change i suppose im getting old i dont like change    chapter ii  at ten oclock the next morning norah and magdalen stood alone in the hall at comberaven watching the departure of the carriage which took their father and mother to the london train  up to the last moment both the sisters had hoped for some explanation of that mysterious family business to which mrs vanstone had so briefly alluded on the previous day no such explanation had been offered even the agitation of the leavetaking under circumstances entirely new in the home experience of the parents and children had not shaken the resolute discretion of mr and mrs vanstone they had gonewith the warmest testimonies of affection with farewell embraces fervently reiterated again and againbut without dropping one word from first to last of the nature of their errand  as the grating sound of the carriagewheels ceased suddenly at a turn in the road the sisters looked one another in the face each feeling and each betraying in her own way the dreary sense that she was openly excluded for the first time from the confidence of her parents norahs customary reserve strengthened into sullen silenceshe sat down in one of the hall chairs and looked out frowningly through the open house door magdalen as usual when her temper was ruffled expressed her dissatisfaction in the plainest terms i dont care who knows iti think we are both of us shamefully illused with those words the young lady followed her sisters example by seating herself on a hall chair and looking aimlessly out through the open house door  almost at the same moment miss garth entered the hall from the morningroom her quick observation showed her the necessity for interfering to some practical purpose and her ready good sense at once pointed the way  look up both of you if you please and listen to me said miss garth if we are all three to be comfortable and happy together now we are alone we must stick to our usual habits and go on in our regular way there is the state of things in plain words accept the situationas the french say here am i to set you the example i have just ordered an excellent dinner at the customary hour i am going to the medicinechest next to physic the kitchenmaidan unwholesome girl whose faceache is all stomach in the meantime norah my dear you will find your work and your books as usual in the library magdalen suppose you leave off tying your handkerchief into knots and use your fingers on the keys of the piano instead well lunch at one and take the dogs out afterward be as brisk and cheerful both of you as i am come rouse up directly if i see those gloomy faces any longer as sure as my names garth ill give your mother written warning and go back to my friends by the mixed train at twelve forty  concluding her address of expostulation in those terms miss garth led norah to the library door pushed magdalen into the morningroom and went on her own way sternly to the regions of the medicinechest  in this halfjesting halfearnest manner she was accustomed to maintain a sort of friendly authority over mr vanstones daughters after her proper functions as governess had necessarily come to an end norah it is needless to say had long since ceased to be her pupil and magdalen had by this time completed her education but miss garth had lived too long and too intimately under mr vanstones roof to be parted with for any purely formal considerations and the first hint at going away which she had thought it her duty to drop was dismissed with such affectionate warmth of protest that she never repeated it again except in jest the entire management of the household was from that time forth left in her hands and to those duties she was free to add what companionable assistance she could render to norahs reading and what friendly superintendence she could still exercise over magdalens music such were the terms on which miss garth was now a resident in mr vanstones family  toward the afternoon the weather improved at halfpast one the sun was shining brightly and the ladies left the house accompanied by the dogs to set forth on their walk  they crossed the stream and ascended by the little rocky pass to the hills beyond then diverged to the left and returned by a crossroad which led through the village of comberaven  as they came in sight of the first cottages they passed a man hanging about the road who looked attentively first at magdalen then at norah they merely observed that he was short that he was dressed in black and that he was a total stranger to themand continued their homeward walk without thinking more about the loitering footpassenger whom they had met on their way back  after they had left the village and had entered the road which led straight to the house magdalen surprised miss garth by announcing that the stranger in black had turned after they had passed him and was now following them he keeps on norahs side of the road she said mischievously im not the attractiondont blame me  whether the man was really following them or not made little difference for they were now close to the house as they passed through the lodgegates miss garth looked round and saw that the stranger was quickening his pace apparently with the purpose of entering into conversation seeing this she at once directed the young ladies to go on to the house with the dogs while she herself waited for events at the gate  there was just time to complete this discreet arrangement before the stranger reached the lodge he took off his hat to miss garth politely as she turned round what did he look like on the face of him he looked like a clergyman in difficulties  taking his portrait from top to toe the picture of him began with a tall hat broadly encircled by a mourning band of crumpled crape below the hat was a lean long sallow face deeply pitted with the smallpox and characterized very remarkably by eyes of two different

nevertheless in an oilskin case the front view of him was the view in which he looked oldest meeting him face to face he might have been estimated at fifty or more walking behind him his back and shoulders were almost young enough to have passed for fiveandthirty his manners were distinguished by a grave serenity when he opened his lips he spoke in a rich bass voice with an easy flow of language and a strict attention to the elocutionary claims of words in more than one syllable persuasion distilled from his mildlycurling lips and shabby as he was perennial flowers of courtesy bloomed all over him from head to foot  this is the residence of mr vanstone i believe he began with a circular wave of his hand in the direction of the house have i the honor of addressing a member of mr vanstones family  yes said the plainspoken miss garth you are addressing mr vanstones governess  the persuasive man fell back a stepadmired mr vanstones governessadvanced a step againand continued the conversation  and the two young ladies he went on the two young ladies who were walking with you are doubtless mr vanstones daughters i recognized the darker of the two and the elder as i apprehend by her likeness to her handsome mother the younger lady  you are acquainted with mrs vanstone i suppose said miss garth interrupting the strangers flow of language which all things considered was beginning in her opinion to flow rather freely the stranger acknowledged the interruption by one of his polite bows and submerged miss garth in his next sentence as if nothing had happened  the younger lady he proceeded takes after her father i presume i assure you her face struck me looking at it with my friendly interest in the family i thought it very remarkable i said to myselfcharming characteristic memorable not like her sister not like her mother no doubt the image of her father  once more miss garth attempted to stem the mans flow of words it was plain that he did not know mr vanstone even by sightotherwise he would never have committed the error of supposing that magdalen took after her father did he know mrs vanstone any better he had left miss garths question on that point unanswered in the name of wonder who was he powers of impudence what did he want  you may be a friend of the family though i dont remember your face said miss garth what may your commands be if you please did you come here to pay mrs vanstone a visit  i had anticipated the pleasure of communicating with mrs vanstone answered this inveterately evasive and inveterately civil man how is she  much as usual said miss garth feeling her resources of politeness fast failing her  is she at home  no  out for long  gone to london with mr vanstone  the mans long face suddenly grew longer his bilious brown eye looked disconcerted and his bilious green eye followed its example his manner became palpably anxious and his choice of words was more carefully selected than ever  is mrs vanstones absence likely to extend over any very lengthened period he inquired  it will extend over three weeks replied miss garth i think you have now asked me questions enough she went on beginning to let her temper get the better of her at last be so good if you please as to mention your business and your name if you have any message to leave for mrs vanstone i shall be writing to her by tonights post and i can take charge of it  a thousand thanks a most valuable suggestion permit me to take advantage of it immediately  he was not in the least affected by the severity of miss garths looks and languagehe was simply relieved by her proposal and he showed it with the most engaging sincerity this time his bilious green eye took the initiative and set his bilious brown eye the example of recovered serenity his curling lips took a new twist upward he tucked his umbrella briskly under his arm and produced from the breast of his coat a large oldfashioned black pocketbook from this he took a pencil and a cardhesitated and considered for a momentwrote rapidly on the cardand placed it with the politest alacrity in miss garths hand  i shall feel personally obliged if you will honor me by inclosing that card in your letter he said there is no necessity for my troubling you additionally with a message my name will be quite sufficient to recall a little family matter to mrs vanstone which has no doubt escaped her memory accept my best thanks this has been a day of agreeable surprises to me i have found the country hereabouts remarkably pretty i have seen mrs vanstones two charming daughters i have become acquainted with an honored preceptress in mr vanstones family i congratulate myselfi apologize for occupying your valuable timei beg my renewed acknowledgmentsi wish you goodmorning  he raised his tall hat his brown eye twinkled his green eye twinkled his curly lips smiled sweetly in a moment he turned on his heel his youthful back appeared to the best advantage his active little legs took him away trippingly in the direction of the village one two threeand he reached the turn in the road four five sixand he was gone  miss garth looked down at the card in her hand and looked up again in blank astonishment the name and address of the clericallooking stranger both written in pencil ran as follows  captain wragge postoffice bristol    chapter iii  when she returned to the house miss garth made no attempt to conceal her unfavorable opinion of the stranger in black his object was no doubt to obtain pecuniary assistance from mrs vanstone what the nature of his claim on her might be seemed less intelligibleunless it was the claim of a poor relation had mrs vanstone ever mentioned in the presence of her daughters the name of captain wragge neither of them recollected to have heard it before had mrs vanstone ever referred to any poor relations who were dependent on her on the contrary she had mentioned of late years that she doubted having any relations at all who were still living and yet captain wragge had plainly declared that the name on his card would recall a family matter to mrs vanstones memory what did it mean a false statement on the strangers part without any intelligible reason for making it or a second mystery following close on the heels of the mysterious journey to london  all the probabilities seemed to point to some hidden connection between the family affairs which had taken mr and mrs vanstone so suddenly from home and the family matter associated with the name of captain wragge miss garths doubts thronged back irresistibly on her mind as she sealed her letter to mrs vanstone with the captains card added by way of inclosure  by return of post the answer arrived  always the earliest riser among the ladies of the house miss garth was alo ne in the breakfastroom when the letter was brought in her first glance at its contents convinced her of the necessity of reading it carefully through in retirement before any embarrassing questions could be put to her leaving a message with the servant requesting norah to make the tea that morning she went upstairs at once to the solitude and security of her own room  mrs vanstones letter extended to some length the first part of it referred to captain wragge and entered unreservedly into all necessary explanations relating to the man himself and to the motive which had brought him to comberaven  it appeared from mrs vanstones statement that her mother had been twice married her mothers first husband had been a certain doctor wraggea widower with young children and one of those children was now the unmilitarylooking captain whose address was postoffice bristol mrs wragge had left no family by her first husband and had afterward married mrs vanstones father of that second marriage mrs vanstone herself was the only issue she had lost both her parents while she was still a young woman and in course of years her mothers family connections who were then her nearest surviving relatives had been one after another removed by death she was left at the present writing without a relation in the worldexcepting perhaps certain cousins whom she had never seen and of whose existence even at the present moment she possessed no positive knowledge  under these circumstances what family claim had captain wragge on mrs vanstone  none whatever as the son of her mothers first husband by that husbands first wife not even the widest stretch of courtesy could have included him at any time in the list of mrs vanstones most distant relations well knowing this the letter proceeded to say he had nevertheless persisted in forcing himself upon her as a species of family connection and she had weakly sanctioned the intrusion solely from the dread that he would otherwise introduce himself to mr vanstones notice and take unblushing advantage of mr vanstones generosity shrinking naturally from allowing her husband to be annoyed and probably cheated as well by any person who claimed however preposterously a family connection with herself it had been her practice for many years past to assist the captain from her own purse on the condition that he should never come near the house and that he should not presume to make any application whatever to mr vanstone  readily admitting the imprudence of this course mrs vanstone further explained that she had perhaps been the more inclined to adopt it through having been always accustomed in her early days to see the captain living now upon one member and now upon another of her mothers family possessed of abilities which might have raised him to distinction in almost any career that he could have chosen he had nevertheless from his youth upward been a disgrace to all his relatives he had been expelled the militia regiment in which he once held a commission he had tried one employment after another and had discreditably failed in all he had lived on his wits in the lowest and basest meaning of the phrase he had married a poor ignorant woman who had served as a waitress at some low eatinghouse who had unexpectedly come into a little money and whose small inheritance he had mercilessly squandered to the last farthing in plain terms he was an incorrigible scoundrel and he had now added one more to the list of his many misdemeanors by impudently breaking the conditions on which mrs vanstone had hitherto assisted him she had written at once to the address indicated on his card in such terms and to such purpose as would prevent him she hoped and believed from ever venturing near the house again such were the terms in which mrs vanstone concluded that first part of her letter which referred exclusively to captain wragge  although the statement thus presented implied a weakness in mrs vanstones character which miss garth after many years of intimate experience had never detected she accepted the explanation as a matter of course receiving it all the more readily inasmuch as it might without impropriety be communicated in substance to appease the irritated curiosity of the two young ladies for this reason especially she perused the first half of the letter with an agreeable sense of relief far different was the impression produced on her when she advanced to the second half and when she had read it to the end  the second part of the letter was devoted to the subject of the journey to london  mrs vanstone began by referring to the long and intimate friendship which had existed between miss garth and herself she now felt it due to that friendship to explain confidentially the motive which had induced her to leave home with her husband miss garth had delicately refrained from showing it but she must naturally have felt and must still be feeling great surprise at the mystery in which their departure had been involved and she must doubtless have asked herself why mrs vanstone should have been associated with family affairs which in her independent position as to relatives must necessarily concern mr vanstone alone  without touching on those affairs which it was neither desirable nor necessary to do mrs vanstone then proceeded to say that she would at once set all miss garths doubts at rest so far as they related to herself by one plain acknowledgment her object in accompanying her husband to london was to see a certain celebrated physician and to consult him privately on a very delicate and anxious matter connected with the state of her health in plainer terms still this anxious matter meant nothing less than the possibility that she might again become a mother  when the doubt had first suggested itself she had treated it as a mere delusion the long interval that had elapsed since the birth of her last child the serious illness which had afflicted her after the death of that child in infancy the time of life at which she had now arrivedall inclined her to dismiss the idea as soon as it arose in her mind it had returned again and again in spite of her she had felt the necessity of consulting the highest medical authority and had shrunk at the same time from alarming her daughters by summoning a london physician to the house the medical opinion sought under the circumstances already mentioned had now been obtained her doubt was confirmed as a certainty and the result which might be expected to take place toward the end of the summer was at her age and with her constitutional peculiarities a subject for serious future anxiety to say the least of it the physician had done his best to encourage her but she had understood the drift of his questions more clearly than he supposed and she knew that he looked to the future with more than ordinary doubt  having disclosed these particulars mrs vanstone requested that they might be kept a secret between her correspondent and herself she had felt unwilling to mention her suspicions to miss garth until those suspicions had been confirmedand she now recoiled with even greater reluctance from allowing her daughters to be in any way alarmed about her it would be best to dismiss the subject for the present and to wait hopefully till the summer came in the meantime they would all she trusted be happily reunited on the twentythird of the month which mr vanstone had fixed on as the day for their return with this intimation and with the customary messages the letter abruptly and confusedly came to an end   for the first few minutes a natural sympathy for mrs vanstone was the only feeling of which miss garth was conscious after she had laid the letter down ere long however there rose obscurely on her mind a doubt which perplexed and distressed her was the explanation which she had just read really as satisfactory and as complete as it professed to be testing it plainly by facts surely not  on the morning of her departure mrs vanstone had unquestionably left the house in good spirits at her age and in her state of health were good spirits compatible with such an errand to a physician as the errand on which she was bent then again had that letter from new orleans which had necessitated mr vanstones departure no share in occasioning his wifes departure as well why otherwise had she looked up so eagerly the moment her daughter mentioned the postmark granting the avowed motive for her journeydid not her manner on the morning when the letter was opened and again on the morning of departure suggest the existence of some other motive which her letter kept concealed  if it was so the conclusion that followed was a very distressing one mrs vanstone feeling what was due to her long friendship with miss garth had apparently placed the fullest confidence in her on one subject by way of unsuspiciously maintaining the strictest reserve toward her on another naturally frank and straightforward in all her own dealings miss garth shrank from plainly pursuing her doubts to this result a want of loyalty toward her tried and valued friend seemed implied in the mere dawning of it on her mind  she locked up the letter in her desk roused herself resolutely to attend to the passing interests of the day and went downstairs again to the breakfastroom amid many uncertainties this at least was clear mr and mrs vanstone were coming back on the twentythird of the month who could say what new revelations might not come back with them   chapter iv  no new revelations came back with them no anticipations associated with their return were realized on the one forbidden subject of their errand in london there was no moving either the master or the mistress of the house whatever their object might have been they had to all appearance successfully accomplished itfor they both returned in perfect possession of their everyday looks and manners mrs vanstones spirits had subsided to their natural quiet level mr vanstones imperturbable cheerfulness sat as easily and indolently on him as usual this was the one noticeable result of their journeythis and no more had the household revolution run its course already was the secret thus far hidden impenetrably hidden forever  nothing in this world is hidden forever the gold which has lain for centuries unsuspected in the ground reveals itself one day on the surface sand turns traitor and betrays the footstep that has passed over it water gives back to the telltale surface the body that has been drowned fire itself leaves the confession in ashes of the substance consumed in it hate breaks its prisonsecrecy in the thoughts through the doorway of the eyes and love finds the judas who betrays it by a kiss look where we will the inevitable law of revelation is one of the laws of nature the lasting preservation of a secret is a miracle which the world has never yet seen  how was the secret now hidden in the household at comberaven doomed to disclose itself through what coming event in the daily lives of the father the mother and the daughters was the law of revelation destined to break the fatal way to discovery the way opened unseen by the parents and unsuspected by the children through the first event that happened after mr and mrs vanstones returnan event which presented on the surface of it no interest of greater importance than the trivial social ceremony of a morning call  three days after the master and mistress of comberaven had come back the female members of the family happened to be assembled together in the morningroom the view from the windows looked over the flowergarden and shrubbery this last being protected at its outward extremity by a fence and approached from the lane beyond by a wicketgate during an interval in the conversation the attention of the ladies was suddenly attracted to this gate by the sharp sound of the iron latch falling in its socket some one had entered the shrubbery from the lane and magdalen at once placed herself at the window to catch the first sight of the visitor through the trees  after a few minutes the figure of a gentleman became visible at the point where the shrubbery path joined the winding gardenwalk which led to the house magdalen looked at him attentively without appearing at first to know who he was as he came nearer however she started in astonishment and turning quickly to her mother and sister proclaimed the gentleman in the garden to be no other than mr francis clare  the visitor thus announced was the son of mr vanstones oldest associate and nearest neighbor  mr clare the elder inhabited an unpretending little cottage situated just outside the shrubbery fence which marked the limit of the comberaven grounds belonging to the younger branch of a family of great antiquity the one inheritance of importance that he had derived from his ancestors was the possession of a magnificent library which not only filled all the rooms in his modest little dwelling but lined the staircases and passages as well mr clares books represented the one important interest of mr clares life he had been a widower for many years past and made no secret of his philosophical resignation to the loss of his wife as a father he regarded his family of three sons in the light of a necessary domestic evil which perpetually threatened the sanctity of his study and the safety of his books when the boys went to school mr clare said goodby to themand thank god to himself as for his small income and his still smaller domestic establishment he looked at them both from the same satirically indifferent point of view he called himself a pauper with a pedigree he abandoned the entire direction of his household to the slatternly old woman who was his only servant on the condition that she was never to venture near his books with a duster in her hand from one years end to the other his favorite poets were horace and pope his chosen philosophers hobbes and voltaire he took his exercise and his fresh air under protest and always walked the same distance to a yard on the ugliest highroad in the neighborhood he was crooked of back and quick of temper he could digest radishes and sleep after green tea his views of human nature were the views of diogenes tempered by rochefoucauld his personal habits were slovenly in the last degree and his favorite boast was that he had outlived all human prejudices  such was this singular man in his more superficial aspects what nobler qualities he might possess below the surface no one had ever discovered mr vanstone it is true stoutly asserted that mr clares worst side was his outsidebut in this expression of opinion he stood alone among his neighbors the association between these two widelydissimilar men had lasted for many years and was almost close enough to be called a friendship they had acquired a habit of meeting to smoke together on certain evenings in the week in the cynicphilosophers study and of there disputing on every imaginable subjectmr vanstone flourishing the stout cudgels of assertion and mr clare meeting him with the keen edgedtools of sophistry they generally quarreled at night and met on the neutral ground of the shrubbery to be reconciled together the next morning the bond of intercourse thus curiously established between them was strengthened on mr vanstones side by a hearty interest in his neighbors three sonsan interest by which those sons benefited all the more importantly seeing that one of the prejudices which their father had outlived was a prejudice in favor of his own children  i look at those boys the philosopher was accustomed to say with a perfectly impartial eye i dismiss the unimportant accident of their birth from all consideration and i find them below the average in every respect the only excuse which a poor gentleman has for presuming to exist in the nineteenth century is the excuse of extraordinary ability my boys have been addleheaded from infancy if i had any capital to give them i should make frank a butcher cecil a baker and arthur a grocerthose being the only human vocations i know of which are certain to be always in request as it is i have no money to help them with and they have no brains to help themselves they appear to me to be three human superfluities in dirty jackets and noisy boots and unless they clear themselves off the community by running away i dont myself profess to see what is to be done with them  fortunately for the boys mr vanstones views were still fast imprisoned in the ordinary prejudices at his intercession and through his influence frank cecil and arthur were received on the foundation of a wellreputed grammarschool in holidaytime they were mercifully allowed the run of mr vanstones paddock and were humanized and refined by association indoors with mrs vanstone and her daughters on these occasions mr clare used sometimes to walk across from his cottage in his dressinggown and slippers and look at the boys disparagingly through the window or over the fence as if they were three wild animals whom his neighbor was attempting to tame you and your wife are excellent people he used to say to mr vanstone i respect your honest prejudices in favor of those boys of mine with all my heart but you are so wrong about themyou are indeed i wish to give no offense i speak quite impartiallybut mark my words vanstone theyll all three turn out ill in spite of everything you can do to prevent it  in later years when frank had reached the age of seventeen the same curious shifting of the relative positions of parent and friend between the two neighbors was exemplified more absurdly than ever a civil engineer in the north of england who owed certain obligations to mr vanstone expressed his willingness to take frank under superintendence on terms of the most favorable kind when this proposal was received mr clare as usual first shifted his own character as franks father on mr vanstones shouldersand then moderated his neighbors parental enthusiasm from the point of view of an impartial spectator  its the finest chance for frank that could possibly have happened cried mr vanstone in a glow of fatherly enthusiasm  my good fellow he wont take it retorted mr clare with the icy composure of a disinterested friend  but he shall take it persisted mr vanstone  say he shall have a mathematical head rejoined mr clare say he shall possess industry ambition and firmness of purpose pooh pooh you dont look at him with my impartial eyes i say no mathematics no industry no ambition no firmness of purpose frank is a compound of negativesand there they are  hang your negatives shouted mr vanstone i dont care a rush for negatives or affirmatives either frank shall have this splendid chance and ill lay you any wager you like he makes the best of it  i am not rich enough to lay wagers usually replied mr clare but i think i have got a guinea about the house somewhere and ill lay you that guinea frank comes back on our hands like a bad shilling  done said mr vanstone no stop a minute i wont do the lads character the injustice of backing it at even money ill lay you five to one frank turns up trumps in this business you ought to be ashamed of yourself for talking of him as you do what sort of hocuspocus you bring it about by i dont pretend to know but you always end in making me take his part as if i was his father instead of you ah yes give you time and youll defend yourself i wont give you time i wont have any of your special pleading blacks white according to you i dont care its black for all that you may talk nineteen to the dozeni shall write to my friend and say yes in franks interests by todays post  such were the circumstances under which mr francis clare departed for the north of england at the age of seventeen to start in life as a civil engineer  from time to time mr vanstones friend communicated with him on the subject of the new pupil frank was praised as a quiet gentlemanlike interesting ladbut he was also reported to be rather slow at acquiring the rudiments of engineering science other letters later in date described him as a little too ready to despond about himself as having been sent away on that account to some new railway works to see if change of scene would rouse him and as having benefited in every respect by the experimentexcept perhaps in regard to his professional studies which still advanced but slowly subsequent communications announced his departure under care of a trustworthy foreman for some public works in belgium touched on the general benefit he appeared to derive from this new change praised his excellent manners and address which were of great assistance in facilitating business communications with the foreignersand passed over in ominous silence the main question of his actual progress in the acquirement of knowledge these reports and many others which resembled them were all conscientiously presented by franks friend to the attention of franks father on each occasion mr clare exulted over mr vanstone and mr vanstone quarreled with mr clare one of these days youll wish you hadnt laid that wager said the cynic philosopher one of these days i shall have the blessed satisfaction of pocketing your guinea cried the sanguine friend two years had then passed since franks departure in one year more results asserted themselves and settled the question  two days after mr vanstones return from london he was called away from the breakfasttable before he had found time enough to look over his letters delivered by the mornings post thrusting them into one of the pockets of his shootingjacket he took the letters out again at one grasp to read them when occasion served later in the day the grasp included the whole correspondence with one exceptionthat exception being a final report from the civil engineer which notified the termination of the connection between his pupil and himself and the immediate return of frank to his fathers house  while this important announcement lay unsuspected in mr vanstones pocket the object of it was traveling home as fast as railways could take him at halfpast ten at night while mr clare was sitting in studious solitude over his books and his green tea with his favorite black cat to keep him company he heard footsteps in the passagethe door openedand frank stood before him  ordinary men would have been astonished but the philosophers composure was not to be shaken by any such trifle as the unexpected return of his eldest son he could not have looked up more calmly from his learned volume if frank had been absent for three minutes instead of three years  exactly what i predicted said mr clare dont interrupt me by making explanations and dont frighten the cat if there is anything to eat in the kitchen get it and go to bed you can walk over to comberaven tomorrow and give this message from me to mr vanstone fathers compliments sir and i have come back upon your hands like a bad shilling as he always said i should he keeps his own guinea and takes your five and he hopes youll mind what he says to you another time that is the message shut the door after you goodnight  under these unfavorable auspices mr francis clare made his appearance the next morning in the grounds at comberaven and something doubtful of the reception that might await him slowly approached the precincts of the house  it was not wonderful that magdalen should have failed to recognize him when he first appeared in view he had gone away a backward lad of seventeen he returned a young man of twenty his slim figure had now acquired strength and grace and had increased in stature to the medium height the small regular features which he was supposed to have inherited from his mother were rounded and filled out without having lost their remarkable delicacy of form his beard was still in its infancy and nascent lines of whisker traced their modest way sparely down his cheeks his gentle wandering brown eyes would have looked to better advantage in a womans facethey wanted spirit and firmness to fit them for the face of a man his hands had the same wandering habit as his eyes they were constantly changing from one position to another constantly twisting and turning any little stray thing they could pick up he was undeniably handsome graceful wellbredbut no close observer could look at him without suspecting that the stout old family stock had begun to wear out in the later generations and that mr francis clare had more in him of the shadow of his ancestors than of the substance  when the astonishment caused by his appearance had partially subsided a search was instituted for the missing report it was found in the remotest recesses of mr vanstones capacious pocket and was read by that gentleman on the spot  the plain facts as stated by the engineer were briefly these frank was not possessed of the necessary abilities to fit him for his new calling and it was useless to waste time by keeping him any longer in an employment for which he had no vocation this after three years trial being the conviction on both sides the master had thought it the most straightforward course for the pupil to go home and candidly place results before his father and his friends in some other pursuit for which he was more fit and in which he could feel an interest he would no doubt display the industry and perseverance which he had been too much discouraged to practice in the profession that he had now abandoned personally he was liked by all who knew him and his future prosperity was heartily desired by the many friends whom he had made in the north such was the substance of the report and so it came to an end  many men would have thought the engineers statement rather too carefully worded and suspecting him of trying to make the best of a bad case would have entertained serious doubts on the subject of franks future mr vanstone was too easytempered and sanguineand too anxious as well not to yield his old antagonist an inch more ground than he could helpto look at the letter from any such unfavorable point of view was it franks fault if he had not got the stuff in him that engineers were made of did no other young men ever begin life with a false start plenty began in that way and got over it and did wonders afterward with these commentaries on the letter the kindhearted gentleman patted frank on the shoulder cheer up my lad said mr vanstone we will be even with your father one of these days though he has won the wager this time  the example thus set by the master of the house was followed at once by the familywith the solitary exception of norah whose incurable formality and reserve expressed themselves not too graciously in her distant manner toward the visitor the rest led by magdalen who had been franks favorite playfellow in past times glided back into their old easy habits with him without an effort he was frank with all of them but norah who persisted in addressing him as mr clare even the account he was now encouraged to give of the reception accorded to him by his father on the previous night failed to disturb norahs gravity she sat with her dark handsome face steadily averted her eyes cast down and the rich color in her cheeks warmer and deeper than usual all the rest miss garth included found old mr clares speech of welcome to his son quite irresistible the noise and merriment were at their height when the servant came in and struck the whole party dumb by the announcement of visitors in the drawingroom mr marrable mrs marrable and miss marrable evergreen lodge clifton  norah rose as readily as if the new arrivals had been a relief to her mind mrs vanstone was the next to leave her chair these two went away first to receive the visitors magdalen who preferred the society of her father and frank pleaded hard to be left behind but miss garth after granting five minutes grace took her into custody and marched her out of the room frank rose to take his leave  no no said mr vanstone detaining him dont go these people wont stop long mr marrables a merchant at bristol ive met him once or twice when the girls forced me to take them to parties at clifton mere acquaintances nothing more come and smoke a cigar in the greenhouse hang all visitorsthey worry ones life out ill appear at the last moment with an apology and you shall follow me at a safe distance and be a proof that i was really engaged  proposing this ingenious stratagem in a confidential whisper mr vanstone took franks arm and led him round the house by the back way the first ten minutes of seclusion in the conservatory passed without events of any kind at the end of that time a flying figure in bright garments flashed upon the two gentlemen through the glassthe door was flung openflowerpots fell in homage to passing petticoatsand mr vanstones youngest daughter ran up to him at headlong speed with every external appearance of having suddenly taken leave of her senses  papa the dream of my whole life is realized she said as soon as she could speak i shall fly through the roof of the greenhouse if somebody doesnt hold me down the marrables have come here with an invitation guess you darlingguess what theyre going to give at evergreen lodge  a ball said mr vanstone without a moments hesitation  private theatricals cried magdalen her clear young voice ringing through the conservatory like a bell her loose sleeves falling back and showing her round white arms to the dimpled elbows as she clapped her hands ecstatically in the air the rivals is the play papathe rivals by the famous whatshisnameand they want me to act the one thing in the whole universe that i long to do most it all depends on you mamma shakes her head and miss garth looks daggers and norahs as sulky as usualbut if you say yes they must all three give way and let me do as i like say yes she pleaded nestling softly up to her father and pressing her lips with a fond gentleness to his ear as she whispered the next words say yes and ill be a good girl for the rest of my life  a good girl repeated mr vanstonea mad girl i think you must mean hang these people and their theatricals i shall have to go indoors and see about this matter you neednt throw away your cigar frank youre well out of the business and you can stop here  no he cant said magdalen hes in the business too  mr francis clare had hitherto remained modestly in the background he now came forward with a face expressive of speechless amazement  yes continued magdalen answering his blank look of inquiry with perfect composure you are to act miss marrable and i have a turn for business and we settled it all in five minutes there are two parts in the play left to be filled one is lucy the waitingmaid which is the character i have undertakenwith papas permission she added slyly pinching her fathers arm and he wont say no will he first because hes a darling secondly because i love him and he loves me thirdly because there is never any difference of opinion between us is there fourthly because i give him a kiss which naturally stops his mouth and settles the whole question dear me im wandering where was i just now oh yes explaining myself to frank  i beg your pardon began frank attempting at this point to enter his protest  the second character in the play pursued magdalen without taking the smallest notice of the protest is falklanda jealous lover with a fine flow of language miss marrable and i discussed falkland privately on the windowseat while the rest were talking she is a delightful girlso impulsive so sensible so entirely unaffected she confided in me she said one of our miseries is that we cant find a gentleman who will grapple with the hideous difficulties of falkland of course i soothed her of course i said ive got the gentleman and he shall grapple immediatelyoh heavens who is hemr francis clareand where is hein the house at this momentwill you be so very charming miss vanstone as to fetch himill fetch him miss marrable with the greatest pleasure i left the windowseati rushed into the morningroomi smelled cigarsi followed the smelland here i am  its a compliment i know to be asked to act said frank in great embarrassment but i hope you and miss marrable will excuse me  certainly not miss marrable and i are both remarkable for the firmness of our characters when we say mr soandso is positively to act the part of falkland we positively mean it come in and be introduced  but i never tried to act i dont know how  not of the slightest consequence if you dont know how come to me and ill teach you  you exclaimed mr vanstone what do you know about it  pray papa be serious i have the strongest internal conviction that i could act every character in the playfalkland included dont let me have to speak a second time frank come and be introduced  she took her fathers arm and moved on with him to the door of the greenhouse at the steps she turned and looked round to see if frank was following her it was only the action of a moment but in that moment her natural firmness of will rallied all its resourcesstrengthened itself with the influence of her beauty commandedand conquered she looked lovely the flush was tenderly bright in her cheeks the radiant pleasure shone and sparkled in her eyes the position of her figure turned suddenly from the waist upward disclosed its delicate strength its supple firmness its seductive serpentine grace come she said with a coquettish beckoning action of her head come frank  few men of forty would have resisted her at that moment frank was twenty last birthday in other words he threw aside his cigar and followed her out of the greenhouse  as he turned and closed the doorin the instant when he lost sight of herhis disinclination to be associated with the private theatricals revived at the foot of the housesteps he stopped again plucked a twig from a plant near him broke it in his hand and looked about him uneasily on this side and on that the path to the left led back to his fathers cottagethe way of escape lay open why not take it  while he still hesitated mr vanstone and his daughter reached the top of the steps once more magdalen looked roundlooked with her resistless beauty with her allconquering smile she beckoned again and again he followed herup the steps and over the threshold the door closed on them  so with a trifling gesture of invitation on one side with a trifling act of compliance on the other sowith no knowledge in his mind with no thought in hers of the secret still hidden under the journey to londonthey took the way which led to that secrets discovery through many a darker winding that was yet to come    chapter v  mr vanstones inquiries into the proposed theatrical entertainment at evergreen lodge were answered by a narrative of dramatic disasters of which miss marrable impersonated the innocent cause and in which her father and mother played the parts of chief victims  miss marrable was that hardest of all born tyrantsan only child she had never granted a constitutional privilege to her oppressed father and mother since the time when she cut her first tooth her seventeenth birthday was now near at hand she had decided on celebrating it by acting a play had issued her orders accordingly and had been obeyed by her docile parents as implicitly as usual mrs marrable gave up the drawingroom to be laid waste for a stage and a theater mr marrable secured the services of a respectable professional person to drill the young ladies and gentlemen and to accept all the other responsibilities incidental to creating a dramatic world out of a domestic chaos having further accustomed themselves to the breaking of furniture and the staining of wallsto thumping tumbling hammering and screaming to doors always banging and to footsteps perpetually running up and down stairsthe nominal master and mistress of the house fondly believed that their chief troubles were over innocent and fatal delusion it is one thing in private society to set up the stage and choose the playit is another thing altogether to find the actors hitherto only the small preliminary annoyances proper to the occasion had shown themselves at evergreen lodge the sound and serious troubles were all to come  the rivals having been chosen as the play miss marrable as a matter of course appropriated to herself the part of lydia languish one of her favored swains next secured captain absolute and another laid violent hands on sir lucius otrigger these two were followed by an accommodating spinster relative who accepted the heavy dramatic responsibility of mrs malapropand there the theatrical proceedings came to a pause nine more speaking characters were left to be fitted with representatives and with that unavoidable necessity the serious troubles began  all the friends of the family suddenly became unreliable people for the first time in their lives after encouraging the idea of the play they declined the personal sacrifice of acting in itor they accepted characters and then broke down in the effort to study themor they volunteered to take the parts which they knew were already engaged and declined the parts which were waiting to be actedor they were afflicted with weak constitutions and mischievously fell ill when they were wanted at rehearsalor they had puritan relatives in the background and after slipping into their parts cheerfully at the weeks beginning oozed out of them penitently under serious family pressure at the weeks end meanwhile the carpenters hammered and the scenes rose miss marrable whose temperament was sensitive became hysterical under the strain of perpetual anxiety the family doctor declined to answer for the nervous consequences if something was not done renewed efforts were made in every direction actors and actresses were sought with a desperate disregard of all considerations of personal fitness necessity which knows no law either in the drama or out of it accepted a lad of eighteen as the representative of sir anthony absolute the stagemanager undertaking to supply the necessary wrinkles from the illimitable resources of theatrical art a lady whose age was unknown and whose personal appearance was stoutbut whose heart was in the right placevolunteered to act the part of the sentimental julia and brought with her the dramatic qualification of habitually wearing a wig in private life thanks to these vigorous measures the play was at last supplied with representativesalways excepting the two unmanageable characters of lucy the waitingmaid and falkland julias jealous lover gentlemen came saw julia at rehearsal observed her stoutness and her wig omitted to notice that her heart was in the right place quailed at the prospect apologized and retired ladies read the part of lucy remarked that she appeared to great advantage in the first half of the play and faded out of it altogether in the latter half objected to pass from the notice of the audience in that manner when all the rest had a chance of distinguishing themselves to the end shut up the book apologized and retired in eight days more the night of performance would arrive a phalanx of social martyrs two hundred strong had been convened to witness it three full rehearsals were absolutely necessary and two characters in the play were not filled yet with this lamentable story and with the humblest apologies for presuming on a slight acquaintance the marrables appeared at comberaven to appeal to the young ladies for a lucy and to the universe for a falkland with the mendicant pertinacity of a family in despair  this statement of circumstancesaddressed to an audience which included a father of mr vanstones disposition and a daughter of magdalens temperamentproduced the result which might have been anticipated from the first  either misinterpreting or disregarding the ominous silence preserved by his wife and miss garth mr vanstone not only gave magdalen permission to assist the forlorn dramatic company but accepted an invitation to witness the performance for norah and himself mrs vanstone declined accompanying them on account of her health and miss garth only engaged to make one among the audience conditionally on not being wanted at home the parts of lucy and falkland which the distressed family carried about with them everywhere like incidental maladies were handed to their representatives on the spot franks faint remonstrances were rejected without a hearing the days and hours of rehearsal were carefully noted down on the covers of the parts and the marrables took their leave with a perfect explosion of thanksfather mother and daughter sowing their expressions of gratitude broadcast from the drawingroom door to the gardengates  as soon as the carriage had driven away magdalen presented herself to the general observation under an entirely new aspect  if any more visitors call today she said with the profoundest gravity of look and manner i am not at home this is a far more serious matter than any of you suppose go somewhere by yourself frank and read over your part and dont let your attention wander if you can possibly help it i shall not be accessible before the evening if you will come herewith papas permissionafter tea my views on the subject of falkland will be at your disposal thomas whatever else the gardener does he is not to make any floricultural noises under my window for the rest of the afternoon i shall be immersed in studyand the quieter the house is the more obliged i shall feel to everybody  before miss garths battery of reproof could open fire before the first outburst of mr vanstones hearty laughter could escape his lips she bowed to them with imperturbable gravity ascended the housesteps for the first time in her life at a walk instead of a run and retired then and there to the bedroom regions franks helpless astonishment at her disappearance added a new element of absurdity to the scene he stood first on one leg and then on the other rolling and unrolling his part and looking piteously in the faces of the friends about him i know i cant do it he said may i come in after tea and hear magdalens views thank youill look in about eight dont tell my father about this acting please i should never hear the last of it those were the only words he had spirit enough to utter he drifted away aimlessly in the direction of the shrubbery with the part hanging open in his handthe most incapable of falklands and the most helpless of mankind  franks departure left the family by themselves and was the signal accordingly for an attack on mr vanstones inveterate carelessness in the exercise of his paternal authority  what could you possibly be thinking of andrew when you gave your consent said mrs vanstone surely my silence was a sufficient warning to you to say no  a mistake mr vanstone chimed in miss garth made with the best intentionsbut a mistake for all that  it may be a mistake said norah taking her fathers part as usual but i really dont see how papa or any one else could have declined under the circumstances  quite right my dear observed mr vanstone the circumstances as you say were dead against me here were these unfortunate people in a scrape on one side and magdalen on the other mad to act i couldnt say i had methodistical objectionsive nothing methodistical about me what other excuse could i make the marrables are respectable people and keep the best company in clifton what harm can she get in their house if you come to prudence and that sort of thingwhy shouldnt magdalen do what miss marrable does there there let the poor things act and amuse themselves we were their age onceand its no use making a fussand thats all ive got to say about it  with that characteristic defense of his own conduct mr vanstone sauntered back to the greenhouse to smoke another cigar  i didnt say so to papa said norah taking her mothers arm on the way back to the house but the bad result of the acting in my opinion will be the familiarity it is sure to encourage between magdalen and francis clare  you are prejudiced against frank my love said mrs vanstone  norahs soft secret hazel eyes sank to the ground she said no more her opinions were unchangeablebut she never disputed with anybody she had the great failing of a reserved naturethe failing of obstinacy and the great meritthe merit of silence what is your head running on now thought miss garth casting a sharp look at norahs dark downcast face youre one of the impenetrable sort give me magdalen with all her perversities i can see daylight through her youre as dark as night  the hours of the afternoon passed away and still magdalen remained shut up in her own room no restless footsteps pattered on the stairs no nimble tongue was heard chattering here there and everywhere from the garret to the kitchenthe house seemed hardly like itself with the one everdisturbing element in the family serenity suddenly withdrawn from it anxious to witness with her own eyes the reality of a transformation in which past experience still inclined her to disbelieve miss garth ascended to magdalens room knocked twice at the door received no answer opened it and looked in  there sat magdalen in an armchair before the long lookingglass with all her hair let down over her shoulders absorbed in the study of her part and comfortably arrayed in her morning wrapper until it was time to dress for dinner and there behind her sat the ladysmaid slowly combing out the long heavy locks of her young mistresss hair with the sleepy resignation of a woman who had been engaged in that employment for some hours past the sun was shining and the green shutters outside the window were closed the dim light fell tenderly on the two quiet seated figures on the little white bed with the knots of rosecolored ribbon which looped up its curtains and the bright dress for dinner laid ready across it on the gayly painted bath with its pure lining of white enamel on the toilettable with its sparkling trinkets its crystal bottles its silver bell with cupid for a handle its litter of little luxuries that adorn the shrine of a womans bedchamber the luxurious tranquillity of the scene the cool fragrance of flowers and perfumes in the atmosphere the rapt attitude of magdalen absorbed over her reading the monotonous regularity of movement in the maids hand and arm as she drew the comb smoothly through and through her mistresss hairall conveyed the same soothing impression of drowsy delicious quiet on one side of the door were the broad daylight and the familiar realities of life on the other was the dreamland of elysian serenitythe sanctuary of unruffled repose  miss garth paused on the threshold and looked into the room in silence  magdalens curious fancy for having her hair combed at all times and seasons was among the peculiarities of her character which were notorious to everybody in the house it was one of her fathers favorite jokes that she reminded him on such occasions of a cat having her back stroked and that he always expected if the combing were only continued long enough to hear her purr extravagant as it may seem the comparison was not altogether inappropriate the girls fervid temperament intensified the essentially feminine pleasure that most women feel in the passage of the comb through their hair to a luxury of sensation which absorbed her in enjoyment so serenely selfdemonstrative so drowsily deep that it did irresistibly suggest a pet cats enjoyment under a caressing hand intimately as miss garth was acquainted with this peculiarity in her pupil she now saw it asserting itself for the first time in association with mental exertion of any kind on magdalens part feeling therefore some curiosity to know how long the combing and the studying had gone on together she ventured on putting the question first to the mistress and receiving no answer in that quarter secondly to the maid  all the afternoon miss off and on was the weary answer miss magdalen says it soothes her feelings and clears her mind  knowing by experience that interference would be hopeless under these circumstances miss garth turned sharply and left the room she smiled when she was outside on the landing the female mind does occasionallythough not oftenproject itself into the future miss garth was prophetically pitying magdalens unfortunate husband  dinnertime presented the fair student to the family eye in the same mentally absorbed aspect on all ordinary occasions magdalens appetite would have terrified those feeble sentimentalists who affect to ignore the allimportant influence which female feeding exerts in the production of female beauty on this occasion she refused one dish after another with a resolution which implied the rarest of all modern martyrdomsgastric martyrdom i have conceived the part of lucy she observed with the demurest gravity the next difficulty is to make frank conceive the part of falkland i see nothing to laugh atyou would all be serious enough if you had my responsibilities no papano wine today thank you i must keep my intelligence clear water thomasand a little more jelly i think before you take it away  when frank presented himself in the evening ignorant of the first elements of his part she took him in hand as a middleaged schoolmistress might have taken in hand a backward little boy the few attempts he made to vary the sternly practical nature of the evenings occupation by slipping in compliments sidelong she put away from her with the contemptuous selfpossession of a woman of twice her age she literally forced him into his part her father fell asleep in his chair mrs vanstone and miss garth lost their interest in the proceedings retired to the further end of the room and spoke together in whispers it grew later and later and still magdalen never flinched from her taskstill with equal perseverance norah who had been on the watch all through the evening kept on the watch to the end the distrust darkened and darkened on her face as she looked at her sister and frank as she saw how close they sat together devoted to the same interest and working to the same end the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to halfpast eleven before lucy the resolute permitted falkland the helpless to shut up his taskbook for the night shes wonderfully clever isnt she said frank taking leave of mr vanstone at the hall door im to come tomorrow and hear more of her viewsif you have no objection i shall never do it dont tell her i said so as fast as she teaches me one speech the other goes out of my head discouraging isnt it goodnight  the next day but one was the day of the first full rehearsal on the previous evening mrs vanstones spirits had been sadly depressed at a private interview with miss garth she had referred again of her own accord to the subject of her letter from londonhad spoken selfreproachfully of her weakness in admitting captain wragges impudent claim to a family connection with herand had then reverted to the state of her health and to the doubtful prospect that awaited her in the coming summer in a tone of despondency which it was very distressing to hear anxious to cheer her spirits miss garth had changed the conversation as soon as possiblehad referred to the approaching theatrical performanceand had relieved mrs vanstones mind of all anxiety in that direction by announcing her intention of accompanying magdalen to each rehearsal and of not losing sight of her until she was safely back again in her fathers house accordingly when frank presented himself at comberaven on the eventful morning there stood miss garth preparedin the interpolated character of argusto accompany lucy and falkland to the scene of trial the railway conveyed the three in excellent time to evergreen lodge and at one oclock the rehearsal began    chapter vi  i hope miss vanstone knows her part whispered mrs marrable anxiously addressing herself to miss garth in a corner of the theater  if airs and graces make an actress maam magdalens performance will astonish us all with that reply miss garth took out her work and seated herself on guard in the center of the pit  the manager perched himself book in hand on a stool close in front of the stage he was an active little man of a sweet and cheerful temper and he gave the signal to begin with as patient an interest in the proceedings as if they had caused him no trouble in the past and promised him no difficulty in the future the two characters which opened the comedy of the rivals fag and the coachman appeared on the scenelooked many sizes too tall for their canvas background which represented a street in bathexhibited the customary inability to manage their own arms legs and voiceswent out severally at the wrong exitsand expressed their perfect approval of results so far by laughing heartily behind the scenes silence gentlemen if you please remonstrated the cheerful manager as loud as you like on the stage but the audience mustnt hear you off it miss marrable ready miss vanstone ready easy there with the street in bath its going up crooked face this way miss marrable full face if you please miss vanstone he checked himself suddenly curious he said under his breathshe fronts the audience of her own accord lucy opened the scene in these words indeed maam i traversed half the town in search of it i dont believe theres a circulating library in bath i havent been at the manager started in his chair my heart alive she speaks out without telling the dialogue went on lucy produced the novels for miss lydia languishs private reading from under her cloak the manager rose excitably to his feet marvelous no hurry with the books no dropping them she looked at the titles before she announced them to her mistress she set down humphrey clinker on the tears of sensibility with a smart little smack which pointed the antithesis one momentand she announced julias visit anotherand she dropped the brisk waitingmaids courtesy a thirdand she was off the stage on the side set down for her in the book the manager wheeled round on his stool and looked hard at miss garth i beg your pardon maam he said miss marrable told me before we began that this was the young ladys first attempt it cant be surely  it is replied miss garth reflecting the managers look of amazement on her own face was it possible that magdalens unintelligible industry in the study of her part really sprang from a serious interest in her occupationan interest which implied a natural fitness for it  the rehearsal went on the stout lady with the wig and the excellent heart personated the sentimental julia from an inveterately tragic point of view and used her handkerchief distractedly in the first scene the spinster relative felt mrs malaprops mistakes in language so seriously and took such extraordinary pains with her blunders that they sounded more like exercises in elocution than anything else the unhappy lad who led the forlorn hope of the company in the person of sir anthony absolute expressed the age and irascibility of his character by tottering incessantly at the knees and thumping the stage perpetually with his stick slowly and clumsily with constant interruptions and interminable mistakes the first act dragged on until lucy appeared again to end it in soliloquy with the confession of her assumed simplicity and the praise of her own cunning  here the stage artifice of the situation presented difficulties which magdalen had not encountered in the first sceneand here her total want of experience led her into more than one palpable mistake the stagemanager with an eagerness which he had not shown in the case of any other member of the company interfered immediately and set her right at one point she was to pause and take a turn on the stageshe did it at another she was to stop toss her head and look pertly at the audienceshe did it when she took out the paper to read the list of the presents she had received could she give it a tap with her finger yes and lead off with a little laugh yesafter twice trying could she read the different items with a sly look at the end of each sentence straight at the pit yes straight at the pit and as sly as you please the managers cheerful face beamed with approval he tucked the play under his arm and clapped his hands gayly the gentlemen clustered together behind the scenes followed his example the ladies looked at each other with dawning doubts whether they had not better have left the new recruit in the retirement of private life too deeply absorbed in the business of the stage to heed any of them magdalen asked leave to repeat the soliloquy and make quite sure of her own improvement she went all through it again without a mistake this time from beginning to end the manager celebrating her attention to his directions by an outburst of professional approbation which escaped him in spite of himself she can take a hint cried the little man with a hearty smack of his hand on the promptbook shes a born actress if ever there was one yet  i hope not said miss garth to herself taking up the work which had dropped into her lap and looking down at it in some perplexity her worst apprehension of results in connection with the theatrical enterprise had foreboded levity of conduct with some of the gentlemenshe had not bargained for this magdalen in the capacity of a thoughtless girl was comparatively easy to deal with magdalen in the character of a born actress threatened serious future difficulties  the rehearsal proceeded lucy returned to the stage for her scenes in the second act the last in which she appears with sir lucius and fag here again magdalens inexperience betrayed itselfand here once more her resolution in attacking and conquering her own mistakes astonished everybody bravo cried the gentlemen behind the scenes as she steadily trampled down one blunder after another ridiculous said the ladies with such a small part as hers heaven forgive me thought miss garth coming round unwillingly to the general opinion i almost wish we were papists and i had a convent to put her in tomorrow one of mr marrables servants entered the theater as that desperate aspiration escaped the governess she instantly sent the man behind the scene with a message miss vanstone has done her part in the rehearsal request her to come here and sit by me the servant returned with a polite apology miss vanstones kind love and she begs to be excusedshes prompting mr clare she prompted him to such purpose that he actually got through his part the performances of the other gentlemen were obtrusively imbecile frank was just one degree betterhe was modestly incapable and he gained by comparison thanks to miss vanstone observed the manager who had heard the prompting she pulled him through we shall be flat enough at night when the drop falls on the second act and the audience have seen the last of her its a thousand pities she hasnt got a better part  its a thousand mercies shes no more to do than she has muttered miss garth overhearing him as things are the people cant well turn her head with applause shes out of the play in the second actthats one comfort  no wellregulated mind ever draws its inferences in a hurry miss garths mind was well regulated therefore logically speaking miss garth ought to have been superior to the weakness of rushing at conclusions she had committed that error nevertheless under present circumstances in plainer terms the consoling reflection which had just occurred to her assumed that the play had by this time survived all its disasters and entered on its longdeferred career of success the play had done nothing of the sort misfortune and the marrable family had not parted company yet  when the rehearsal was over nobody observed that the stout lady with the wig privately withdrew herself from the company and when she was afterward missed from the table of refreshments which mr marrables hospitality kept ready spread in a room near the theater nobody imagined that there was any serious reason for her absence it was not till the ladies and gentlemen assembled for the next rehearsal that the true state of the case was impressed on the minds of the company at the appointed hour no julia appeared in her stead mrs marrable portentously approached the stage with an open letter in her hand she was naturally a lady of the mildest good breeding she was mistress of every bland conventionality in the english languagebut disasters and dramatic influences combined threw even this harmless matron off her balance at last for the first time in her life mrs marrable indulged in vehement gesture and used strong language she handed the letter sternly at armslength to her daughter my dear she said with an aspect of awful composure we are under a curse before the amazed dramatic company could petition for an explanation she turned and left the room the managers professional eye followed her out respectfullyhe looked as if he approved of the exit from a theatrical point of view  what new misfortune had befallen the play the last and worst of all misfortunes had assailed it the stout lady had resigned her part  not maliciously her heart which had been in the right place throughout remained inflexibly in the right place still her explanation of the circumstances proved this if nothing else did the letter began with a statement she had overheard at the last rehearsal quite unintentionally personal remarks of which she was the subject they might or might not have had reference to herhair and herfigure she would not distress mrs marrable by repeating them neither would she mention names because it was foreign to her nature to make bad worse the only course at all consistent with her own selfrespect was to resign her part she inclosed it accordingly to mrs marrable with many apologies for her presumption in undertaking a youthful character atwhat a gentleman was pleased to termher age and with what two ladies were rude enough to characterize as her disadvantages ofhair andfigure a younger and more attractive representative of julia would no doubt be easily found in the meantime all persons concerned had her full forgiveness to which she would only beg leave to add her best and kindest wishes for the success of the play  in four nights more the play was to be performed if ever any human enterprise stood in need of good wishes to help it that enterprise was unquestionably the theatrical entertainment at evergreen lodge  one armchair was allowed on the stage and into that armchair miss marrable sank preparatory to a fit of hysterics magdalen stepped forward at the first convulsion snatched the letter from miss marrables hand and stopped the threatened catastrophe  shes an ugly baldheaded malicious middleaged wretch said magdalen tearing the letter into fragments and tossing them over the heads of the company but i can tell her one thingshe shant spoil the play ill act julia  bravo cried the chorus of gentlementhe anonymous gentleman who had helped to do the mischief otherwise mr francis clare loudest of all  if you want the truth i dont shrink from owning it continued magdalen im one of the ladies she means i said she had a head like a mop and a waist like a bolster so she has  i am the other lady added the spinster relative but i only said she was too stout for the part  i am the gentleman chimed in frank stimulated by the force of example i said nothingi only agreed with the ladies  here miss garth seized her opportunity and addressed the stage loudly from the pit  stop stop she said you cant settle the difficulty that way if magdalen plays julia who is to play lucy  miss marrable sank back in the armchair and gave way to the second convulsion  stuff and nonsense cried magdalen the things simple enough ill act julia and lucy both together  the manager was consulted on the spot suppressing lucys first entrance and turning the short dialogue about the novels into a soliloquy for lydia languish appeared to be the only changes of importance necessary to the accomplishment of magdalens project lucys two telling scenes at the end of the first and second acts were sufficiently removed from the scenes in which julia appeared to give time for the necessary transformations in dress even miss garth though she tried hard to find them could put no fresh obstacles in the way the question was settled in five minutes and the rehearsal went on magdalen learning julias stage situations with the book in her hand and announcing afterward on the journey home that she proposed sitting up all night to study the new part frank thereupon expressed his fears that she would have no time left to help him through his theatrical difficulties she tapped him on the shoulder coquettishly with her part you foolish fellow how am i to do without you youre julias jealous lover youre always making julia cry come tonight and make me cry at teatime you havent got a venomous old woman in a wig to act with now its my heart youre to breakand of course i shall teach you how to do it   the four days interval passed busily in perpetual rehearsals public and private the night of performance arrived the guests assembled the great dramatic experiment stood on its trial magdalen had made the most of her opportunities she had learned all that the manager could teach her in the time miss garth left her when the overture began sitting apart in a corner behind the scenes serious and silent with her smellingbottle in one hand and her book in the other resolutely training herself for the coming ordeal to the very last  the play began with all the proper accompaniments of a theatrical performance in private life with a crowded audience an african temperature a bursting of heated lampglasses and a difficulty in drawing up the curtain fag and the coachman who opened the scene took leave of their memories as soon as they stepped on the stage left half their dialogue unspoken came to a dead pause were audibly entreated by the invisible manager to come off and went off accordingly in every respect sadder and wiser men than when they went on the next scene disclosed miss marrable as lydia languish gracefully seated very pretty beautifully dressed accurately mistress of the smallest words in her part possessed in short of every personal resourceexcept her voice the ladies admired the gentlemen applauded nobody heard anything but the words speak up miss whispered by the same voice which had already entreated fag and the coachman to come off a responsive titter rose among the younger spectators checked immediately by magnanimous applause the temperature of the audience was rising to blood heatbut the national sense of fair play was not boiled out of them yet  in the midst of the demonstration magdalen quietly made her first entrance as julia she was dressed very plainly in dark colors and wore her own hair all stage adjuncts and alterations excepting the slightest possible touch of rouge on her cheeks having been kept in reserve to disguise her the more effectually in her second part the grace and simplicity of her costume the steady selfpossession with which she looked out over the eager rows of faces before her raised a low hum of approval and expectation she spokeafter suppressing a momentary tremorwith a quiet distinctness of utterance which reached all ears and which at once confirmed the favorable impression that her appearance had produced the one member of the audience who looked at her and listened to her coldly was her elder sister before the actress of the evening had been five minutes on the stage norah detected to her own indescribable astonishment that magdalen had audaciously individualized the feeble amiability of julias character by seizing no less a person than herself as the model to act it by she saw all her own little formal peculiarities of manner and movement unblushingly reproducedand even the very tone of her voice so accurately mimicked from time to time that the accents startled her as if she was speaking herself with an echo on the stage the effect of this cool appropriation of norahs identity to theatrical purposes on the audiencewho only saw resultsasserted itself in a storm of applause on magdalens exit she had won two incontestable triumphs in her first scene by a dexterous piece of mimicry she had made a living reality of one of the most insipid characters in the english drama and she had roused to enthusiasm an audience of two hundred exiles from the blessings of ventilation all simmering together in their own animal heat under the circumstances where is the actress by profession who could have done much more  but the event of the evening was still to come magdalens disguised reappearance at the end of the act in the character of lucywith false hair and false eyebrows with a brightred complexion and patches on her cheeks with the gayest colors flaunting in her dress and the shrillest vivacity of voice and mannerfairly staggered the audience they looked down at their programmes in which the representative of lucy figured under an assumed name looked up again at the stage penetrated the disguise and vented their astonishment in another round of applause louder and heartier even than the last norah herself could not deny this time that the tribute of approbation had been well deserved there forcing its way steadily through all the faults of inexperiencethere plainly visible to the dullest of the spectators was the rare faculty of dramatic impersonation expressing itself in every look and action of this girl of eighteen who now stood on a stage for the first time in her life failing in many minor requisites of the double task which she had undertaken she succeeded in the one important necessity of keeping the main distinctions of the two characters thoroughly apart everybody felt that the difficulty lay hereeverybody saw the difficulty conqueredeverybody echoed the managers enthusiasm at rehearsal which had hailed her as a born actress  when the dropscene descended for the first time magdalen had concentrated in herself the whole interest and attraction of the play the audience politely applauded miss marrable as became the guests assembled in her fathers house and goodhumoredly encouraged the remainder of the company to help them through a task for which they were all more or less palpably unfit but as the play proceeded nothing roused them to any genuine expression of interest when magdalen was absent from the scene there was no disguising it miss marrable and her bosom friends had been all hopelessly cast in the shade by the new recruit whom they had summoned to assist them in the capacity of forlorn hope and this on miss marrables own birthday and this in her fathers house and this after the unutterable sacrifices of six weeks past of all the domestic disasters which the thankless theatrical enterprise had inflicted on the marrable family the crowning misfortune was now consummated by magdalens success  leaving mr vanstone and norah on the conclusion of the play among the guests in the supperroom miss garth went behind the scenes ostensibly anxious to see if she could be of any use really bent on ascertaining whether magdalens head had been turned by the triumphs of the evening it would not have surprised miss garth if she had discovered her pupil in the act of making terms with the manager for her forthcoming appearance in a public theater as events really turned out she found magdalen on the stage receiving with gracious smiles a card which the manager presented to her with a professional bow noticing miss garths mute look of inquiry the civil little man hastened to explain that the card was his own and that he was merely asking the favor of miss vanstones recommendation at any future opportunity  this is not the last time the young lady will be concerned in private theatricals ill answer for it said the manager and if a superintendent is wanted on the next occasion she has kindly promised to say a good word for me i am always to be heard of miss at that address saying those words he bowed again and discreetly disappeared  vague suspicions beset the mind of miss garth and urged her to insist on looking at the card no more harmless morsel of pasteboard was ever passed from one hand to another the card contained nothing but the managers name and under it the name and address of a theatrical agent in london  it is not worth the trouble of keeping said miss garth  magdalen caught her hand before she could throw the card awaypossessed herself of it the next instantand put it in her pocket  i promised to recommend him she saidand thats one reason for keeping his card if it does nothing else it will remind me of the happiest evening of my lifeand thats another come she cried throwing her arms round miss garth with a feverish gayetycongratulate me on my success  i will congratulate you when you have got over it said miss garth  in half an hour more magdalen had changed her dress had joined the guests and had soared into an atmosphere of congratulation high above the reach of any controlling influence that miss garth could exercise frank dilatory in all his proceedings was the last of the dramatic company who left the precincts of the stage he made no attempt to join magdalen in the supperroombut he was ready in the hall with her cloak when the carriages were called and the party broke up  oh frank she said looking round at him as he put the cloak on her shoulders i am so sorry its all over come tomorrow morning and lets talk about it by ourselves  in the shrubbery at ten asked frank in a whisper  she drew up the hood of her cloak and nodded to him gayly miss garth standing near noticed the looks that passed between them though the disturbance made by the parting guests prevented her from hearing the words there was a soft underlying tenderness in magdalens assumed gayety of mannerthere was a sudden thoughtfulness in her face a confidential readiness in her hand as she took franks arm and went out to the carriage what did it mean had her passing interest in him as her stagepupil treacherously sown the seeds of any deeper interest in him as a man had the idle theatrical scheme now that it was all over graver results to answer for than a mischievous waste of time  the lines on miss garths face deepened and hardened she stood lost among the fluttering crowd around her norahs warning words addressed to mrs vanstone in the garden recurred to her memoryand now for the first time the idea dawned on her that norah had seen the consequences in their true light   chapter vii  early the next morning miss garth and norah met in the garden and spoke together privately the only noticeable result of the interview when they presented themselves at the breakfasttable appeared in the marked silence which they both maintained on the topic of the theatrical performance mrs vanstone was entirely indebted to her husband and to her youngest daughter for all that she heard of the evenings entertainment the governess and the elder daughter had evidently determined on letting the subject drop  after breakfast was over magdalen proved to be missing when the ladies assembled as usual in the morningroom her habits were so little regular that mrs vanstone felt neither surprise nor uneasiness at her absence miss garth and norah looked at one another significantly and waited in silence two hours passedand there were no signs of magdalen norah rose as the clock struck twelve and quietly left the room to look for her  she was not upstairs dusting her jewelry and disarranging her dresses she was not in the conservatory not in the flowergarden not in the kitchen teasing the cook not in the yard playing with the dogs had she by any chance gone out with her father mr vanstone had announced his intention at the breakfasttable of paying a morning visit to his old ally mr clare and of rousing the philosophers sarcastic indignation by an account of the dramatic performance none of the other ladies at comberaven ever ventured themselves inside the cottage but magdalen was reckless enough for anythingand magdalen might have gone there as the idea occurred to her norah entered the shrubbery  at the second turning where the path among the trees wound away out of sight of the house she came suddenly face to face with magdalen and frank they were sauntering toward her arm in arm their heads close together their conversation apparently proceeding in whispers they looked suspiciously handsome and happy at the sight of norah both started and both stopped frank confusedly raised his hat and turned back in the direction of his fathers cottage magdalen advanced to meet her sister carelessly swinging her closed parasol from side to side carelessly humming an air from the overture which had preceded the rising of the curtain on the previous night  luncheontime already she said looking at her watch surely not  have you and mr francis clare been alone in the shrubbery since ten oclock asked norah  mr francis clare how ridiculously formal you are why dont you call him frank  i asked you a question magdalen  dear me how black you look this morning im in disgrace i suppose havent you forgiven me yet for my acting last night i couldnt help it love i should have made nothing of julia if i hadnt taken you for my model its quite a question of art in your place i should have felt flattered by the selection  in your place magdalen i should have thought twice before i mimicked my sister to an audience of strangers  thats exactly why i did itan audience of strangers how were they to know come come dont be angry you are eight years older than i amyou ought to set me an example of goodhumor  i will set you an example of plainspeaking i am more sorry than i can say magdalen to meet you as i met you here just now  what next i wonder you meet me in the shrubbery at home talking over the private theatricals with my old playfellow whom i knew when i was no taller than this parasol and that is a glaring impropriety is it honi soit qui mal y pense you wanted an answer a minute agothere it is for you my dear in the choicest normanfrench  i am in earnest about this magdalen  not a doubt of it nobody can accuse you of ever making jokes  i am seriously sorry  oh dear  it is quite useless to interrupt me i have it on my conscience to tell youand i will tell youthat i am sorry to see how this intimacy is growing i am sorry to see a secret understanding established already between you and mr francis clare  poor frank how you do hate him to be sure what on earth has he done to offend you  norahs selfcontrol began to show signs of failing her her dark cheeks glowed her delicate lips trembled before she spoke again magdalen paid more attention to her parasol than to her sister she tossed it high in the air and caught it once she saidand tossed it up again twiceand she tossed it higher thrice before she could catch it for the third time norah seized her passionately by the arm and the parasol dropped to the ground between them  you are treating me heartlessly she said for shame magdalenfor shame  the irrepressible outburst of a reserved nature forced into open selfassertion in its own despite is of all moral forces the hardest to resist magdalen was startled into silence for a moment the two sistersso strangely dissimilar in person and characterfaced one another without a word passing between them for a moment the deep brown eyes of the elder and the light gray eyes of the younger looked into each other with steady unyielding scrutiny on either side norahs face was the first to change norahs head was the first to turn away she dropped her sisters arm in silence magdalen stooped and picked up her parasol  i try to keep my temper she said and you call me heartless for doing it you always were hard on me and you always will be  norah clasped her trembling hands fast in each other hard on you she said in low mournful tonesand sighed bitterly  magdalen drew back a little and mechanically dusted the parasol with the end of her garden cloak  yes she resumed doggedly hard on me and hard on frank  frank repeated norah advancing on her sister and turning pale as suddenly as she had turned red do you talk of yourself and frank as if your interests were one already magdalen if i hurt you do i hurt him is he so near and so dear to you as that  magdalen drew further and further back a twig from a tree near caught her cloak she turned petulantly broke it off and threw it on the ground what right have you to question me she broke out on a sudden whether i like frank or whether i dont what interest is it of yours as she said the words she abruptly stepped forward to pass her sister and return to the house  norah turning paler and paler barred the way to her if i hold you by main force she said you shall stop and hear me i have watched this francis clare i know him better than you do he is unworthy of a moments serious feeling on your part he is unworthy of our dear good kindhearted fathers interest in him a man with any principle any honor any gratitude would not have come back as he has come back disgracedyes disgraced by his spiritless neglect of his own duty i watched his face while the friend who has been better than a father to him was comforting and forgiving him with a kindness he had not deserved i watched his face and i saw no shame and no distress in iti saw nothing but a look of thankless heartless relief he is selfish he is ungrateful he is ungeneroushe is only twenty and he has the worst failings of a mean old age already and this is the man i find you meeting in secretthe man who has taken such a place in your favor that you are deaf to the truth about him even from my lips magdalen this will end ill for gods sake think of what i have said to you and control yourself before it is too late she stopped vehement and breathless and caught her sister anxiously by the hand  magdalen looked at her in unconcealed astonishment  you are so violent she said and so unlike yourself that i hardly know you the more patient i am the more hard words i get for my pains you have taken a perverse hatred to frank and you are unreasonably angry with me because i wont hate him too dont norah you hurt my hand  norah pushed the hand from her contemptuously i shall never hurt your heart she said and suddenly turned her back on magdalen as she spoke the words  there was a momentary pause norah kept her position magdalen looked at her perplexedlyhesitatedthen walked away by herself toward the house  at the turn in the shrubbery path she stopped and looked back uneasily oh dear dear she thought to herself why didnt frank go when i told him she hesitated and went back a few steps theres norah standing on her dignity as obstinate as ever she stopped again what had i better do i hate quarreling i think ill make up she ventured close to her sister and touched her on the shoulder norah never moved its not often she flies into a passion thought magdalen touching her again but when she does what a time it lasts hercome she said give me a kiss norah and make it up wont you let me get at any part of you my dear but the back of your neck well its a very nice neckits better worth kissing than mineand there the kiss is in spite of you  she caught fast hold of norah from behind and suited the action to the word with a total disregard of all that had just passed which her sister was far from emulating hardly a minute since the warm outpouring of norahs heart had burst through all obstacles had the icy reserve frozen her up again already it was hard to say she never spoke she never changed her positionshe only searched hurriedly for her handkerchief as she drew it out there was a sound of approaching footsteps in the inner recesses of the shrubbery a scotch terrier scampered into view and a cheerful voice sang the first lines of the glee in as you like it its papa cried magdalen come norahcome and meet him  instead of following her sister norah pulled down the veil of her garden hat turned in the opposite direction and hurried back to the house she ran up to her own room and locked herself in she was crying bitterly    chapter viii  when magdalen and her father met in the shrubbery mr vanstones face showed plainly that something had happened to please him since he had left home in the morning he answered the question which his daughters curiosity at once addressed to him by informing her that he had just come from mr clares cottage and that he had picked up in that unpromising locality a startling piece of news for the family at comberaven  on entering the philosophers study that morning mr vanstone had found him still dawdling over his late breakfast with an open letter by his side in place of the book which on other occasions lay ready to his hand at mealtimes he held up the letter the moment his visitor came into the room and abruptly opened the conversation by asking mr vanstone if his nerves were in good order and if he felt himself strong enough for the shock of an overwhelming surprise  nerves repeated mr vanstone thank god i know nothing about my nerves if you have got anything to tell me shock or no shock out with it on the spot  mr clare held the letter a little higher and frowned at his visitor across the breakfasttable what have i always told you he asked with his sourest solemnity of look and manner  a great deal more than i could ever keep in my head answered mr vanstone  in your presence and out of it continued mr clare i have always maintained that the one important phenomenon presented by modern society isthe enormous prosperity of fools show me an individual fool and i will show you an aggregate society which gives that highlyfavored personage nine chances out of tenand grudges the tenth to the wisest man in existence look where you will in every high place there sits an ass settled beyond the reach of all the greatest intellects in this world to pull him down over our whole social system complacent imbecility rules supremesnuffs out the searching light of intelligence with total impunityand hoots owllike in answer to every form of protest see how well we all do in the dark one of these days that audacious assertion will be practically contradicted and the whole rotten system of modern society will come down with a crash  god forbid cried mr vanstone looking about him as if the crash was coming already  with a crash repeated mr clare there is my theory in few words now for the remarkable application of it which this letter suggests here is my lout of a boy  you dont mean that frank has got another chance exclaimed mr vanstone  here is this perfectly hopeless booby frank pursued the philosopher he has never done anything in his life to help himself and as a necessary consequence society is in a conspiracy to carry him to the top of the tree he has hardly had time to throw away that chance you gave him before this letter comes and puts the ball at his foot for the second time my rich cousin who is intellectually fit to be at the tail of the family and who is therefore as a matter of course at the head of it has been good enough to remember my existence and has offered his influence to serve my eldest boy read his letter and then observe the sequence of events my rich cousin is a booby who thrives on landed property he has done something for another booby who thrives on politics who knows a third booby who thrives on commerce who can do something for a fourth booby thriving at present on nothing whose name is frank so the mill goes so the cream of all human rewards is sipped in endless succession by the fools i shall pack frank off tomorrow in course of time hell come back again on our hands like a bad shilling more chances will fall in his way as a necessary consequence of his meritorious imbecility years will go oni may not live to see it no more may youit doesnt matter franks future is equally certain either wayput him into the army the church politics what you please and let him drift hell end in being a general a bishop or a minister of state by dint of the great modern qualification of doing nothing whatever to deserve his place with this summary of his sons worldly prospects mr clare tossed the letter contemptuously across the table and poured himself out another cup of tea  mr vanstone read the letter with eager interest and pleasure it was written in a tone of somewhat elaborate cordiality but the practical advantages which it placed at franks disposal were beyond all doubt the writer had the means of using a friends interestinterest of no ordinary kindwith a great mercantile firm in the city and he had at once exerted this influence in favor of mr clares eldest boy frank would be received in the office on a very different footing from the footing of an ordinary clerk he would be pushed on at every available opportunity and the first good thing the house had to offer either at home or abroad would be placed at his disposal if he possessed fair abilities and showed common diligence in exercising them his fortune was made and the sooner he was sent to london to begin the better for his own interests it would be  wonderful news cried mr vanstone returning the letter im delightedi must go back and tell them at home this is fifty times the chance that mine was what the deuce do you mean by abusing society society has behaved uncommonly well in my opinion wheres frank  lurking said mr clare it is one of the intolerable peculiarities of louts that they always lurk i havent seen my lout this morning it you meet with him anywhere give him a kick and say i want him   mr clares opinion of his sons habits might have been expressed more politely as to form but as to substance it happened on that particular morning to be perfectly correct after leaving magdalen frank had waited in the shrubbery at a safe distance on the chance that she might detach herself from her sisters company and join him again mr vanstones appearance immediately on norahs departure instead of encouraging him to show himself had determined him on returning to the cottage he walked back discontentedly and so fell into his fathers clutches totally unprepared for the pending announcement in that formidable quarter of his departure for london  in the meantime mr vanstone had communicated his newsin the first place to magdalen and afterward on getting back to the house to his wife and miss garth he was too unobservant a man to notice that magdalen looked unaccountably startled and miss garth unaccountably relieved by his announcement of franks good fortune he talked on about it quite unsuspiciously until the luncheonbell rangand then for the first time he noticed norahs absence she sent a message downstairs after they had assembled at the table to say that a headache was keeping her in her own room when miss garth went up shortly afterward to communicate the news about frank norah appeared strangely enough to feel very little relieved by hearing it mr francis clare had gone away on a former occasion she remarked and had come back he might come back again and sooner than they any of them thought for she said no more on the subject than this she made no reference to what had taken place in the shrubbery her unconquerable reserve seemed to have strengthened its hold on her since the outburst of the morning she met magdalen later in the day as if nothing had happened no formal reconciliation took place between them it was one of norahs peculiarities to shrink from all reconciliations that were openly ratified and to take her shy refuge in reconciliations that were silently implied magdalen saw plainly in her look and manner that she had made her first and last protest whether the motive was pride or sullenness or distrust of herself or despair of doing good the result was not to be mistakennorah had resolved on remaining passive for the future  later in the afternoon mr vanstone suggested a drive to his eldest daughter as the best remedy for her headache she readily consented to accompany her father who thereupon proposed as usual that magdalen should join them magdalen was nowhere to be found for the second time that day she had wandered into the grounds by herself on this occasion miss garthwho after adopting norahs opinions had passed from the one extreme of overlooking frank altogether to the other extreme of believing him capable of planning an elopement at five minutes noticevolunteered to set forth immediately and do her best to find the missing young lady after a prolonged absence she returned unsuccessfulwith the strongest persuasion in her own mind that magdalen and frank had secretly met one another somewhere but without having discovered the smallest fragment of evidence to confirm her suspicions by this time the carriage was at the door and mr vanstone was unwilling to wait any longer he and norah drove away together and mrs vanstone and miss garth sat at home over their work  in half an hour more magdalen composedly walked into the room she was pale and depressed she received miss garths remonstrances with a weary inattention explained carelessly that she had been wandering in the wood took up some books and put them down again sighed impatiently and went away upstairs to her own room  i think magdalen is feeling the reaction after yesterday said mrs vanstone quietly it is just as we thought now the theatrical amusements are all over she is fretting for more  here was an opportunity of letting in the light of truth on mrs vanstones mind which was too favorable to be missed miss garth questioned her conscience saw her chance and took it on the spot  you forget she rejoined that a certain neighbor of ours is going away tomorrow shall i tell you the truth magdalen is fretting over the departure of francis clare  mrs vanstone looked up from her work with a gentle smiling surprise  surely not she said it is natural enough that frank should be attracted by magdalen but i cant think that magdalen returns the feeling frank is so very unlike her so quiet and undemonstrative so dull and helpless poor fellow in some things he is handsome i know but he is so singularly unlike magdalen that i cant think it possiblei cant indeed  my dear good lady cried miss garth in great amazement do you really suppose that people fall in love with each other on account of similarities in their characters in the vast majority of cases they do just the reverse men marry the very last women and women the very last men whom their friends would think it possible they could care about is there any phrase that is oftener on all our lips than what can have made mr soandso marry that womanor how could mrs soandso throw herself away on that man has all your experience of the world never yet shown you that girls take perverse fancies for men who are totally unworthy of them  very true said mrs vanstone composedly i forgot that still it seems unaccountable doesnt it  unaccountable because it happens every day retorted miss garth goodhumoredly i know a great many excellent people who reason against plain experience in the same waywho read the newspapers in the morning and deny in the evening that there is any romance for writers or painters to work upon in modern life seriously mrs vanstone you may take my word for itthanks to those wretched theatricals magdalen is going the way with frank that a great many young ladies have gone before her he is quite unworthy of her he is in almost every respect her exact oppositeand without knowing it herself she has fallen in love with him on that very account she is resolute and impetuous clever and domineering she is not one of those model women who want a man to look up to and to protect themher beauideal though she may not think it herself is a man she can henpeck well one comfort is there are far better men even of that sort to be had than frank its a mercy he is going away before we have more trouble with them and before any serious mischief is done  poor frank said mrs vanstone smiling compassionately we have known him since he was in jackets and magdalen in short frocks dont let us give him up yet he may do better this second time  miss garth looked up in astonishment  and suppose he does better she asked what then  mrs vanstone cut off a loose thread in her work and laughed outright  my good friend she said there is an old farmyard proverb which warns us not to count our chickens before they are hatched let us wait a little before we count ours  it was not easy to silence miss garth when she was speaking under the influence of a strong conviction but this reply closed her lips she resumed her work and looked and thought unutterable things  mrs vanstones behavior was certainly remarkable under the circumstances here on one side was a girlwith great personal attractions with rare pecuniary prospects with a social position which might have justified the best gentleman in the neighborhood in making her an offer of marriageperversely casting herself away on a penniless idle young fellow who had failed at his first start in life and who even if he succeeded in his second attempt must be for years to come in no position to marry a young lady of fortune on equal terms and there on the other side was that girls mother by no means dismayed at the prospect of a connection which was to say the least of it far from desirable by no means certain judging her by her own words and looks that a marriage between mr vanstones daughter and mr clares son might not prove to be as satisfactory a result of the intimacy between the two young people as the parents on both sides could possibly wish for  it was perplexing in the extreme it was almost as unintelligible as that past mysterythat forgotten mystery nowof the journey to london   in the evening frank made his appearance and announced that his father had mercilessly sentenced him to leave comberaven by the parliamentary train the next morning he mentioned this circumstance with an air of sentimental resignation and listened to mr vanstones boisterous rejoicings over his new prospects with a mild and mute surprise his gentle melancholy of look and manner greatly assisted his personal advantages in his own effeminate way he was more handsome than ever that evening his soft brown eyes wandered about the room with a melting tenderness his hair was beautifully brushed his delicate hands hung over the arms of his chair with a languid grace he looked like a convalescent apollo never on any previous occasion had he practiced more successfully the social art which he habitually cultivatedthe art of casting himself on society in the character of a wellbred incubus and conferring an obligation on his fellowcreatures by allowing them to sit under him it was undeniably a dull evening all the talking fell to the share of mr vanstone and miss garth mrs vanstone was habitually silent norah kept herself obstinately in the background magdalen was quiet and undemonstrative beyond all former precedent from first to last she kept rigidly on her guard the few meaning looks that she cast on frank flashed at him like lightning and were gone before any one else could see them even when she brought him his tea and when in doing so her selfcontrol gave way under the temptation which no woman can resistthe temptation of touching the man she loveseven then she held the saucer so dexterously that it screened her hand franks selfpossession was far less steadily disciplined it only lasted as long as he remained passive when he rose to go when he felt the warm clinging pressure of magdalens fingers round his hand and the lock of her hair which she slipped into it at the same moment he became awkward and confused he might have betrayed magdalen and betrayed himself but for mr vanstone who innocently covered his retreat by following him out and patting him on the shoulder all the way god bless you frank cried the friendly voice that never had a harsh note in it for anybody your fortunes waiting for you go in my boygo in and win  yes said frank thank you it will be rather difficult to go in and win at first of course as you have always told me a mans business is to conquer his difficulties and not to talk about them at the same time i wish i didnt feel quite so loose as i do in my figures its discouraging to feel loose in ones figuresoh yes ill write and tell you how i get on im very much obliged by your kindness and very sorry i couldnt succeed with the engineering i think i should have liked engineering better than trade it cant be helped now can it thank you again goodby  so he drifted away into the misty commercial futureas aimless as helpless as gentlemanlike as ever    chapter ix  three months passed during that time frank remained in london pursuing his new duties and writing occasionally to report himself to mr vanstone as he had promised  his letters were not enthusiastic on the subject of mercantile occupations he described himself as being still painfully loose in his figures he was also more firmly persuaded than evernow when it was unfortunately too latethat he preferred engineering to trade in spite of this conviction in spite of headaches caused by sitting on a high stool and stooping over ledgers in unwholesome air in spite of want of society and hasty breakfasts and bad dinners at chophouses his attendance at the office was regular and his diligence at the desk unremitting the head of the department in which he was working might be referred to if any corroboration of this statement was desired such was the general tenor of the letters and franks correspondent and franks father differed over them as widely as usual mr vanstone accepted them as proofs of the steady development of industrious principles in the writer mr clare took his own characteristically opposite view these london men said the philosopher are not to be tri fled with by louts they ha ve got frank by the scruff of the neckhe cant wriggle himself freeand he makes a merit of yielding to sheer necessity  the three months interval of franks probation in london passed less cheerfully than usual in the household at comberaven  as the summer came nearer and nearer mrs vanstones spirits in spite of her resolute efforts to control them became more and more depressed  i do my best she said to miss garth i set an example of cheerfulness to my husband and my childrenbut i dread july norahs secret misgivings on her sisters account rendered her more than usually serious and uncommunicative as the year advanced even mr vanstone when july drew nearer lost something of his elasticity of spirit he kept up appearances in his wifes presencebut on all other occasions there was now a perceptible shade of sadness in his look and manner magdalen was so changed since franks departure that she helped the general depression instead of relieving it all her movements had grown languid all her usual occupations were pursued with the same weary indifference she spent hours alone in her own room she lost her interest in being brightly and prettily dressed her eyes were heavy her nerves were irritable her complexion was altered visibly for the worsein one word she had become an oppression and a weariness to herself and to all about her stoutly as miss garth contended with these growing domestic difficulties her own spirits suffered in the effort her memory reverted oftener and oftener to the march morning when the master and mistress of the house had departed for london and then the first serious change for many a year past had stolen over the family atmosphere when was that atmosphere to be clear again when were the clouds of change to pass off before the returning sunshine of past and happier times  the spring and the early summer wore away the dreaded month of july came with its airless nights its cloudless mornings and its sultry days  on the fifteenth of the month an event happened which took every one but norah by surprise for the second time without the slightest apparent reasonfor the second time without a word of warning beforehandfrank suddenly reappeared at his fathers cottage  mr clares lips opened to hail his sons return in the old character of the bad shilling and closed again without uttering a word there was a portentous composure in franks manner which showed that he had other news to communicate than the news of his dismissal he answered his fathers sardonic look of inquiry by at once explaining that a very important proposal for his future benefit had been made to him that morning at the office his first idea had been to communicate the details in writing but the partners had on reflection thought that the necessary decision might be more readily obtained by a personal interview with his father and his friends he had laid aside the pen accordingly and had resigned himself to the railway on the spot  after this preliminary statement frank proceeded to describe the proposal which his employers had addressed to him with every external appearance of viewing it in the light of an intolerable hardship  the great firm in the city had obviously made a discovery in relation to their clerk exactly similar to the discovery which had formerly forced itself on the engineer in relation to his pupil the young man as they politely phrased it stood in need of some special stimulant to stir him up his employers acting under a sense of their obligation to the gentleman by whom frank had been recommended had considered the question carefully and had decided that the one promising use to which they could put mr francis clare was to send him forthwith into another quarter of the globe  as a consequence of this decision it was now therefore proposed that he should enter the house of their correspondents in china that he should remain there familiarizing himself thoroughly on the spot with the tea trade and the silk trade for five years and that he should return at the expiration of this period to the central establishment in london if he made a fair use of his opportunities in china he would come back while still a young man fit for a position of trust and emolument and justified in looking forward at no distant date to a time when the house would assist him to start in business for himself such were the new prospects whichto adopt mr clares theorynow forced themselves on the everreluctant everhelpless and everungrateful frank there was no time to be lost the final answer was to be at the office on monday the twentieth the correspondents in china were to be written to by the mail on that day and frank was to follow the letter by the next opportunity or to resign his chance in favor of some more enterprising young man  mr clares reception of this extraordinary news was startling in the extreme the glorious prospect of his sons banishment to china appeared to turn his brain the firm pedestal of his philosophy sank under him the prejudices of society recovered their hold on his mind he seized frank by the arm and actually accompanied him to comberaven in the amazing character of visitor to the house  here i am with my lout said mr clare before a word could be uttered by the astonished family hear his story all of you it has reconciled me for the first time in my life to the anomaly of his existence frank ruefully narrated the chinese proposal for the second time and attempted to attach to it his own supplementary statement of objections and difficulties his father stopped him at the first word pointed peremptorily southeastward from somersetshire to china and said without an instants hesitation go mr vanstone basking in golden visions of his young friends future echoed that monosyllabic decision with all his heart mrs vanstone miss garth even norah herself spoke to the same purpose frank was petrified by an absolute unanimity of opinion which he had not anticipated and magdalen was caught for once in her life at the end of all her resources  so far as practical results were concerned the sitting of the family council began and ended with the general opinion that frank must go mr vanstones faculties were so bewildered by the sons sudden arrival the fathers unexpected visit and the news they both brought with them that he petitioned for an adjournment before the necessary arrangements connected with his young friends departure were considered in detail suppose we all sleep upon it he said tomorrow our heads will feel a little steadier and tomorrow will be time enough to decide all uncertainties this suggestion was readily adopted and all further proceedings stood adjourned until the next day  that next day was destined to decide more uncertainties than mr vanstone dreamed of   early in the morning after making tea by herself as usual miss garth took her parasol and strolled into the garden she had slept ill and ten minutes in the open air before the family assembled at breakfast might help to compensate her as she thought for the loss of her nights rest  she wandered to the outermost boundary of the flowergarden and then returned by another path which led back past the side of an ornamental summerhouse commanding a view over the fields from a corner of the lawn a slight noiselike and yet not like the chirruping of a birdcaught her ear as she approached the summerhouse she stepped round to the entrance looked in and discovered magdalen and frank seated close together to miss garths horror magdalens arm was unmistakably round franks neck and worse still the position of her face at the moment of discovery showed beyond all doubt that she had just been offering to the victim of chinese commerce the first and foremost of all the consolations which a woman can bestow on a man in plainer words she had just given frank a kiss  in the presence of such an emergency as now confronted her miss gart h felt instinctively that all ordinary phrases of reproof would be phrases thrown away  i presume she remarked addressing magdalen with the merciless selfpossession of a middleaged lady unprovided for the occasion with any kissing remembrances of her owni presume whatever excuses your effrontery may suggest you will not deny that my duty compels me to mention what i have just seen to your father  i will save you the trouble replied magdalen composedly i will mention it to him myself  with those words she looked round at frank standing trebly helpless in a corner of the summerhouse you shall hear what happens she said with her bright smile and so shall you she added for miss garths especial benefit as she sauntered past the governess on her way back to the breakfasttable the eyes of miss garth followed her indignantly and frank slipped out on his side at that favorable opportunity  under these circumstances there was but one course that any respectable woman could takeshe could only shudder miss garth registered her protest in that form and returned to the house  when breakfast was over and when mr vanstones hand descended to his pocket in search of his cigarcase magdalen rose looked significantly at miss garth and followed her father into the hall  papa she said i want to speak to you this morningin private  ay ay returned mr vanstone what about my dear  about magdalen hesitated searching for a satisfactory form of expression and found it about business papa she said  mr vanstone took his garden hat from the hall tableopened his eyes in mute perplexityattempted to associate in his mind the two extravagantly dissimilar ideas of magdalen and businessfailedand led the way resignedly into the garden  his daughter took his arm and walked with him to a shady seat at a convenient distance from the house she dusted the seat with her smart silk apron before her father occupied it mr vanstone was not accustomed to such an extraordinary act of attention as this he sat down looking more puzzled than ever magdalen immediately placed herself on his knee and rested her head comfortably on his shoulder  am i heavy papa she asked  yes my dear you are said mr vanstonebut not too heavy for me stop on your perch if you like it well and what may this business happen to be  it begins with a question  ah indeed that doesnt surprise me business with your sex my dear always begins with questions go on  papa do you ever intend allowing me to be married  mr vanstones eyes opened wider and wider the question to use his own phrase completely staggered him  this is business with a vengeance he said why magdalen what have you got in that harumscarum head of yours now  i dont exactly know papa will you answer my question  i will if i can my dear you rather stagger me well

if talking of business means tickling your cheek against my whisker ive nothing to say against it go on my dear whats the next question come to the point  she was far too genuine a woman to do

might frank do better  he might marry me  if the summer scene which then spread before mr vanstones eyes had suddenly changed to a dreary winter viewif the trees had lost all their leaves and the green fields had turned white with snow in an instanthis face could hardly have expressed greater amazement than it displayed when his daughters faltering voice spoke those four last words he tried to look at herbut she steadily refused him the opportunity she kept her face hidden over his shoulder was she in earnest his cheek still wet with her tears answered for her there was a long pause of silence she waitedwith unaccustomed patience she waited for him to speak he roused himself and spoke these words only you surprise me magdalen you surprise me more than i can say  at the altered tone of his voicealtered to a quiet fatherly seriousnessmagdalens arms clung round him closer than before  have i disappointed you papa she asked faintly dont say i have disappointed you who am i to tell my secret to if not to you dont let him godont dont you will break his heart he is afraid to tell his father he is even afraid you might be angry with him there is nobody to speak for us exceptexcept me oh dont let him go dont for his sake she whispered the next words in a kissdont for mine  her fathers kind face saddened he sighed and patted her fair head tenderly hush my love he said almost in a whisper hush she little knew what a revelation every word every action that escaped her now opened before him she had made him her grownup playfellow from her childhood to that day she had romped with him in her frocks she had gone on romping with him in her gowns he had never been long enough separated from her to have the external changes in his daughter forced on his attention his artless fatherly experience of her had taught him that she was a taller child in later yearsand had taught him little more and now in one breathless instant the conviction that she was a woman rushed over his mind he felt it in the trouble of her bosom pre ssed against his in the nervous thrill of her arms clasped around his neck the magdalen of his innocent experience a womanwith the masterpassion of her sex in possession of her heart already  have you thought long of this my dear he asked as soon as he could speak composedly are you sure  she answered the question before he could finish it  sure i love him she said oh what words can say yes for me as i want to say it i love him her voice faltered softly and her answer ended in a sigh  you are very young you and frank my love are both very young  she raised her head from his shoulder for the first time the thought and its expression flashed from her at the same moment  are we much younger than you and mamma were she asked smiling through her tears  she tried to lay her head back in its old position but as she spoke those words her father caught her round the waist forced her before she was aware of it to look him in the faceand kissed her with a sudden outburst of tenderness which brought the tears thronging back thickly into her eyes not much younger my child he said in low broken tonesnot much younger than your mother and i were he put her away from him and rose from the seat and turned his head aside quickly wait here and compose yourself i will go indoors and speak to your mother his voice trembled over those parting words and he left her without once looking round again  she waitedwaited a weary time and he never came back at last her growing anxiety urged her to follow him into the house a new timidity throbbed in her heart as she doubtingly approached the door never had she seen the depths of her fathers simple nature stirred as they had been stirred by her confession she almost dreaded her next meeting with him she wandered softly to and fro in the hall with a shyness unaccountable to herself with a terror of being discovered and spoken to by her sister or miss garth which made her nervously susceptible to the slightest noises in the house the door of the morningroom opened while her back was turned toward it she started violently as she looked round and saw her father in the hall her heart beat faster and faster and she felt herself turning pale a second look at him as he came nearer reassured her he was composed again though not so cheerful as usual she noticed that he advanced and spoke to her with a forbearing gentleness which was more like his manner to her mother than his ordinary manner to herself  go in my love he said opening the door for her which he had just closed tell your mother all you have told meand more if you have more to say she is better prepared for you than i was we will take today to think of it magdalen and tomorrow you shall know and frank shall know what we decide  her eyes brightened as they looked into his face and saw the decision there already with the double penetration of her womanhood and her love happy and beautiful in her happiness she put his hand to her lips and went without hesitation into the morningroom there her fathers words had smoothed the way for her there the first shock of the surprise was past and over and only the pleasure of it remained her mother had been her age once her mother would know how fond she was of frank so the coming interview was anticipated in her thoughts andexcept that there was an unaccountable appearance of restraint in mrs vanstones first reception of herwas anticipated aright after a little the mothers questions came more and more unreservedly from the sweet unforgotten experience of the mothers heart she lived again through her own young days of hope and love in magdalens replies  the next morning the allimportant decision was announced in words mr vanstone took his daughter upstairs into her mothers room and there placed before her the result of the yesterdays consultation and of the nights reflection which had followed it he spoke with perfect kindness and selfpossession of mannerbut in fewer and more serious words than usual and he held his wifes hand tenderly in his own all through the interview  he informed magdalen that neither he nor her mother felt themselves justified in blaming her attachment to frank it had been in part perhaps the natural consequence of her childish familiarity with him in part also the result of the closer intimacy between them which the theatrical entertainment had necessarily produced at the same time it was now the duty of her parents to put that attachment on both sides to a proper testfor her sake because her happy future was their dearest care for franks sake because they were bound to give him the opportunity of showing himself worthy of the trust confided in him they were both conscious of being strongly prejudiced in franks favor his fathers eccentric conduct had made the lad the object of their compassion and their care from his earliest years he and his younger brothers had almost filled the places to them of those other children of their own whom they had lost although they firmly believed their good opinion of frank to be well foundedstill in the interest of their daughters happiness it was necessary to put that opinion firmly to the proof by fixing certain conditions and by interposing a year of delay between the contemplated marriage and the present time  during that year frank was to remain at the office in london his employers being informed beforehand that family circumstances prevented his accepting their offer of employment in china he was to consider this concession as a recognition of the attachment between magdalen and himself on certain terms only if during the year of probation he failed to justify the confidence placed in hima confidence which had led mr vanstone to take unreservedly upon himself the whole responsibility of franks future prospectsthe marriage scheme was to be considered from that moment as at an end if on the other hand the result to which mr vanstone confidently looked forward really occurredif franks probationary year proved his claim to the most precious trust that could be placed in his handsthen magdalen herself should reward him with all that a woman can bestow and the future which his present employers had placed before him as the result of a five years residence in china should be realized in one years time by the dowry of his young wife  as her father drew that picture of the future the outburst of magdalens gratitude could no longer be restrained she was deeply touchedshe spoke from her inmost heart mr vanstone waited until his daughter and his wife were composed again and then added the last words of explanation which were now left for him to speak  you understand my love he said that i am not anticipating franks living in idleness on his wifes means my plan for him is that he should still profit by the interest which his present employers take in him their knowledge of affairs in the city will soon place a good partnership at his disposal and you will give him the money to buy it out of hand i shall limit the sum my dear to half your fortune and the other half i shall have settled upon yourself we shall all be alive and hearty i hopehe looked tenderly at his wife as he said those wordsall alive and hearty at the years end but if i am gone magdalen it will make no difference my willmade long before i ever thought of having a soninlaw divides my fortune into two equal parts one part goes to your mother and the other part is fairly divided between my children you will have your share on your weddingday and norah will have hers when she marries from my own hand if i live and under my will if i die there there no gloomy faces he said with a momentary return of his everyday good spirits your mother and i mean to live and see frank a great merchant i shall leave you my dear to enlighten the son on our new projects while i walk over to the cottage  he stopped his eyebrows contra cted a little and he looked aside hesitatingly at mrs vanstone  what must you do at the cottage papa asked magdalen after having vainly waited for him to finish the sentence of his own accord  i must consult franks father he replied we must not forget that mr clares consent is still wanting to settle this matter and as time presses and we dont know what difficulties he may not raise the sooner i see him the better  he gave that answer in low altered tones and rose from his chair in a halfreluctant halfresigned manner which magdalen observed with secret alarm  she glanced inquiringly at her mother to all appearance mrs vanstone had been alarmed by the change in him also she looked anxious and uneasy she turned her face away on the sofa pillowturned it suddenly as if she was in pain  are you not well mamma asked magdalen  quite well my love said mrs vanstone shortly and sharply without turning round leave me a littlei only want rest  magdalen went out with her father  papa she whispered anxiously as they descended the stairs you dont think mr clare will say no  i cant tell beforehand answered mr vanstone i hope he will say yes  there is no reason why he should say anything elseis there  she put the question faintly while he was getting his hat and stick and he did not appear to hear her doubting whether she should repeat it or not she accompanied him as far as the garden on his way to mr clares cottage he stopped her on the lawn and sent her back to the house  you have nothing on your head my dear he said if you want to be in the garden dont forget how hot the sun isdont come out without your hat  he walked on toward the cottage  she waited a moment and looked after him she missed the customary flourish of his stick she saw his little scotch terrier who had run out at his heels barking and capering about him unnoticed he was out of spirits he was strangely out of spirits what did it mean    chapter x  on returning to the house magdalen felt her shoulder suddenly touched from behind as she crossed the hall she turned and confronted her sister before she could ask any questions norah confusedly addressed her in these words i beg your pardon i beg you to forgive me  magdalen looked at her sister in astonishment all memory on her side of the sharp words which had passed between them in the shrubbery was lost in the new interests that now absorbed her lost as completely as if the angry interview had never taken place forgive you she repeated amazedly what for  i have heard of your new prospects pursued norah speaking with a mechanical submissiveness of manner which seemed almost ungracious i wished to set things right between us i wished to say i was sorry for what happened will you forget it will you forget and forgive what happened in the shrubbery she tried to proceed but her inveterate reserveor perhaps her obstinate reliance on her own opinionssilenced her at those last words her face clouded over on a sudden before her sister could answer her she turned away abruptly and ran upstairs  the door of the library opened before magdalen could follow her and miss garth advanced to express the sentiments proper to the occasion  they were not the mechanicallysubmissive sentiments which magdalen had just heard norah had struggled against her rooted distrust of frank in deference to the unanswerable decision of both her parents in his favor and had suppressed the open expression of her antipathy though the feeling itself remained unconquered miss garth had made no such concession to the master and mistress of the house she had hitherto held the position of a high authority on all domestic questions and she flatly declined to get off her pedestal in deference to any change in the family circumstances no matter how amazing or how unexpected that change might be  pray accept my congratulations said miss garth bristling all over with implied objections to frankmy congratulations and my apologies when i caught you kissing mr francis clare in the summerhouse i had no idea you were engaged in carrying out the intentions of your parents i offer no opinion on the subject i merely regret my own accidental appearance in the character of an obstacle to the course of truelovewhich appears to run smooth in summerhouses whatever shakespeare may say to the contrary consider me for the future if you please as an obstacle removed may you be happy miss garths lips closed on that last sentence like a trap and miss garths eyes looked ominously prophetic into the matrimonial future  if magdalens anxieties had not been far too serious to allow her the customary free use of her tongue she would have been ready on the instant with an appropriately satirical answer as it was miss garth simply irritated her pooh she saidand ran upstairs to her sisters room  she knocked at the door and there was no answer she tried the door and it resisted her from the inside the sullen unmanageable norah was locked in  under other circumstances magdalen would not have been satisfied with knockingshe would have called through the door loudly and more loudly till the house was disturbed and she had carried her point but the doubts and fears of the morning had unnerved her already she went downstairs again softly and took her hat from the stand in the hall he told me to put my hat on she said to herself with a meek filial docility which was totally out of her character  she went into the garden on the shrubbery side and waited there to catch the first sight of her father on his return half an hour passed forty minutes passedand then his voice reached her from among the distant trees come in to heel she heard him call out loudly to the dog her face turned pale hes angry with snap she exclaimed to herself in a whisper the next minute he appeared in view walking rapidly with his head down and snap at his heels in disgrace the sudden excess of her alarm as she observed those ominous signs of something wrong rallied her natural energy and determined her desperately on knowing the worst she walked straight forward to meet her father  your face tells your news she said faintly mr clare has been as heartless as usualmr clare has said no  her father turned on her with a sudden severity so entirely unparalleled in her experience of him that she started back in downright terror  magdalen he said whenever you speak of my old friend and neighbor again bear this in mind mr clare has just laid me under an obligation which i shall remember gratefully to the end of my life  he stopped suddenly after saying those remarkable words seeing that he had startled her his natural kindness prompted him instantly to soften the reproof and to end the suspense from which she was plainly suffering give me a kiss my love he resumed and ill tell you in return that mr clare has saidyes  she attempted to thank him but the sudden luxury of relief was too much for her she could only cling round his neck in silence he felt her trembling from head to foot and said a few words to calm her at the altered tones of his masters voice snaps meek tail reappeared fiercely from between his legs and snaps lungs modestly tested his position with a brief experimental bark the dogs quaintly appropriate assertion of himself on his old footing was the interruption of all others which was best fitted to restore magdalen to herself she caught the shaggy little terrier up in her arms and kissed him next you darling she exclaimed youre almost as glad as i am she turned again to her father with a look of tender reproach you frightened me papa she said you were so unlike yourself  i shall be right again tomorrow my dear i am a little upset today  not by me  no no  by something you have heard at mr clares  yesnothing you need alarm yourself about nothing that wont wear off by tomorrow let me go now my dear i have a letter to write and i want to speak to your mother  he left her and went on to the house magdalen lingered a little on the lawn to feel all the happiness of her new sensationsthen turned away toward the shrubbery to enjoy the higher luxury of communicating them the dog followed her she whistled and clapped her hands find him she said with beaming eyes find frank snap scampered into the shrubbery with a bloodthirsty snarl at starting perhaps he had mistaken his young mistress and considered himself her emissary in search of a rat  meanwhile mr vanstone entered the house he met his wife slowly descending the stairs and advanced to give her his arm how has it ended she asked anxiously as he led her to the sofa  happilyas we hoped it would answered her husband my old friend has justified my opinion of him  thank god said mrs vanstone fervently did you feel it love she asked as her husband arranged the sofa pillowsdid you feel it as painfully as i feared you would  i had a duty to do my dearand i did it  after replying in those terms he hesitated apparently he had something more to saysomething perhaps on the subject of that passing uneasiness of mind which had been produced by his interview with mr clare and which magdalens questions had obliged him to acknowledge a look at his wife decided his doubts in the negative he only asked if she felt comfortable and then turned away to leave the room  must you go she asked  i have a letter to write my dear  anything about frank  no tomorrow will do for that a letter to mr pendril i want him here immediately  business i suppose  yes my dearbusiness  he went out and shut himself into the little front room close to the hall door which was called his study by nature and habit the most procrastinating of letterwriters he now inconsistently opened his desk and took up the pen without a moments delay his letter was long enough to occupy three pages of notepaper it was written with a readiness of expression and a rapidity of hand which seldom characterized his proceedings when engaged over his ordinary correspondence he wrote the address as follows immediatewilliam pendril esq serle street lincolns inn londonthen pushed the letter away from him and sat at the table drawing lines on the blottingpaper with his pen lost in thought no he said to himself i can do nothing more till pendril comes he rose his face brightened as he put the stamp on the envelope the writing of the letter had sensibly relieved him and his whole bearing showed it as he left the room  on the doorstep he found norah and miss garth setting forth together for a walk  which way are you going he asked anywhere near the postoffice i wish you would post this letter for me norah it is very importantso important that i hardly like to trust it to thomas as usual  norah at once took charge of the letter  if you look my dear continued her father you will see that i am writing to mr pendril i expect him here tomorrow afternoon will you give the necessary directions miss garth mr pendril will sleep here tomorrow night and stay over sundaywait a minute today is friday surely i had an engagement for saturday afternoon he consulted his pocketbook and read over one of the entries with a look of annoyance grailsea mill three oclock saturday just the time when pendril will be here and i must be at home to see him how can i manage it monday will be too late for my business at grailsea ill go today instead and take my chance of catching the miller at his dinnertime he looked at his watch no time for driving i must do it by railway if i go at once i shall catch the down train at our station and get on to grailsea take care of the letter norah i wont keep dinner waiting if the return train doesnt suit ill borrow a gig and get back in that way  as he took up his hat magdalen appeared at the door returning from her interview with frank the hurry of her fathers movements attracted her attention and she asked him where he was going  to grailsea replied mr vanstone your business miss magdalen has got in the way of mineand mine must give way to it  he spoke those parting words in his old hearty manner and left them with the old characteristic flourish of his trusty stick  my business said magdalen i thought my business was done  miss garth pointed significantly to the letter in norahs hand your business beyond all doubt she said mr pendril is coming tomorrow and mr vanstone seems remarkably anxious about it law and its attendant troubles already governesses who look in at summerhouse doors are not the only obstacles to the course of truelove parchment is sometimes an obstacle i hope you may find parchment as pliable as i ami wish you well through it now norah  miss garths second shaft struck as harmless as the first magdalen had returned to the house a little vexed her interview with frank having been interrupted by a messenger from mr clare sent to summon the son into the fathers presence although it had been agreed at the private interview between mr vanstone and mr clare that the questions discussed that morning should not be communicated to the children until the year of probation was at an endand although under these circumstances mr clare had nothing to tell frank which magdalen could not communicate to him much more agreeablythe philosopher was not the less resolved on personally informing his son of the parental concession which rescued him from chinese exile the result was a sudden summons to the cottage which startled magdalen but which did not appear to take frank by surprise his filial experience penetrated the mystery of mr clares motives easily enough when my fathers in spirits he said sulkily he likes to bully me about my good luck this message means that hes going to bully me now  dont go suggested magdalen  i must rejoined frank i shall never hear the last of it if i dont hes primed and loaded and he means to go off he went off once when the engineer took me he went off twice when the office in the city took me and hes going off thrice now youve taken me if it wasnt for you i should wish i had never been born yes your fathers been kind to me i knowand i should have gone to china if it hadnt been for him im sure im very much obliged of course we have no right to expect anything elsestill its discouraging to keep us waiting a year isnt it  magdalen stopped his mouth by a summary process to which even frank submitted gratefully at the same time she did not forget to set down his discontent to the right side how fond he is of me she thought a years waiting is quite a hardship to him she returned to the house secretly regretting that she had not heard more of franks complimentary complaints miss garths elaborate satire addressed to her while she was in this frame of mind was a purely gratuitous waste of miss garths breath what did magdalen care for satire what do youth and love ever care for except themselves she never even said as much as pooh this time she laid aside her hat in serene silence and sauntered languidly into the morningroom to keep her mother company she lunched on dire forebodings of a quarrel between frank and his father with accidental interruptions in the shape of cold chicken and cheesecakes she trifled away half an hour at the piano and played in that time selections from the songs of mendelssohn the mazurkas of chopin the operas of verdi and the sonatas of mozartall of whom had combined together on this occasion and produced one immortal work entitled frank she closed the piano and went up to her room to dream away the hours luxuriously in visions of her married future the green shutters were closed the easychair was pushed in front of the glass the maid w as summoned as usual and the comb assisted the mistresss reflections through the medium of the mistresss hair till heat and idleness asserted their narcotic influences together and magdalen fell asleep   it was past three oclock when she woke on going downstairs again she found her mother norah and miss garth all sitting together enjoying the shade and the coolness under the open portico in front of the house  norah had the railway timetable in her hand they had been discussing the chances of mr vanstones catching the return train and getting back in good time that topic had led them next to his business errand at grailseaan errand of kindness as usual undertaken for the benefit of the miller who had been his old farmservant and who was now hard pressed by serious pecuniary difficulties from this they had glided insensibly into a subject often repeated among them and never exhausted by repetitionthe praise of mr vanstone himself each one of the three had some experience of her own to relate of his simple generous nature the conversation seemed to be almost painfully interesting to his wife she was too near the time of her trial now not to feel nervously sensitive to the one subject which always held the foremost place in her heart her eyes overflowed as magdalen joined the little group under the portico her frail hand trembled as it signed to her youngest daughter to take the vacant chair by her side we were talking of your father she said softly oh my love if your married life is only as happy her voice failed her she put her handkerchief hurriedly over her face and rested her head on magdalens shoulder norah looked appealingly to miss garth who at once led the conversation back to the more trivial subject of mr vanstones return we have all been wondering she said with a significant look at magdalen whether your father will leave grailsea in time to catch the trainor whether he will miss it and be obliged to drive back what do you say  i say papa will miss the train replied magdalen taking miss garths hint with her customary quickness the last thing he attends to at grailsea will be the business that brings him there whenever he has business to do he always puts it off to the last moment doesnt he mamma  the question roused her mother exactly as magdalen had intended it should not when his errand is an errand of kindness said mrs vanstone he has gone to help the miller in a very pressing difficulty  and dont you know what hell do persisted magdalen hell romp with the millers children and gossip with the mother and hobandnob with the father at the last moment when he has got five minutes left to catch the train hell say lets go into the countinghouse and look at the books hell find the books dreadfully complicated hell suggest sending for an accountant hell settle the business off hand by lending the money in the meantime hell jog back comfortably in the millers gig and hell tell us all how pleasant the lanes were in the cool of the evening  the little charactersketch which these words drew was too faithful a likeness not to be recognized mrs vanstone showed her appreciation of it by a smile when your father returns she said we will put your account of his proceedings to the test i think she continued rising languidly from her chair i had better go indoors again now and rest on the sofa till he comes back  the little group under the portico broke up magdalen slipped away into the garden to hear franks account of the interview with his father the other three ladies entered the house together when mrs vanstone was comfortably established on the sofa norah and miss garth left her to repose and withdrew to the library to look over the last parcel of books from london  it was a quiet cloudless summers day the heat was tempered by a light western breeze the voices of laborers at work in a field near reached the house cheerfully the clockbell of the village church as it struck the quarters floated down the wind with a clearer ring a louder melody than usual sweet odors from field and flowergarden stealing in at the open windows filled the house with their fragrance and the birds in norahs aviary upstairs sang the song of their happiness exultingly in the sun  as the church clock struck the quarter past four the morningroom door opened and mrs vanstone crossed the hall alone she had tried vainly to compose herself she was too restless to lie still and sleep for a moment she directed her steps toward the porticothen turned and looked about her doubtful where to go or what to do next while she was still hesitating the halfopen door of her husbands study attracted her attention the room seemed to be in sad confusion drawers were left open coats and hats accountbooks and papers pipes and fishingrods were all scattered about together she went in and pushed the door tobut so gently that she still left it ajar it will amuse me to put his room to rights she thought to herself i should like to do something for him before i am down on my bed helpless she began to arrange his drawers and found his bankers book lying open in one of them my poor dear how careless he is the servants might have seen all his affairs if i had not happened to have looked in she set the drawers right and then turned to the multifarious litter on a sidetable a little oldfashioned musicbook appeared among the scattered papers with her name written in it in faded ink she blushed like a young girl in the first happiness of the discovery how good he is to me he remembers my poor old musicbook and keeps it for my sake as she sat down by the table and opened the book the bygone time came back to her in all its tenderness the clock struck the halfhour struck the threequartersand still she sat there with the musicbook on her lap dreaming happily over the old songs thinking gratefully of the golden days when his hand had turned the pages for her when his voice had whispered the words which no womans memory ever forgets   norah roused herself from the volume she was reading and glanced at the clock on the library mantelpiece  if papa comes back by the railway she said he will be here in ten minutes  miss garth started and looked up drowsily from the book which was just dropping out of her hand  i dont think he will come by train she replied he will jog backas magdalen flippantly expressed itin the millers gig  as she said the words there was a knock at the library door the footman appeared and addressed himself to miss garth  a person wishes to see you maam  who is it  i dont know maam a stranger to mea respectablelooking manand he said he particularly wished to see you  miss garth went out into the hall the footman closed the library door after her and withdrew down the kitchen stairs  the man stood just inside the door on the mat his eyes wandered his face was palehe looked ill he looked frightened he trifled nervously with his cap and shifted it backward and forward from one hand to the other  you wanted to see me said miss garth  i beg your pardon maamyou are not mrs vanstone are you  certainly not i am miss garth why do you ask the question  i am employed in the clerks office at grailsea station  yes  i am sent here  he stopped again his wandering eyes looked down at the mat and his restless hands wrung his cap harder and harder he moistened his dry lips and tried once more  i am sent here on a very serious errand  serious to me  serious to all in this house  miss garth took one step nearer to himtook one steady look at his face she turned cold in the summer heat stop she said with a sudden distrust and glanced aside anxiously at the door of the morningroom it was safely closed tell me the worst and dont speak loud there has been an accident where  on the railway close to grailsea station  the uptrain to london  no the downtrain at onefifty  god almighty help us the train mr vanstone traveled by to grailsea  the same i was sent here by the uptrain the line was just cleared in time for it they wouldnt writethey said i must see miss garth and tell her there are seven passengers badly hurt and two  the next word failed on his lips he raised his hand in the dead silence with eyes that opened wide in horror he raised his hand and pointed over miss garths shoulder  she turned a little and looked back  face to face with her on the threshold of the study door stood the mistress of the house she held her old musicbook clutched fast mechanically in both hands she stood the specter of herself with a dreadful vacancy in her eyes with a dreadful stillness in her voice she repeated the mans last words  seven passengers badly hurt and two  her tortured fingers relaxed their hold the book dropped from them she sank forward heavily miss garth caught her before she fellcaught her and turned upon the man with the wifes swooning body in her arms to hear the husbands fate  the harm is done she said you may speak out is he wounded or dead  dead    chapter xi  the sun sank lower the western breeze floated cool and fresh into the house as the evening advanced the cheerful ring of the village clock came nearer and nearer field and flowergarden felt the influence of the hour and shed their sweetest fragrance the birds in norahs aviary sunned themselves in the evening stillness and sang their farewell gratitude to the dying day  staggered in its progress for a time only the pitiless routine of the house went horribly on its daily way the panicstricken servants took their blind refuge in the duties proper to the hour the footman softly laid the table for dinner the maid sat waiting in senseless doubt with the hotwater jugs for the bedrooms ranged near her in their customary row the gardener who had been ordered to come to his master with vouchers for money that he had paid in excess of his instructions said his character was dear to him and left the vouchers at his appointed time custom that never yields and death that never spares met on the wreck of human happinessand death gave way  heavily the thunderclouds of affliction had gathered over the househeavily but not at their darkest yet at five that evening the shock of the calamity had struck its blow before another hour had passed the disclosure of the husbands sudden death was followed by the suspense of the wifes mortal peril she lay helpless on her widowed bed her own life and the life of her unborn child trembling in the balance  but one mind still held possession of its resourcesbut one guiding spirit now moved helpfully in the house of mourning  if miss garths early days had been passed as calmly and as happily as her later life at comberaven she might have sunk under the cruel necessities of the time but the governesss youth had been tried in the ordeal of family affliction and she met her terrible duties with the steady courage of a woman who had learned to suffer alone she had faced the trial of telling the daughters that they were fatherless alone she now struggled to sustain them when the dreadful certainty of their bereavement was at last impressed on their minds  her least anxiety was for the elder sister the agony of norahs grief had forced its way outward to the natural relief of tears it was not so with magdalen tearless and speechless she sat in the room where the revelation of her fathers death had first reached her her face unnaturally petrified by the sterile sorrow of old agea white changeless blank fearful to look at nothing roused nothing melted her she only said dont speak to me dont touch me let me bear it by myselfand fell silent again the first great grief which had darkened the sisters lives had as it seemed changed their everyday characters already  the twilight fell and faded and the summer night came brightly as the first carefully shaded light was kindled in the sickroom the physician who had been summoned from bristol arrived to consult with the medical attendant of the family he could give no comfort he could only say we must try and hope the shock which struck her when she overheard the news of her husbands death has prostrated her strength at the time when she needed it most no effort to preserve her shall be neglected i will stay here for the night  he opened one of the windows to admit more air as he spoke the view overlooked the drive in front of the house and the road outside little groups of people were standing before the lodgegates looking in if those persons make any noise said the doctor they must be warned away there was no need to warn them they were only the laborers who had worked on the dead mans property and here and there some women and children from the village they were all thinking of himsome talking of himand it quickened their sluggish minds to look at his house the gentlefolks thereabouts were mostly kind to them the men said but none like him the women whispered to each other of his comforting ways when he came into their cottages he was a cheerful man poor soul and thoughtful of us too he never came in and stared at mealtimes the rest of em help us and scold usall he ever said was better luck next time so they stood and talked of him and looked at his house and grounds and moved off clumsily by twos and threes with the dim sense that the sight of his pleasant face would never comfort them again the dullest head among them knew that night that the hard ways of poverty would be all the harder to walk on now he was gone  a little later news was brought to the bedchamber door that old mr clare had come alone to the house and was waiting in the hall below to hear what the physician said miss garth was not able to go down to him herself she sent a message he said to the servant ill come and ask again in two hours timeand went out slowly unlike other men in all things else the sudden death of his old friend had produced no discernible change in him the feeling implied in the errand of inquiry that had brought him to the house was the one betrayal of human sympathy which escaped the rugged impenetrable old man  he came again when the two hours had expired and this time miss garth saw him  they shook hands in silence she waited she nerved herself to hear him speak of his lost friend no he never mentioned the dreadful accident he never alluded to the dreadful death he said these words is she better or worse and said no more was the tribute of his grief for the husband sternly suppressed under the expression of his anxiety for the wife the nature of the man unpliably antagonistic to the world and the worlds customs might justify some such interpretation of his conduct as this he repeated his question is she better or worse  miss garth answered him  no better if there is any change it is a change for the worse  they spoke those words at the window of the morningroom which opened on the garden mr clare paused after hearing the reply to his inquiry stepped out on to the walk then turned on a sudden and spoke again  has the doctor given her up he asked  he has not concealed from us that she is in danger we can only pray for her  the old man laid his hand on miss garths arm as she answered him and looked her attentively in the face  you believe in prayer he said  miss garth drew sorrowfully back from him  you might have spared me that question sir at such a time as this  he took no notice of her answer his eyes were still fastened on her face  pray he said pray as you never prayed before for the preservation of mrs vanstones life  he left her his voice and manner implied some unutterable dread of the future which his words had not confessed miss garth followed him into the garden and called to him he heard her but he never turned back he quickened his pace as if he desired to avoid her she watched him across the lawn in the warm summer moonlight she saw his white withered hands saw them suddenly against the black background of the shrubbery raised and wrung above his head they droppedthe trees shrouded him in darknesshe was gone  miss garth went back to the suffering woman with the burden on her mind of one anxiety more  it was then past eleven oclock some little time had elapsed since she had seen the sisters and spoken to them the inquiries she addressed to one of the female servants only elicited the information that they were both in their rooms she delayed her return to the mothers bedside to say her parting words of comfort to the daughters before she left them for the night norahs room was the nearest she softly opened the door and looked in the kneeling figure by the bedside told her that gods help had found the fatherless daughter in her affliction grateful tears gathered in her eyes as she looked she softly closed the door and went on to magdalens room there doubt stayed her feet at the threshold and she waited for a moment before going in  a sound in the room caught her earthe monotonous rustling of a womans dress now distant now near passing without cessation from end to end over the floora sound which told her that magdalen was pacing to and fro in the secrecy of her own chamber miss garth knocked the rustling ceased the door was opened and the sad young face confronted her locked in its cold despair the large light eyes looked mechanically into hers as vacant and as tearless as ever  that look wrung the heart of the faithful woman who had trained her and loved her from a child she took magdalen tenderly in her arms  oh my love she said no tears yet oh if i could see you as i have seen norah speak to me magdalentry if you can speak to me  she tried and spoke  norah she said feels no remorse he was not serving norahs interests when he went to his death he was serving mine  with that terrible answer she put her cold lips to miss garths cheek  let me bear it by myself she said and gently closed the door  again miss garth waited at the threshold and again the sound of the rustling dress passed to and fronow far now nearto and fro with a cruel mechanical regularity that chilled the warmest sympathy and daunted the boldest hope  the night passed it had been agreed if no change for the better showed itself by the morning that the london physician whom mrs vanstone had consulted some months since should be summoned to the house on the next day no change for the better appeared and the physician was sent for  as the morning advanced frank came to make inquiries from the cottage had mr clare intrusted to his son the duty which he had personally performed on the previous day through reluctance to meet miss garth again after what he had said to her it might be so frank could throw no light on the subject he was not in his fathers confidence he looked pale and bewildered his first inquiries after magdalen showed how his weak nature had been shaken by the catastrophe he was not capable of framing his own questions the words faltered on his lips and the ready tears came into his eyes miss garths heart warmed to him for the first time grief has this that is noble in itit accepts all sympathy come whence it may she encouraged the lad by a few kind words and took his hand at parting  before noon frank returned with a second message his father desired to know whether mr pendril was not expected at comberaven on that day if the lawyers arrival was looked for frank was directed to be in attendance at the station and to take him to the cottage where a bed would be placed at his disposal this message took miss garth by surprise it showed that mr clare had been made acquainted with his dead friends purpose of sending for mr pendril was the old mans thoughtful offer of hospitality another indirect expression of the natural human distress which he perversely concealed or was he aware of some secret necessity for mr pendrils presence of which the bereaved family had been kept in total ignorance miss garth was too heartsick and hopeless to dwell on either question she told frank that mr pendril had been expected at three oclock and sent him back with her thanks  shortly after his departure such anxieties on magdalens account as her mind was now able to feel were relieved by better news than her last nights experience had inclined her to hope for norahs influence had been exerted to rouse her sister and norahs patient sympathy had set the prisoned grief free magdalen had suffered severelysuffered inevitably with such a nature as hersin the effort that relieved her the healing tears had not come gently they had burst from her with a torturing passionate vehemencebut norah had never left her till the struggle was over and the calm had come these better tidings encouraged miss garth to withdraw to her own room and to take the rest which she needed sorely worn out in body and mind she slept from sheer exhaustionslept heavily and dreamless for some hours it was between three and four in the afternoon when she was roused by one of the female servants the woman had a note in her handa note left by mr clare the younger with a message desiring that it might be delivered to miss garth immediately the name written in the lower corner of the envelope was william pendril the lawyer had arrived  miss garth opened the note after a few first sentences of sympathy and condolence the writer announced his arrival at mr clares and then proceeded apparently in his professional capacity to make a very startling request  if he wrote any change for the better in mrs vanstone should take placewhether it is only an improvement for the time or whether it is the permanent improvement for which we all hopein either case i entreat you to let me know of it immediately it is of the last importance that i should see her in the event of her gaining strength enough to give me her attention for five minutes and of her being able at the expiration of that time to sign her name may i beg that you will communicate my request in the strictest confidence to the medical men in attendance they will understand and you will understand the vital importance i attach to this interview when i tell you that i have arranged to defer to it all other business claims on me and that i hold myself in readiness to obey your summons at any hour of the day or night  in those terms the letter ended miss garth read it twice over at the second reading the request which the lawyer now addressed to her and the farewell words which had escaped mr clares lips the day before connected themselves vaguely in her mind there was some other serious interest in suspense known to mr pendril and known to mr clare besides the first and foremost interest of mrs vanstones recovery whom did it affect the children were they threatened by some new calamity which their mothers signature might avert what did it mean did it mean that mr vanstone had died without leaving a will  in her distress and confusion of mind miss garth was incapable of reasoning with herself as she might have reasoned at a happier time she hastened to the antechamber of mrs vanstones room and after explaining mr pendrils position toward the family placed his letter in the hands of the medical men they both answered without hesitation to the same purpose mrs vanstones condition rendered any such interview as the lawyer desired a total impossibility if she rallied from her present prostration miss garth should be at once informed of the improvement in the meantime the answer to mr pendril might be conveyed in one wordimpossible  you see what importance mr pendril attaches to the interview said miss garth  yes both the doctors saw it  my mind is lost and confused gentlemen in this dreadful suspense can you either of you guess why the signature is wanted or what the object of the interview may be i have only seen mr pendril when he has come here on former visits i have no claim to justify me in questioning him will you look at the letter again do you think it implies that mr vanstone has never made a will  i think it can hardly imply that said one of the doctors but even supposing mr vanstone to have died intestate the law takes due care of the interests of his widow and his children  would it do so interposed the other medical man if the property happened to be in land  i am not sure in that case do you happen to know miss garth whether mr vanstones property was in money or in land  in money replied miss garth i have heard him say so on more than one occasion  then i can relieve your mind by speaking from my own experience the law if he has died intestate gives a third of his property to his widow and divides the rest equally among his children  but if mrs vanstone  if mrs vanstone should die pursued the doctor completing the question which miss garth had not the heart to conclude for herself i believe i am right in telling you that the property would as a matter of legal course go to the children whatever necessity there may be for the interview which mr pendril requests i can see no reason for connecting it with the question of mr vanstones presumed intestacy but by all means put the question for the satisfaction of your own mind to mr pendril himself  miss garth withdrew to take the course which the doctor advised after communicating to mr pendril the medical decision which thus far refused him the interview that he sought she added a brief statement of the legal question she had put to the doctors and hinted delicately at her natural anxiety to be informed of the motives which had led the lawyer to make his request the answer she received was guarded in the extreme it did not impress her with a favorable opinion of mr pendril he confirmed the doctors interpretation of the law in general terms only expressed his intention of waiting at the cottage in the hope that a change for the better might yet enable mrs vanstone to see him and closed his letter without the slightest explanation of his motives and without a word of reference to the question of the existence or the nonexistence of mr vanstones will  the marked caution of the lawyers reply dwelt uneasily on miss garths mind until the longexpected event of the day recalled all her thoughts to her one absorbing anxiety on mrs vanstones account  early in the evening the physician from london arrived he watched long by the bedside of the suffering woman he remained longer still in consultation with his medical brethren he went back again to the sickroom before miss garth could prevail on him to communicate to her the opinion at which he had arrived  when he called out into the antechamber for the second time he silently took a chair by her side she looked in his face and the last faint hope died in her before he opened his lips  i must speak the hard truth he said gently all that can be done has been done the next fourandtwenty hours at most will end your suspense if nature makes no effort in that timei grieve to say ityou must prepare yourself for the worst  those words said all they were prophetic of the end  the night passed and she lived through it the next day came and she lingered on till the clock pointed to five at that hour the tidings of her husbands death had dealt the mortal blow when the hour came round again the mercy of god let her go to him in the better world her daughters were kneeling at the bedside as her spirit passed away she left them unconscious of their presence mercifully and happily insensible to the pang of the last farewell  her child survived her till the evening was on the wane and the sunset was dim in the quiet western heaven as the darkness came the light of the frail little lifefaint and feeble from the firstflickered and went out all that was earthly of mother and child lay that night on the same bed the angel of death had done his awful bidding and the two sisters were left alone in the world   chapter xii  earlier than usual on the morning of thursday the twentythird of july mr clare appeared at the door of his cottage and stepped out into the little strip of garden attached to his residence  after he had taken a few turns backward and forward alone he was joined by a spare quiet grayhaired man whose personal appearance was totally devoid of marked character of any kind whose inexpressive face and conventionallyquiet manner presented nothing that attracted approval and nothing that inspired dislike this was mr pendrilthis was the man on whose lips hung the future of the orphans at comberaven  the time is getting on he said looking toward the shrubbery as he joined mr clare  my appointment with miss garth is for eleven oclock it only wants ten minutes of the hour  are you to see her alone asked mr clare  i left miss garth to decideafter warning her first of all that the circumstances i am compelled to disclose are of a very serious nature  and has she decided  she writes me word that she mentioned my appointment and repeated the warning i had given her to both the daughters the elder of the two shrinksand who can wonder at itfrom any discussion connected with the future which requires her presence so soon as the day after the funeral the younger one appears to have expressed no opinion on the subject as i understand it she suffers herself to be passively guided by her sisters example my interview therefore will take place with miss garth aloneand it is a very great relief to me to know it  he spoke the last words with more emphasis and energy than seemed habitual to him mr clare stopped and looked at his guest attentively  you are almost as old as i am sir he said has all your long experience as a lawyer not hardened you yet  i never knew how little it had hardened me replied mr pendril quietly until i returned from london yesterday to attend the funeral i was not warned that the daughters had resolved on following their parents to the grave i think their presence made the closing scene of this dreadful calamity doubly painful and doubly touching you saw how the great concourse of people were moved by itand they were in ignorance of the truth they knew nothing of the cruel necessity which takes me to the house this morning the sense of that necessityand the sight of those poor girls at the time when i felt my hard duty toward them most painfullyshook me as a man of my years and my way of life is not often shaken by any distress in the present or any suspense in the future i have not recovered it this morning i hardly feel sure of myself yet  a mans composurewhen he is a man like youcomes with the necessity for it said mr clare you must have had duties to perform as trying in their way as the duty that lies before you this morning  mr pendril shook his head many duties as serious many stories more romantic no duty so trying no story so hopeless as this  with those words they parted mr pendril left the garden for the shrubbery path which led to comberaven mr clare returned to the cottage  on reaching the passage he looked through the open door of his little parlor and saw frank sitting there in idle wretchedness with his head resting wearily on his hand  i have had an answer from your employers in london said mr clare in consideration of what has happened they will allow the offer they made you to stand over for another month  frank changed color and rose nervously from his chair  are my prospects altered he asked are mr vanstones plans for me not to be carried out he told magdalen his will had provided for her she repeate d his words to me she said i ought to know all that his goodness and generosity had done for both of us how can his death make a change has anything happened  wait till mr pendril comes back from comberaven said his father question himdont question me  the ready tears rose in franks eyes  you wont be hard on me he pleaded faintly you wont expect me to go back to london without seeing magdalen first  mr clare looked thoughtfully at his son and considered a little before he replied  you may dry your eyes he said you shall see magdalen before you go back  he left the room after making that reply and withdrew to his study the books lay ready to his hand as usual he opened one of them and set himself to read in the customary manner but his attention wandered and his eyes strayed away from time to time to the empty chair oppositethe chair in which his old friend and gossip had sat and wrangled with him goodhumoredly for many and many a year past after a struggle with himself he closed the book dn the chair he said it will talk of him and i must listen he reached down his pipe from the wall and mechanically filled it with tobacco his hand shook his eyes wandered back to the old place and a heavy sigh came from him unwillingly that empty chair was the only earthly argument for which he had no answer his heart owned its defeat and moistened his eyes in spite of him he has got the better of me at last said the rugged old man there is one weak place left in me stilland he has found it  meanwhile mr pendril entered the shrubbery and followed the path which led to the lonely garden and the desolate house he was met at the door by the manservant who was apparently waiting in expectation of his arrival  i have an appointment with miss garth is she ready to see me  quite ready sir  is she alone  yes sir  in the room which was mr vanstones study  in that room sir  the servant opened the door and mr pendril went in  the governess stood alone at the study window the morning was oppressively hot and she threw up the lower sash to admit more air into the room as mr pendril entered it  they bowed to each other with a formal politeness which betrayed on either side an uneasy sense of restraint mr pendril was one of the many men who appear superficially to the worst advantage under the influence of strong mental agitation which it is necessary for them to control miss garth on her side had not forgotten the ungraciously guarded terms in which the lawyer had replied to her letter and the natural anxiety which she had felt on the subject of the interview was not relieved by any favorable opinion of the man who sought it as they confronted each other in the silence of the summers morningboth dressed in black miss garths hard features gaunt and haggard with grief the lawyers cold colorless face void of all marked expression suggestive of a business embarrassment and of nothing moreit would have been hard to find two persons less attractive externally to any ordinary sympathies than the two who had now met together the one to tell the other to hear the secrets of the dead  i am sincerely sorry miss garth to intrude on you at such a time as this but circumstances as i have already explained leave me no other choice  will you take a seat mr pendril you wished to see me in this room i believe  only in this room because mr vanstones papers are kept here and i may find it necessary to refer to some of them  after that formal interchange of question and answer they sat down on either side of a table placed close under the window one waited to speak the other waited to bear there was a momentary silence mr pendril broke it by referring to the young ladies with the customary expressions of sympathy miss garth answered him with the same ceremony in the same conventional tone there was a second pause of silence the humming of flies among the evergreen shrubs under the window penetrated drowsily into the room and the tramp of a heavyfooted carthorse plodding along the highroad beyond the garden was as plainly audible in the stillness as if it had been night  the lawyer roused his flagging resolution and spoke to the purpose when he spoke next  you have some reason miss garth he began to feel not quite satisfied with my past conduct toward you in one particular during mrs vanstones fatal illness you addressed a letter to me making certain inquiries which while she lived it was impossible for me to answer her deplorable death releases me from the restraint which i had imposed on myself and permitsor more properly obliges me to speak you shall know what serious reasons i had for waiting day and night in the hope of obtaining that interview which unhappily never took place and in justice to mr vanstones memory your own eyes shall inform you that he made his will  he rose unlocked a little iron safe in the corner of the room and returned to the table with some folded sheets of paper which he spread open under miss garths eyes when she had read the first words in the name of god amen he turned the sheet and pointed to the end of the next page she saw the wellknown signature andrew vanstone she saw the customary attestations of the two witnesses and the date of the document reverting to a period of more than five years since having thus convinced her of the formality of the will the lawyer interposed before she could question him and addressed her in these words  i must not deceive you he said i have my own reasons for producing this document  what reasons sir  you shall hear them when you are in possession of the truth these pages may help to preserve your respect for mr vanstones memory  miss garth started back in her chair  what do you mean she asked with a stern straightforwardness  he took no heed of the question he went on as if she had not interrupted him  i have a second reason he continued for showing you the will if i can prevail on you to read certain clauses in it under my superintendence you will make your own discovery of the circumstances which i am here to disclosecircumstances so painful that i hardly know how to communicate them to you with my own lips  miss garth looked him steadfastly in the face  circumstances sir which affect the dead parents or the living children  which affect the dead and the living both answered the lawyer circumstances i grieve to say which involve the future of mr vanstones unhappy daughters  wait said miss garth wait a little she pushed her gray hair back from her temples and struggled with the sickness of heart the dreadful faintness of terror which would have overpowered a younger or a less resolute woman her eyes dim with watching weary with grief searched the lawyers unfathomable face his unhappy daughters she repeated to herself vacantly he talks as if there was some worse calamity than the calamity which has made them orphans she paused once more and rallied her sinking courage i will not make your hard duty sir more painful to you than i can help she resumed show me the place in the will let me read it and know the worst  mr pendril turned back to the first page and pointed to a certain place in the cramped lines of writing begin here he said  she tried to begin she tried to follow his finger as she had followed it already to the signatures and the dates but her senses seemed to share the confusion of her mindthe words mingled together and the lines swam before her eyes  i cant follow you she said you must tell it or read it to me she pushed her chair back from the table and tried to collect herself stop she exclaimed as the lawyer with visible hesitation and reluctance took the papers in his own hand one question first does his will provide for his children  his will provided for them when he made it  when he made it something of her natural bluntness broke out in her manner as she repeated the answer does it provide for them now  it does not  she snatched the will from his hand and threw it into a corner of the room you mean well she said you wish to spare mebut you are wasting your time and my strength if the will is useless there let it lie tell me the truth mr pendriltell it plainly tell it instantly in your own words  he felt that it would be useless cruelty to resist that appeal there was no merciful alternative but to answer it on the spot  i must refer you to the spring of the present year miss garth do you remember the fourth of march  her attention wandered again a thought seemed to have struck her at the moment when he spoke instead of answering his inquiry she put a question of her own  let me break the news to myself she saidlet me anticipate you if i can his useless will the terms in which you speak of his daughters the doubt you seem to feel of my continued respect for his memory have opened a new view to me mr vanstone has died a ruined manis that what you had to tell me  far from it mr vanstone has died leaving a fortune of more than eighty thousand poundsa fortune invested in excellent securities he lived up to his income but never beyond it and all his debts added together would not reach two hundred pounds if he had died a ruined man i should have felt deeply for his children but i should not have hesitated to tell you the truth as i am hesitating now let me repeat a question which escaped you i think when i first put it carry your mind back to the spring of this year do you remember the fourth of march  miss garth shook her head my memory for dates is bad at the best of times she said i am too confused to exert it at a moments notice can you put your question in no other form  he put it in this form  do you remember any domestic event in the spring of the present year which appeared to affect mr vanstone more seriously than usual  miss garth leaned forward in her chair and looked eagerly at mr pendril across the table the journey to london she exclaimed i distrusted the journey to london from the first yes i remember mr vanstone receiving a letteri remember his reading it and looking so altered from himself that he startled us all  did you notice any apparent understanding between mr and mrs vanstone on the subject of that letter  yes i did one of the girlsit was magdalenmentioned the postmark some place in america it all comes back to me mr pendril mrs vanstone looked excited and anxious the moment she heard the place named they went to london together the next day they explained nothing to their daughters nothing to me mrs vanstone said the journey was for family affairs i suspected something wrong i couldnt tell what mrs vanstone wrote to me from london saying that her object was to consult a physician on the state of her health and not to alarm her daughters by telling them something in the letter rather hurt me at the time i thought there might be some other motive that she was keeping from me did i do her wrong  you did her no wrong there was a motive which she was keeping from you in revealing that motive i reveal the painful secret which brings me to this house all that i could do to prepare you i have done let me now tell the truth in the plainest and fewest words when mr and mrs vanstone left comberaven in the march of the present year  before he could complete the sentence a sudden movement of miss garths interrupted him she started violently and looked round toward the window only the wind among the leaves she said faintly my nerves are so shaken the least thing startles me speak out for gods sake when mr and mrs vanstone left this house tell me in plain words why did they go to london  in plain words mr pendril told her  they went to london to be married  with that answer he placed a slip of paper on the table it was the marriage certificate of the dead parents and the date it bore was march the twentieth eighteen hundred and fortysix  miss garth neither moved nor spoke the certificate lay beneath her unnoticed she sat with her eyes rooted on the lawyers face her mind stunned her senses helpless he saw that all his efforts to break the shock of the discovery had been efforts made in vain he felt the vital importance of rousing her and firmly and distinctly repeated the fatal words  they went to london to be married he said try to rouse yourself try to realize the plain fact first the explanation shall come afterward miss garth i speak the miserable truth in the spring of this year they left home they lived in london for a fortnight in the strictest retirement they were married by license at the end of that time there is a copy of the certificate which i myself obtained on monday last read the date of the marriage for yourself it is friday the twentieth of marchthe march of this present year  as he pointed to the certificate that faint breath of air among the shrubs beneath the window which had startled miss garth stirred the leaves once more he heard it himself this time and turned his face so as to let the breeze play upon it no breeze came no breath of air that was strong enough for him to feel floated into the room  miss garth roused herself mechanically and read the certificate it seemed to produce no distinct impression on her she laid it on one side in a lost bewildered manner twelve years she said in low hopeless tonestwelve quiet happy years i lived with this family mrs vanstone was my friend my dear valued friendmy sister i might almost say i cant believe it bear with me a little sir i cant believe it yet  i shall help you to believe it when i tell you more said mr pendrilyou will understand me better when i take you back to the time of mr vanstones early life i wont ask for your attention just yet let us wait a little until you recover yourself  they waited a few minutes the lawyer took some letters from his pocket referred to them attentively and put them back again can you listen to me now he asked kindly she bowed her head in answer mr pendril considered with himself for a moment i must caution you on one point he said if the aspect of mr vanstones character which i am now about to present to you seems in some respects at variance with your later experience bear in mind that when you first knew him twelve years since he was a man of forty and that when i first knew him he was a lad of nineteen  his next words raised the veil and showed the irrevocable past    chapter xiii  the fortune which mr vanstone possessed when you knew him the lawyer began was part and part only of the inheritance which fell to him on his fathers death mr vanstone the elder was a manufacturer in the north of england he married early in life and the children of the marriage were either six or seven in numberi am not certain which first michael the eldest son still living and now an old man turned seventy secondly selina the eldest daughter who married in afterlife and who died ten or eleven years ago after those two came other sons and daughters whose early deaths make it unnecessary to mention them particularly the last and by many years the youngest of the children was andrew whom i first knew as i told you at the age of nineteen my father was then on the point of retiring from the active pursuit of his profession and in succeeding to his business i also succeeded to his connection with the vanstones as the family solicitor  at that time andrew had just started in life by entering the army after little more than a year of homeservice he was ordered out with his regiment to canada when he quitted england he left his father and his elder brother michael seriously at variance i need not detain you by entering into the cause of the quarrel i need only tell you that the elder mr vanstone with many excellent qualities was a man of fierce and intractable temper his eldest son had set him at defiance under circumstances which might have justly irritated a father of far milder character and he declared in the most positive terms that he would never see michaels face again in defiance of my entreaties and of the entreaties of his wife he tore up in our presence the will which provided for michaels share in the paternal inheritance such was the family position when the younger son left home for canada  some months after andrews arrival with his regiment at quebec he became acquainted with a woman of great personal attractions who came or said she came from one of the southern states of america she obtained an immediate influence over him and she used it to the basest purpose you knew the easy affectionate trusting nature of the man in later lifeyou can imagine how thoughtlessly he acted on the impulse of his youth it is useless to dwell on this lamentable part of the story he was just twentyone he was blindly devoted to a worthless woman and she led him on with merciless cunning till it was too late to draw back in one word he committed the fatal error of his life he married her  she had been wise enough in her own interests to dread the influence of his brotherofficers and to persuade him up to the period of the marriage ceremony to keep the proposed union between them a secret she could do this but she could not provide against the results of accident hardly three months had passed when a chance disclosure exposed the life she had led before her marriage but one alternative was left to her husbandthe alternative of instantly separating from her  the effect of the discovery on the unhappy boyfor a boy in disposition he still wasmay be judged by the event which followed the exposure one of andrews superior officersa certain major kirke if i remember rightfound him in his quarters writing to his father a confession of the disgraceful truth with a loaded pistol by his side that officer saved the lads life from his own hand and hushed up the scandalous affair by a compromise the marriage being a perfectly legal one and the wifes misconduct prior to the ceremony giving her husband no claim to his release from her by divorce it was only possible to appeal to her sense of her own interests a handsome annual allowance was secured to her on condition that she returned to the place from which she had come that she never appeared in england and that she ceased to use her husbands name other stipulations were added to these she accepted them all and measures were privately taken to have her well looked after in the place of her retreat what life she led there and whether she performed all the conditions imposed on her i cannot say i can only tell you that she never to my knowledge came to england that she never annoyed mr vanstone and that the annual allowance was paid her through a local agent in america to the day of her death all that she wanted in marrying him was money and money she got  in the meantime andrew had left the regiment nothing would induce him to face his brotherofficers after what had happened he sold out and returned to england the first intelligence which reached him on his return was the intelligence of his fathers death he came to my office in london before going home and there learned from my lips how the family quarrel had ended  the will which mr vanstone the elder had destroyed in my presence had not been so far as i know replaced by another when i was sent for in the usual course on his death i fully expected that the law would be left to make the customary division among his widow and his children to my surprise a will appeared among his papers correctly drawn and executed and dated about a week after the period when the first will had been destroyed he had maintained his vindictive purpose against his eldest son and had applied to a stranger for the professional assistance which i honestly believe he was ashamed to ask for at my hands  it is needless to trouble you with the provisions of the will in detail there were the widow and three surviving children to be provided for the widow received a lifeinterest only in a portion of the testators property the remaining portion was divided between andrew and selinatwothirds to the brother onethird to the sister on the mothers death the money from which her income had been derived was to go to andrew and selina in the same relative proportions as beforefive thousand pounds having been first deducted from the sum and paid to michael as the sole legacy left by the implacable father to his eldest son  speaking in round numbers the division of property as settled by the will stood thus before the mothers death andrew had seventy thousand pounds selina had thirtyfive thousand pounds michaelhad nothing after the mothers death michael had five thousand pounds to set against andrews inheritance augmented to one hundred thousand and selinas inheritance increased to fifty thousanddo not suppose that i am dwelling unnecessarily on this part of the subject every word i now speak bears on interests still in suspense which vitally concern mr vanstones daughters as we get on from past to present keep in mind the terrible inequality of michaels inheritance and andrews inheritance the harm done by that vindictive will is i greatly fear not over yet  andrews first impulse when he heard the news which i had to tell him was worthy of the open generous nature of the man he at once proposed to divide his inheritance with his elder brother but there was one serious obstacle in the way a letter from michael was waiting for him at my office when he came there and that letter charged him with being the original cause of estrangement between his father and his elder brother the efforts which he had madebluntly and incautiously i own but with the purest and kindest intentions as i knowto compose the quarrel before leaving home were perverted by the vilest misconstruction to support an accusation of treachery and falsehood which would have stung any man to the quick andrew felt what i felt that if these imputations were not withdrawn before his generous intentions toward his brother took effect the mere fact of their execution would amount to a practical acknowledgment of the justice of michaels charge against him he wrote to his brother in the most forbearing terms the answer received was as offensive as words could make it michael had inherited his fathers temper unredeemed by his fathers better qualities his second letter reiterated the charges contained in the first and declared that he would only accept the offered division as an act of atonement and restitution on andrews part i next wrote to the mother to use her influence she was herself aggrieved at being left with nothing more than a life interest in her husbands property she sided resolutely with michael and she stigmatized andrews proposal as an attempt to bribe her eldest son into withdrawing a charge against his brother which that brother knew to be true after this last repulse nothing more could be done michael withdrew to the continent and his mother followed him there she lived long enough and saved money enough out of her income to add considerably at her death to her elder sons five thousand pounds he had previously still further improved his pecuniary position by an advantageous marriage and he is now passing the close of his days either in france or switzerlanda widower with one son we shall return to him shortly in the meantime i need only tell you that andrew and michael never again metnever again communicated even by writing to all intents and purposes they were dead to each other from those early days to the present time  you can now estimate what andrews position was when he left his profession and returned to england possessed of a fortune h e was alone in the world his future destroyed at the fair outset of life his mother and brother estranged from him his sister lately married with interests and hopes in which he had no share men of firmer mental caliber might have found refuge from such a situation as this in an absorbing intellectual pursuit he was not capable of the effort all the strength of his character lay in the affections he had wasted his place in the world was that quiet place at home with wife and children to make his life happy which he had lost forever to look back was more than he dare to look forward was more than he could in sheer despair he let his own impetuous youth drive him on and cast himself into the lowest dissipations of a london life  a womans falsehood had driven him to his ruin a womans love saved him at the outset of his downward career let us not speak of her harshlyfor we laid her with him yesterday in the grave  you who only knew mrs vanstone in later life when illness and sorrow and secret care had altered and saddened her can form no adequate idea of her attractions of person and character when she was a girl of seventeen i was with andrew when he first met her i had tried to rescue him for one night at least from degrading associates and degrading pleasures by persuading him to go with me to a ball given by one of the great city companies there they met she produced a strong impression on him the moment he saw her to me as to him she was a total stranger an introduction to her obtained in the customary manner informed him that she was the daughter of one mr blake the rest he discovered from herself they were partners in the dance unobserved in that crowded ballroom all through the evening  circumstances were against her from the first she was unhappy at home her family and friends occupied no recognized station in life they were mean underhand people in every way unworthy of her it was her first ballit was the first time she had ever met with a man who had the breeding the manners and the conversation of a gentleman are these excuses for her which i have no right to make if we have any human feeling for human weakness surely not  the meeting of that night decided their future when other meetings had followed when the confession of her love had escaped her he took the one course of all others took it innocently and unconsciously which was most dangerous to them both his frankness and his sense of honor forbade him to deceive her he opened his heart and told her the truth she was a generous impulsive girl she had no home ties strong enough to plead with her she was passionately fond of himand he had made that appeal to her pity which to the eternal honor of women is the hardest of all appeals for them to resist she saw and saw truly that she alone stood between him and his ruin the last chance of his rescue hung on her decision she decided and saved him  let me not be misunderstood let me not be accused of trifling with the serious social question on which my narrative forces me to touch i will defend her memory by no false reasoningi will only speak the truth it is the truth that she snatched him from mad excesses which must have ended in his early death it is the truth that she restored him to that happy home existence which you remember so tenderlywhich he remembered so gratefully that on the day when he was free he made her his wife let strict morality claim its right and condemn her early fault i have read my new testament to little purpose indeed if christian mercy may not soften the hard sentence against herif christian charity may not find a plea for her memory in the love and fidelity the suffering and the sacrifice of her whole life  a few words more will bring us to a later time and to events which have happened within your own experience  i need not remind you that the position in which mr vanstone was now placed could lead in the end to but one resultto a disclosure more or less inevitable of the truth attempts were made to keep the hopeless misfortune of his life a secret from miss blakes family and as a matter of course those attempts failed before the relentless scrutiny of her father and her friends what might have happened if her relatives had been what is termed respectable i cannot pretend to say as it was they were people who could in the common phrase be conveniently treated with the only survivor of the family at the present time is a scoundrel calling himself captain wragge when i tell you that he privately extorted the price of his silence from mrs vanstone to the last and when i add that his conduct presents no extraordinary exception to the conduct in their lifetime of the other relativesyou will understand what sort of people i had to deal with in my clients interests and how their assumed indignation was appeased  having in the first instance left england for ireland mr vanstone and miss blake remained there afterward for some years girl as she was she faced her position and its necessities without flinching having once resolved to sacrifice her life to the man she loved having quieted her conscience by persuading herself that his marriage was a legal mockery and that she was his wife in the sight of heaven she set herself from the first to accomplish the one foremost purpose of so living with him in the worlds eye as never to raise the suspicion that she was not his lawful wife the women are few indeed who cannot resolve firmly scheme patiently and act promptly where the dearest interests of their lives are concerned mrs vanstoneshe has a right now remember to that namemrs vanstone had more than the average share of a womans tenacity and a womans tact and she took all the needful precautions in those early days which her husbands less ready capacity had not the art to deviseprecautions to which they were largely indebted for the preservation of their secret in later times  thanks to these safeguards not a shadow of suspicion followed them when they returned to england they first settled in devonshire merely because they were far removed there from that northern county in which mr vanstones family and connections had been known on the part of his surviving relatives they had no curious investigations to dread he was totally estranged from his mother and his elder brother his married sister had been forbidden by her husband who was a clergyman to hold any communication with him from the period when he had fallen into the deplorable way of life which i have described as following his return from canada other relations he had none when he and miss blake left devonshire their next change of residence was to this house neither courting nor avoiding notice simply happy in themselves in their children and in their quiet rural life unsuspected by the few neighbors who formed their modest circle of acquaintance to be other than what they seemedthe truth in their case as in the cases of many others remained undiscovered until accident forced it into the light of day  if in your close intimacy with them it seems strange that they should never have betrayed themselves let me ask you to consider the circumstances and you will understand the apparent anomaly remember that they had been living as husband and wife to all intents and purposes except that the marriageservice had not been read over them for fifteen years before you came into the house and bear in mind at the same time that no event occurred to disturb mr vanstones happiness in the present to remind him of the past or to warn him of the future until the announcement of his wifes death reached him in that letter from america which you saw placed in his hand from that day forthwhen a past which he abhorred was forced back to his memory when a future which she had never dared to anticipate was placed within her reachyou will soon perceive if you have not perceived already that they both betrayed themselves time after time and that you r innocence of all suspicion and their childrens innocence of all suspicion alone prevented you from discovering the truth  the sad story of the past is now as well known to you as to me i have had hard words to speak god knows i have spoken them with true sympathy for the living with true tenderness for the memory of the dead   he paused turned his face a little away and rested his head on his hand in the quiet undemonstrative manner which was natural to him thus far miss garth had only interrupted his narrative by an occasional word or by a mute token of her attention she made no effort to conceal her tears they fell fast and silently over her wasted cheeks as she looked up and spoke to him i have done you some injury sir in my thoughts she said with a noble simplicity i know you better now let me ask your forgiveness let me take your hand  those words and the action which accompanied them touched him deeply he took her hand in silence she was the first to speak the first to set the example of selfcontrol it is one of the noble instincts of women that nothing more powerfully rouses them to struggle with their own sorrow than the sight of a mans distress she quietly dried her tears she quietly drew her chair round the table so as to sit nearer to him when she spoke again  i have been sadly broken mr pendril by what has happened in this house she said or i should have borne what you have told me better than i have borne it today will you let me ask one question before you go on my heart aches for the children of my lovemore than ever my children now is there no hope for their future are they left with no prospect but poverty before them  the lawyer hesitated before he answered the question  they are left dependent he said at last on the justice and the mercy of a stranger  through the misfortune of their birth  through the misfortunes which have followed the marriage of their parents  with that startling answer he rose took up the will from the floor and restored it to its former position on the table between them  i can only place the truth before you he resumed in one plain form of words the marriage has destroyed this will and has left mr vanstones daughters dependent on their uncle  as he spoke the breeze stirred again among the shrubs under the window  on their uncle repeated miss garth she considered for a moment and laid her hand suddenly on mr pendrils arm not on michael vanstone  yes on michael vanstone  miss garths hand still mechanically grasped the lawyers arm her whole mind was absorbed in the effort to realize the discovery which had now burst on her  dependent on michael vanstone she said to herself dependent on their fathers bitterest enemy how can it be  give me your attention for a few minutes more said mr pendril and you shall hear the sooner we can bring this painful interview to a close the sooner i can open communications with mr michael vanstone and the sooner you will know what he decides on doing for his brothers orphan daughters i repeat to you that they are absolutely dependent on him you will most readily understand how and why if we take up the chain of events where we last left itat the period of mr and mrs vanstones marriage  one moment sir said miss garth were you in the secret of that marriage at the time when it took place  unhappily i was not i was away from londonaway from england at the time if mr vanstone had been able to communicate with me when the letter from america announced the death of his wife the fortunes of his daughters would not have been now at stake  he paused and before proceeding further looked once more at the letters which he had consulted at an earlier period of the interview he took one letter from the rest and put it on the table by his side  at the beginning of the present year he resumed a very serious business necessity in connection with some west indian property possessed by an old client and friend of mine required the presence either of myself or of one of my two partners in jamaica one of the two could not be spared the other was not in health to undertake the voyage there was no choice left but for me to go i wrote to mr vanstone telling him that i should leave england at the end of february and that the nature of the business which took me away afforded little hope of my getting back from the west indies before june my letter was not written with any special motive i merely thought it rightseeing that my partners were not admitted to my knowledge of mr vanstones private affairsto warn him of my absence as a measure of formal precaution which it was right to take at the end of february i left england without having heard from him i was on the sea when the news of his wifes death reached him on the fourth of march and i did not return until the middle of last june  you warned him of your departure interposed miss garth did you not warn him of your return  not personally my headclerk sent him one of the circulars which were dispatched from my office in various directions to announce my return it was the first substitute i thought of for the personal letter which the pressure of innumerable occupations all crowding on me together after my long absence did not allow me leisure to write barely a month later the first information of his marriage reached me in a letter from himself written on the day of the fatal accident the circumstances which induced him to write arose out of an event in which you must have taken some interesti mean the attachment between mr clares son and mr vanstones youngest daughter  i cannot say that i was favorably disposed toward that attachment at the time replied miss garth i was ignorant then of the family secret i know better now  exactly the motive which you can now appreciate is the motive that leads us to the point the young lady herself as i have heard from the elder mr clare to whom i am indebted for my knowledge of the circumstances in detail confessed her attachment to her father and innocently touched him to the quick by a chance reference to his own early life he had a long conversation with mrs vanstone at which they both agreed that mr clare must be privately informed of the truth before the attachment between the two young people was allowed to proceed further it was painful in the last degree both to husband and wife to be reduced to this alternative but they were resolute honorably resolute in making the sacrifice of their own feelings and mr vanstone betook himself on the spot to mr clares cottageyou no doubt observed a remarkable change in mr vanstones manner on that day and you can now account for it  miss garth bowed her head and mr pendril went on  you are sufficiently acquainted with mr clares contempt for all social prejudices he continued to anticipate his reception of the confession which his neighbor addressed to him five minutes after the interview had begun the two old friends were as easy and unrestrained together as usual in the course of conversation mr vanstone mentioned the pecuniary arrangement which he had made for the benefit of his daughter and of her future husbandand in doing so he naturally referred to his will here on the table between us mr clare remembering that his friend had been married in the march of that year at once asked when the will had been executed receiving the reply that it had been made five years since and thereupon astounded mr vanstone by telling him bluntly that the document was waste paper in the eye of the law up to that moment he like many other persons had been absolutely ignorant that a mans marriage is legally as well as socially considered to be the most important event in his life that it destroys the validity of any will which he may have made as a single man and that it renders absolutely necessary the entire reassertion of his testamentary intentions in the character of a husband the statement of this plain fact appeared to overwhelm mr vanstone declaring that his friend had laid him under an obligation which he should remember to his dying day he at once left the cottage at once returned home and wrote me this letter  he handed the letter open to miss garth in tearless speechless grief she read these words   my dear pendrilsince we last wrote to each other an extraordinary change has taken place in my life about a week after you went away i received news from america which told me that i was free need i say what use i made of that freedom need i say that the mother of my children is now my wife  if you are surprised at not having heard from me the moment you got back attribute my silence in great partif not altogetherto my own total ignorance of the legal necessity for making another will not half an hour since i was enlightened for the first time under circumstances which i will mention when me meet by my old friend mr clare family anxieties have had something to do with my silence as well my wifes confinement is close at hand and besides this serious anxiety my second daughter is just engaged to be married until i saw mr clare today these matters so filled my mind that i never thought of writing to you during the one short month which is all that has passed since i got news of your return now i know that my will must be made again i write instantly for gods sake come on the day when you receive thiscome and relieve me from the dreadful thought that my two darling girls are at this moment unprovided for if anything happened to me and if my desire to do their mother justice ended through my miserable ignorance of the law in leaving norah and magdalen disinherited i should not rest in my grave come at any cost to yours ever  a v   on the saturday morning mr pendril resumed those lines reached me i instantly set aside all other business and drove to the railway at the london terminus i heard the first news of the fridays accident heard it with conflicting accounts of the numbers and names of the passengers killed at bristol they were better informed and the dreadful truth about mr vanstone was confirmed i had time to recover myself before i reached your station here and found mr clares son waiting for me he took me to his fathers cottage and there without losing a moment i drew out mrs vanstones will my object was to secure the only provision for her daughters which it was now possible to make mr vanstone having died intestate a third of his fortune would go to his widow and the rest would be divided among his next of kin as children born out of wedlock mr vanstones daughters under the circumstances of their fathers death had no more claim to a share in his property than the daughters of one of his laborers in the village the one chance left was that their mother might sufficiently recover to leave her third share to them by will in the event of her decease now you know why i wrote to you to ask for that interviewwhy i waited day and night in the hope of receiving a summons to the house i was sincerely sorry to send back such an answer to your note of inquiry as i was compelled to write but while there was a chance of the preservation of mrs vanstones life the secret of the marriage was hers not mine and every consideration of delicacy forbade me to disclose it  you did right sir said miss garth i understand your motives and respect them  my last attempt to provide for the daughters continued mr pendril was as you know rendered unavailing by the dangerous nature of mrs vanstones illness her death left the infant who survived her by a few hours the infant born you will remember in lawful wedlock possessed in due legal course of the whole of mr vanstones fortune on the childs deathif it had only outlived the mother by a few seconds instead of a few hours the result would have been the samethe next of kin to the legitimate offspring took the money and that next of kin is the infants paternal uncle michael vanstone the whole fortune of eighty thousand pounds has virtually passed into his possession already  are there no other relations asked miss garth is there no hope from any one else  there are no other relations with michael vanstones claim said the lawyer there are no grandfathers or grandmothers of the dead child on the side of either of the parents now alive it was not likely there should be considering the ages of mr and mrs vanstone when they died but it is a misfortune to be reasonably lamented that no other uncles or aunts survive there are cousins alive a son and two daughters of that elder sister of mr vanstones who married archdeacon bartram and who died as i told you some years since but their interest is superseded by the interest of the nearer blood no miss garth we must look facts as they are resolutely in the face mr vanstones daughters are nobodys children and the law leaves them helpless at their uncles mercy  a cruel law mr pendrila cruel law in a christian country  cruel as it is miss garth it stands excused by a shocking peculiarity in this case i am far from defending the law of england as it affects illegitimate offspring on the contrary i think it a disgrace to the nation it visits the sins of the parents on the children it encourages vice by depriving fathers and mothers of the strongest of all motives for making the atonement of marriage and it claims to produce these two abominable results in the names of morality and religion but it has no extraordinary oppression to answer for in the case of these unhappy girls the more merciful and christian law of other countries which allows the marriage of the parents to make the children legitimate has no mercy on these children the accident of their father having been married when he first met with their mother has made them the outcasts of the whole social community it has placed them out of the pale of the civil law of europe i tell you the hard truthit is useless to disguise it there is no hope if we look back at the past there may be hope if we look on to the future the best service which i can now render you is to shorten the period of your suspense in less than an hour i shall be on my way back to london immediately on my arrival i will ascertain the speediest means of communicating with mr michael vanstone and will let you know the result sad as the position of the two sisters now is we must look at it on its best side we must not lose hope  hope repeated miss garth hope from michael vanstone  yes hope from the influence on him of time if not from the influence of mercy as i have already told you he is now an old man he cannot in the course of nature expect to live much longer if he looks back to the period when he and his brother were first at variance he must look back through thirty years surely these are softening influences which must affect any man surely his own knowledge of the shocking circumstances under which he has become possessed of this money will plead with him if nothing else does  i will try to think as you do mr pendrili will try to hope for the best shall we be left long in suspense before the decision reaches us  i trust not the only delay on my side will be caused by the necessity of discovering the place of michael vanstones residence on the continent i think i have the means of meeting this difficulty successfully and the moment i reach london those means shall be tried  he took up his hat and then returned to the table on which the fathers last letter and the fathers useless will were lying side by side after a moments consideration he placed them both in miss garths hands  it may help you in breaking the hard truth to the orphan sisters he said in his quiet selfrepressed way if they can see how their father refers to them in his willif they ca n read his letter to me the last he ever wrote let these tokens tell them that the one idea of their fathers life was the idea of making atonement to his children they may think bitterly of their birth he said to me at the time when i drew this useless will but they shall never think bitterly of me i will cross them in nothing they shall never know a sorrow that i can spare them or a want which i will not satisfy he made me put those words in his will to plead for him when the truth which he had concealed from his children in his lifetime was revealed to them after his death no law can deprive his daughters of the legacy of his repentance and his love i leave the will and the letter to help you i give them both into your care  he saw how his parting kindness touched her and thoughtfully hastened the farewell she took his hand in both her own and murmured a few broken words of gratitude trust me to do my best he saidand turning away with a merciful abruptness left her in the broad cheerful sunshine he had come in to reveal the fatal truth in the broad cheerful sunshinethat truth disclosedhe went out    chapter xiv  it was nearly an hour past noon when mr pendril left the house miss garth sat down again at the table alone and tried to face the necessity which the event of the morning now forced on her  her mind was not equal to the effort she tried to lessen the strain on itto lose the sense of her own positionto escape from her thoughts for a few minutes only after a little she opened mr vanstones letter and mechanically set herself to read it through once more  one by one the last words of the dead man fastened themselves more and more firmly on her attention the unrelieved solitude the unbroken silence helped their influence on her mind and opened it to those very impressions of past and present which she was most anxious to shun as she reached the melancholy lines which closed the letter she found herselfinsensibly almost unconsciously at firsttracing the fatal chain of events link by link backward until she reached its beginning in the contemplated marriage between magdalen and francis clare  that marriage had taken mr vanstone to his old friend with the confession on his lips which would otherwise never have escaped them thence came the discovery which had sent him home to summon the lawyer to the house that summons again had produced the inevitable acceleration of the saturdays journey to friday the friday of the fatal accident the friday when he went to his death from his death followed the second bereavement which had made the house desolate the helpless position of the daughters whose prosperous future had been his dearest care the revelation of the secret which had overwhelmed her that morning the disclosure more terrible still which she now stood committed to make to the orphan sisters for the first time she saw the whole sequence of eventssaw it as plainly as the cloudless blue of the sky and the green glow of the trees in the sunlight outside  howwhen could she tell them who could approach them with the disclosure of their own illegitimacy before their father and mother had been dead a week who could speak the dreadful words while the first tears were wet on their cheeks while the first pang of separation was at its keenest in their hearts while the memory of the funeral was not a day old yet not their last friend left not the faithful woman whose heart bled for them no silence for the present time at all risksmerciful silence for many days to come  she left the room with the will and the letter in her handwith the natural human pity at her heart which sealed her lips and shut her eyes resolutely to the future in the hall she stopped and listened not a sound was audible she softly ascended the stairs on her way to her own room and passed the door of norahs bedchamber voices inside the voices of the two sisters caught her ear after a moments consideration she checked herself turned back and quickly descended the stairs again both norah and magdalen knew of the interview between mr pendril and herself she had felt it her duty to show them his letter making the appointment could she excite their suspicion by locking herself up from them in her room as soon as the lawyer had left the house her hand trembled on the banister she felt that her face might betray her the selfforgetful fortitude which had never failed her until that day had been tried once too oftenhad been tasked beyond its powers at last  at the hall door she reflected for a moment again and went into the garden directing her steps to a rustic bench and table placed out of sight of the house among the trees in past times she had often sat there with mrs vanstone on one side with norah on the other with magdalen and the dogs romping on the grass alone she sat there nowthe will and the letter which she dared not trust out of her own possession laid on the tableher head bowed over them her face hidden in her hands alone she sat there and tried to rouse her sinking courage  doubts thronged on her of the dark days to come dread beset her of the hidden danger which her own silence toward norah and magdalen might store up in the near future the accident of a moment might suddenly reveal the truth mr pendril might write might personally address himself to the sisters in the natural conviction that she had enlightened them complications might gather round them at a moments notice unforeseen necessities might arise for immediately leaving the house she saw all these perilsand still the cruel courage to face the worst and speak was as far from her as ever ere long the thickening conflict of her thoughts forced its way outward for relief in words and actions she raised her head and beat her hand helplessly on the table  god help me what am i to do she broke out how am i to tell them  there is no need to tell them said a voice behind her they know it already  she started to her feet and looked round it was magdalen who stood before hermagdalen who had spoken those words  yes there was the graceful figure in its mourning garments standing out tall and black and motionless against the leafy background there was magdalen herself with a changeless stillness on her white face with an icy resignation in her steady gray eyes  we know it already she repeated in clear measured tones mr vanstones daughters are nobodys children and the law leaves them helpless at their uncles mercy  so without a tear on her cheeks without a faltering tone in her voice she repeated the lawyers own words exactly as he had spoken them miss garth staggered back a step and caught at the bench to support herself her head swam she closed her eyes in a momentary faintness when they opened again magdalens arm was supporting her magdalens breath fanned her cheek magdalens cold lips kissed her she drew back from the kiss the touch of the girls lips thrilled her with terror  as soon as she could speak she put the inevitable question you heard us she said where  under the open window  all the time  from beginning to end  she had listenedthis girl of eighteen in the first week of her orphanage had listened to the whole terrible revelation word by word as it fell from the lawyers lips and had never once betrayed herself from first to last the only movements which had escaped her had been movements guarded enough and slight enough to be mistaken for the passage of the summer breeze through the leaves  dont try to speak yet she said in softer and gentler tones dont look at me with those doubting eyes what wrong have i done when mr pendril wished to speak to you about norah and me his letter gave us our choice to be present at the interview or to keep away if my elder sister decided to keep away how could i come how could i hear my own story except as i did my listening has done no harm it has done goodit has saved you the distress of speaking to us you have suffered enough for us already it is time we learned to suffer for ourselves i have learned and norah is learning  norah  yes i have done all i could to spare you i have told norah  she had told norah was this girl whose courage had faced the terrible necessity from which a woman old enough to be her mother had recoiled the girl miss garth had brought up the girl whose nature she had believed to be as well known to her as her own  magdalen she cried out passionately you frighten me  magdalen only sighed and turned wearily away  try not to think worse of me than i deserve she said i cant cry my heart is numbed  she moved away slowly over the grass miss garth watched the tall black figure gliding away alone until it was lost among the trees while it was in sight she could think of nothing else the moment it was gone she thought of norah for the first time in her experience of the sisters her heart led her instinctively to the elder of the two  norah was still in her own room she was sitting on the couch by the window with her mothers old musicbookthe keepsake which mrs vanstone had found in her husbands study on the day of her husbands deathspread open on her lap she looked up from it with such quiet sorrow and pointed with such ready kindness to the vacant place at her side that miss garth doubted for the moment whether magdalen had spoken the truth see said norah simply turning to the first leaf in the musicbookmy mothers name written in it and some verses to my father on the next page we may keep this for ourselves if we keep nothing else she put her arm round miss garths neck and a faint tinge of color stole over her cheeks i see anxious thoughts in your face she whispered are you anxious about me are you doubting whether i have heard it i have heard the whole truth i might have felt it bitterly later it is too soon to feel it now you have seen magdalen she went out to find youwhere did you leave her  in the garden i couldnt speak to her i couldnt look at her magdalen has frightened me  norah rose hurriedly rose startled and distressed by miss garths reply  dont think ill of magdalen she said magdalen suffers in secret more than i do try not to grieve over what you have heard about us this morning does it matter who we are or what we keep or lose what loss is there for us after the loss of our father and mother oh miss garth there is the only bitterness what did we remember of them when we laid them in the grave yesterday nothing but the love they gave usthe love we must never hope for again what else can we remember today what change can the world and the worlds cruel laws make in our memory of the kindest father the kindest mother that children ever had she stopped struggled with her rising grief and quietly resolutely kept it down will you wait here she said while i go and bring magdalen back magdalen was always your favorite i want her to be your favorite still she laid the musicbook gently on miss garths lapand left the room  magdalen was always your favorite  tenderly as they had been spoken those words fell reproachfully on miss garths ear for the first time in the long companionship of her pupils and herself a doubt whether she and all those about her had not been fatally mistaken in their relative estimate of the sisters now forced itself on her mind  she had studied the natures of her two pupils in the daily intimacy of twelve years those natures which she believed herself to have sounded through all their depths had been suddenly tried in the sharp ordeal of affliction how had they come out from the test as her previous experience had prepared her to see them no in flat contradiction to it  what did such a result as this imply  thoughts came to her as she asked herself that question which have startled and saddened us all  does there exist in every human being beneath that outward and visible character which is shaped into form by the social influences surrounding us an inward invisible disposition which is part of ourselves which education may indirectly modify but can never hope to change is the philosophy which denies this and asserts that we are born with dispositions like blank sheets of paper a philosophy which has failed to remark that we are not born with blank facesa philosophy which has never compared together two infants of a few days old and has never observed that those infants are not born with blank tempers for mothers and nurses to fill up at will are there infinitely varying with each individual inbred forces of good and evil in all of us deep down below the reach of mortal encouragement and mortal repressionhidden good and hidden evil both alike at the mercy of the liberating opportunity and the sufficient temptation within these earthly limits is earthly circumstance ever the key and can no human vigilance warn us beforehand of the forces imprisoned in ourselves which that key may unlock  for the first time thoughts such as these rose darklyas shadowy and terrible possibilitiesin miss garths mind for the first time she associated those possibilities with the past conduct and characters with the future lives and fortunes of the orphan sisters  searching as in a glass darkly into the two natures she felt her way doubt by doubt from one possible truth to another it might be that the upper surface of their characters was all that she had thus far plainly seen in norah and magdalen it might be that the unalluring secrecy and reserve of one sister the allattractive openness and high spirits of the other were more or less referable in each case to those physical causes which work toward the production of moral results it might be that under the surface so formeda surface which there had been nothing hitherto in the happy prosperous uneventful lives of the sisters to disturbforces of inborn and inbred disposition had remained concealed which the shock of the first serious calamity in their lives had now thrown up into view was this so was the promise of the future shining with prophetic light through the surfaceshadow of norahs reserve and darkening with prophetic gloom under the surfaceglitter of magdalens bright spirits if the life of the elder sister was destined henceforth to be the ripening ground of the undeveloped good that was in herwas the life of the younger doomed to be the battlefield of mortal conflict with the roused forces of evil in herself  on the brink of that terrible conclusion miss garth shrank back in dismay her heart was the heart of a true woman it accepted the conviction which raised norah higher in her love it rejected the doubt which threatened to place magdalen lower she rose and paced the room impatiently she recoiled with an angry suddenness from the whole train of thought in which her mind had been engaged but the moment before what if there were dangerous elements in the strength of magdalens characterwas it not her duty to help the girl against herself how had she performed that duty she had let herself be governed by first fears and first impressions she had never waited to consider whether magdalens openly acknowledged action of that morning might not imply a selfsacrificing fortitude which promised in afterlife the noblest and the most enduring results she had let norah go and speak those words of tender remonstrance which she should first have spoken herself oh she thought bitterly how long i have lived in the world and how little i have known of my own weakness and wickedness until today    the door of the room opened norah came in as she had gone out alone  do you remember leaving anything on the little table by the gardenseat she asked quietly  before miss garth could answer the question she held out her fathers will and her fathers letter  magdalen came back after you went away she said and found these last relics she heard mr pendril say they were her legacy and mine when i went into the garden she was reading the letter there was no need for me to speak to her our father had spoken to her from his grave see how she has listened to him  she pointed to the letter the traces of heavy teardrops lay thick over the last lines of the dead mans writing  her tears said norah softly  miss garths head drooped low over the mute revelation of magdalens return to her better self  oh never doubt her again pleaded norah we are alone nowwe have our hard way through the world to walk on as patiently as we can if magdalen ever falters and turns back help her for the love of old times help her against herself  with all my heart and strengthas god shall judge me with the devotion of my whole life in those fervent words miss garth answered she took the hand which norah held out to her and put it in sorrow and humility to her lips oh my love forgive me i have been miserably blindi have never valued you as i ought  norah gently checked her before she could say more gently whispered come with me into the gardencome and help magdalen to look patiently to the future  the future who could see the faintest glimmer of it who could see anything but the illomened figure of michael vanstone posted darkly on the verge of the present timeand closing all the prospect that lay beyond him    chapter xv  on the next morning but one news was received from mr pendril the place of michael vanstones residence on the continent had been discovered he was living at zurich and a letter had been dispatched to him at that place on the day when the information was obtained in the course of the coming week an answer might be expected and the purport of it should be communicated forthwith to the ladies at comberaven  short as it was the interval of delay passed wearily ten days elapsed before the expected answer was received and when it came at last it proved to be strictly speaking no answer at all mr pendril had been merely referred to an agent in london who was in possession of michael vanstones instructions certain difficulties had been discovered in connection with those instructions which had produced the necessity of once more writing to zurich and there the negotiations rested again for the present  a second paragraph in mr pendrils letter contained another piece of intelligence entirely new mr michael vanstones son and only child mr noel vanstone had recently arrived in london and was then staying in lodgings occupied by his cousin mr george bartram professional considerations had induced mr pendril to pay a visit to the lodgings he had been very kindly received by mr bartram but had been informed by that gentleman that his cousin was not then in a condition to receive visitors mr noel vanstone had been suffering for some years past from a wearing and obstinate malady he had come to england expressly to obtain the best medical advice and he still felt the fatigue of the journey so severely as to be confined to his bed under these circumstances mr pendril had no alternative but to take his leave an interview with mr noel vanstone might have cleared up some of the difficulties in connection with his fathers instructions as events had turned out there was no help for it but to wait for a few days more  the days passed the empty days of solitude and suspense at last a third letter from the lawyer announced the long delayed conclusion of the correspondence the final answer had been received from zurich and mr pendril would personally communicate it at comberaven on the afternoon of the next day  that next day was wednesday the twelfth of august the weather had changed in the night and the sun rose watery through mist and cloud by noon the sky was overcast at all points the temperature was sensibly colder and the rain poured down straight and soft and steady on the thirsty earth toward three oclock miss garth and norah entered the morningroom to await mr pendrils arrival they were joined shortly afterward by magdalen in half an hour more the familiar fall of the iron latch in the socket reached their ears from the fence beyond the shrubbery mr pendril and mr clare advanced into view along the gardenpath walking arminarm through the rain sheltered by the same umbrella the lawyer bowed as they passed the windows mr clare walked straight on deep in his own thoughtsnoticing nothing  after a delay which seemed interminable after a weary scraping of wet feet on the hall mat after a mysterious muttered interchange of question and answer outside the door the two came inmr clare leading the way the old man walked straight up to the table without any preliminary greeting and looked across it at the three women with a stern pity for them in his ragged wrinkled face  bad news he said i am an enemy to all unnecessary suspense plainness is kindness in such a case as this i mean to be kindand i tell you plainlybad news  mr pendril followed him he shook hands in silence with miss garth and the two sisters and took a seat near them mr clare placed himself apart on a chair by the window the gray rainy light fell soft and sad on the faces of norah and magdalen who sat together opposite to him miss garth had placed herself a little behind them in partial shadow and the lawyers quiet face was seen in profile close beside her so the four occupants of the room appeared to mr clare as he sat apart in his corner his long clawlike fingers interlaced on his knee his dark vigilant eyes fixed searchingly now on one face now on another the dripping rustle of the rain among the leaves and the clear ceaseless tick of the clock on the mantelpiece made the minute of silence which followed the settling of the persons present in their places indescribably oppressive it was a relief to every one when mr pendril spoke  mr clare has told you already he began that i am the bearer of bad news i am grieved to say miss garth that your doubts when i last saw you were better founded than my hopes what that heartless elder brother was in his youth he is still in his old age in all my unhappy experience of the worst side of human nature i have never met with a man so utterly dead to every consideration of mercy as michael vanstone  do you mean that he takes the whole of his brothers fortune and makes no provision whatever for his brothers children asked miss garth  he offers a sum of money for present emergencies replied mr pendril so meanly and disgracefully insufficient that i am ashamed to mention it  and nothing for the future  absolutely nothing  as that answer was given the same thought passed at the same moment through miss garths mind and through norahs the decision which deprived both the sisters alike of the resources of fortune did not end there for the younger of the two michael vanstones merciless resolution had virtually pronounced the sentence which dismissed frank to china and which destroyed all present hope of magdalens marriage as the words passed the lawyers lips miss garth and norah looked at magdalen anxiously her face turned a shade palerbut not a feature of it moved not a word escaped her norah who held her sisters hand in her own felt it tremble for a moment and then turn coldand that was all  let me mention plainly what i have done resumed mr pendril i am very desirous you should not think that i have left any effort untried when i wrote to michael vanstone in the first instance i did not confine myself to the usual formal statement i put before him plainly and earnestly every one of the circumstances under which he has become possessed of his brothers fortune when i received the answer referring me to his written instructions to his lawyer in londonand when a copy of those instructions was placed in my handsi positively declined on becoming acquainted with them to receive the writers decision as final i induce d the solicitor on the other side to accord us a further term of delay i attempted to see mr noel vanstone in london for the purpose of obtaining his intercession and failing in that i myself wrote to his father for the second time the answer referred me in insolently curt terms to the instructions already communicated declared those instructions to be final and declined any further correspondence with me there is the beginning and the end of the negotiation if i have overlooked any means of touching this heartless mantell me and those means shall be tried  he looked at norah she pressed her sisters hand encouragingly and answered for both of them  i speak for my sister as well as for myself she said with her color a little heightened with her natural gentleness of manner just touched by a quiet uncomplaining sadness you have done all that could be done mr pendril we have tried to restrain ourselves from hoping too confidently and we are deeply grateful for your kindness at a time when kindness is sorely needed by both of us  magdalens hand returned the pressure of her sisterswithdrew itselftrifled for a moment impatiently with the arrangement of her dressthen suddenly moved the chair closer to the table leaning one arm on it with the hand fast clinched she looked across at mr pendril her face always remarkable for its want of color was now startling to contemplate in its blank bloodless pallor but the light in her large gray eyes was bright and steady as ever and her voice though low in tone was clear and resolute in accent as she addressed the lawyer in these terms  i understood you to say mr pendril that my fathers brother had sent his written orders to london and that you had a copy have you preserved it  certainly  have you got it about you  i have  may i see it  mr pendril hesitated and looked uneasily from magdalen to miss garth and from miss garth back again to magdalen  pray oblige me by not pressing your request he said it is surely enough that you know the result of the instructions why should you agitate yourself to no purpose by reading them they are expressed so cruelly they show such abominable want of feeling that i really cannot prevail upon myself to let you see them  i am sensible of your kindness mr pendril in wishing to spare me pain but i can bear pain i promise to distress nobody will you excuse me if i repeat my request  she held out her handthe soft white virgin hand that had touched nothing to soil it or harden it yet  oh magdalen think again said norah  you distress mr pendril added miss garth you distress us all  there can be no end gained pleaded the lawyerforgive me for saying sothere can really be no useful end gained by my showing you the instructions  fools said mr clare to himself have they no eyes to see that she means to have her own way  something tells me there is an end to be gained persisted magdalen this decision is a very serious one it is more serious to me she looked round at mr clare who sat closely watching her and instantly looked back again with the first outward betrayal of emotion which had escaped her yet it is even more serious to me she resumed for private reasonsthan it is to my sister i know nothing yet but that our fathers brother has taken our fortunes from us he must have some motives of his own for such conduct as that it is not fair to him or fair to us to keep those motives concealed he has deliberately robbed norah and robbed me and i think we have a right if we wish it to know why  i dont wish it said norah  i do said magdalen and once more she held out her hand  at this point mr clare roused himself and interfered for the first time  you have relieved your conscience he said addressing the lawyer give her the right she claims it is her rightif she will have it  mr pendril quietly took the written instructions from his pocket i have warned you he saidand handed the papers across the table without another word one of the pages of writingwas folded down at the corner and at that folded page the manuscript opened when magdalen first turned the leaves is this the place which refers to my sister and myself she inquired mr pendril bowed and magdalen smoothed out the manuscript before her on the table  will you decide norah she asked turning to her sister shall i read this aloud or shall i read it to myself  to yourself said miss garth answering for norah who looked at her in mute perplexity and distress  it shall be as you wish said magdalen with that reply she turned again to the manuscript and read these lines    you are now in possession of my wishes in relation to the property in money and to the sale of the furniture carriages horses and so forth the last point left on which it is necessary for me to instruct you refers to the persons inhabiting the house and to certain preposterous claims on their behalf set up by a solicitor named pendril who has no doubt interested reasons of his own for making application to me  i understand that my late brother has left two illegitimate children both of them young women who are of an age to earn their own livelihood various considerations all equally irregular have been urged in respect to these persons by the solicitor representing them be so good as to tell him that neither you nor i have anything to do with questions of mere sentiment and then state plainly for his better information what the motives are which regulate my conduct and what the provision is which i feel myself justified in making for the two young women your instructions on both these points you will find detailed in the next paragraph  i wish the persons concerned to know once for all how i regard the circumstances which have placed my late brothers property at my disposal let them understand that i consider those circumstances to be a providential interposition which has restored to me the inheritance that ought always to have been mine i receive the money not only as my right but also as a proper compensation for the injustice which i suffered from my father and a proper penalty paid by my younger brother for the vile intrigue by which he succeeded in disinheriting me his conduct when a young man was uniformly discreditable in all the relations of life and what it then was it continued to be on the showing of his own legal representative after the time when i ceased to hold any communication with him he appears to have systematically imposed a woman on society as his wife who was not his wife and to have completed the outrage on morality by afterward marrying her such conduct as this has called down a judgment on himself and his children i will not invite retribution on my own head by assisting those children to continue the imposition which their parents practiced and by helping them to take a place in the world to which they are not entitled let them as becomes their birth gain their bread in situations if they show themselves disposed to accept their proper position i will assist them to start virtuously in life by a present of one hundred pounds each this sum i authorize you to pay them on their personal application with the necessary acknowledgment of receipt and on the express understanding that the transaction so completed is to be the beginning and the end of my connection with them the arrangements under which they quit the house i leave to your discretion and i have only to add that my decision on this matter as on all other matters is positive and final   line by linewithout once looking up from the pages before her magdalen read those atrocious sentences through from beginning to end the other persons assembled in the room all eagerly looking at her together saw the dress rising and falling faster and faster over her bosomsaw the hand in which she lightly held the manuscript at the outset close unconsciously on the paper and crush it as she advanced nearer and nearer to the endbut detected no other outward signs of what was passing within her as soon as she had done she silently pushed the manuscript away and put her hands on a sudden over her face when she withdrew them all the four persons in the room noticed a change in her something in her expression had altered subtly and silently something which made the familiar features suddenly look strange even to her sister and miss garth something through all after years never to be forgotten in connection with that dayand never to be described  the first words she spoke were addressed to mr pendril  may i ask one more favor she said before you enter on your business arrangements  mr pendril replied ceremoniously by a gesture of assent magdalens resolution to possess herself of the instructions did not appear to have produced a favorable impression on the lawyers mind  you mentioned what you were so kind as to do in our interests when you first wrote to mr michael vanstone she continued you said you had told him all the circumstances i wantif you will allow meto be made quite sure of what he really knew about uswhen he sent these orders to his lawyer did he know that my father had made a will and that he had left our fortunes to my sister and myself  he did know it said mr pendril  did you tell him how it happened that we are left in this helpless position  i told him that your father was entirely unaware when he married of the necessity for making another will  and that another will would have been made after he saw mr clare but for the dreadful misfortune of his death  he knew that also  did he know that my fathers untiring goodness and kindness to both of us  her voice faltered for the first time she sighed and put her hand to her head wearily norah spoke entreatingly to her miss garth spoke entreatingly to her mr clare sat silent watching her more and more earnestly she answered her sisters remonstrance with a faint smile i will keep my promise she said i will distress nobody with that reply she turned again to mr pendril and steadily reiterated the questionbut in another form of words  did mr michael vanstone know that my fathers great anxiety was to make sure of providing for my sister and myself  he knew it in your fathers own words i sent him an extract from your fathers last letter to me  the letter which asked you to come for gods sake and relieve him from the dreadful thought that his daughters were unprovided for the letter which said he should not rest in his grave if he left us disinherited  that letter and those words  she paused still keeping her eyes steadily fixed on the lawyers face  i want to fasten it all in my mind she said before i go on mr michael vanstone knew of the first will he knew what prevented the making of the second will he knew of the letter and he read the words what did he know of besides did you tell him of my mothers last illness did you say that her share in the money would have been left to us if she could have lifted her dying hand in your presence did you try to make him ashamed of the cruel law which calls girls in our situation nobodys children and which allows him to use us as he is using us now  i put all those considerations to him i left none of them doubtful i left none of them out  she slowly reached her hand to the copy of the instructions and slowly folded it up again in the shape in which it had been presented to her i am much obliged to you mr pendril with those words she bowed and gently pushed the manuscript back across the table then turned to her sister  norah she said if we both of us live to grow old and if you ever forget all that we owe to michael vanstonecome to me and i will remind you  she rose and walked across the room by herself to the window as she passed mr clare the old man stretched out his clawlike fingers and caught her fast by the arm before she was aware of him  what is this mask of yours hiding he asked forcing her to bend to him and looking close into her face which of the extremes of human temperature does your courage start fromthe dead cold or the white hot  she shrank back from him and turned away her head in silence she would have resented that unscrupulous intrusion on her own thoughts from any man alive but franks father he dropped her arm as suddenly as he had taken it and let her go on to the window no he said to himself not the cold extreme whatever else it may be so much the worse for her and for all belonging to her  there was a momentary pause once more the dripping rustle of the rain and the steady ticking of the clock filled up the gap of silence mr pendril put the instructions back in his pocket considered a little and turning toward norah and miss garth recalled their attention to the present and pressing necessities of the time  our consultation has been needlessly prolonged he sail by painful references to the past we shall be better employed in settling our arrangements for the future i am obliged to return to town this evening pray let me hear how i can best assist you pray tell me what trouble and what responsibility i can take off your hands  for the moment neither norah nor miss garth seemed to be capable of answering him magdalens reception of the news which annihilated the marriage prospect that her fathers own lips had placed before her not a month since had bewildered and dismayed them alike they had summoned their courage to meet the shock of her passionate grief or to face the harder trial of witnessing her speechless despair but they were not prepared for her invincible resolution to read the instructions for the terrible questions which she had put to the lawyer for her immovable determination to fix all the circumstances in her mind under which michael vanstones decision had been pronounced there she stood at the window an unfathomable mystery to the sister who had never been parted from her to the governess who had trained her from a child miss garth remembered the dark doubts which had crossed her mind on the day when she and magdalen had met in the garden norah looked forward to the coming time with the first serious dread of it on her sisters account which she had felt yet both had hitherto remained passive in despair of knowing what to do both were now silent in despair of knowing what to say  mr pendril patiently and kindly helped them by returning to the subject of their future plans for the second time  i am sorry to press any business matters on your attention he said when you are necessarily unfitted to deal with them but i must take my instructions back to london with me to night with reference in the first place to the disgraceful pecuniary offer to which i have already alluded the younger miss vanstone having read the instructions needs no further information from my lips the elder will i hope excuse me if i tell her what i should be ashamed to tell her but that it is a matter of necessity that mr michael vanstones provision for his brothers children begins and ends with an offer to each of them of one hundred pounds  norahs face crimsoned with indignation she started to her feet as if michael vanstone had been present in the room and had personally insulted her  i see said the lawyer wishing to spare her i may tell mr michael vanstone you refuse the money  tell him she broke out passionately if i was starving by the roadside i wouldnt touch a farthing of it  shall i notify your refusal also asked mr pendril speaking to magdalen next  she turned round from the windowbut kept her face in shadow by standing close against it with her back to the light  tell him on my part she said to think again before he starts me in life with a hundred pounds i will give him time to think she spoke those strange words with a marked emphasis and turning back quickly to the window hid her face from the observation of every one in the room  you both refuse the offer said mr pendril taking out his pencil and making his professional note of the decision as he shut up his pocketbook he glanced toward magdalen doubtfully she had roused in him the latent distrust which is a lawyers second nature he had his suspicions of her looks he had his suspicions of her language her sister seemed to have mere influence over her than miss garth he resolved to speak privately to her sister before he went away  while the idea was passing through his mind his attention was claimed by another question from magdalen  is he an old man she asked suddenly without turning round from the window  if you mean mr michael vanstone he is seventyfive or seventysix years of age  you spoke of his son a little while since has he any other sonsor daughters  none  do you know anything of his wife  she has been dead for many years  there was a pause why do you ask these questions said norah  i beg your pardon replied magdalen quietly i wont ask any more  for the third time mr pendril returned to the business of the interview  the servants must not be forgotten he said they must be settled with and discharged i will give them the necessary explanation before i leave as for the house no questions connected with it need trouble you the carriages and horses the furniture and plate and so on must simply be left on the premises to await mr michael vanstones further orders but any possessions miss vanstone personally belonging to you or to your sisterjewelry and dresses and any little presents which may have been made to youare entirely at your disposal with regard to the time of your departure i understand that a month or more will elapse before mr michael vanstone can leave zurich and i am sure i only do his solicitor justice in saying  excuse me mr pendril interposed norah i think i understand from what you have just said that our house and everything in it belongs to she stopped as if the mere utterance of the mans name was abhorrent to her  to michael vanstone said mr pendril the house goes to him with the rest of the property  then i for one am ready to leave it tomorrow  magdalen started at the window as her sister spoke and looked at mr clare with the first open signs of anxiety and alarm which she had shown yet  dont be angry with me she whispered stooping over the old man with a sudden humility of look and a sudden nervousness of manner i cant go without seeing frank first  you shall see him replied mr clare i am here to speak to you about it when the business is done  it is quite unnecessary to hurry your departure as you propose continued mr pendril addressing norah i can safely assure you that a week hence will be time enough  if this is mr michael vanstones house repeated norah i am ready to leave it tomorrow  she impatiently quitted her chair and seated herself further away on the sofa as she laid her hand on the back of it her face changed there at the head of the sofa were the cushions which had supported her mother when she lay down for the last time to repose there at the foot of the sofa was the clumsy oldfashioned armchair which had been her fathers favorite seat on rainy days when she and her sister used to amuse him at the piano opposite by playing his favorite tunes a heavy sigh which she tried vainly to repress burst from her lips oh she thought i had forgotten these old friends how shall we part from them when the time comes  may i inquire miss vanstone whether you and your sister have formed any definite plans for the future asked mr pendril have you thought of any place of residence  i may take it on myself sir said miss garth to answer your question for them when they leave this house they leave it with me my home is their home and my bread is their bread their parents honored me trusted me and loved me for twelve happy years they never let me remember that i was their governess they only let me know myself as their companion and their friend my memory of them is the memory of unvarying gentleness and generosity and my life shall pay the debt of my gratitude to their orphan children  norah rose hastily from the sofa magdalen impetuously left the window for once there was no contrast in the conduct of the sisters for once the same impulse moved their hearts the same earnest feeling inspired their words miss garth waited until the first outburst of emotion had passed away then rose and taking norah and magdalen each by the hand addressed herself to mr pendril and mr clare she spoke with perfect selfpossession strong in her artless unconsciousness of her own good action  even such a trifle as my own story she said is of some importance at such a moment as this i wish you both gentlemen to understand that i am not promising more to the daughters of your old friend than i can perform when i first came to this house i entered it under such independent circumstances as are not common in the lives of governesses in my younger days i was associated in teaching with my elder sister we established a school in london which grew to be a large and prosperous one i only left it and became a private governess because the heavy responsibility of the school was more than my strength could bear i left my share in the profits untouched and i possess a pecuniary interest in our establishment to this day that is my story in few words when we leave this house i propose that we shall go back to the school in london which is still prosperously directed by my elder sister we can live there as quietly as we please until time has helped us to bear our affliction better than we can bear it now if norahs and magdalens altered prospects oblige them to earn their own independence i can help them to earn it as a gentlemans daughters should the best families in this land are glad to ask my sisters advice where the interests of their childrens hometraining are concerned and i answer beforehand for her hearty desire to serve mr vanstones daughters as i answer for my own that is the future which my gratitude to their father and mother and my love for themselves now offers to them if you think my proposal gentlemen a fit and fair proposaland i see in your faces that you dolet us not make the hard necessities of our position harder still by any useless delay in meeting them at once let us do what we must do let us act on norahs decision and leave this house tomorrow you mentioned the servants just now mr pendril i am ready to call them together in the next room and to assist you in the settlement of their claims whenever you please  without waiting for the lawyers answer without leaving the sisters time to realize their own terrible situation she moved at once toward the door it was her wise resolution to meet the coming trial by doing much and saying little before she could leave the room mr clare followed and stopped her on the threshold  i never envied a womans feelings before said the old man it may surprise you to hear it but i envy yours wait i have something more to say there is an obstacle still leftthe everlasting obstacle of frank help me to sweep him off take the elder sister along with you and the lawyer and leave me here to have it out with the younger i want to see what metal shes really made of  while mr clare was addressing these words to miss garth mr pendril had taken the opportunity of speaking to norah before i go back to town he said i should like to have a word with you in private from what has passed today miss vanstone i have formed a very high opinion of your discretion and as an old friend of your fathers i want to take the freedom of speaking to you about your sister  before norah could answer she was summoned in compliance with mr clares request to the conference with the servants mr pendril followed miss garth as a matter of course when the three were out in the hall mr clare reentered the room closed the door and signed peremptorily to magdalen to take a chair  she obeyed him in silence he took a turn up and down the room with his hands in the sidepockets of the long loose shapeless coat which he habitually wore  how old are you he said stopping suddenly and speaking to her with the whole breadth of the room between them  i was eighteen last birthday she answered humbly without looking up at him  you have shown extraordinary courage for a girl of eighteen have you got any of that courage left  she clasped her hands together and wrung them hard a few tears gathered in her eyes and rolled slowly over her cheeks  i cant give frank up she said faintly you dont care for me i know but you used to care for my father will you try to be kind to me for my fathers sake  the last words died away in a whisper she could say no more never had she felt the illimitable power which a womans love possesses of absorbing into itself every other event every other joy or sorrow of her life as she felt it then never had she so tenderly associated frank with the memory of her lost parents as at that moment never had the impenetrable atmosphere of illusion through which women behold the man of their choicethe atmosphere which had blinded her to all that was weak selfish and mean in franks naturesurrounded him with a brighter halo than now when she was pleading with the father for the possession of the son oh dont ask me to give him up she said trying to take courage and shuddering from head to foot in the next instant she flew to the opposite extreme with the suddenness of a flash of lightning i wont give him up she burst out violently no not if a thousand fathers ask me  i am one father said mr clare and i dont ask you  in the first astonishment and delight of hearing those unexpected words she started to her feet crossed the room and tried to throw her arms round his neck she might as well have attempted to move the house from its foundations he took her by the shoulders and put her back in her chair his inexorable eyes looked her into submission and his lean forefinger shook at her warningly as if he was quieting a fractious child  hug frank he said dont hug me i havent done with you yet when i have you may shake hands with me if you like wait and compose yourself  he left her his hands went back into his pockets and his monotonous march up and down the room began again  ready he asked stopping short after a while she tried to answer take two minutes more he said and resumed his walk with the regularity of clockwork these are the creatures he thought to himself into whose keeping men otherwise sensible give the happiness of their lives is there any other object in creation i wonder which answers its end as badly as a woman does  he stopped before her once more her breathing was easier the dark flush on her face was dying out again  ready he repeated yes ready at last listen to me and lets get it over i dont ask you to give frank up i ask you to wait  i will wait she said patiently willingly  will you make frank wait  yes  will you send him to china  her head drooped upon her bosom and she clasped her hands again in silence mr clare saw where the difficulty lay and marched straight up to it on the spot  i dont pretend to enter into your feelings for frank or franks for you he said the subject doesnt interest me but i do pretend to state two plain truths it is one plain truth that you cant be married till you have money enough to pay for the roof that shelters you the clothes that cover you and the victuals you eat it is another plain truth that you cant find the money that i cant find the money and that franks only chance of finding it is going to china if i tell him to go hell sit in a corner and cry if i insist hell say yes and deceive me if i go a step further and see him on board ship with my own eyes hell slip off in the pilots boat and sneak back secretly to you thats his disposition  no said magdalen its not his disposition its his love for me  call it what you like retorted mr clare sneak or sweetheart hes too slippery in either capacity for my fingers to hold him my shutting the door wont keep him from coming back your shutting the door will have you the courage to shut it are you fond enough of him not to stand in his light  fond i would die for him  will you send him to china  she sighed bitterly  have a little pity for me she said i have lost my father i have lost my mother i have lost my fortuneand now i am to lose frank you dont like women i know but try to help me with a little pity i dont say its not for his own interests to send him to china i only say its hardvery very hard on me  mr clare had been deaf to her violence insensible to her caresses blind to her tears but under the tough integument of his philosophy he had a heartand it answered that hopeless appeal it felt those touching words  i dont deny that your case is a hard one he said i dont want to make it harder i only ask you to do in franks interests what frank is too weak to do for himself its no fault of yours its no fault of minebut its not the less true that the fortune you were to have brought him has changed owners  she suddenly looked up with a furtive light in her eyes with a threatening smile on her lips  it may change owners again she said  mr clare saw the alteration in her expression and heard the tones of her voice but the words were spoken low spoken as if to herselfthey failed to reach him across the breadth of the room he stopped instantly in his walk and asked what she had said  nothing she answered turning her head away toward the window and looking out mechanically at the falling rain only my own thoughts  mr clare resumed his walk and returned to his subject  its your interest he went on as well as franks interest that he should go he may make money enough to marry you in china he cant make it here if he stops at home hell be the ruin of both of you hell shut his eyes to every consideration of prudence and pester you to marry him and when he has carried his point he will be the first to turn round afterward and complain that youre a burden on him hear me out youre in love with frankim not and i know him put you two together often enough give him time enough to hug cry pester and plead and ill tell you what the end will beyoull marry him  he had touched the right string at last it rung back in answer before he could add another word  you dont know me she said firmly you dont know what i can suffer for franks sake he shall never marry me till i can be what my father said i should bethe making of his fortune he shall take no burden when he takes me i promise you that ill be the good angel of franks life ill not go a penniless girl to him and drag him down she abruptly left her seat advanced a few steps toward mr clare and stopped in the middle of the room her arms fell helpless on either side of her and she burst into tears he shall go she said if my heart breaks in doing it ill tell him tomorrow that we must say goodby  mr clare at once advanced to meet her and held out his hand  ill help you he said frank shall hear every word that has passed between us when he comes tomorrow he shall know beforehand that he comes to say goodby  she took his hand in both her ownhesitatedlooked at himand pressed it to her bosom may i ask a favor of you before you go she said timidly he tried to take his hand from her but she knew her advantage and held it fast suppose there should be some change for the better she went on sup pose i could come to frank as my fat her said i should come to him  before she could complete the question mr clare made a second effort and withdrew his hand as your father said you should come to him he repeated looking at her attentively  yes she replied strange things happen sometimes if strange things happen to me will you let frank come back before the five years are out  what did she mean was she clinging desperately to the hope of melting michael vanstones heart mr clare could draw no other conclusion from what she had just said to him at the beginning of the interview he would have roughly dispelled her delusion at the end of the interview he left her compassionately in possession of it  you are hoping against all hope he said but if it gives you courage hope on if this impossible good fortune of yours ever happens tell me and frank shall come back in the meantime  in the meantime she interposed sadly you have my promise  once more mr clares sharp eyes searched her face attentively  i will trust your promise he said you shall see frank tomorrow  she went back thoughtfully to her chair and sat down again in silence mr clare made for the door before any formal leavetaking could pass between them deep he thought to himself as he looked back at her before he went out only eighteen and too deep for my sounding  in the hall he found norah waiting anxiously to hear what had happened  is it all over she asked does frank go to china  be careful how you manage that sister of yours said mr clare without noticing the question she has one great misfortune to contend with shes not made for the ordinary jogtrot of a womans life i dont say i can see straight to the end of the good or evil in heri only warn you her future will be no common one   an hour later mr pendril left the house and by that nights post miss garth dispatched a letter to her sister in london  the end of the first scene     between the scenes  progress of the story through the post  i  from norah vanstone to mr pendril  westmoreland house kensington  august 14th 1846  dear mr pendrilthe date of this letter will show you that the last of many hard partings is over we have left comberaven we have said farewell to home  i have been thinking seriously of what you said to me on wednesday before you went back to town i entirely agree with you that miss garth is more shaken by all she has gone through for our sakes than she is herself willing to admit and that it is my duty for the future to spare her all the anxiety that i can on the subject of my sister and myself this is very little to do for our dearest friend for our second mother such as it is i will do it with all my heart  but forgive me for saying that i am as far as ever from agreeing with you about magdalen i am so sensible in our helpless position of the importance of your assistance so anxious to be worthy of the interest of my fathers trusted adviser and oldest friend that i feel really and truly disappointed with myself for differing with youand yet i do differ magdalen is very strange very unaccountable to those who dont know her intimately i can understand that she has innocently misled you and that she has presented herself perhaps under her least favorable aspect but that the clew to her language and her conduct on wednesday last is to be found in such a feeling toward the man who has ruined us as the feeling at which you hinted is what i can not and will not believe of my sister if you knew as i do what a noble nature she has you would not be surprised at this obstinate resistance of mine to your opinion will you try to alter it i dont mind what mr clare says he believes in nothing but i attach a very serious importance to what you say and kind as i know your motives to be it distresses me to think you are doing magdalen an injustice  having relieved my mind of this confession i may now come to the proper object of my letter i promised if you could not find leisure time to visit us today to write and tell you all that happened after you left us the day has passed without our seeing you so i open my writingcase and perform my promise  i am sorry to say that three of the womenservantsthe housemaid the kitchenmaid and even our own maid to whom i am sure we have always been kindtook advantage of your having paid them their wages to pack up and go as soon as your back was turned they came to say goodby with as much ceremony and as little feeling as if they were leaving the house under ordinary circumstances the cook for all her violent temper behaved very differently she sent up a message to say that she would stop and help us to the last and thomas who has never yet been in any other place than ours spoke so gratefully of my dear fathers unvarying kindness to him and asked so anxiously to be allowed to go on serving us while his little savings lasted that magdalen and i forgot all formal considerations and both shook hands with him the poor lad went out of the room crying i wish him well i hope he will find a kind master and a good place  the long quiet rainy evening outofdoorsour last evening at comberavenwas a sad trial to us i think wintertime would have weighed less on our spirits the drawn curtains and the bright lamps and the companionable fires would have helped us we were only five in the house altogetherafter having once been so many i cant tell you how dreary the gray daylight looked toward seven oclock in the lonely rooms and on the noiseless staircase surely the prejudice in favor of long summer evenings is the prejudice of happy people we did our best we kept ourselves employed and miss garth helped us the prospect of preparing for our departure which had seemed so dreadful earlier in the day altered into the prospect of a refuge from ourselves as the evening came on we each tried at first to pack up in our own roomsbut the loneliness was more than we could bear we carried all our possessions downstairs and heaped them on the large diningtable and so made our preparations together in the same room i am sure we have taken nothing away which does not properly belong to us  having already mentioned to you my own conviction that magdalen was not herself when you saw her on wednesday i feel tempted to stop here and give you an instance in proof of what i say the little circumstance happened on wednesday night just before we went up to our rooms  after we had packed our dresses and our birthday presents our books and our music we began to sort our letters which had got confused from being placed on the table together some of my letters were mixed with magdalens and some of hers with mine among these last i found a card which had been given to my sister early in the year by an actor who managed an amateur theatrical performance in which she took a part the man had given her the card containing his name and address in the belief that she would be invited to many more amusements of the same kind and in the hope that she would recommend him as a superintendent on future occasions i only relate these trifling particulars to show you how little worth keeping such a card could be in such circumstances as ours naturally enough i threw it away from me across the table meaning to throw it on the floor it fell short close to the place in which magdalen was sitting she took it up looked at it and immediately declared that she would not have had this perfectly worthless thing destroyed for the world she was almost angry with me for having thrown it away almost angry with miss garth for asking what she could possibly want with it could there be any plainer proof than this that our misfortunesfalling so much more heavily on her than on mehave quite unhinged her and worn her out surely her words and looks are not to be interpreted against her when she is not sufficiently mistress of herself to exert her natural judgmentwhen she shows the unreasonable petulance of a child on a question which is not of the slightest importance  a little after eleven we went upstairs to try if we could get some rest  i drew aside the curtain of my window and looked out oh what a cruel last night it was no moon no stars such deep darkness that not one of the dear familiar objects in the garden was visible when i looked for them such deep stillness that even my own movements about the room almost frightened me i tried to lie down and sleep but the sense of loneliness came again and quite overpowered me you will say i am old enough at sixandtwenty to have exerted more control over myself i hardly know how it happened but i stole into magdalens room just as i used to steal into it years and years ago when we were children she was not in bed she was sitting with her writing materials before her thinking i said i wanted to be with her the last night and she kissed me and told me to lie down and promised soon to follow me my mind was a little quieted and i fell asleep it was daylight when i wokeand the first sight i saw was magdalen still sitting in the chair and still thinking she had never been to bed she had not slept all through the night  i shall sleep when we have left comberaven she said i shall be better when it is all over and i have bid frank goodby she had in her hand our fathers will and the letter he wrote to you and when she had done speaking she gave them into my possession i was the eldest she said and those last precious relics ought to be in my keeping i tried to propose to her that we should divide them but she shook her head i have copied for myself was her answer all that he says of us in the will and all that he says in the letter she told me this and took from her bosom a tiny white silk bag which she had made in the night and in which she had put the extracts so as to keep them always about her this tells me in his own words what his last wishes were for both of us she said and this is all i want for the future  these are trifles to dwell on and i am almost surprised at myself for not feeling ashamed to trouble you with them but since i have known what your early connection was with my father and mother i have learned to think of you and i suppose to write to you as an old friend and besides i have it so much at heart to change your opinion of magdalen that i cant help telling you the smallest things about her which may in my judgment end in making you think of her as i do  when breakfasttime came on thursday morning we were surprised to find a strange letter on the table perhaps i ought to mention it to you in case of any future necessity for your interference it was addressed to miss garth on paper with the deepest mourningborder round it and the writer was the same man who followed us on our way home from a walk one day last springcaptain wragge his object appears to be to assert once more his audacious claim to a family connection with my poor mother under cover of a letter of condolence which it is an insolence in such a person to have written at all he expresses as much sympathyon his discovery of our affliction in the newspaperas if he had been really intimate with us and he begs to know in a postscript being evidently in total ignorance of all that has really happened whether it is thought desirable that he should be present among the other relatives at the reading of the will the address he gives at which letters will reach him for the next fortnight is postoffice birmingham this is all i have to tell you on the subject both the letter and the writer seem to me to be equally unworthy of the slightest notice on our part or on yours  after breakfast magdalen left us and went by herself into the morningroom the weather being still showery we had arranged that francis clare should see her in that room when he presented himself to take his leave i was upstairs when he came and i remained upstairs for more than half an hour afterward sadly anxious as you may well believe on magdalens account  at the end of the halfhour or more i came downstairs as i reached the landing i suddenly heard her voice raised entreatingly and calling on him by his namethen loud sobsthen a frightful laughing and screaming both together that rang through the house i instantly ran into the room and found magdalen on the sofa in violent hysterics and frank standing staring at her with a lowering angry face biting his nails  i felt so indignantwithout knowing plainly why for i was ignorant of course of what had passed at the interviewthat i took mr francis clare by the shoulders and pushed him out of the room i am careful to tell you how i acted toward him and what led to it because i understand that he is excessively offended with me and that he is likely to mention elsewhere what he calls my unladylike violence toward him if he should mention it to you i am anxious to acknowledge of my own accord that i forgot myselfnot i hope you will think without some provocation  i pushed him into the hall leaving magdalen for the moment to miss garths care instead of going away he sat down sulkily on one of the hall chairs may i ask the reason of this extraordinary violence he inquired with an injured look no i said you will be good enough to imagine the reason for yourself and to leave us immediately if you please he sat doggedly in the chair biting his nails and considering what have i done to be treated in this unfeeling manner he asked after a while i can enter into no discussion with you i answered i can only request you to leave us if you persist in waiting to see my sister again i will go to the cottage myself and appeal to your father he got up in a great hurry at those words i have been infamously used in this business he said all the hardships and the sacrifices have fallen to my share im the only one among you who has any heart all the rest are as hard as stonesmagdalen included in one breath she says she loves me and in another she tells me to go to china what have i done to be treated with this heartless inconsistency i am consistent myselfi only want to stop at homeand whats the consequence youre all against me in that manner he grumbled his way down the steps and so i saw the last of him this was all that passed between us if he gives you any other account of it what he says will be false he made no attempt to return an hour afterward his father came alone to say goodby he saw miss garth and me but not magdalen and he told us he would take the necessary measures with your assistance for having his son properly looked after in london and seen safely on board the vessel when the time came it was a short visit and a sad leavetaking even mr clare was sorry though he tried hard to hide it  we had barely two hours after mr clare had left us before it would be time to go i went back to magdalen and found her quieter and better though terribly pale and exhausted and oppressed as i fancied by thoughts which she could not prevail on herself to communicate she would tell me nothing thenshe has told me nothing sinceof what passed between herself and francis clare when i spoke of him angrily feeling as i did that he had distressed and tortured her when she ought to have had all the encouragement and comfort from him that man could give she refused to hear me she made the kindest allowances and the sweetest excuses for him and laid all the blame of the dreadful state in which i had found her entirely on herself was i wrong in telling you that she had a noble nature and wont you alter your opinion when you read these lines  we had no friends to come and bid us goodby and our few acquaintances were too far from usperhaps too indifferent about usto call we employed the little leisure left in going over the house together for the last time we took leave of our old schoolroom our bedrooms the room where our mother died the little study where our father used to settle his accounts and write his lettersfeeling toward them in our forlorn condition as other girls might have felt at parting with old friends from the house in a gleam of fine weather we went into the garden and gathered our last nosegay with the purpose of drying the flowers when they begin to wither and keeping them in remembrance of the happy days that are gone when we had said goodby to the garden there was only half an hour left we went together to the grave we knelt down side by side in silence and kissed the sacred ground i thought my heart would have broken august was the month of my mothers birthday and this time last year my father and magdalen and i were all consulting in secret what present we could make to surprise her with on the birthday morning  if you had seen how magdalen suffered you would never doubt her again i had to take her from the last restingplace of our father and mother almost by force before we were out of the churchyard she broke from me and ran back she dropped on her knees at the grave tore up from it passionately a handful of grass and said something to herself at the same moment which though i followed her instantly i did not get near enough to hear she turned on me in such a frenzied manner when i tried to raise her from the groundshe looked at me with such a fearful wildness in her eyesthat i felt absolutely terrified at the sight of her to my relief the paroxysm left her as suddenly as it had come she thrust away the tuft of grass into the bosom of her dress and took my arm and hurried with me out of the churchyard i asked her why she had gone backi asked what those words were which she had spoken at the grave a promise to our dead father she answered with a momentary return of the wild look and the frenzied manner which had startled me already i was afraid to agitate her by saying more i left all other questions to be asked at a fitter and a quieter time you will understand from this how terribly she suffers how wildly and strangely she acts under violent agitation and you will not interpret against her what she said or did when you saw her on wednesday last  we only returned to the house in time to hasten away from it to the train perhaps it was better for us sobetter that we had only a moment left to look back before the turn in the road hid the last of comberaven from our view there was not a soul we knew at the station nobody to stare at us nobody to wish us goodby the rain came on again as we took our seats in the train what we felt at the sight of the railwaywhat horrible remembrances it forced on our minds of the calamity which has made us fatherlessi cannot and dare not tell you i have tried anxiously not to write this letter in a gloomy tone not to return all your kindness to us by distressing you with our grief perhaps i have dwelt too long already on the little story of our parting from home i can only say in excuse that my heart is full of it and what is not in my heart my pen wont write  we have been so short a time in our new abode that i have nothing more to tell youexcept that miss garths sister has received us with the heartiest kindness she considerately leaves us to ourselves until we are fitter than we are now to think of our future plans and to arrange as we best can for earning our own living the house is so large and the position of our rooms has been so thoughtfully chosen that i should hardly knowexcept when i hear the laughing of the younger girls in the gardenthat we were living in a school  with kindest and best wishes from miss garth and my sister believe me dear mr pendril gratefully yours  norah vanstone   ii  from miss garth to mr pendril  westmoreland house kensington  september 23d 1846  my dear siri write these lines in such misery of mind as no words can describe magdalen has deserted us at an early hour this morning she secretly left the house and she has not been heard of since  i would come and speak to you personally but i dare not leave norah i must try to control myself i must try to write  nothing happened yesterday to prepare me or to prepare norah for this lasti had almost said this worstof all our afflictions the only alteration we either of us noticed in the unhappy girl was an alteration for the better when we parted for the night she kissed me which she has not done latterly and she burst out crying when she embraced her sister next we had so little suspicion of the truth that we thought these signs of renewed tenderness and affection a promise of better things for the future  this morning when her sister went into her room it was empty and a note in her handwriting addressed to norah was lying on the dressingtable i cannot prevail on norah to part with the note i can only send you the inclosed copy of it you will see that it affords no clew to the direction she has taken  knowing the value of time in this dreadful emergency i examined her room and with my sisters help questioned the servants immediately on the news of her absence reaching me her wardrobe was empty and all her boxes but one which she has evidently taken away with her are empty too we are of opinion that she has privately turned her dresses and jewelry into money that she had the one trunk she took with her removed from the house yesterday and that she left us this morning on foot the answers given by one of the servants are so unsatisfactory that we believe the woman has been bribed to assist her and has managed all those arrangements for her flight which she could not have safely undertaken by herself  of the immediate object with which she has left us i entertain no doubt  i have reasons which i can tell you at a fitter time for feeling assured that she has gone away with the intention of trying her fortune on the stage she has in her possession the card of an actor by profession who superintended an amateur theatrical performance at clifton in which she took part and to him she has gone to help her i saw the card at the time and i know the actors name to be huxtable the address i cannot call to mind quite so correctly but i am almost sure it was at some theatrical place in bow street covent garden let me entreat you not to lose a moment in sending to make the necessary inquiries the first trace of her will i firmly believe be found at that address  if we had nothing worse to dread than her attempting to go on the stage i should not feel the distress and dismay which now overpower me hundreds of other girls have acted as recklessly as she has acted and have not ended ill after all but my fears for magdalen do not begin and end with the risk she is running at present  there has been something weighing on her mind ever since we left comberavenweighing far more heavily for the last six weeks than at first until the period when francis clare left england i am persuaded she was secretly sustained by the hope that he would contrive to see her again from the day when she knew that the measures you had taken for preventing this had succeeded from the day when she was assured that the ship had really taken him away nothing has roused nothing has interested her she has given herself up more and more hopelessly to her own brooding thoughts thoughts which i believe first entered her mind on the day when the utter ruin of the prospects on which her marriage depended was made known to her she has formed some desperate project of contesting the possession of her fathers fortune with michael vanstone and the stage career which she has gone away to try is nothing more than a means of freeing herself from all home dependence and of enabling her to run what mad risks she pleases in perfect security from all home control what it costs me to write of her in these terms i must leave you to imagine the time has gone by when any consideration of distress to my own feelings can weigh with me whatever i can say which will open your eyes to the real danger and strengthen your conviction of the instant necessity of averting it i say in despite of myself without hesitation and without reserve  one word more and i have done  the last time you were so good as to come to this house do you remember how magdalen embarrassed and distressed us by questioning you about her right to bear her fathers name do you remember her persisting in her inquiries until she had forced you to acknowledge that legally speaking she and her sister had no name i venture to remind you of this because you have the affairs of hundreds of clients to think of and you might well have forgotten the circumstance whatever natural reluctance she might otherwise have had to deceiving us and degrading herself by the use of an assumed name that conversation with you is certain to have removed we must discover her by personal descriptionwe can trace her in no other way  i can think of nothing more to guide your decision in our deplorable emergency for gods sake let no expense and no efforts be spared my letter ought to reach you by ten oclock this morning at the latest let me have one line in answer to say you will act instantly for the best my only hope of quieting norah is to show her a word of encouragement from your pen believe me dear sir yours sincerely and obliged  harriet garth   iii  from magdalen to norah inclosed in the preceding letter  my darlingtry to forgive me i have struggled against myself till i am worn out in the effort i am the wretchedest of living creatures our quiet life here maddens me i can bear it no longer i must go if you knew what my thoughts are if you knew how hard i have fought against them and how horribly they have gone on haunting me in the lonely quiet of this house you would pity and forgive me oh my love dont feel hurt at my not opening my heart to you as i ought i dare not open it i dare not show myself to you as i really am  pray dont send and seek after me i will write and relieve all your anxieties you know norah we must get our living for ourselves i have only gone to get mine in the manner which is fittest for me whether i succeed or whether i fail i can do myself no harm either way i have no position to lose and no name to degrade dont doubt i love youdont let miss garth doubt my gratitude i go away miserable at leaving you but i must go if i had loved you less dearly i might have had the courage to say this in your presencebut how could i trust myself to resist your persuasions and to bear the sight of your distress farewell my darling take a thousand kisses from me my own best dearest love till we meet again  magdalen   iv  from sergeant bulmer of the detective police to mr pendril  scotland yard september 29th 1846  siryour clerk informs me that the parties interested in our inquiry after the missing young lady are anxious for news of the same i went to your office to speak to you about the matter today not having found you and not being able to return and try again tomorrow i write these lines to save delay and to tell you how we stand thus far  i am sorry to say no advance has been made since my former report the trace of the young lady which we found nearly a week since still remains the last trace discovered of her this case seems a mighty simple one looked at from a distance looked at close it alters very considerably for the worse and becomes to speak the plain trutha poser  this is how we now stand  we have traced the young lady to the theatrical agents in bow street we know that at an early hour on the morning of the twentythird the agent was called downstairs while he was dressing to speak to a young lady in a cab at the door we know that on her production of mr huxtables card he wrote on it mr huxtables address in the country and heard her order the cabman to drive to the great northern terminus we believe she left by the nine oclock train we followed her by the twelve oclock train we have ascertained that she called at halfpast two at mr huxtables lodgings that she found he was away and not expected back till eight in the evening that she left word she would call again at eight and that she never returned mr huxtables statement ishe and the young lady have never set eyes on each other the first consideration which follows is this are we to believe mr huxtable i have carefully inquired into his character i know as much or more about him than he knows about himself and my opinion is that we are to believe him to the best of my knowledge he is a perfectly honest man  here then is the hitch in the case the young lady sets out with a certain object before her instead of going on to the accomplishment of that object she stops short of it why has she stopped and where those are unfortunately just the questions which we cant answer yet  my own opinion of the matter is briefly as follows i dont think she has met with any serious accident serious accidents in nine cases out of ten discover themselves my own notion is that she has fallen into the hands of some person or persons interested in hiding her away and sharp enough to know how to set about it whether she is in their charge with or without her own consent is more than i can undertake to say at present i dont wish to raise false hopes or false fears i wish to stop short at the opinion i have given already  in regard to the future i may tell you that i have left one of my men in daily communication with the authorities i have also taken care to have the handbills offering a reward for the discovery of her widely circulated lastly i have completed the necessary arrangements for seeing the playbills of all country theaters and for having the dramatic companies well looked after some years since this would have cost a serious expenditure of time and money luckily for our purpose the country theaters are in a bad way excepting the large cities hardly one of them is open and we can keep our eye on them with little expense and less difficulty  these are the steps which i think it needful to take at present if you are of another opinion you have only to give me your directions and i will carefully attend to the same i dont by any means despair of our finding the young lady and bringing her back to her friends safe and well please to tell them so and allow me to subscribe myself yours respectfully  abraham bulmer  v  anonymous letter addressed to mr pendril  sira word to the wise the friends of a certain young lady are wasting time and money to no purpose your confidential clerk and your detective policeman are looking for a needle in a bottle of hay this is the ninth of october and they have not found her yet they will as soon find

york which is situated on the western bank of the ouse there is a narrow street called skeldergate running nearly north and south parallel with the course of the river the postern by which skeldergate was formerly approached no longer exists and the few old houses left in the street are disguised in melancholy modern costume of whitewash and cement shops of the smaller and poorer order intermixed here and there with dingy warehouses and joyless private residences of red brick compose the present a spect of skeldergate on the riverside the houses are separated at intervals by lanes running down

trees the meadows the publicwalk on one bank and the towingpath on the other open to view  here where the street ends and on the side of it furthest from the river a narrow little lane leads up to the paved footway surmounting the ancient walls of york the one small row of buildings which is all that the lane possesses is composed of cheap lodginghouses with an opposite view at the distance of a few feet of a portion of the massive city wall this place is called rosemary lane very little light enters it very few people live in it the floating population of skeldergate passes it by and visitors to the walk on the walls who use it as the way up or the way down get out of the dreary little passage as fast as they can  the door of one of the houses in this lost corner of york opened softly on the evening of the twentythird of september eighteen hundred and fortysix and a solitary individual of the male sex sauntered into skeldergate from the seclusion of rosemary lane  turning northward this person directed his steps toward the bridge over the ouse and the busy center of the city he bore the external appearance of respectable poverty he carried a gingham umbrella preserved in an oilskin case he picked his steps with the neatest avoidance of all dirty places on the pavement and he surveyed the scene around him with eyes of two different colorsa bilious brown eye on the lookout for employment and a bilious green eye in a similar predicament in plainer terms the stranger from rosemary lane was no other thancaptain wragge  outwardly speaking the captain had not altered for the better since the memorable spring day when he had presented himself to miss garth at the lodgegate at comberaven the railway mania of that famous year had attacked even the wary wragge had withdrawn him from his customary pursuits and had left him prostrate in the end like many a better man he had lost his clerical appearancehe had faded with the autumn leaves his crape hatband had put itself in brown mourning for its own bereavement of black his dingy white collar and cravat had died the death of old linen and had gone to their long home at the papermakers to live again one day in quires at a stationers shop a gray shootingjacket in the last stage of woolen atrophy replaced the black frockcoat of former times and like a faithful servant kept the dark secret of its masters linen from the eyes of a prying world from top to toe every square inch of the captains clothing was altered for the worse but the man himself remained unchangedsuperior to all forms of moral mildew impervious to the action of social rust he was as courteous as persuasive as blandly dignified as ever he carried his head as high without a shirtcollar as ever he had carried it with one the threadbare black handkerchief round his neck was perfectly tied his rotten old shoes were neatly blacked he might have compared chins in the matter of smooth shaving with the highest church dignitary in york time change and poverty had all attacked the captain together and had all failed alike to get him down on the ground he paced the streets of york a man superior to clothes and circumstanceshis vagabond varnish as bright on him as ever  arrived at the bridge captain wragge stopped and looked idly over the parapet at the barges in the river it was plainly evident that he had no particular destination to reach and nothing whatever to do while he was still loitering the clock of york minster chimed the halfhour past five cabs rattled by him over the bridge on their way to meet the train from london at twenty minutes to six after a moments hesitation the captain sauntered after the cabs when it is one of a mans regular habits to live upon his fellowcreatures that man is always more or less fond of haunting large railway stations captain wragge gleaned the human field and on that unoccupied afternoon the york terminus was as likely a corner to look about in as any other  he reached the platform a few minutes after the train had arrived that entire incapability of devising administrative measures for the management of large crowds which is one of the characteristics of englishmen in authority is nowhere more strikingly exemplified than at york three different lines of railway assemble three passenger mobs from morning to night under one roof and leave them to raise a travelers riot with all the assistance which the bewildered servants of the company can render to increase the confusion the customary disturbance was rising to its climax as captain wragge approached the platform dozens of different people were trying to attain dozens of different objects in dozens of different directions all starting from the same common point and all equally deprived of the means of information a sudden parting of the crowd near the secondclass carriages attracted the captains curiosity he pushed his way in and found a decentlydressed manassisted by a porter and a policemanattempting to pick up some printed bills scattered from a paper parcel which his frenzied fellowpassengers had knocked out of his hand  offering his assistance in this emergency with the polite alacrity which marked his character captain wragge observed the three startling words fifty pounds reward printed in capital letters on the bills which he assisted in recovering and instantly secreted one of them to be more closely examined at the first convenient opportunity as he crumpled up the bill in the palm of his hand his partycolored eyes fixed with hungry interest on the proprietor of the unlucky parcel when a man happens not to be possessed of fifty pence in his own pocket if his heart is in the right place it bounds if his mouth is properly constituted it waters at the sight of another man who carries about with him a printed offer of fifty pounds sterling addressed to his fellowcreatures  the unfortunate traveler wrapped up his parcel as he best might and made his way off the platform after addressing an inquiry to the first official victim of the days passengertraffic who was sufficiently in possession of his senses to listen to it leaving the station for the riverside which was close at hand the stranger entered the ferryboat at the north street postern the captain who had carefully dogged his steps thus far entered the boat also and employed the short interval of transit to the opposite bank in a perusal of the handbill which he had kept for his own private enlightenment with his back carefully turned on the traveler captain wragge now possessed his mind of the following lines  fifty pounds reward  left her home in london early on the morning of september 23d 1846 a young lady ageeighteen dressdeep mourning personal appearancehair of a very light brown eyebrows and eyelashes darker eyes light gray complexion strikingly pale lower part of her face large and full tall upright figure walks with remarkable grace and ease speaks with openness and resolution has the manners and habits of a refined cultivated lady personal markstwo little moles close together on the left side of the neck mark on the underclothingmagdalen vanstone is supposed to have joined or attempted to join under an assumed name a theatrical company now performing at york had when she left london one black box and no other luggage whoever will give such information as will restore her to her friends shall receive the above reward apply at the office of mr harkness solicitor coney street york or to messrs wyatt pendril and gwilt serle street lincolns inn london   accustomed as captain wragge was to keep the completest possession of himself in all hum an emergencies his own profound astonishment when the course of his reading brought him to the mark on the linen of the missing young lady betrayed him into an exclamation of surprise which even startled the ferryman the traveler was less observant his whole attention was fixed on the opposite bank of the river and he left the boat hastily the moment it touched the landingplace captain wragge recovered himself pocketed the handbill and followed his leader for the second time  the stranger directed his steps to the nearest street which ran down to the river compared a note in his pocketbook with the numbers of the houses on the lefthand side stopped at one of them and rang the bell the captain went on to the next house affected to ring the bell in his turn and stood with his back to the travelerin appearance waiting to be let in in reality listening with all his might for any scraps of dialogue which might reach his ears on the opening of the door behind him  the door was answered with all due alacrity and a sufficiently instructive interchange of question and answer on the threshold rewarded the dexterity of captain wragge  does mr huxtable live here asked the traveler  yes sir was the answer in a womans voice  is he at home  not at home now sir but he will be in again at eight tonight  i think a young lady called here early in the day did she not  yes a young lady came this afternoon  exactly i come on the same business did she see mr huxtable  no sir he has been away all day the young lady told me she would come back at eight oclock  just so i will call and see mr huxtable at the same time  any name sir  no say a gentleman called on theatrical businessthat will be enough wait one minute if you please i am a stranger in york will you kindly tell me which is the way to coney street  the woman gave the required information the door closed and the stranger hastened away in the direction of coney street  on this occasion captain wragge made no attempt to follow him the handbill revealed plainly enough that the mans next object was to complete the necessary arrangements with the local solicitor on the subject of the promised reward  having seen and heard enough for his immediate purpose the captain retraced his steps down the street turned to the right and entered on the esplanade which in that quarter of the city borders the riverside between the swimmingbaths and lendal tower this is a family matter said captain wragge to himself persisting from sheer force of habit in the old assertion of his relationship to magdalens mother i must consider it in all its bearings he tucked the umbrella under his arm crossed his hands behind him and lowered himself gently into the abyss of his own reflections the order and propriety observable in the captains shabby garments accurately typified the order and propriety which distinguished the operations of the captains mind it was his habit always to see his way before him through a neat succession of alternativesand so he saw it now  three courses were open to him in connection with the remarkable discovery which he had just made the first course was to do nothing in the matter at all inadmissible on family grounds equally inadmissible on pecuniary grounds rejected accordingly the second course was to deserve the gratitude of the young ladys friends rated at fifty pounds the third course was by a timely warning to deserve the gratitude of the young lady herself ratedat an unknown figure between these two last alternatives the wary wragge hesitated not from doubt of magdalens pecuniary resourcesfor he was totally ignorant of the circumstances which had deprived the sisters of their inheritancebut from doubt whether an obstacle in the shape of an undiscovered gentleman might not be privately connected with her disappearance from home after mature reflection he determined to pause and be guided by circumstances in the meantime the first consideration was to be beforehand with the messenger from london and to lay hands securely on the young lady herself  i feel for this misguided girl mused the captain solemnly strutting backward and forward by the lonely riverside i always have looked upon heri always shall look upon herin the light of a niece  where was the adopted relative at that moment in other words how was a young lady in magdalens critical position likely to while away the hours until mr huxtable s return if there was an obstructive gentleman in the background it would be mere waste of time to pursue the question but if the inference which the handbill suggested was correctif she was really alone at that moment in the city of yorkwhere was she likely to be  not in the crowded thoroughfares to begin with not viewing the objects of interest in the minster for it was now past the hour at which the cathedral could be seen was she in the waitingroom at the railway she would hardly run that risk was she in one of the hotels doubtful considering that she was entirely by herself in a pastrycooks shop far more likely driving about in a cab possible certainly but no more loitering away the time in some quiet locality outofdoors likely enough again on that fine autumn evening the captain paused weighed the relative claims on his attention of the quiet locality and the pastrycooks shop and decided for the first of the two there was time enough to find her at the pastrycooks to inquire after her at the principal hotels or finally to intercept her in mr huxtables immediate neighborhood from seven to eight while the light lasted the wise course was to use it in looking for her outofdoors where the esplanade was a quiet locality but she was not therenot on the lonely road beyond which ran back by the abbey wall where next the captain stopped looked across the river brightened under the influence of a new idea and suddenly hastened back to the ferry  the walk on the walls thought this judicious man with a twinkle of his partycolored eyes the quietest place in york and the place that every stranger goes to see  in ten minutes more captain wragge was exploring the new field of search he mounted to the walls which inclose the whole western portion of the city by the north street postern from which the walk winds round until it ends again at its southernly extremity in the narrow passage of rosemary lane it was then twenty minutes to seven the sun had set more than half an hour since the red light lay broad and low in the cloudless western heaven all visible objects were softening in the tender twilight but were not darkening yet the first few lamps lit in the street below looked like faint little specks of yellow light as the captain started on his walk through one of the most striking scenes which england can show  on his right hand as he set forth stretched the open country beyond the wallsthe rich green meadows the boundarytrees dividing them the broad windings of the river in the distance the scattered buildings nearer to view all wrapped in the evening stillness all made beautiful by the evening peace on his left hand the majestic west front of york minster soared over the city and caught the last brightest light of heaven on the summits of its lofty towers had this noble prospect tempted the lost girl to linger and look at it no thus far not a sign of her the captain looked round him attentively and walked on  he reached the spot where the iron course of the railroad strikes its way through arches in the old wall he paused at this placewhere the central activity of a great railway enterprise beats with all the pulses of its loudclanging life side by side with the dead majesty of the past deep under the old historic stones which tell of fortified york and the sieges of two centuries sincehe stood on this spot and searched for her again and searched in vain others were looking idly down at the desolate activity on the wilderness of the iron rails but she was not among them the captain glanced doubtfully at the darkening sky and walked on  he stopped again where the postern of micklegate still stands and still strengthens the city wall as of old here the paved walk descends a few steps passes through the dark stone guardroom of the ancient gate ascends again and continues its course southward until the walls reach the river once more he paused and peered anxiously into the dim inner corners of the old guardroom was she waiting there for the darkness to come and hide her from prying eyes no a solitary workman loitered through the stone chamber but no other living creature stirred in the place the captain mounted the steps which led out from the postern and walked on  he advanced some fifty or sixty yards along the paved footway the outlying suburbs of york on one side of him a ropewalk and some patches of kitchen garden occupying a vacant strip of ground on the other he advanced with eager eyes and quickened step for he saw before him the lonely figure of a woman standing by the parapet of the wall with her face set toward the westward view he approached cautiously to make sure of her before she turned and observed him there was no mistaking that tall dark figure as it rested against the parapet with a listless grace there she stood in her long black cloak and gown the last dim light of evening falling tenderly on her pale resolute young face there she stoodnot three months since the spoiled darling of her parents the priceless treasure of the household never left unprotected never trusted alonethere she stood in the lovely dawn of her womanhood a castaway in a strange city wrecked on the world  vagabond as he was the first sight of her staggered even the dauntless assurance of captain wragge as she slowly turned her face and looked at him he raised his hat with the nearest approach to respect which a long life of unblushing audacity had left him capable of making  i think i have the honor of addressing the younger miss vanstone he began deeply gratified i am surefor more reasons than one  she looked at him with a cold surprise no recollection of the day when he had followed her sister and herself on their way home with miss garth rose in her memory while he now confronted her with his altered manner and his altered dress  you are mistaken she said quietly you are a perfect stranger to me  pardon me replied the captain i am a species of relation i had the pleasure of seeing you in the spring of the present year i presented myself on that memorable occasion to an honored preceptress in your late fathers family permit me under equally agreeable circumstances to present myself to you my name is wragge  by this time he had recovered complete possession of his own impudence his partycolored eyes twinkled cheerfully and he accompanied his modest announcement of himself with a dancingmasters bow  magdalen frowned and drew back a step the captain was not a man to be daunted by a cold reception he tucked his umbrella under his arm and jocosely spelled his name for her further enlightenment w r a double g ewragge said the captain ticking off the letters persuasively on his fingers  i remember your name said magdalen excuse me for leaving you abruptly i have an engagement  she tried to pass him and walk on northward toward the railway he instantly met the attempt by raising both hands and displaying a pair of darned black gloves outspread in polite protest  not that way he said not that way miss vanstone i beg and entreat  why not she asked haughtily  because answered the captain that is the way which leads to mr huxtables  in the ungovernable astonishment of hearing his reply she suddenly bent forward and for the first time looked him close in the face he sustained her suspicious scrutiny with every appearance of feeling highly gratified by it h u xhux said the captain playfully turning to the old joke t ata huxta b l eble huxtable  what do you know about mr huxtable she asked what do you mean by mentioning him to me  the captains curly lip took a new twist upward he immediately replied to the best practical purpose by producing the handbill from his pocket  there is just light enough left he said for young and lovely eyes to read by before i enter upon the personal statement which your flattering inquiry claims from me pray bestow a moments attention on this document  she took the handbill from him by the last gleam of twilight she read the lines which set a price on her recoverywhich published the description of her in pitiless print like the description of a strayed dog no tender consideration had prepared her for the shock no kind word softened it to her when it came the vagabond whose cunning eyes watched her eagerly while she read knew no more that the handbill which he had stolen had only been prepared in anticipation of the worst and was only to be publicly used in the event of all more considerate means of tracing her being tried in vainthan she knew it the bill dropped from her hand her face flushed deeply she turned away from captain wragge as if all idea of his existence had passed out of her mind  oh norah norah she said to herself sorrowfully after the letter i wrote youafter the hard struggle i had to go away oh norah norah  how is norah inquired the captain with the utmost politeness  she turned upon him with an angry brightness in her large gray eyes is this thing shown publicly she asked stamping her foot on it is the mark on my neck described all over york  pray compose yourself pleaded the persuasive wragge at present i have every reason to believe that you have just perused the only copy in circulation allow me to pick it up  before he could touch the bill she snatched it from the pavement tore it into fragments and threw them over the wall  bravo cried the captain you remind me of your poor dear mother the family spirit miss vanstone we all inherit our hot blood from my maternal grandfather  how did you come by it she asked suddenly  my dear creature i have just told you remonstrated the captain we all come by it from my maternal grandfather  how did you come by that handbill she repeated passionately  i beg ten thousand pardons my head was running on the family spirithow did i come by it briefly thus here captain wragge entered on his personal statement taking his customary vocal exercise through the longest words of the english language with the highest elocutionary relish having on this rare occasion nothing to gain by concealment he departed from his ordinary habits and with the utmost amazement at the novelty of his own situation permitted himself to tell the unmitigated truth  the effect of the narrative on magdalen by no means fulfilled captain wragges anticipations in relating it she was not startled she was not irritated she showed no disposition to cast herself on his mercy and to seek his advice she looked him steadily in the face and all she said when he had neatly rounded his last sentence wasgo on  go on repeated the captain shocked to disappoint you i am sure but the fact is i have done  no you have not she rejoined you have left out the end of your story the end of it is you came here to look for me and you mean to earn the fifty pounds reward  those plain words so completely staggered captain wragge that for the moment he stood speechless but he had faced awkward truths of all sorts far too often to be permanently disconcerted by them before magdalen could pursue her advantage the vagabond had recovered his balance wragge was himself again  smart said the captain laughing indulgently and drumming with his umbrella on the pavement some men might take it seriously im not easily offended try again  magdalen looked at him through the gathering darkness in mute perplexity all her little experience of society had been experience among people who possessed a common sense of honor and a common responsibility of social position she had hitherto seen nothing but the successful human product from the great manufactory of civilization here was one of the failures and with all her quickness she was puzzled how to deal with it  pardon me for returning to the subject pursued the captain it has just occurred to my mind that you might actually have spoken in earnest my poor child how can i earn the fifty pounds before the reward is offered to me those handbills may not be publicly posted for a week to come precious as you are to all your relatives myself included take my word for it the lawyers who are managing this case will not pay fifty pounds for you if they can possibly help it are you still persuaded that my needy pockets are gaping for the money very good button them up in spite of me with your own fair fingers there is a train to london at nine fortyfive tonight submit yourself to your friends wishes and go back by it  never said magdalen firing at the bare suggestion exactly as the captain had intended she should if my mind had not been made up before that vile handbill would have decided me i forgive norah she added turning away and speaking to herself but not mr pendril and not miss garth  quite right said captain wragge the family spirit i should have done the same myself at your age it runs in the blood hark there goes the clock againhalfpast seven miss vanstone pardon this seasonable abruptness if you are to carry out your resolutionif you are to be your own mistress much longer you must take a course of some kind before eight oclock you are young you are inexperienced you are in imminent danger here is a position of emergency on one sideand here am i on the other with an uncles interest in you full of advice tap me  suppose i choose to depend on nobody and to act for myself said magdalen what then  then replied the captain you will walk straight into one of the four traps which are set to catch you in the ancient and interesting city of york trap the first at mr huxtables house trap the second at all the hotels trap the third at the railway station trap the fourth at the theater that man with the handbills has had an hour at his disposal if he has not set those four traps with the assistance of the local solicitor by this time he is not the competent lawyers clerk i take him for come come my dear girl if there is somebody else in the background whose advice you prefer to mine  you see that i am alone she interposed proudly if you knew me better you would know that i depend on nobody but myself  those words decided the only doubt which now remained in the captains mindthe doubt whether the course was clear before him the motive of her flight from home was evidently what the handbills assumed it to bea reckless fancy for going on the stage one of two things thought wragge to himself in his logical way shes worth more than fifty pounds to me in her present situation or she isnt if she is her friends may whistle for her if she isnt i have only to keep her till the bills are posted fortified by this simple plan of action the captain returned to the charge and politely placed magdalen between the two inevitable alternatives of trusting herself to him on the one hand or of returning to her friends on the other  i respect independence of character wherever i find it he said with an air of virtuous severity in a young and lovely relative i more than respecti admire it but excuse the bold assertion to walk on a way of your own you must first have a way to walk on under existing circumstances where is your way mr huxtable is out of the question to begin with  out of the question for tonight said magdalen but what hinders me from writing to mr huxtable and making my own private arrangements with him for tomorrow  granted with all my hearta hit a palpable hit now for my turn to get to tomorrow excuse the bold assertion once more you must first pass through tonight where are you to sleep  are there no hotels in york  excellent hotels for large families excellent hotels for single gentlemen the very worst hotels in the world for handsome young ladies who present themselves alone at the door without male escort without a maid in attendance and without a single article of luggage dark as it is i think i could see a ladys box if there was anything of the sort in our immediate neighborhood  my box is at the cloakroom what is to prevent my sending the ticket for it  nothingif you want to communicate your address by means of your boxnothing whatever think pray think do you really suppose that the people who are looking for you are such fools as not to have an eye on the cloakroom do you think they are such foolswhen they find you dont come to mr huxtables at eight tonightas not to inquire at all the hotels do you think a young lady of your striking appearance even if they consented to receive you could take up her abode at an inn without becoming the subject of universal curiosity and remark here is night coming on as fast as it can dont let me bore you only let me ask once morewhere are you to sleep  there was no answer to that question in magdalens position there was literally no answer to it on her side she was silent  where are you to sleep repeated the captain the reply is obviousunder my roof mrs wragge will be charmed to see you look upon her as your aunt pray look upon her as your aunt the landlady is a widow the house is close by there are no other lodgers and there is a bedroom to let can anything be more satisfactory under all the circumstances pray observe i say nothing about tomorrowi leave tomorrow to you and confine myself exclusively to the night i may or may not command theatrical facilities which i am in a position to offer you sympathy and admiration may or may not be strong within me when i contemplate the dash and independence of your character hosts of examples of bright stars of the british drama who have begun their apprenticeship to the stage as you are beginning yours may or may not crowd on my memory these are topics for the future for the present i confine myself within my strict range of duty we are within five minutes walk of my present address allow me to offer you my arm no you hesitate you distrust me good heavens is it possible you can have heard anything to my disadvantage  quite possible said magdalen without a moments flinching from the answer  may i inquire the particulars asked the captain with the politest composure dont spare my feelings oblige me by speaking out in the plainest terms now what have you heard  she answered him with a womans desperate disregard of consequences when she is driven to bayshe answered him instantly  i have heard you are a rogue  have you indeed said the impenetrable wragge a rogue well i waive my privilege of setting you right on that point for a fitter time for the sake of argument let us say i am a rogue what is mr huxtable  a respectable man or i should not have seen him in the house where we first met  very good now observe you talked of writing to mr huxtable a minute ago what do you think a respectable man is likely to do with a young lady who openly acknowledges that she has run away from her home and her friends to go on the stage my dear girl on your own showing its not a respectable man you want in your present predicament its a roguelike me  magdalen laughed bitterly  there is some truth in that she said thank you for recalling me to myself and my circumstances i have my end to gainand who am i to pick and choose the way of getting to it it is my turn to beg pardon now i have been talking as if i was a young lady of family and position absurd we know better than that dont we captain wragge you are quite right nobodys child must sleep under somebodys roofand why not yours  this way said the captain dexterously profiting by the sudden change in her humor and cunningly refraining from exasperating it by saying more himself this way  she followed him a few steps and suddenly stopped  suppose i am discovered she broke out abruptly who has any authority over me who can take me back if i dont choose to go if they all find me tomorrow what then cant i say no to mr pendril cant i trust my own courage with miss garth  can you trust your courage with your sister whispered the captain who had not forgotten the references to norah which had twice escaped her already  her head drooped she shivered as if the cold night air had struck her and leaned back wearily against the parapet of the wall  not with norah she said sadly i could trust myself with the others not with norah  this way repeated captain wragge she roused herself looked up at the darkening heaven looked round at the darkening view what must be must she said and followed him  the minster clock struck the quarter to eight as they left the walk on the wall and descended the steps into rosemary lane almost at the same moment the lawyers clerk from london gave the last instructions to his subordinates and took up his own position on the opposite side of the river within easy view of mr huxtables door   chapter ii  captain wragge stopped nearly midway in the one little row of houses composing rosemary lane and let himself and his guest in at the door of his lodgings with his own key as they entered the passage a careworn woman in a widows cap made her appearance with a candle my niece said the captain presenting magdalen my niece on a visit to york she has kindly consented to occupy your empty bedroom consider it let if you please to my nieceand be very particular in airing the sheets is mrs wragge upstairs very good you may lend me your candle my dear girl mrs wragges boudoir is on the first floor mrs wragge is visible allow me to show you the way up  as he ascended the stairs first the careworn widow whispered piteously to magdalen i hope youll pay me miss your uncle doesnt  the captain threw open the door of the front room on the first floor and disclosed a female figure arrayed in a gown of tarnished ambercolored satin seated solitary on a small chair with dingy old gloves on its hands with a tattered old book on its knees and with one little bedroom candle by its side the figure terminated at its upper extremity in a large smooth white round facelike a moonencircled by a cap and green ribbons and dimly irradiated by eyes of mild and faded blue which looked straightforward into vacancy and took not the smallest notice of magdalens appearance on the opening of the door  mrs wragge cried the captain shouting at her as if she was fast asleep mrs wragge  the lady of the faded blue eyes slowly rose to an apparently interminable height when she had at last attained an upright position she towered to a stature of two or three inches over six feet giants of both sexes are by a wise dispensation of providence created for the most part gentle if mrs wragge and a lamb had been placed side by side comparison under those circumstances would have exposed the lamb as a rank impostor  tea captain inquired mrs wragge looking submissively down at her husband whose head when he stood on tiptoe barely reached her shoulder  miss vanstone the younger said the captain presenting magdalen our fair relative whom i have met by fortunate accident our guest for the night our guest reiterated the captain shouting once more as if the tall lady was still fast asleep in spite of the plain testimony of her own eyes to the contrary  a smile expressed itself in faint outline on the large vacant space of mrs wragges countenance oh she said interrogatively oh indeed please miss will you sit down im sorryno i dont mean im sorry i mean im glad she stopped and consulted her husband by a helpless look  glad of course shouted the captain  glad of course echoed the giantess of the amber satin more meekly than ever  mrs wragge is not deaf explained the captain shes only a little slow constitutionally torpidif i may use the expression i am merely loud with her and i beg you will honor me by being loud too as a necessary stimulant to her ideas shout at herand her mind comes up to time speak to herand she drifts miles away from you directly mrs wragge  mrs wragge instantly acknowledged the stimulant tea captain she inquired for the second time  put your cap straight shouted her husband i beg ten thousand pardons he resumed again addressing himself to magdalen the sad truth is i am a martyr to my own sense of order all untidiness all want of system and regularity cause me the acutest irritation my attention is distracted my composure is upset i cant rest till things are set straight again externally speaking mrs wragge is to my infinite regret the crookedest woman i ever met with more to the right shouted the captain as mrs wragge like a welltrained child presented herself with her revised headdress for her husbands inspection  mrs wragge immediately pulled the cap to the left magdalen rose and set it right for her the moonface of the giantess brightened for the first time she looked admiringly at magdalens cloak and bonnet do you like dress miss she asked suddenly in a confidential whisper i do  show miss vanstone her room said the captain looking as if the whole house belonged to him the spareroom the landladys spareroom on the third floor front offer miss vanstone all articles connected with the toilet of which she may stand in need she has no luggage with her supply the deficiency and then come back and make tea  mrs wragge acknowledged the receipt of these lofty directions by a look of placid bewilderment and led the way out of the room magdalen following her with a candle presented by the attentive captain as soon as they were alone on the landing outside mrs wragge raised the tattered old book which she had been reading when magdalen was first presented to her and which she had never let out of her hand since and slowly tapped herself on the forehead with it oh my poor head said the tall lady in meek soliloquy its buzzing again worse than ever  buzzing repeated magdalen in the utmost astonishment  mrs wragge ascended the stairs without offering any explanation stopped at one of the rooms on the second floor and led the way in  this is not the third floor said magdalen this is not my room surely  wait a bit pleaded mrs wragge wait a bit miss before we go up any higher ive got the buzzing in my head worse than ever please wait for me till im a little better again  shall i ask for help inquired magdalen shall i call the landlady  help echoed mrs wragge bless you i dont want help im used to it ive had the buzzing in my head off and onhow many years she stopped reflected lost herself and suddenly tried a question in despair have you ever been at darchs diningrooms in london she asked with an appearance of the deepest interest  no replied magdalen wondering at the strange inquiry  thats where the buzzing in my head first began said mrs wragge following the new clew with the deepest attention and anxiety i was employed to wait on the gentlemen at darchs diningroomsi was the gentlemen all came together the gentlemen were all hungry together the gentlemen all gave their orders together she stopped and tapped her head again despondently with the tattered old book  and you had to keep all their orders in your memory separate one from the other suggested magdalen helping her out and the trying to do that confused you  thats it said mrs wragge becoming violently excited in a moment boiled pork and greens and peasepudding for number one stewed beef and carrots and gooseberry tart for number two cut of mutton and quick about it well done and plenty of fat for number three codfish and parsnips two chops to follow hotandhot or ill be the death of you for number four five six seven eight nine ten

gentleman likes cheese and that gentleman doesntmatilda tilda tilda tilda fifty times over till i didnt know my own name againoh lord oh lord oh lord all together all at the same time all out of temper all buzzing in my poor head like forty thousand million beesdont tell the captain dont tell the captain the unfortunate creature dropped the tattered old book and beat both her hands on her head with a look of blank terror fixed on the door  hush hush said magdalen the captain hasnt heard you i know what is the matter with your head now let me cool it  she dipped a towel in water and pressed it on the hot and helpless head which mrs wragge submitted to her with the docility of a sick child  what a pretty hand youve got said the poor creature feeling the relief of the coolness and taking magdalens hand admiringly in her own how soft and white it is i try to be a lady i always keep my gloves onbut i cant get my hands like yours im nicely dressed though aint i i like dress its a comfort to me im always happy when im looking at my things i sayyou wont be angry with mei should so like to try your bonnet on  magdalen humored her with the ready compassion of the young she stood smiling and nodding at herself in the glass with the bonnet perched on the top of her head i had one as pretty as this once she saidonly it was white not black i wore it when the captain married me  where did you meet with him asked magdalen putting the question as a chance means of increasing her scanty stock of information on the subject of captain wragge  at the diningrooms said mrs wragge he was the hungriest and the loudest to wait upon of the lot of em i made more mistakes with him than i did with all the rest of them put together he used to swearoh didnt he use to swear when he left off swearing at me he married me there was others wanted me besides him bless you i had my pick why not when you have a trifle of money left you that you didnt expect if that dont make a lady of you what does isnt a lady to have her pick i had my trifle of money and i had my pick and i picked the captaini did he was the smartest and the shortest of them all he took care of me and my money im here the moneys gone dont you put that towel down on the tablehe wont have that dont move his razorsdont please or i shall forget which is which ive got to remember which is which tomorrow morning bless you the captain dont shave himself he had me taught i shave him i do his hair and cut his nailshes awfully particular about his nails so he is about his trousers and his shoes and his newspaper in the morning and his breakfasts and lunches and dinners and teas she stopped struck by a sudden recollection looked about her observed the tattered old book on the floor and clasped her hands in despair ive lost the place she exclaimed helplessly oh mercy what will become of me ive lost the place  never mind said magdalen ill soon find the place for you again  she picked up the book looked into the pages and found that the object of mrs wragges anxiety was nothing more important than an oldfashioned treatise on the art of cookery reduced under the usual heads of fish flesh and fowl and containing the customary series of recipes turning over the leaves magdalen came to one particular page thickly studded with little drops of moisture half dry curious she said if this was anything but a cookerybook i should say somebody had been crying over it  somebody echoed mrs wragge with a stare of amazement it isnt somebodyits me thank you kindly thats the place sure enough bless you im used to crying over it youd cry too if you had to get the captains dinners out of it as sure as ever i sit down to this book the buzzing in my head begins again whos to make it out sometimes i think ive got it and it all goes away from me sometimes i think i havent got it and it all comes back in a heap look here heres what hes ordered for his breakfast tomorrow omelette with herbs beat up two eggs with a little water or milk salt pepper chives and parsley mince smallthere mince small how am i to mince small when its all mixed up and running put a piece of butter the size of your thumb into the fryingpanlook at my thumb and look at yours whose size does she mean boil but not brownif it mustnt be brown what color must it be she wont tell me she expects me to know and i dont pour in the omelettethere i can do that allow it to set raise it round the edge when done turn it over to double itoh the number of times i turned it over and doubled it in my head before you came in tonight keep it soft put the dish on the fryingpan and turn it over which am i to turn overoh mercy try the cold towel again and tell me whichthe dish or the fryingpan  put the dish on the fryingpan said magdalen and then turn the fryingpan over that is what it means i think  thank you kindly said mrs wragge i want to get it into my head please say it again  magdalen said it again  and then turn the fryingpan over repeated mrs wragge with a sudden burst of energy ive got it now oh the lots of omelettes all frying together in my head and all frying wrong much obliged im sure youve put me all right again im only a little tired with talking and then turn the fryingpan then turn the fryingpan then turn the fryingpan over it sounds like poetry dont it  her voice sank and she drowsily closed her eyes at the same moment the door of the room below opened and the captains mellifluous bass notes floated upstairs charged with the customary stimulant to his wifes faculties  mrs wragge cried the captain mrs wragge  she started to her feet at that terrible summons oh what did he tell me to do she asked distractedly lots of things and ive forgotten them all  say you have done them when he asks you suggested magdalen they were things for methings i dont want i remember all that is necessary my room is the front room on the third floor go downstairs and say i am coming directly  she took up the candle and pushed mrs wragge out on the landing say i am coming directly she whispered againand went upstairs by herself to the third story  the room was small close and very poorly furnished in former days miss garth would have hesitated to offer such a room to one of the servants at comberaven but it was quiet it gave her a few minutes alone and it was endurable even welcome on that account she locked herself in and walked mechanically with a womans first impulse in a strange bedroom to the rickety little table and the dingy little lookingglass she waited there for a moment and then turned away with weary contempt what does it matter how pale i am she thought to herself frank cant see mewhat does it matter now  she laid aside her cloak and bonnet and sat down to collect herself but the events of the day had worn her out the past when she tried to remember it only made her heart ache the future when she tried to penetrate it was a black void she rose again and stood by the uncurtained windowstood looking out as if there was some hidden sympathy for her own desolation in the desolate night  norah she said to herself tenderly i wonder if norah is thinking of me oh if i could be as patient as she is if i could only forget the debt we owe to michael vanstone  her face darkened with a vindictive despair and she paced the little cage of a room backward and forward softly no never till the debt is paid her thoughts veered back again to frank still at sea poor fellow further and further away from me sailing through the day sailing through the night oh frank love me  her eyes filled with tears she dashed them away made for the door and laughed with a desperate levity as she unlocked it again  any company is better than my own thoughts she burst out recklessly as she left the room im forgetting my readymade relationsmy halfwitted aunt and my uncle the rogue she descended the stairs to the landing on the first floor and paused there in momentary hesitation how will it end she asked herself where is my blindfolded journey taking me to now who knows and who cares  she entered the room   captain wragge was presiding at the teatray with the air of a prince in his own banquetinghall at one side of the table sat mrs wragge watching her husbands eye like an animal waiting to be fed at the other side was an empty chair toward which the captain waved his persuasive hand when magdalen came in how do you like your room he inquired i trust mrs wragge has made herself useful you take milk and sugar try the local bread honor the york butter test the freshness of a new and neighboring egg i offer my little all a paupers meal my dear girlseasoned with a gentlemans welcome  seasoned with salt pepper chives and parsley murmured mrs wragge catching instantly at a word in connection with cookery and harnessing her head to the omelette for the rest of the evening  sit straight at the table shouted the captain more to the left more stillthat will do during your absence upstairs he continued addressing himself to magdalen my mind has not been unemployed i have been considering your position with a view exclusively to your own benefit if you decide on being guided tomorrow by the light of my experience that light is unreservedly at your service you may naturally say i know but little of you captain and that little is unfavorable granted on one conditionthat you permit me to make myself and my character quite familiar to you when tea is over false shame is foreign to my nature you see my wife my house my bread my butter and my eggs all exactly as they are see me too my dear girl while you are about it  when tea was over mrs wragge at a signal from her husband retired to a corner of the room with the eternal cookerybook still in her hand mince small she whispered confidentially as she passed magdalen thats a teaser isnt it  down at heel again shouted the captain pointing to his wifes heavy flat feet as they shuffled across the room the right shoe pull it up at heel mrs wraggepull it up at heel pray allow me he continued offering his arm to magdalen and escorting her to a dirty little horsehair sofa you want reposeafter your long journey you really want repose he drew his chair to the sofa and surveyed her with a bland look of investigationas if he had been her medical attendant with a diagnosis on his mind  very pleasant very pleasant said the captain when he had seen his guest comfortable on the sofa i feel quite in the bosom of my family shall we return to our subjectthe subject of my rascally self no no no apologies no protestations pray dont mince the matter on your sideand depend on me not to mince it on mine now come to facts pray come to facts who and what am i carry your mind back to our conversation on the walls of this interesting city and let us start once more from your point of view i am a rogue and in that capacity as i have already pointed out the most useful man you possibly could have met with now observe there are many varieties of rogue let me tell you my variety to begin with i am a swindler  his entire shamelessness was really superhuman not the vestige of a blush varied the sallow monotony of his complexion the smile wreathed his curly lips as pleasantly as ever his partycolored eyes twinkled at magdalen with the selfenjoying frankness of a naturally harmless man had his wife heard him magdalen looked over his shoulder to the corner of the room in which she was sitting behind him no the selftaught student of cookery was absorbed in her subject she had advanced her imaginary omelette to the critical stage at which the butter was to be thrown inthat vaguelymeasured morsel of butter the size of your thumb mrs wragge sat lost in contemplation of one of her own thumbs and shook her head over it as if it failed to satisfy her  dont be shocked proceeded the captain dont be astonished swindler is nothing but a word of two syllables s w i n dswind l e rler swindler definition a moral agriculturist a man who cultivates the field of human sympathy i am that moral agriculturist that cultivating man narrowminded mediocrity envious of my success in my profession calls me a swindler what of that the same low tone of mind assails men in other professions in a similar mannercalls great writers scribblersgreat generals butchersand so on it entirely depends on the point of view adopting your point i announce myself intelligibly as a swindler now return the obligation and adopt mine hear what i have to say for myself in the exercise of my professionshall i continue to put it frankly  yes said magdalen and ill tell you frankly afterward what i think of it  the captain cleared his throat mentally assembled his entire army of wordshorse foot artillery and reserves put himself at the head and dashed into action to carry the moral intrenchments of society by a general charge  now observe he began here am i a needy object very good without complicating the question by asking how i come to be in that condition i will merely inquire whether it is or is not the duty of a christian community to help the needy if you say no you simply shock me and there is an end of it if you say yes then i beg to ask why am i to blame for making a christian community do its duty you may say is a careful man who has saved money bound to spend it again on a careless stranger who has saved none why of course he is and on what ground pray good heavens on the ground that he has got the money to be sure all the world over the man who has not got the thing obtains it on one pretense or another of the man who hasand in nine cases out of ten the pretense is a false one what your pockets are full and my pockets are empty and you refuse to help me sordid wretch do you think i will allow you to violate the sacred obligations of charity in my person i wont allow youi say distinctly i wont allow you those are my principles as a moral agriculturist principles which admit of trickery certainly am i to blame if the field of human sympathy cant be cultivated in any other way consult my brother agriculturists in the mere farming linedo they get their crops for the asking no they must circumvent arid nature exactly as i circumvent sordid man they must plow and sow and topdress and bottomdress and deepdrain and surfacedrain and all the rest of it why am i to be checked in the vast occupation of deepdraining mankind why am i to be persecuted for habitually exciting the noblest feelings of our common nature infamousi can characterize it by no other wordinfamous if i hadnt confidence in the future i should despair of humanitybut i have confidence in the future yes one of these days when i am dead and gone as ideas enlarge and enlightenment progresses the abstract merits of the profession now called swindling will be recognized when that day comes dont drag me out of my grave and give me a public funeral dont take advantage of my having no voice to raise in my own defense and insult me by a national statue no do me justice on my tombstone dash me off in one masterly sentence on my epitaph here lies wragge embalmed in the tardy recognition of his species he plowed sowed and reaped his fellowcreatures and enlightened posterity congratulates him on the uniform excellence of his crops  he stopped not from want of confidence not from want of wordspurely from want of breath i put it frankly with a dash of humor he said pleasantly i dont shock youdo i weary and heartsick as she wassuspicious of others doubtful of herselfthe extravagant impudence of captain wragges defense of swindling touched magdalens natural sense of humor and forced a smile to her lips is the yorkshire crop a particularly rich one just at present she inquired meeting him in her neatly feminine way with his own weapons  a hita palpable hit said the captain jocosely exhibiting the tails of his threadbare shooting jacket as a practical commentary on magdalens remark my dear girl here or elsewhere the crop never failsbut one man cant always gather it in the assistance of intelligent cooperation is i regret to say denied me i have nothing in common with the clumsy rank and file of my profession who convict themselves before recorders and magistrates of the worst of all offensesincurable stupidity in the exercise of their own vocation such as you see me i stand entirely alone after years of successful selfdependence the penalties of celebrity are beginning to attach to me on my way from the north i pause at this interesting city for the third time i consult my books for the customary references to past local experience i find under the heading personal position in york the initials t w k signifying too well known i refer to my index and turn to the surrounding neighborhood the same brief marks meet my eye leeds t w kscarborough t w kharrowgate t w kand so on what is the inevitable consequence i suspend my proceedings my resources evaporate and my fair relative finds me the pauper gentleman whom she now sees before her  your books said magdalen what books do you mean  you shall see replied the captain trust me or not as you likei trust you implicitly you shall see  with those words he retired into the back room while he was gone magdalen stole another look at mrs wragge was she still selfisolated from her husbands deluge of words perfectly selfisolated she had advanced the imaginary omelette to the last stage of culinary progress and she was now rehearsing the final operation of turning it overwith the palm of her hand to represent the dish and the cookerybook to impersonate the fryingpan ive got it said mrs wragge nodding across the room at magdalen first put the fryingpan on the dish and then tumble both of them over  captain wragge returned carrying a neat black dispatchbox adorned with a bright brass lock he produced from the box five or six plump little books bound in commercial calf and vellum and each fitted comfortably with its own little lock  mind said the moral agriculturist i take no credit to myself for this it is my nature to be orderly and orderly i am i must have everything down in black and white or i should go mad here is my commercial library daybook ledger book of districts book of letters book of remarks and so on kindly throw your eye over any one of them i flatter myself there is no such thing as a blot or a careless entry in it from the first page to the last look at this roomis there a chair out of place not if i know it look at me am i dusty am i dirty am i half shaved am i in brief a speckless pauper or am i not mind i take no credit to myself the nature of the man my dear girlthe nature of the man  he opened one of the books magdalen was no judge of the admirable correctness with which the accounts inside were all kept but she could estimate the neatness of the handwriting the regularity in the rows of figures the mathematical exactness of the ruled lines in red and black ink the cleanly absence of blots stains or erasures although captain wragges inborn sense of order was in himas it is in othersa sense too inveterately mechanical to exercise any elevating moral influence over his actions it had produced its legitimate effect on his habits and had reduced his rogueries as strictly to method and system as if they had been the commercial transactions of an honest man  in appearance my system looks complicated pursued the captain in reality it is simplicity itself i merely avoid the errors of inferior practitioners that is to say i never plead for myself and i never apply to rich peopleboth fatal mistakes which the inferior practitioner perpetually commits people with small means sometimes have generous impulses in connection with moneyrich people never my lord with forty thousand a year sir john with property in half a dozen countiesthose are the men who never forgive the genteel beggar for swindling them out of a sovereign those are the men who send for the mendicity officers those are the men who take care of their money who are the people who lose shillings and sixpences by sheer thoughtlessness servants and small clerks to whom shillings and sixpences are of consequence did you ever hear of rothschild or baring dropping a fourpennypiece down a gutterhole fourpence in rothschilds pocket is safer than fourpence in the pocket of that woman who is crying stale shrimps in skeldergate at this moment fortified by these sound principles enlightened by the stores of written information in my commercial library i have ranged through the population for years past and have raised my charitable crops with the most cheering success here in book number one are all my districts mapped out with the prevalent public feeling to appeal to in each military district clerical district agricultural district et cetera et cetera here in number two are my cases that i plead family of an officer who fell at waterloo wife of a poor curate stricken down by nervous debility widow of a grazier in difficulties gored to death by a mad bull et cetera et cetera here in number three are the people who have heard of the officers family the curates wife the graziers widow and the people who havent the people who have said yes and the people who have said no the people to try again the people who want a fresh case to stir them up the people who are doubtful the people to beware of et cetera et cetera here in number four are my adopted handwritings of public characters my testimonials to my own worth and integrity my heartrending statements of the officers family the curates wife and the graziers widow stained with tears blotted with emotion et cetera et cetera here in numbers five and six are my own personal subscriptions to local charities actually paid in remunerative neighborhoods on the principle of throwing a sprat to catch a herring also my diary of each days proceedings my personal reflections and remarks my statement of existing difficulties such as the difficulty of finding myself t w k in this interesting city my outgivings and incomings wind and weather politics and public events fluctuations in my own health fluctuations in mrs wragges head fluctuations in our means and meals our payments prospects and principles et cetera et cetera so my dear girl the swindlers mill goes so you see me exactly as i am you knew before i met you that i lived on my wits well have i or have i not shown you that i have wits to live on  i have no doubt you have done yourself full justice said magdalen quietly  i am not at all exhausted continued the captain i can go on if necessary for t he rest of the eveninghowever if i have do ne myself full justice perhaps i may leave the remaining points in my character to develop themselves at future opportunities for the present i withdraw myself from notice exit wragge and now to business permit me to inquire what effect i have produced on your own mind do you still believe that the rogue who has trusted you with all his secrets is a rogue who is bent on taking a mean advantage of a fair relative  i will wait a little magdalen rejoined before i answer that question when i came down to tea you told me you had been employing your mind for my benefit may i ask how  by all means said captain wragge you shall have the net result of the whole mental process said process ranges over the present and future proceedings of your disconsolate friends and of the lawyers who are helping them to find you their present proceedings are in all probability assuming the following form the lawyers clerk has given you up at mr huxtables and has also by this time given you up after careful inquiry at all the hotels his last chance is that you may send for your box to the cloakroomyou dont send for itand there the clerk is tonight thanks to captain wragge and rosemary lane at the end of his resources he will forthwith communicate that fact to his employers in london and those employers dont be alarmed will apply for help to the detective police allowing for inevitable delays a professional spy with all his wits about him and with those handbills to help him privately in identifying you will be here certainly not later than the day after tomorrowpossibly earlier if you remain in york if you attempt to communicate with mr huxtable that spy will find you out if on the other hand you leave the city before he comes taking your departure by other means than the railway of course you put him in the same predicament as the clerkyou defy him to find a fresh trace of you there is my brief abstract of your present position what do you think of it  i think it has one defect said magdalen it ends in nothing  pardon me retorted the captain it ends in an arrangement for your safe departure and in a plan for the entire gratification of your wishes in the direction of the stage both drawn from the resources of my own experience and both waiting a word from you to be poured forth immediately in the fullest detail  i think i know what that word is replied magdalen looking at him attentively  charmed to hear it i am sure you have only to say captain wragge take charge of meand my plans are yours from that moment  i will take tonight to consider your proposal she said after an instants reflection you shall have my answer tomorrow morning  captain wragge looked a little disappointed he had not expected the reservation on his side to be met so composedly by a reservation on hers  why not decide at once he remonstrated in his most persuasive tones you have only to consider  i have more to consider than you think for she answered i have another object in view besides the object you know of  may i ask  excuse me captain wraggeyou may not ask allow me to thank you for your hospitality and to wish you goodnight i am worn out i want rest  once more the captain wisely adapted himself to her humor with the ready selfcontrol of an experienced man  worn out of course he said sympathetically unpardonable on my part not to have thought of it before we will resume our conversation tomorrow permit me to give you a candle mrs wragge  prostrated by mental exertion mrs wragge was pursuing the course of the omelette in dreams her head was twisted one way and her body the other she snored meekly at intervals one of her hands raised itself in the air shook an imaginary fryingpan and dropped again with a faint thump on the cookerybook in her lap at the sound of her husbands voice she started to her feet and confronted him with her mind fast asleep and her eyes wide open  assist miss vanstone said the captain and the next time you forget yourself in your chair fall asleep straightdont annoy me by falling asleep crooked  mrs wragge opened her eyes a little wider and looked at magdalen in helpless amazement  is the captain breakfasting by candlelight she inquired meekly and havent i done the omelette  before her husbands corrective voice could apply a fresh stimulant magdalen took her compassionately by the arm and led her out of the room   another object besides the object i know of repeated captain wragge when he was left by himself is there a gentleman in the background after all is there mischief brewing in the dark that i dont bargain for    chapter iii  toward six oclock the next morning the light pouring in on her face awoke magdalen in the bedroom in rosemary lane  she started from her deep dreamless repose of the past night with that painful sense of bewilderment on first waking which is familiar to all sleepers in strange beds norah she called out mechanically when she opened her eyes the next instant her mind roused itself and her senses told her the truth she looked round the miserable room with a loathing recognition of it the sordid contrast which the place presented to all that she had been accustomed to see in her own bedchamberthe practical abandonment implied in its scanty furniture of those elegant purities of personal habit to which she had been accustomed from her childhoodshocked that sense of bodily selfrespect in magdalen which is a refined womans second nature contemptible as the influence seemed when compared with her situation at that moment the bare sight of the jug and basin in a corner of the room decided her first resolution when she woke she determined then and there to leave rosemary lane  how was she to leave it with captain wragge or without him  she dressed herself with a dainty shrinking from everything in the room which her hands or her clothes touched in the process and then opened the window the autumn air felt keen and sweet and the little patch of sky that she could see was warmly bright already with the new sunlight distant voices of bargemen on the river and the chirping of birds among the weeds which topped the old city wall were the only sounds that broke the morning silence she sat down by the window and searched her mind for the thoughts which she had lost when weariness overcame her on the night before  the first subject to which she returned was the vagabond subject of captain wragge  the moral agriculturist had failed to remove her personal distrust of him cunningly as he had tried to plead against it by openly confessing the impostures that he had practiced on others he had raised her opinion of his abilities he had amused her by his humor he had astonished her by his assurance but he had left her original conviction that he was a rogue exactly where it was when he first met with her if the one design then in her mind had been the design of going on the stage she would at all hazards have rejected the more than doubtful assistance of captain wragge on the spot  but the perilous journey on which she had now adventured herself had another end in viewan end dark and distantan end with pitfalls hidden on the way to it far other than the shallow pitfalls on the way to the stage in the mysterious stillness of the morning her mind looked on to its second and its deeper design and the despicable figure of the swindler rose before her in a new view  she tried to shut him outto feel above him and beyond him again as she had felt up to this time  after a little trifling with her dress she took from her bosom the white silk bag which her own hands had made on the farewell night at comberaven it drew together at the mouth with delicate silken strings the first thing she took out on opening it was a lock of franks hair tied with a morsel of silver thread the next was a sheet of paper containing the extracts which she had copied from her fathers will and her fathers letter the last was a closelyfolded packet of banknotes to the value of nearly two hundred poundsthe produce as miss garth had rightly conjectured of the sale of her jewelry and her dresses in which the servant at the boardingschool had privately assisted her she put back the notes at once without a second glance at them and then sat looking thoughtfully at the lock of hair as it lay on her lap you are better than nothing she said speaking to it with a girls fanciful tenderness i can sit and look at you sometimes till i almost think i am looking at frank oh my darling my darling her voice faltered softly and she put the lock of hair with a languid gentleness to her lips it fell from her fingers into her bosom a lovely tinge of color rose on her cheeks and spread downward to her neck as if it followed the falling hair she closed her eyes and let her fair head droop softly the world passed from her and for one enchanted moment love opened the gates of paradise to the daughter of eve  the trivial noises in the neighboring street gathering in number as the morning advanced forced her back to the hard realities of the passing time she raised her head with a heavy sigh and opened her eyes once more on the mean and miserable little room  the extracts from the will and the letterthose last memorials of her father now so closely associated with the purpose which had possession of her mindstill lay before her the transient color faded from her face as she spread the little manuscript open on her lap the extracts from the will stood highest on the page they were limited to those few touching words in which the dead father begged his childrens forgiveness for the stain on their birth and implored them to remember the untiring love and care by which he had striven to atone for it the extract from the letter to mr pendril came next she read the last melancholy sentences aloud to herself for gods sake come on the day when you receive thiscome and relieve me from the dreadful thought that my two darling girls are at this moment unprovided for if anything happened to me and if my desire to do their mother justice ended through my miserable ignorance of the law in leaving norah and magdalen disinherited i should not rest in my grave under these lines again and close at the bottom of the page was written the terrible commentary on that letter which had fallen from mr pendrils lips mr vanstones daughters are nobodys children and the law leaves them helpless at their uncles mercy  helpless when those words were spokenhelpless still after all that she had resolved after all that she had sacrificed the assertion of her natural rights and her sisters sanctioned by the direct expression of her fathers last wishes the recall of frank from china the justification of her desertion of norahall hung on her desperate purpose of recovering the lost inheritance at any risk from the man who had beggared and insulted his brothers children and that man was still a shadow to her so little did she know of him that she was even ignorant at that moment of his place of abode  she rose and paced the room with the noiseless negligent grace of a wild creature of the forest in its cage how can i reach him in the dark she said to herself how can i find out she stopped suddenly before the question had shaped itself to an end in her thoughts captain wragge was back in her mind again  a man well used to working in the dark a man with endless resources of audacity and cunning a man who would hesitate at no mean employment that could be offered to him if it was employment that filled his pocketswas this the instrument for which in its present need her hand was waiting two of the necessities to be met before she could take a single step in advance were plainly present to herthe necessity of knowing more of her fathers brother than she knew now and the necessity of throwing him off his guard by concealing herself personally during the process of inquiry resolutely selfdependent as she was the inevitable spys work at the outset must be work delegated to another in her position was there any ready human creature within reach but the vagabond downstairs not one she thought of it anxiously she thought of it long not one there the choice was steadily confronting her the choice of taking the rogue or of turning her back on the purpose  she paused in the middle of the room what can he do at his worst she said to herself cheat me well if my money governs him for me what then let him have my money she returned mechanically to her place by the window a moment more decided her a moment more and she took the first fatal step downwardshe determined to face the risk and try captain wragge  at nine oclock the landlady knocked at magdalens door and informed her with the captains kind compliments that breakfast was ready  she found mrs wragge alone attired in a voluminous brown holland wrapper with a limp cape and a trimming of dingy pink ribbon the exwaitress at darchs diningrooms was absorbed in the contemplation of a large dish containing a leatherylooking substance of a mottled yellow color profusely sprinkled with little black spots  there it is said mrs wragge omelette with herbs the landlady helped me and thats what weve made of it dont you ask the captain for any when he comes indont theres a good soul it isnt nice we had some accidents with it its been under the grate its been spilled on the stairs its scalded the landladys youngest boyhe went and sat on it bless you it isnt half as nice as it looks dont you ask for any perhaps he wont notice if you say nothing about it what do you think of my wrapper i should so like to have a white one have you got a white one how is it trimmed do tell me  the formidable entrance of the captain suspended the next question on her lips fortunately for mrs wragge her husband was far too anxious for the promised expression of magdalens decision to pay his customary attention to questions of cookery when breakfast was over he dismissed mrs wragge and merely referred to the omelette by telling her that she had his full permission to give it to the dogs  how does my little proposal look by daylight he asked placing chairs for magdalen and himself which is it to be captain wragge take charge of me or captain wragge goodmorning  you shall hear directly replied magdalen i have something to say first i told you last night that i had another object in view besides the object of earning my living on the stage  i beg your pardon interposed captain wragge did you say earning your living  certainly both my sister and myself must depend on our own exertions to gain our daily bread  what cried the captain starting to his feet the daughters of my wealthy and lamented relative by marriage reduced to earn their own living impossiblewildly extravagantly impossible he sat down again and looked at magdalen as if she had inflicted a personal injury on him  you are not acquainted with the full extent of our misfortune she said quietly i will tell you what has happened before i go any further she told him at once in the plainest terms she could find and with as few details as possible  captain wragges profound bewilderment left him conscious of but one distinct result produced by the narrative on his own mind the lawyers offer of fifty pounds reward for the missing young lady ascended instantly to a place in his estimation which it had never occupied until that moment  do i understand he inquired that you are entirely deprived of present resources  i have sold my jewelry and my dresses said magdalen impatient of his mean harping on the pecuniary string if my want of experience keeps me back in a theater i can afford to wait till the stage can afford to pay me  captain wragge mentally appraised the rings bracelets and necklaces the silks satins and laces of the daughter of a gentleman of fortune atsay a third of their real value in a moment more the fifty pounds reward suddenly sank again to the lowest depths in the deep estimation of this judicious man  just so he said in his most businesslike manner there is not the least fear my dear girl of your being kept back in a theater if you possess present resources and if you profit by my assistance  i must accept more assistance than you have already offeredor none said magdalen i have more serious difficulties before me than the difficulty of leaving york and the difficulty of finding my way to the stage  you dont say so i am all attention pray explain yourself  she considered her next words carefully before they passed her lips  there are certain inquiries she said which i am interested in making if i undertook them myself i should excite the suspicion of the person inquired after and should learn little or nothing of what i wish to know if the inquiries could be made by a stranger without my being seen in the matter a service would be rendered me of much greater importance than the service you offered last night  captain wragges vagabond face became gravely and deeply attentive  may i ask he said what the nature of the inquiries is likely to be  magdalen hesitated she had necessarily mentioned michael vanstones name in informing the captain of the loss of her inheritance she must inevitably mention it to him again if she employed his services he would doubtless discover it for himself by a plain process of inference before she said many words more frame them as carefully as she might under these circumstances was there any intelligible reason for shrinking from direct reference to michael vanstone no intelligible reasonand yet she shrank  for instance pursued captain wragge are they inquiries about a man or a woman inquiries about an enemy or a friend  an enemy she answered quickly  her reply might still have kept the captain in the darkbut her eyes enlightened him michael vanstone thought the wary wragge she looks dangerous ill feel my way a little further  with regard now to the person who is the object of these inquiries he resumed are you thoroughly clear in your own mind about what you want to know  perfectly clear replied magdalen i want to know where he lives to begin with  yes and after that  i want to know about his habits about who the people are whom he associates with about what he does with his money she considered a little and one thing more she said i want to know whether there is any woman about his housea relation or a housekeeperwho has an influence over him  harmless enough so far said the captain what next  nothing the rest is my secret  the clouds on captain wragges countenance began to clear away again he reverted with his customary precision to his customary choice of alternatives these inquiries of hers he thought mean one of two thingsmischief or money if its mischief ill slip through her fingers if its money ill make myself useful with a view to the future  magdalens vigilant eyes watched the progress of his reflections suspiciously captain wragge she said if you want time to consider say so plainly  i dont want a moment replied the captain place your departure from york your dramatic career and your private inquiries under my care here i am unreservedly at your disposal say the worddo you take me  her heart beat fast her lips turned drybut she said the word  i do  there was a pause magdalen sat silent struggling with the vague dread of the future which had been roused in her mind by her own reply captain wragge on his side was apparently absorbed in the consideration of a new set of alternatives his hands descended into his empty pockets and prophetically tested their capacity as receptacles for gold and silver the brightness of the precious metals was in his face the smoothness of the precious metals was in his voice as he provided himself with a new supply of words and resumed the conversation  the next question he said is the question of time do these confidential investigations of ours require immediate attentionor can they wait  for the present they can wait replied magdalen i wish to secure my freedom from all interference on the part of my friends before the inquiries are made  very good the first step toward accomplishing that object is to beat our retreatexcuse a professional metaphor from a military manto beat our retreat from york tomorrow i see my way plainly so far but i am all abroad as we used to say in the militia about my marching orders afterward the next direction we take ought to be chosen with an eye to advancing your dramatic views i am all ready when i know what your views are how came you to think of the theater at all i see the sacred fire burning in you tell me who lit it  magdalen could only answer him in one way she could only look back at the days that were gone forever and tell him the story of her first step toward the stage at evergreen lodge captain wragge listened with his usual politeness but he evidently derived no satisfactory impression from what he heard audiences of friends were audiences whom he privately declined to trust and the opinion of the stagemanager was the opinion of a man who spoke with his fee in his pocket and his eye on a future engagement  interesting deeply interesting he said when magdalen had done but not conclusive to a practical man a specimen of your abilities is necessary to enlighten me i have been on the stage myself the comedy of the rivals is familiar to me from beginning to end a sample is all i want if you have not forgotten the wordsa sample of lucy and a sample of julia  i have not forgotten the words said magdalen sorrowfully and i have the little books with me in which my dialogue was written out i have never parted with them they remind me of a time her lip trembled and a pang of the heartache silenced her  nervous remarked the captain indulgently not at all a bad sign the greatest actresses on the stage are nervous follow their example and get over it where are the parts oh here they are very nicely written and remarkably clean ill give you the cuesit will all be over as the dentists say in no time take the back drawingroom for the stage and take me for the audience tingle goes the bell up runs the curtain order in the gallery silence in the pitenter lucy  she tried hard to control herself she forced back the sorrowthe innocent natural human sorrow for the absent and the deadpleading hard with her for the tears that she refused resolutely with cold clinched hands she tried to begin as the first familiar words passed her lips frank came back to her from the sea and the face of her dead father looked at her with the smile of happy old times the voices of her mother and her sister talked gently in the fragrant country stillness and the gardenwalks at comberaven opened once more on her view with a faint wailing cry she dropped into a chair her head fell forward on the table and she burst passionately into tears  captain wragge was on his feet in a moment she shuddered as he came near her and waved him back vehemently with her hand leave me she said leave me a minute by myself the compliant wragge retired to the front room looked out of the window and whistled under his breath the family spirit again he said complicated by hysterics  after waiting a minute or two he returned to make inquiries  is there anything i can offer you he asked cold water burned feathers smelling salts medical assistance shall i summon mrs wragge shall we put it off till tomorrow  she started up wild and flushed with a desperate s elfcommand in her face with an angry resolution in her manner  no she said i must harden myselfand i will sit down again and see me act  bravo cried the captain dash at it my beautyand its done  she dashed at it with a mad defiance of herselfwith a raised voice and a glow like fever in her cheeks all the artless girlish charm of the performance in happier and better days was gone the native dramatic capacity that was in her came hard and bold to the surface stripped of every softening allurement which had once adorned it she would have saddened and disappointed a man with any delicacy of feeling she absolutely electrified captain wragge he forgot his politeness he forgot his long words the essential spirit of the mans whole vagabond life burst out of him irresistibly in his first exclamation who the devil would have thought it she can act after all the instant the words escaped his lips he recovered himself and glided off into his ordinary colloquial channels magdalen stopped him in the middle of his first compliment no she said i have forced the truth out of you for once i want no more  pardon me replied the incorrigible wragge you want a little instruction and i am the man to give it you  with that answer he placed a chair for her and proceeded to explain himself  she sat down in silence a sullen indifference began to show itself in her manner her cheeks turned pale again and her eyes looked wearily vacant at the wall before her captain wragge noticed these signs of heartsickness and discontent with herself after the effort she had made and saw the importance of rousing her by speaking for once plainly and directly to the point she had set a new value on herself in his mercenary eyes she had suggested to him a speculation in her youth her beauty and her marked ability for the stage which had never entered his mind until he saw her act the old militiaman was quick at his shifts he and his plans had both turned right about together when magdalen sat down to hear what he had to say  mr huxtables opinion is my opinion he began you are a born actress but you must be trained before you can do anything on the stage i am disengagedi am competenti have trained othersi can train you dont trust my word trust my eye to my own interests ill make it my interest to take pains with you and to be quick about it you shall pay me for my instructions from your profits on the stage half your salary for the first year a third of your salary for the second year and half the sum you clear by your first benefit in a london theater what do you say to that have i made it my interest to push you or have i not  so far as appearances went and so far as the stage went it was plain that he had linked his interests and magdalens together she briefly told him so and waited to hear more  a month or six weeks study continued the captain will give me a reasonable idea of what you can do best all ability runs in grooves and your groove remains to be found we cant find it herefor we cant keep you a close prisoner for weeks together in rosemary lane a quiet country place secure from all interference and interruption is the place we want for a month certain trust my knowledge of yorkshire and consider the place found i see no difficulties anywhere except the difficulty of beating our retreat tomorrow  i thought your arrangements were made last night said magdalen  quite right rejoined the captain they were made last night and here they are we cant leave by railway because the lawyers clerk is sure to be on the lookout for you at the york terminus very good we take to the road instead and leave in our own carriage where the deuce do we get it we get it from the landladys brother who has a horse and chaise which he lets out for hire that chaise comes to the end of rosemary lane at an early hour tomorrow morning i take my wife and my niece out to show them the beauties of the neighborhood we have a picnic hamper with us which marks our purpose in the public eye you disfigure yourself in a shawl bonnet and veil of mrs wragges we turn our backs on york and away we drive on a pleasure trip for the dayyou and i on the front seat mrs wragge and the hamper behind good again once on the highroad what do we do drive to the first station beyond york northward southward or eastward as may be hereafter determined no lawyers clerk is waiting for you there you and mrs wragge get outfirst opening the hamper at a convenient opportunity instead of containing chickens and champagne it contains a carpetbag with the things you want for the night you take your tickets for a place previously determined on and i take the chaise back to york arrived once more in this house i collect the luggage left behind and send for the woman downstairs ladies so charmed with such and such a place wrong place of course that they have determined to stop there pray accept the customary weeks rent in place of a weeks warning good day is the clerk looking for me at the york terminus not he i take my ticket under his very nose i follow you with the luggage along your line of railwayand where is the trace left of your departure nowhere the fairy has vanished and the legal authorities are left in the lurch  why do you talk of difficulties asked magdalen the difficulties seem to be provided for  all but one said captain wragge with an ominous emphasis on the last word the grand difficulty of humanity from the cradle to the gravemoney he slowly winked his green eye sighed with deep feeling and buried his insolvent hands in his unproductive pockets  what is the money wanted for inquired magdalen  to pay my bills replied the captain with a touching simplicity pray understand i never wasand never shall bepersonally desirous of paying a single farthing to any human creature on the habitable globe i am speaking in your interest not in mine  my interest  certainly you cant get safely away from york tomorrow without the chaise and i cant get the chaise without money the landladys brother will lend it if he sees his sisters bill receipted and if he gets his days hire beforehandnot otherwise allow me to put the transaction in a business light we have agreed that i am to be remunerated for my course of dramatic instruction out of your future earnings on the stage very good i merely draw on my future prospects and you on whom those prospects depend are naturally my banker for mere arguments sake estimate my share in your first years salary at the totally inadequate value of a hundred pounds halve that sum quarter that sum  how much do you want said magdalen impatiently  captain wragge was sorely tempted to take the reward at the top of the handbills as his basis of calculation but he felt the vast future importance of present moderation and actually wanting some twelve or thirteen pounds he merely doubled the amount and said fiveandtwenty  magdalen took the little bag from her bosom and gave him the money with a contemptuous wonder at the number of words which he had wasted on her for the purpose of cheating on so small a scale in the old days at comberaven fiveandtwenty pounds flowed from a stroke of her fathers pen into the hands of any one in the house who chose to ask for it  captain wragges eyes dwelt on the little bag as the eyes of lovers dwell on their mistresses happy bag he murmured as she put it back in her bosom he rose dived into a corner of the room produced his neat dispatchbox and solemnly unlocked it on the table between magdalen and himself  the nature of the man my dear girlthe nature of the man he said opening one of his plump little books bound in calf and vellum a transaction has taken place between us i must have it down in black and white he opened the book at a blank page and wrote at the top in a fine mercantile hand miss vanstone the younger in account with horatio wragge late o f the royal militia drcr sept 24th 1846 dr to estimated value of h wragges interest in miss vs first years salarysay200 pounds cr by paid on account 25 pounds having completed the entryand having also shown by doubling his original estimate on the debtor side that magdalens easy compliance with his demand on her had not been thrown away on himthe captain pressed his blottingpaper over the wet ink and put away the book with the air of a man who had done a virtuous action and who was above boasting about it  excuse me for leaving you abruptly he said time is of importance i must make sure of the chaise if mrs wragge comes in tell her nothingshe is not sharp enough to be trusted if she presumes to ask questions extinguish her immediately you have only to be loud pray take my authority into your own hands and be as loud with mrs wragge as i am he snatched up his tall hat bowed smiled and tripped out of the room  sensible of little else but of the relief of being alone feeling no more distinct impression than the vague sense of some serious change having taken place in herself and her position magdalen let the events of the morning come and go like shadows on her mind and waited wearily for what the day might bring forth after the lapse of some time the door opened softly the giant figure of mrs wragge stalked into the room and stopped opposite magdalen in solemn astonishment  where are your things asked mrs wragge with a burst of incontrollable anxiety ive been upstairs looking in your drawers where are your nightgowns and nightcaps and your petticoats and stockings and your hairpins and bears grease and all the rest of it  my luggage is left at the railway station said magdalen  mrs wragges moonface brightened dimly the ineradicable female instinct of curiosity tried to sparkle in her faded blue eyesflickered piteouslyand died out  how much luggage she asked confidentially the captains gone out lets go and get it  mrs wragge cried a terrible voice at the door  for the first time in magdalens experience mrs wragge was deaf to the customary stimulant she actually ventured on a feeble remonstrance in the presence of her husband  oh do let her have her things pleaded mrs wragge oh poor soul do let her have her things  the captains inexorable forefinger pointed to a corner of the roomdropped slowly as his wife retired before itand suddenly stopped at the region of her shoes  do i hear a clapping on the floor exclaimed captain wragge with an expression of horror yes i do down at heel again the left shoe this time pull it up mrs wragge pull it upthe chaise will be here tomorrow morning at nine oclock he continued addressing magdalen we cant possibly venture on claiming your box there is notepaper write down a list of the necessaries you want i will take it myself to the shop pay the bill for you and bring back the parcel we must sacrifice the boxwe must indeed  while her husband was addressing magdalen mrs wragge had stolen out again from her corner and had ventured near enough to the captain to hear the words shop and parcel she clapped her great hands together in ungovernable excitement and lost all control over herself immediately  oh if its shopping let me do it cried mrs wragge shes going out to buy her things oh let me go with herplease let me go with her  sit down shouted the captain straight more to the rightmore still stop where you are  mrs wragge crossed her helpless hands on her lap and melted meekly into tears  i do so like shopping pleaded the poor creature and i get so little of it now  magdalen completed her list and captain wragge at once left the room with it dont let my wife bore you he said pleasantly as he went out cut her short poor soulcut her short  dont cry said magdalen trying to comfort mrs wragge by patting her on the shoulder when the parcel comes back you shall open it  thank you my dear said mrs wragge meekly drying her eyes thank you kindly dont notice my handkerchief please its such a very little one i had a nice lot of them once with lace borders theyre all gone now never mind it will comfort me to unpack your things youre very good to me i like you i sayyou wont be angry will you give us a kiss  magdalen stooped over her with the frank grace and gentleness of past days and touched her faded cheek let me do something harmless she thought with a pang at her heartoh let me do something innocent and kind for the sake of old times  she felt her eyes moistening and silently turned away  that night no rest came to her that night the roused forces of good and evil fought their terrible fight for her souland left the strife between them still in suspense when morning came as the clock of york minster struck nine she followed mrs wragge to the chaise and took her seat by the captains side in a quarter of an hour more york was in the distance and the highroad lay bright and open before them in the morning sunlight  the end of the second scene     between the scenes  chronicle of events preserved in captain wragges dispatchbox  i  chronicle for october 1846  i have retired into the bosom of my family we are residing in the secluded village of ruswarp on the banks of the esk about two miles inland from whitby our lodgings are comfortable and we possess the additional blessing of a tidy landlady mrs wragge and miss vanstone preceded me here in accordance with the plan i laid down for effecting our retreat from york on the next day i followed them alone with the luggage on leaving the terminus i had the satisfaction of seeing the lawyers clerk in close confabulation with the detective officer whose advent i had prophesied i left him in peaceable possession of the city of york and the whole surrounding neighborhood he has returned the compliment and has left us in peaceable possession of the valley of the esk thirty miles away from him  remarkable results have followed my first efforts at the cultivation of miss vanstones dramatic abilities  i have discovered that she possesses extraordinary talent as a mimic she has the flexible face the manageable voice and the dramatic knack which fit a woman for characterparts and disguises on the stage all she now wants is teaching and practice to make her sure of her own resources the experience of her thus gained has revived an idea in my mind which originally occurred to me at one of the at homes of the late inimitable charles mathews comedian i was in the wine trade at the time i remember we imitated the vintageprocesses of nature in a backkitchen at brompton and produced a dinnersherry pale and curious tonic in character round in the mouth a favorite with the court of spain at nineteenandsixpence a dozen bottles includedvide prospectus of the period the profits of myself and partners were small we were in advance of the tastes of the age and in debt to the bottle merchant being at my wits end for want of money and seeing what audiences mathews drew the idea occurred to me of starting an imitation of the great imitator himself in the shape of an at home given by a woman the one trifling obstacle in the way was the difficulty of finding the woman from that time to this i have hitherto failed to overcome it i have conquered it at last i have found the woman now miss vanstone possesses youth and beauty as well as talent train her in the art of dramatic disguise provide her with appropriate dresses for different characters develop her accomplishments in singing and playing give her plenty of smart talk addressed to the audience advertise her as a young lady at home astonish the public by a dramatic entertainment which depends from first to last on that young ladys own sole exertions commit the entire management of the t hing to my careand what follows as a necessary con sequence fame for my fair relative and a fortune for myself  i put these considerations as frankly as usual to miss vanstone offering to write the entertainment to manage all the business and to share the profits i did not forget to strengthen my case by informing her of the jealousies she would encounter and the obstacles she would meet if she went on the stage and i wound up by a neat reference to the private inquiries which she is interested in making and to the personal independence which she is desirous of securing before she acts on her information if you go on the stage i said your services will be bought by a manager and he may insist on his claims just at the time when you want to get free from him if on the contrary you adopt my views you will be your own mistress and your own manager and you can settle your course just as you like this last consideration appeared to strike her she took a day to consider it and when the day was over gave her consent  i had the whole transaction down in black and white immediately our arrangement is eminently satisfactory except in one particular she shows a morbid distrust of writing her name at the bottom of any document which i present to her and roundly declares she will sign nothing as long as it is her interest to provide herself with pecuniary resources for the future she verbally engages to go on when it ceases to be her interest she plainly threatens to leave off at a weeks notice a difficult girl to deal with she has found out her own value to me already one comfort is i have the cooking of the accounts and my fair relative shall not fill her pockets too suddenly if i can help it  my exertions in training miss vanstone for the coming experiment have been varied by the writing of two anonymous letters in that young ladys interests finding her too fidgety about arranging matters with her friends to pay proper attention to my instructions i wrote anonymously to the lawyer who is conducting the inquiry after her recommending him in a friendly way to give it up the letter was inclosed to a friend of mine in london with instructions to post it at charing cross a week later i sent a second letter through the same channel requesting the lawyer to inform me in writing whether he and his clients had or had not decided on taking my advice i directed him with jocose reference to the collision of interests between us to address his letter tit for tat postoffice west strand  in a few days the answer arrivedprivately forwarded of course to postoffice whitby by arrangement with my friend in london  the lawyers reply was short and surly sirif my advice had been followed you and your anonymous letter would both be treated with the contempt which they deserve but the wishes of miss magdalen vanstones eldest sister have claims on my consideration which i cannot dispute and at her entreaty i inform you that all further proceedings on my part are withdrawnon the express understanding that this concession is to open facilities for written communication at least between the two sisters a letter from the elder miss vanstone is inclosed in this if i dont hear in a weeks time that it has been received i shall place the matter once more in the hands of the policewilliam pendril a sour man this william pendril i can only say of him what an eminent nobleman once said of his sulky servanti wouldnt have such a temper as that fellow has got for any earthly consideration that could be offered me  as a matter of course i looked into the letter which the lawyer inclosed before delivering it miss vanstone the elder described herself as distracted at not hearing from her sister as suited with a governesss situation in a private family as going into the situation in a weeks time and as longing for a letter to comfort her before she faced the trial of undertaking her new duties after closing the envelope again i accompanied the delivery of the letter to miss vanstone the younger by a word of caution are you more sure of your own courage now i said than you were when i met you she was ready with her answer captain wragge when you met me on the walls of york i had not gone too far to go back i have gone too far now  if she really feels thisand i think she doesher corresponding with her sister can do no harm she wrote at great length the same day cried profusely over her own epistolary composition and was remarkably illtempered and snappish toward me when we met in the evening she wants experience poor girlshe sadly wants experience of the world how consoling to know that i am just the man to give it her   ii  chronicle for november  we are established at derby the entertainment is written and the rehearsals are in steady progress all difficulties are provided for but the one eternal difficulty of money miss vanstones resources stretch easily enough to the limits of our personal wants including pianoforte hire for practice and the purchase and making of the necessary dresses but the expenses of starting the entertainment are beyond the reach of any means we possess a theatrical friend of mine here whom i had hoped to interest in our undertaking proves unhappily to be at a crisis in his career the field of human sympathy out of which i might have raised the needful pecuniary crop is closed to me from want of time to cultivate it i see no other resource leftif we are to be ready by christmasthan to try one of the local musicsellers in this town who is said to be a speculating man a private rehearsal at these lodgings and a bargain which will fill the pockets of a grasping strangersuch are the sacrifices which dire necessity imposes on me at starting well there is only one consolation ill cheat the musicseller   iii  chronicle for december first fortnight  the musicseller extorts my unwilling respect he is one of the very few human beings i have met with in the course of my life who is not to be cheated he has taken a masterly advantage of our helplessness and has imposed terms on us for performances at derby and nottingham with such a businesslike disregard of all interests but his own thatfond as i am of putting things down in black and whitei really cannot prevail upon myself to record the bargain it is needless to say i have yielded with my best grace sharing with my fair relative the wretched pecuniary prospects offered to us our turn will come in the meantime i cordially regret not having known the local musicseller in early life  personally speaking i have no cause to complain of miss vanstone we have arranged that she shall regularly forward her address at the postoffice to her friends as we move about from place to place besides communicating in this way with her sister she also reports herself to a certain mr clare residing in somersetshire who is to forward all letters exchanged between herself and his son careful inquiry has informed me that this latter individual is now in china having suspected from the first that there was a gentleman in the background it is highly satisfactory to know that he recedes into the remote perspective of asia long may he remain there  the trifling responsibility of finding a name for our talented magdalen to perform under has been cast on my shoulders she feels no interest whatever in this part of the subject give me any name you like she said i have as much right to one as to another make it yourself i have readily consented to gratify her wishes the resources of my commercial library include a list of useful names to assume and we can choose one at five minutes notice when the admirable man of business who now oppresses us is ready to issue his advertisements on this point my mind is easy enough all my anxieties center in the fair performer i have not the least doubt she will do wonders if she is only left to herself on the first night but if the days post is mischievous enough to upset her by a letter from her sister i tremble for the consequences   iv  chronicle for december second fortnight  my gifted relative has made her first appearance in public and has laid the foundation of our future fortunes  on the first night the attendance was larger than i had ventured to hope the novelty of an evenings entertainment conducted from beginning to end by the unaided exertions of a young lady see advertisement roused the public curiosity and the seats were moderately well filled as good luck would have it no letter addressed to miss vanstone came that day she was in full possession of herself until she got the first dress on and heard the bell ring for the music at that critical moment she suddenly broke down i found her alone in the waitingroom sobbing and talking like a child oh poor papa poor papa oh my god if he saw me now my experience in such matters at once informed me that it was a case of salvolatile accompanied by sound advice we strung her up in no time to concert pitch set her eyes in a blaze and made her outblush her own rouge the curtain rose when we had got her at a red heat she dashed at it exactly as she dashed at it in the back drawingroom at rosemary lane her personal appearance settled the question of her reception before she opened her lips she rushed full gallop through her changes of character her songs and her dialogue making mistakes by the dozen and never stopping to set them right carrying the people along with her in a perfect whirlwind and never waiting for the applause the whole thing was over twenty minutes sooner than the time we had calculated on she carried it through to the end and fainted on the waitingroom sofa a minute after the curtain was down the musicseller having taken leave of his senses from sheer astonishment and i having no evening costume to appear in we sent the doctor to make the necessary apology to the public who were calling for her till the place rang again i prompted our medical orator with a neat speech from behind the curtain and i never heard such applause from such a comparatively small audience before in my life i felt the tributei felt it deeply fourteen years ago i scraped together the wretched means of existence in this very town by reading the newspaper with explanatory comments to the company at a publichouse and now here i am at the top of the tree  it is needless to say that my first proceeding was to bowl out the musicseller on the spot he called the next morning no doubt with a liberal proposal for extending the engagement beyond derby and nottingham my niece was described as not well enough to see him and when he asked for me he was told i was not up i happened to be at that moment engaged in putting the case pathetically to our gifted magdalen her answer was in the highest degree satisfactory she would permanently engage herself to nobodyleast of all to a man who had taken sordid advantage of her position and mine she would be her own mistress and share the profits with me while she wanted money and while it suited her to go on so far so good but the reason she added next for her flattering preference of myself was less to my taste the musicseller is not the man whom i employ to make my inquiries she said you are the man i dont like her steadily remembering those inquiries in the first bewilderment of her success it looks ill for the future it looks infernally ill for the future   v  chronicle for january 1847  she has shown the cloven foot already i begin to be a little afraid of her  on the conclusion of the nottingham engagement the results of which more than equaled the results at derby i proposed taking the entertainment nextnow we had got it into our own handsto newark miss vanstone raised no objection until we came to the question of time when she amazed me by stipulating for a weeks delay before we appeared in public again  for what possible purpose i asked  for the purpose of making the inquiries which i mentioned to you at york she answered  i instantly enlarged on the danger of delay putting all the considerations before her in every imaginable form she remained perfectly immovable i tried to shake her on the question of expenses she answered by handing me over her share of the proceeds at derby and nottinghamand there were my expenses paid at the rate of nearly two guineas a day i wonder who first picked out a mule as the type of obstinacy how little knowledge that man must have had of women  there was no help for it i took down my instructions in black and white as usual my first exertions were to be directed to the discovery of mr michael vanstones address i was also expected to find out how long he was likely to live there and whether he had sold comberaven or not my next inquiries were to inform me of his ordinary habits of life of what he did with his money of who his intimate friends were and of the sort of terms on which his son mr noel vanstone was now living with him lastly the investigations were to end in discovering whether there was any female relative or any woman exercising domestic authority in the house who was known to have an influence over either father or son  if my long practice in cultivating the field of human sympathy had not accustomed me to private investigations into the affairs of other people i might have found some of these queries rather difficult to deal with in the course of a week as it was i gave myself all the benefit of my own experience and brought the answers back to nottingham in a day less than the given time here they are in regular order for convenience of future reference  1 mr michael vanstone is now residing at german place brighton and likely to remain there as he finds the air suits him he reached london from switzerland in september last and sold the comberaven property immediately on his arrival  2 his ordinary habits of life are secret and retired he seldom visits or receives company part of his money is supposed to be in the funds and part laid out in railway investments which have survived the panic of eighteen hundred and fortysix and are rapidly rising in value he is said to be a bold speculator since his arrival in england he has invested with great judgment in house property he has some houses in remote parts of london and some houses in certain wateringplaces on the east coast which are shown to be advancing in public repute in all these cases he is reported to have made remarkably good bargains  3 it is not easy to discover who his intimate friends are two names only have been ascertained the first is admiral bartram supposed to have been under friendly obligations in past years to mr michael vanstone the second is mr george bartram nephew of the admiral and now staying on a short visit in the house at german place mr george bartram is the son of the

by storm is sheffield we open the first week in february   vi  chronicle for february  practice has now given my fair relative the confidence which i predicted would come with time her knack of disguising her own identity in the impersonation of different characters so completely staggers her audiences that the same people come twice over to find out how she does it it is the amiable defect of the english public never to know when they have had enough of a good thing they actually try to encore one of her charactersan old northcountry lady modeled on that honored preceptress in the late mr vanstones family to whom i presented myself at comberaven this particular performance fairly amazes the people i dont wonder at it such an extraordinary assumption of age by a girl of nineteen has never been seen in public before in the whole course of my theatrical experience  i find myself writing in a lower tone than usual i miss my own dash of humor the fact is i am depressed about the future in the very height of our prosperity my perverse pupil sticks to her trumpery family quarrel i feel myself at the mercy of the first whim in the vanstone direction which may come into her headi the architect of her fortunes too bad upon my soul too bad  she has acted already on the inquiries which she forced me to make for her she has written two letters to mr michael vanstone  to the first letter no answer came to the second a reply was received her infernal cleverness put an obstacle i had not expected in the way of my intercepting it later in the day after she had herself opened and read the answer i laid another trap for her it just succeeded and no more i had half a minute to look into the envelope in her absence it contained nothing but her own letter returned she is not the girl to put up quietly with such an insult as this mischief will come of itmischief to michael vanstonewhich is of no earthly consequence mischief to mewhich is a truly serious matter   vii  chronicle for march  after performing at sheffield and manchester we have moved to liverpool preston and lancaster another change in this weathercock of a girl she has written no more letters to michael vanstone and she has become as anxious to make money as i am myself we are realizing large profits and we are worked to death i dont like this change in her she has a purpose to answer or she would not show such extraordinary eagerness to fill her purse nothing i can dono cooking of accounts no selfpresented testimonialscan keep that purse empty the success of the entertainment and her own sharpness in looking after her interests literally force me into a course of comparative honesty she puts into her pocket more than a third of the profits in defiance of my most arduous exertions to prevent her and this at my age this after my long and successful career as a moral agriculturist marks of admiration are very little things but they express my feelings and i put them in freely   viii  chronicle for april and may  we have visited seven more large towns and are now at birmingham consulting my books i find that miss vanstone has realized by the entertainment up to this time the enormous sum of nearly four hundred pounds it is quite possible that my own profits may reach one or two miserable hundred more but i was the architect of her fortunesthe publisher so to speak of her bookand if anything i am underpaid  i made the above discovery on the twentyninth of the monthanniversary of the restoration of my royal predecessor in the field of human sympathies charles the second i had barely finished locking up my dispatchbox when the ungrateful girl whose reputation i have made came into the room and told me in so many words that the business connection between us was for the present at an end  i attempt no description of my own sensations i merely record facts she informed me with an appearance of perfect composure that she needed rest and that she had new objects in view she might possibly want me to assist those objects and she might possibly return to the entertainment in either case it would be enough if we exchanged addresses at which we could write to each other in case of need having no desire to leave me too abruptly she would remain the next day which was sunday and would take her departure on monday morning such was her explanation in so many words  remonstrance as i knew by experience would be thrown away authority i had none to exert my one sensible course to take in this emergency was to find out which way my own interests pointed and to go that way without a moments unnecessary hesitation  a very little reflection has since convinced me that she has a deeplaid scheme against michael vanstone in view she is young handsome clever and unscrupulous she has made money to live on and has time at her disposal to find out the weak side of an old man and she is going to attack mr michael vanstone unawares with the legitimate weapons of her sex is she likely to want me for such a purpose as this doubtful is she merely anxious to get rid of me on easy terms probable am i the sort of man to be treated in this way by my own pupil decidedly not i am the man to see my way through a neat succession of alternatives and here they are  first alternative to announce my compliance with her proposal to exchange addresses with her and then to keep my eye privately on all her future movements second alternative to express fond anxiety in a paternal capacity and to threaten giving the alarm to her sister and the lawyer if she persists in her design third alternative to turn the information i already possess to the best account by making it a marketable commodity between mr michael vanstone and myself at present i incline toward the last of these three courses but my decision is far too important to be hurried today is only the twentyninth i will suspend my chronicle of events until monday   may 31stmy alternatives and her plans are both overthrown together  the newspaper came in as usual after breakfast i looked it over and discovered this memorable entry among the obituary announcements of the day  on the 29th inst at brighton michael vanstone esq formerly of zurich aged 77  miss vanstone was present in the room when i read those two startling lines her bonnet was on her boxes were packed she was waiting impatiently until it was time to go to the train i handed the paper to her without a word on my side without a word on hers she looked where i pointed and read the news of michael vanstones death  the paper dropped out of her hand and she suddenly pulled down her veil i caught one glance at her face before she hid it from me the effect on my mind was startling in the extreme to put it with my customary dash of humorher face informed me that the most sensible action which michael vanstone esq formerly of zurich had ever achieved in his life was the action he performed at brighton on the 29th instant  finding the dead silence in the room singularly unpleasant under existing circumstances i thought i would make a remark my regard for my own interests supplied me with a subject i mentioned the entertainment  after what has happened i said i presume we go on with our performances as usual  no she answered behind the veil we go on with my inquiries  inquiries after a dead man  inquiries after the dead mans son  mr noel vanstone  yes mr noel vanstone  not having a veil to put down over my own face i stooped and picked up the newspaper her devilish determination quite upset me for the moment i actually had to steady myself before i could speak to her again  are the new inquiries as harmless as the old ones i asked  quite as harmless  what am i expected to find out  i wish to know whether mr noel vanstone remains at brighton after the funeral  and if not  if not i shall want to know his new address wherever it may be  yes and what next  i wish you to find out next if all the fathers money goes to the son  i began to see her drift the word money relieved me i felt quite on my own ground again  anything more i asked  only one thing more she answered make sure if you please whether mrs lecount the housekeeper remains or not in mr noel vanstones service  her voice altered a little as she mentioned mrs lecounts name she is evidently sharp enough to distrust the housekeeper already  my expenses are to be paid as usual i said  as usual  when am i expected to leave for brighton  as soon as you can  she rose and left the room after a momentary doubt i decided on executing the new commission the more private inquiries i conduct for my fair relative the harder she will find it to get rid of hers truly horatio wragge  there is nothing to prevent my starting for brighton tomorrow so tomorrow i go if mr noel vanstone succeeds to his fathers property he is the only human being possessed of pecuniary blessings who fails to inspire me with a feeling of unmitigated envy   ix  chronicle for june  9thi returned yesterday with my information here it is privately noted down for convenience of future reference  mr noel vanstone has left brighton and has removed for the purpose of transacting business in london to one of his late fathers empty houses in vauxhall walk lambeth this singularly mean selection of a place of residence on the part of a gentleman of fortune looks as if mr n v and his money were not easily parted  mr noel vanstone has stepped into his fathers shoes under the following circumstances mr michael vanstone appears to have died curiously enough as mr andrew vanstone diedintestate with this difference however in the two cases that the younger brother left an informal will and the elder brother left no will at all the hardest men have their weaknesses and mr michael vanstones weakness seems to have been an insurmountable horror of contemplating the event of his own death his son his housekeeper and his lawyer had all three tried over and over again to get him to make a will and had never shaken his obstinate resolution to put off performing the only business duty he was ever known to neglect two doctors attended him in his last illness warned him that he was too old a man to hope to get over it and warned him in vain he announced his own positive determination not to die his last words in this world as i succeeded in discovering from the nurse who assisted mrs lecount were im getting better every minute send for the fly directly and take me out for a drive the same night death proved to be the more obstinate of the two and left his son and only child to take the property in due course of law nobody doubts that the result would have been the same if a will had been made the father and son had every confidence in each other and were known to have always lived together on the most friendly terms  mrs lecount remains with mr noel vanstone in the same housekeeping capacity which she filled with his father and has accompanied him to the new residence in vauxhall walk she is acknowledged on all hands to have been a sufferer by the turn events have taken if mr michael vanstone had made his will there is no doubt she would have received a handsome legacy she is now left dependent on mr noel vanstones sense of gratitude and she is not at all likely i should imagine to let that sense fall asleep for want of a little timely jogging whether my fair relatives future intentions in this quarter point toward mischief or money is more than i can yet say in either case i venture to predict that she will find an awkward obstacle in mrs lecount   so much for my information to the present date the manner in which it was received by miss vanstone showed the most ungrateful distrust of me she confided nothing to my private ear but the expression of her best thanks a sharp girla devilish sharp girl but there is such a thing as bowling a man out once too often especially when the name of that man happens to be wragge  not a word more about the entertainment not a word more about moving from our present quarters very good my right hand lays my left hand a wager ten to one on her opening communications with the son as she opened them with the father ten to one on her writing to noel vanstone before the month is out  21stshe has written by todays post a long letter apparentlyfor she put two stamps on the envelope private memorandum addressed to myself wait for the answer  22d 23d 24thprivate memorandum continued wait for the answer  25ththe answer has come as an exmilitary man i have naturally employed stratagem to get at it the success which rewards all genuine perseverance has rewarded meand i have got at it accordingly  the letter is written not by mr noel vanstone but by mrs lecount she takes the highest moral ground in a tone of spiteful politeness mr noel vanstones delicate health and recent bereavement prevent him from writing himself any more letters from miss vanstone will be returned unopened any personal application will produce an immediate appeal to the protection of the law mr noel vanstone having been expressly cautioned against miss magdalen vanstone by his late lamented father has not yet forgotten his fathers advice considers it a reflection cast on the memory of the best of men to suppose that his course of action toward the misses vanstone can be other than the course of action which his father pursued this is what he has himself instructed mrs lecount to say she has endeavored to express herself in the most conciliatory language she could select she had tried to avoid giving unnecessary pain by addressing miss vanstone as a matter of courtesy by the family name and she trusts these concessions which speak for themselves will not be thrown awaysuch is the substance of the letter and so it ends  i draw two conclusions from this little document firstthat it will lead to serious results secondlythat mrs lecount with all her politeness is a dangerous woman to deal with i wish i saw my way safe before me i dont see it yet   29thmiss vanstone has abandoned my protection and the whole lucrative future of the dramatic entertainment has abandoned me with her i am swindledi the last man under heaven who could possibly have expected to write in those disgraceful terms of myselfi am swindled  let me chronicle the events they exhibit me for the time being in a sadly helpless point of view but the nature of the man prevails i must have the events down in black and white  the announcement of her approaching departure was intimated to me yesterday after another civil speech about the information i had procured at brighton she hinted that there was a necessity for pushing our inquiries a little further i immediately offered to undertake them as before no she said they are not in your way this time they are inquiries relating to a woman and i mean to make them myself feeling privately convinced that this new resolution pointed straight at mrs lecount i tried a few innocent questions on the subject she quietly declined to answer them i asked next when she proposed to leave she would leave on the twentyeighth for what destination london for long probably not by herself no with me no with whom then with mrs wragge if i had no objection good heavens for what possible purpose for the purpose of getting a respectable lodging which she could hardly expect to accomplish unless she was accompanied by an elderly female friend and was i in the capacity of elderly male friend to be left out of the business altogether impossible to say at present was i not even to forward any letters which might come for her at our present address no she would make the arrangement herself at the postoffice and she would ask me at the same time for an address at which i could receive a letter from her in case of necessity for future communication further inquiries after this last answer could lead to nothing but waste of time i saved time by putting no more questions  it was clear to me that our present position toward each other was what our position had been previously to the event of michael vanstones death i returned as before to my choice of alternatives which way did my private interests point toward trusting the chance of her wanting me again toward threatening her with the interference of her relatives and friends or toward making the information which i possessed a marketable commodity between the wealthy branch of the family and myself the last of the three was the alternative i had chosen in the case of the father i chose it once more in the case of the son  the train started for london nearly four hours since and took her away in it accompanied by mrs wragge  my wife is too great a fool poor soul to be actively valuable in the present emergency but she will be passively useful in keeping up miss vanstones connection with meand in consideration of that circumstance i consent to brush my own trousers shave my own chin and submit to the other inconveniences of waiting on myself for a limited period any faint glimmerings of sense which mrs wragge may have formerly possessed appear to have now finally taken their leave of her on receiving permission to go to london she favored us immediately with two inquiries might she do some shopping and might she leave the cookerybook behind her miss vanstone said yes to one question and i said yes to the otherand from that moment mrs wragge has existed in a state of perpetual laughter i am still hoarse with vainly repeated applications of vocal stimulant and i left her in the railway carriage to my inexpressible disgust with both shoes down at heel  under ordinary circumstances these absurd particulars would not have dwelt on my memory but as matters actually stand my unfortunate wifes imbecility may in her present position lead to consequences which we none of us foresee she is nothing more or less than a grownup child and i can plainly detect that miss vanstone trusts her as she would not have trusted a sharper woman on that very account i know children little and big rather better than my fair relative does and i saybeware of all forms of human innocence when it happens to be your interest to keep a secret to yourself  let me return to business here i am at two oclock on a fine summers afternoon left entirely alone to consider the safest means of approaching mr noel vanstone on my own account my private suspicions of his miserly character produce no discouraging effect on me i have extracted cheering pecuniary results in my time from people quite as fond of their money as he can be the real difficulty to contend with is the obstacle of mrs lecount if i am not mistaken this lady merits a little serious consideration on my part i will close my chronicle for today and give mrs lecount her due   three oclocki open these pages again to record a discovery which has taken me entirely by surprise  after completing the last entry a circumstance revived in my memory which i had noticed on escorting the ladies this morning to the railway i then remarked that miss vanstone had only taken one of her three boxes with herand it now occurred to me that a private investigation of the luggage she had left behind might possibly be attended with beneficial results having at certain periods of my life been in the habit of cultivating friendly terms with strange locks i found no difficulty in establishing myself on a familiar footing with miss vanstones boxes one of the two presented nothing to interest me the otherdevoted to the preservation of the costumes articles of toilet and other properties used in the dramatic entertainmentproved to be better worth examining for it led me straight to the discovery of one of its owners secrets  i found all the dresses in the box completewith one remarkable exception that exception was the dress of the old northcountry lady the character which i have already mentioned as the best of all my pupils disguises and as modeled in voice and manner on her old governess miss garth the wig the eyebrows the bonnet and veil the cloak padded inside to disfigure her back and shoulders the paints and cosmetics used to age her face and alter her complexionwere all gone nothing but the gown remained a gaudilyflowered silk useful enough for dramatic purposes but too extravagant in color and pattern to bear inspection by daylight the other parts of the dress are sufficiently quiet to pass muster the bonnet and veil are only oldfashioned and the cloak is of a sober gray color but one plain inference can be drawn from such a discovery as this as certainly as i sit here she is going to open the campaign against noel vanstone and mrs lecount in a character which neither of those two persons can have any possible reason for suspecting at the outsetthe character of miss garth  what course am i to take under these circumstances having got her secret what am i to do with it these are awkward considerations i am rather puzzled how to deal with them  it is something more than the mere fact of her choosing to disguise herself to forward her own private ends that causes my present perplexity hundreds of girls take fancies for disguising themselves and hundreds of instances of it are related year after year in the public journals but my expupil is not to be confounded for one moment with the average adventuress of the newspapers she is capable of going a long way beyond the limit of dressing herself like a man and imitating a mans voice and manner she has a natural gift for assuming characters which i have never seen equaled by a woman and she has performed in public until she has felt her own power and trained her talent for disguising herself to the highest pitch a girl who takes the sharpest people unawares by using such a capacity as this to help her own objects in private life and who sharpens that capacity by a determination to fight her way to her own purpose which has beaten down everything before it up to this timeis a girl who tries an experiment in deception new enough and dangerous enough to lead one way or the other to very serious results this is my conviction founded on a large experience in the art of imposing on my fellowcreatures i say of my fair relatives enterprise what i never said or thought of it till i introduced myself to the inside of her box the chances for and against her winning the fight for her lost fortune are now so evenly balanced that i cannot for the life of me see on which side the scale inclines all i can discern is that it will to a dead certainty turn one way or the other on the day when she passes noel vanstones doors in disguise  which way do my interests point now upon my honor i dont know   five oclocki have effected a masterly compromise i have decided on turning myself into a jacko nbothsides  by todays post i have dispatched to london an anonymous letter for m r noel vanstone it will be forwarded to its destination by the same means which i successfully adopted to mystify mr pendril and it will reach vauxhall walk lambeth by the afternoon of tomorrow at the latest  the letter is short and to the purpose it warns mr noel vanstone in the most alarming language that he is destined to become the victim of a conspiracy and that the prime mover of it is a young lady who has already held written communication with his father and himself it offers him the information necessary to secure his own safety on condition that he makes it worth the writers while to run the serious personal risk which such a disclosure will entail on him and it ends by stipulating that the answer shall be advertised in the times shall be addressed to an unknown friend and shall state plainly what remuneration mr noel vanstone offers for the priceless service which it is proposed to render him  unless some unexpected complication occurs this letter places me exactly in the position which it is my present interest to occupy if the advertisement appears and if the remuneration offered is large enough to justify me in going over to the camp of the enemy over i go if no advertisement appears or if mr noel vanstone rates my invaluable assistance at too low a figure here i remain biding my time till my fair relative wants me or till i make her want me which comes to the same thing if the anonymous letter falls by any accident into her hands she will find disparaging allusions in it to myself purposely introduced to suggest that the writer must be one of the persons whom i addressed while conducting her inquiries if mrs lecount takes the business in hand and lays a trap for mei decline her tempting invitation by becoming totally ignorant of the whole affair the instant any second person appears in it let the end come as it may here i am ready to profit by it here i am facing both ways with perfect ease and securitya moral agriculturist with his eye on two crops at once and his swindlers sickle ready for any emergency  for the next week to come the newspaper will be more interesting to me than ever i wonder which side i shall eventually belong to      the third scene  vauxhall walk lambeth    chapter i  the old archiepiscopal palace of lambeth on the southern bank of the thameswith its bishops walk and garden and its terrace fronting the riveris an architectural relic of the london of former times precious to all lovers of the picturesque in the utilitarian london of the present day southward of this venerable structure lies the street labyrinth of lambeth and nearly midway in that part of the maze of houses which is placed nearest to the river runs the dingy double row of buildings now as in former days known by the name of vauxhall walk  the network of dismal streets stretching over the surrounding neighborhood contains a population for the most part of the poorer order in the thoroughfares where shops abound the sordid struggle with poverty shows itself unreservedly on the filthy pavement gathers its forces through the week and strengthening to a tumult on saturday night sees the sunday morning dawn in murky gaslight miserable women whose faces never smile haunt the butchers shops in such london localities as these with relics of the mens wages saved from the publichouse clutched fast in their hands with eyes that devour the meat they dare not buy with eager fingers that touch it covetously as the fingers of their richer sisters touch a precious stone in this district as in other districts remote from the wealthy quarters of the metropolis the hideous london vagabondwith the filth of the street outmatched in his speech with the mud of the street outdirtied in his clotheslounges lowering and brutal at the street corner and the ginshop door the public disgrace of his country the unheeded warning of social troubles that are yet to come here the loud selfassertion of modern progresswhich has reformed so much in manners and altered so little in menmeets the flat contradiction that scatters its pretensions to the winds here while the national prosperity feasts like another belshazzar on the spectacle of its own magnificence is the writing on the wall which warns the monarch money that his glory is weighed in the balance and his power found wanting  situated in such a neighborhood as this vauxhall walk gains by comparison and establishes claims to respectability which no impartial observation can fail to recognize a large proportion of the walk is still composed of private houses in the scattered situations where shops appear those shops are not besieged by the crowds of more populous thoroughfares commerce is not turbulent nor is the public consumer besieged by loud invitations to buy birdfanciers have sought the congenial tranquillity of the scene and pigeons coo and canaries twitter in vauxhall walk secondhand carts and cabs bedsteads of a certain age detached carriagewheels for those who may want one to make up a set are all to be found here in the same repository one tributary stream in the great flood of gas which illuminates london tracks its parent source to works established in this locality here the followers of john wesley have set up a temple built before the period of methodist conversion to the principles of architectural religion and heremost striking object of allon the site where thousands of lights once sparkled where sweet sounds of music made night tuneful till morning dawned where the beauty and fashion of london feasted and danced through the summer seasons of a centuryspreads at this day an awful wilderness of mud and rubbish the deserted dead body of vauxhall gardens mouldering in the open air   on the same day when captain wragge completed the last entry in his chronicle of events a woman appeared at the window of one of the houses in vauxhall walk and removed from the glass a printed paper which had been wafered to it announcing that apartments were to be let the apartments consisted of two rooms on the first floor they had just been taken for a week certain by two ladies who had paid in advancethose two ladies being magdalen and mrs wragge  as soon as the mistress of the house had left the room magdalen walked to the window and cautiously looked out from it at the row of buildings opposite they were of superior pretensions in size and appearance to the other houses in the walk the date at which they had been erected was inscribed on one of them and was stated to be the year 1759 they stood back from the pavement separated from it by little strips of gardenground this peculiarity of position added to the breadth of the roadway interposing between them and the smaller houses opposite made it impossible for magdalen to see the numbers on the doors or to observe more of any one who might come to the windows than the bare general outline of dress and figure nevertheless there she stood anxiously fixing her eyes on one house in the row nearly opposite to herthe house she had looked for before entering the lodgings the house inhabited at that moment by noel vanstone and mrs lecount  after keeping watch at the window in silence for ten minutes or more she suddenly looked back into the room to observe the effect which her behavior might have produced on her traveling companion  not the slightest cause appeared for any apprehension in that quarter mrs wragge was seated at the table absorbed in the arrangement of a series of smart circulars and tempting pricelists issued by advertising tradespeople and flung in at the cabwindows as they left the london terminus ive often heard tell of light reading said mrs wragge restlessly shifting the positions of the circulars as a child restlessly shifts the position of a new set of toys heres light reading printed in pretty colors heres all the things im going to buy when im out shopping tomorrow lend us a pencil pleaseyou wont be angry will you i do so want to mark em off she looked up at magdalen chuckled joyfully over her own altered circumstances and beat her great hands on the table in irrepressible delight no cookerybook cried mrs wragge no buzzing in my head no captain to shave tomorrow im all down at heel my caps on one side and nobody bawls at me my heart alive here is a holiday and no mistake her hands began to drum on the table louder than ever until magdalen quieted them by presenting her with a pencil mrs wragge instantly recovered her dignity squared her elbows on the table and plunged into imaginary shopping for the rest of the evening  magdalen returned to the window she took a chair seated herself behind the curtain and steadily fixed her eyes once more on the house opposite  the blinds were down over the windows of the first floor and the second the window of the room on the groundfloor was uncovered and partly open but no living creature came near it doors opened and people came and went in the houses on either side children by the dozen poured out on the pavement to play and invaded the little strips of gardenground to recover lost balls and shuttlecocks streams of people passed backward and forward perpetually heavy wagons piled high with goods lumbered along the road on their way to or their way from the railway station near all the daily life of the district stirred with its ceaseless activity in every direction but one the hours passedand there was the house opposite still shut up still void of any signs of human existence inside or out the one object which had decided magdalen on personally venturing herself in vauxhall walkthe object of studying the looks manners and habits of mrs lecount and her master from a post of observation known only to herselfwas thus far utterly defeated after three hours watching at the window she had not even discovered enough to show her that the house was inhabited at all  shortly after six oclock the landlady disturbed mrs wragges studies by spreading the cloth for dinner magdalen placed herself at the table in a position which still enabled her to command the view from the window nothing happened the dinner came to an end mrs wragge lulled by the narcotic influence of annotating circulars and eating and drinking with an appetite sharpened by the captains absence withdrew to an armchair and fell asleep in an attitude which would have caused her husband the acutest mental suffering seven oclock struck the shadows of the summer evening lengthened stealthily on the gray pavement and the brown housewallsand still the closed door opposite remained shut still the one window open showed nothing but the black blank of the room inside lifeless and changeless as if that room had been a tomb  mrs wragges meek snoring deepened in tone the evening wore on drearily it was close on eight oclockwhen an event happened at last the street door opposite opened for the first time and a woman appeared on the threshold  was the woman mrs lecount no as she came nearer her dress showed her to be a servant she had a large doorkey in her hand and was evidently going out to perform an errand roused partly by curiosity partly by the impulse of the moment which urged her impetuous nature into action after the passive endurance of many hours past magdalen snatched up her bonnet and determined to follow the servant to her destination wherever it might be  the woman led her to the great thoroughfare of shops close at hand called lambeth walk after proceeding some little distance and looking about her with the hesitation of a person not well acquainted with the neighborhood the servant crossed the road and entered a stationers shop magdalen crossed the road after her and followed her in  the inevitable delay in entering the shop under these circumstances made magdalen too late to hear what the woman asked for the first words spoken however by the man behind the counter reached her ears and informed her that the servants object was to buy a railway guide  do you mean a guide for this month or a guide for july asked the shopman addressing his customer  master didnt tell me which answered the woman all i know is hes going into the country the day after tomorrow  the day after tomorrow is the first of july said the shopman the guide your master wants is the guide for the new month it wont be published till tomorrow  engaging to call again on the next day the servant left the shop and took the way that led back to vauxhall walk  magdalen purchased the first trifle she saw on the counter and hastily returned in the same direction the discovery she had just made was of very serious importance to her and she felt the necessity of acting on it with as little delay as possible  on entering the front room at the lodgings she found mrs wragge just awake lost in drowsy bewilderment with her cap fallen off on her shoulders and with one of her shoes missing altogether magdalen endeavored to persuade her that she was tired after her journey and that her wisest proceeding would be to go to bed mrs wragge was perfectly willing to profit by this suggestion provided she could find her shoe first in looking for the shoe she unfortunately discovered the circulars put by on a sidetable and forthwith recovered her recollection of the earlier proceedings of the evening  give us the pencil said mrs wragge shuffling the circulars in a violent hurry i cant go to bed yeti havent half done marking down the things i want lets see where did i leave off try finchs feedingbottle for infants no theres a cross against that the cross means i dont want it comfort in the field bucklers indestructible huntingbreeches oh dear dear ive lost the place no i havent here it is heres my mark against it elegant cashmere robes strictly oriental very grand reduced to one pound nineteenandsixpence be in time only three left only three oh do lend us the money and lets go and get one  not tonight said magdalen suppose you go to bed now and finish the circulars tomorrow i will put them by the bedside for you and you can go on with them as soon as you wake the first thing in the morning  this suggestion met with mrs wragges immediate approval magdalen took her into the next room and put her to bed like a childwith her toys by her side the room was so narrow and the bed was so small and mrs wragge arrayed in the white apparel proper for the occasion with her moonface framed round by a spacious halo of nightcap looked so hugely and disproportionately large that magdalen anxious as she was could not repress a smile on taking leave of her traveling companion for the night  aha cried mrs wragge cheerfully well have that cashmere robe tomorrow come here i want to whisper something to you just you look at meim going to sleep crooked and the captains not here to bawl at me   the front room at the lodgings contained a sofabedstead which the landlady arranged betimes for the night this done and the candles brought in magdalen was left alone to shape the future course as her own thoughts counseled her  the questions and answers which had passed in her presence that evening at the stationers shop led plainly to the conclusion that one day more would bring noel vanstones present term of residence in vauxhall walk to an end her first cautious resolution to pass many days together in unsuspected observation of the house opposite before she ventured herself inside was entirely frustrated by the turn events had taken she was placed in the dilemma of running all risks headlong on the next day or of pausing for a future opportunity which might never occur there was no middle course open to her until she had seen noel vanstone with her own eyes and had discovered the worst there was to fear from mrs lecountuntil she had achieved t his double object with the needful precaution of keeping her own identity carefully in the darknot a step could she advance toward the accomplishment of the purpose which had brought her to london  one after another the minutes of the night passed away one after another the thronging thoughts followed each other over her mindand still she reached no conclusion still she faltered and doubted with a hesitation new to her in her experience of herself at last she crossed the room impatiently to seek the trivial relief of unlocking her trunk and taking from it the few things that she wanted for the night captain wragges suspicions had not misled him there hidden between two dresses were the articles of costume which he had missed from her box at birmingham she turned them over one by one to satisfy herself that nothing she wanted had been forgotten and returned once more to her post of observation by the window  the house opposite was dark down to the parlor there the blind previously raised was now drawn over the window the light burning behind it showed her for the first time that the room was inhabited her eyes brightened and her color rose as she looked at it  there he is she said to herself in a low angry whisper there he lives on our money in the house that his fathers warning has closed against me she dropped the blind which she had raised to look out returned to her trunk and took from it the gray wig which was part of her dramatic costume in the character of the northcountry lady the wig had been crumpled in packing she put it on and went to the toilettable to comb it out his father has warned him against magdalen vanstone she said repeating the passage in mrs lecounts letter and laughing bitterly as she looked at herself in the glass i wonder whether his father has warned him against miss garth tomorrow is sooner than i bargained for no matter tomorrow shall show    chapter ii  the early morning when magdalen rose and looked out was cloudy and overcast but as time advanced to the breakfast hour the threatening of rain passed away and she was free to provide without hinderance from the weather for the first necessity of the daythe necessity of securing the absence of her traveling companion from the house  mrs wragge was dressed armed at all points with her collection of circulars and eager to be away by ten oclock at an earlier hour magdalen had provided for her being properly taken care of by the landladys eldest daughtera quiet wellconducted girl whose interest in the shopping expedition was readily secured by a little present of money for the purchase on her own account of a parasol and a muslin dress shortly after ten oclock magdalen dismissed mrs wragge and her attendant in a cab she then joined the landladywho was occupied in setting the rooms in order upstairswith the object of ascertaining by a little welltimed gossip what the daily habits might be of the inmates of the house  she discovered that there were no other lodgers but mrs wragge and herself the landladys husband was away all day employed at a railway station her second daughter was charged with the care of the kitchen in the elder sisters absence the younger children were at school and would be back at one oclock to dinner the landlady herself got up fine linen for ladies and expected to be occupied over her work all that morning in a little room built out at the back of the premises thus there was every facility for magdalens leaving the house in disguise and leaving it unobserved provided she went out before the children came back to dinner at one oclock  by eleven oclock the apartments were set in order and the landlady had retired to pursue her own employments magdalen softly locked the door of her room drew the blind over the window and entered at once on her preparations for the perilous experiment of the day  the same quick perception of dangers to be avoided and difficulties to be overcome which had warned her to leave the extravagant part of her character costume in the box at birmingham now kept her mind fully alive to the vast difference between a disguise worn by gaslight for the amusement of an audience and a disguise assumed by daylight to deceive the searching eyes of two strangers the first article of dress which she put on was an old gown of her own made of the material called alpaca of a darkbrown color with a neat pattern of little starshaped spots in white a double flounce running round the bottom of this dress was the only milliners ornament which it presentedan ornament not at all out of character with the costume appropriated to an elderly lady the disguise of her head and face was the next object of her attention she fitted and arranged the gray wig with the dexterity which constant practice had given her fixed the false eyebrows made rather large and of hair darker than the wig carefully in their position with the gum she had with her for the purpose and stained her face with the customary stage materials so as to change the transparent fairness of her complexion to the dull faintly opaque color of a woman in ill health the lines and markings of age followed next and here the first obstacles presented themselves the art which succeeded by gaslight failed by day the difficulty of hiding the plainly artificial nature of the marks was almost insuperable she turned to her trunk took from it two veils and putting on her oldfashioned bonnet tried the effect of them in succession one of the veils of black lace was too thick to be worn over the face at that summer season without exciting remark the other of plain net allowed her features to be seen through it just indistinctly enough to permit the safe introduction of certain lines many fewer than she was accustomed to use in performing the character on the forehead and at the sides of the mouth but the obstacle thus set aside only opened the way to a new difficultythe difficulty of keeping her veil down while she was speaking to other persons without any obvious reason for doing so an instants consideration and a chance look at her little china palette of stage colors suggested to her ready invention the production of a visible excuse for wearing her veil she deliberately disfigured herself by artificially reddening the insides of her eyelids so as to produce an appearance of inflammation which no human creature but a doctorand that doctor at close quarterscould have detected as false she sprang to her feet and looked triumphantly at the hideous transformation of herself reflected in the glass who could think it strange now if she wore her veil down and if she begged mrs lecounts permission to sit with her back to the light  her last proceeding was to put on the quiet gray cloak which she had brought from birmingham and which had been padded inside by captain wragges own experienced hands so as to hide the youthful grace and beauty of her back and shoulders her costume being now complete she practiced the walk which had been originally taught her as appropriate to the charactera walk with a slight limpand returning to the glass after a minutes trial exercised herself next in the disguise of her voice and manner this was the only part of the character in which it had been possible with her physical peculiarities to produce an imitation of miss garth and here the resemblance was perfect the harsh voice the blunt manner the habit of accompanying certain phrases by an emphatic nod of the head the northumbrian burr expressing itself in every word which contained the letter rall these personal peculiarities of the old northcountry governess were reproduced to the life the personal transformation thus completed was literally what captain wragge had described it to bea triumph in the art of selfdisguise excepting the one case of seeing her face close with a strong light on it nobody who now looked at magdalen could have suspected for an instant that she was other than an ailing illmade unattractive woman of fifty years old at least  before unlocking the door she looked about her carefully to make sure that none of her stage materials were exposed to view in case the landlady entered the room in her absence the only forgotten object belonging to her that she discovered was a little packet of norahs letters which she had been reading overnight and which had been accidentally pushed under the lookingglass while she was engaged in dressing herself as she took up the letters to put them away the thought struck her for the first time would norah know me now if we met each other in the street she looked in the glass and smiled sadly no she said not even norah  she unlocked the door after first looking at her watch it was close on twelve oclock there was barely an hour left to try her desperate experiment and to return to the lodging before the landladys children came back from school  an instants listening on the landing assured her that all was quiet in the passage below she noiselessly descended the stairs and gained the street without having met any living creature on her way out of the house in another minute she had crossed the road and had knocked at noel vanstones door  the door was opened by the same womanservant whom she had followed on the previous evening to the stationers shop with a momentary tremor which recalled the memorable first night of her appearance in public magdalen inquired in miss garths voice and with miss garths manner for mrs lecount  mrs lecount has gone out maam said the servant  is mr vanstone at home asked magdalen her resolution asserting itself at once against the first obstacle that opposed it  my master is not up yet maam  another check a weaker nature would have accepted the warning magdalens nature rose in revolt against it  what time will mrs lecount be back she asked  about one oclock maam  say if you please that i will call again as soon after one oclock as possible i particularly wish to see mrs lecount my name is miss garth  she turned and left the house going back to her own room was out of the question the servant as magdalen knew by not hearing the door close was looking after her and moreover she would expose herself if she went indoors to the risk of going out again exactly at the time when the landladys children were sure to be about the house she turned mechanically to the right walked on until she recalled vauxhall bridge and waited there looking out over the river  the interval of unemployed time now before her was nearly an hour how should she occupy it  as she asked herself the question the thought which had struck her when she put away the packet of norahs letters rose in her mind once more a sudden impulse to test the miserable completeness of her disguise mixed with the higher and purer feeling at her heart and strengthened her natural longing to see her sisters face again though she dare not discover herself and speak norahs later letters had described in the fullest details her life as a governessher hours for teaching her hours of leisure her hours for walking out with her pupils there was just time if she could find a vehicle at once for magdalen to drive to the house of norahs employer with the chance of getting there a few minutes before the hour when her sister would be going out one look at her will tell me more than a hundred letters with that thought in her heart with the one object of following norah on her daily walk under protection of the disguise magdalen hastened over the bridge and made for the northern bank of the river  so at the turningpoint of her lifeso in the interval before she took the irrevocable step and passed the threshold of noel vanstones doorthe forces of good triumphing in the strife for her over the forces of evil turned her back on the scene of her meditated deception and hurried her mercifully further and further away from the fatal house   she stopped the first empty cab that passed her told the driver to go to new street spring gardens and promised to double his fare if he reached his destination by a given time the man earned the moneymore than earned it as the event proved magdalen had not taken ten steps in advance along new street walking toward st jamess park before the door of a house beyond her opened and a lady in mourning came out accompanied by two little girls the lady also took the direction of the park without turning her head toward magdalen as she descended the house step it mattered little magdalens heart looked through her eyes and told her that she saw norah  she followed them into st jamess park and thence along the mall into the green park venturing closer and closer as they reached the grass and ascended the rising ground in the direction of hyde park corner her eager eyes devoured every detail in norahs dress and detected the slightest change that had taken place in her figure and her bearing she had become thinner since the autumnher head drooped a little she walked wearily her mourning dress worn with the modest grace and neatness which no misfortune could take from her was suited to her altered station her black gown was made of stuff her black shawl and bonnet were of the plainest and cheapest kind the two little girls walking on either side of her were dressed in silk magdalen instinctively hated them  she made a wide circuit on the grass so as to turn gradually and meet her sister without exciting suspicion that the meeting was contrived her heart beat fast a burning heat glowed in her as she thought of her false hair her false color her false dress and saw the dear familiar face coming nearer and nearer they passed each other close norahs dark gentle eyes looked up with a deeper light in them with a sadder beauty than of oldrested all unconscious of the truth on her sisters faceand looked away from it again as from the face of a stranger that glance of an instant struck magdalen to the heart she stood rooted to the ground after norah had passed by a horror of the vile disguise that concealed her a yearning to burst its trammels and hide her shameful painted face on norahs bosom took possession of her body and soul she turned and looked back  norah and the two children had reached the higher ground and were close to one of the gates in the iron railing which fenced the park from the street drawn by an irresistible fascination magdalen followed them again gained on them as they reached the gate and heard the voices of the two children raised in angry dispute which way they wanted to walk next she saw norah take them through the gate and then stoop and speak to them while waiting for an opportunity to cross the road they only grew the louder and the angrier for what she said the youngesta girl of eight or nine years oldflew into a childs vehement passion cried screamed and even kicked at the governess the people in the street stopped and laughed some of them jestingly advised a little wholesome correction one woman asked norah if she was the childs mother another pitied her audibly for being the childs governess before magdalen could push her way through the crowdbefore her allmastering anxiety to help her sister had blinded her to every other consideration and had brought her selfbetrayed to norahs sidean open carriage passed the pavement slowly hindered in its progress by the press of vehicles before it an old lady seated inside heard the childs cries recognized norah and called to her immediately the footman parted the crowd and the children were put into the carriage its lucky i happened to pass this way said the old lady beckoning contemptuously to norah to take her place on the front seat you never could manage my daughters children and you never will the footman put up the steps the carriage drove on with the children and the governess the crowd dispersed and magdalen was alone again   so be it she thought bitterly i should only have distressed her we should only have had the misery of parting to suffer again  she mechanically retraced her steps she returned as in a dream to the open space of the park arming itself treacherously with the strength of her love for her sister with the vehemence of the indignation that she felt for her sisters sake the terrible temptation of her life fastened its hold on her more firmly than ever through all the paint and disfigurement of the disguise the fierce despair of that strong and passionate nature lowered haggard and horrible norah made an object of public curiosity and amusement norah reprimanded in the open street norah the hired victim of an old womans insolence and a childs illtemper and the same man to thank for it who had sent frank to chinaand that mans son to thank after him the thought of her sister which had turned her from the scene of her meditated deception which had made the consciousness of her own disguise hateful to her was now the thought which sanctioned that means or any means to compass her end the thought which set wings to her feet and hurried her back nearer and nearer to the fatal house   she left the park again and found herself in the streets without knowing where once more she hailed the first cab that passed her and told the man to drive to vauxhall walk  the change from walking to riding quieted her she felt her attention returning to herself and her dress the necessity of making sure that no accident had happened to her disguise in the interval since she had left her own room impressed itself immediately on her mind she stopped the driver at the first pastrycooks shop which he passed and there obtained the means of consulting a lookingglass before she ventured back to vauxhall walk  her gray headdress was disordered and the oldfashioned bonnet was a little on one side nothing else had suffered she set right the few defects in her costume and returned to the cab it was halfpast one when she approached the house and knocked for the second time at noel vanstones door the womanservant opened it as before  has mrs lecount come back  yes maam step this way if you please  the servant preceded magdalen along an empty passage and leading her past an uncarpeted staircase opened the door of a room at the back of the house the room was lighted by one window looking out on a yard the walls were bare the boarded floor was uncovered two bedroom chairs stood against the wall and a kitchentable was placed under the window on the table stood a glass tank filled with water and ornamented in the middle by a miniature pyramid of rockwork interlaced with weeds snails clung to the sides of the tank tadpoles and tiny fish swam swiftly in the green water slippery efts and slimy frogs twined their noiseless way in and out of the weedy rockwork and on top of the pyramid there sat solitary cold as the stone brown as the stone motionless as the stone a little brighteyed toad the art of keeping fish and reptiles as domestic pets had not at that time been popularized in england and magdalen on entering the room started back in irrepressible astonishment and disgust from the first specimen of an aquarium that she had ever seen  dont be alarmed said a womans voice behind her my pets hurt nobody  magdalen turned and confronted mrs lecount she had expectedfounding her anticipations on the letter which the housekeeper had written to herto see a hard wily illfavored insolent old woman she found herself in the presence of a lady of mild ingratiating manners whose dress was the perfection of neatness taste and matronly simplicity whose personal appearance was little less than a triumph of physical resistance to the deteriorating influence of time if mrs lecount had struck some fifteen or sixteen years off her real age and had asserted herself to be eightandthirty there would not have been one man in a thousand or one woman in a hundred who would have hesitated to believe her her dark hair was just turning to gray and no more it was plainly parted under a spotless lace cap sparingly ornamented with mourning ribbons not a wrinkle appeared on her smooth white forehead or her plump white cheeks her double chin was dimpled and her teeth were marvels of whiteness and regularity her lips might have been critically considered as too thin if they had not been accustomed to make the best of their defects by means of a pleading and persuasive smile her large black eyes might have looked fierce if they had been set in the face of another woman they were mild and melting in the face of mrs lecount they were tenderly interested in everything she looked atin magdalen in the toad on the rockwork in the backyard view from the window in her own plump fair handswhich she rubbed softly one over the other while she spoke in her own pretty cambric chemisette which she had a habit of looking at complacently while she listened to others the elegant black gown in which she mourned the memory of michael vanstone was not a mere dressit was a wellmade compliment paid to death her innocent white muslin apron was a little domestic poem in itself her jet earrings were so modest in their pretensions that a quaker might have looked at them and committed no sin the comely plumpness of her face was matched by the comely plumpness of her figure it glided smoothly over the ground it flowed in sedate undulations when she walked there are not many men who could have observed mrs lecount entirely from the platonic point of viewlads in their teens would have found her irresistiblewomen only could have hardened their hearts against her and mercilessly forced their way inward through that fair and smiling surface magdalens first glance at this venus of the autumn period of female life more than satisfied her that she had done well to feel her ground in disguise before she ventured on matching herself against mrs lecount  have i the pleasure of addressing the lady who called this morning inquired the housekeeper am i speaking to miss garth  something in the expression of her eyes as she asked that question warned magdalen to turn her face further inward from the window than she had turned it yet the bare doubt whether the housekeeper might not have seen her already under too strong a light shook her selfpossession for the moment she gave herself time to recover it and merely answered by a bow  accept my excuses maam for the place in which i am compelled to receive you proceeded mrs lecount in fluent english spoken with a foreign accent mr vanstone is only here for a temporary purpose we leave for the seaside tomorrow afternoon and it has not been thought worth while to set the house in proper order will you take a seat and oblige me by mentioning the object of your visit  she glided imperceptibly a step or two nearer to magdalen and placed a chair for her exactly opposite the light from the window pray sit down said mrs lecount looking with the tenderest interest at the visitors inflamed eyes through the visitors net veil  i am suffering as you see from a complaint in the eyes replied magdalen steadily keeping her profile toward the window and carefully pitching her voice to the tone of miss garths i must beg your permission to wear my veil down and to sit away from the light she said those words feeling mistress of herself again with perfect composure she drew the chair back into the corner of the room beyond the window and seated herself keeping the shadow of her bonnet well over her face mrs lecounts persuasive lips murmured a polite expression of sympathy mrs lecounts amiable black eyes looked more interested in the strange lady than ever she placed a chair for herself exactly on a line with magdalens and sat so close to the wall as to force her visitor either to turn her head a little further round toward the window or to fail in politeness by not looking at the person whom she addressed yes said mrs lecount with a confidential little c ough and to what circumstances am i indebted for the honor of this visit  may i inquire first if my name happens to be familiar to you said magdalen turning toward her as a matter of necessity but coolly holding up her handkerchief at the same time between her face and the light  no answered mrs lecount with another little cough rather harsher than the first the name of miss garth is not familiar to me  in that case pursued magdalen i shall best explain the object that causes me to intrude on you by mentioning who i am i lived for many years as governess in the family of the late mr andrew vanstone of comberaven and i come here in the interest of his orphan daughters  mrs lecounts hands which had been smoothly sliding one over the other up to this time suddenly stopped and mrs lecounts lips selfforgetfully shutting up owned they were too thin at the very outset of the interview  i am surprised you can bear the light outofdoors without a green shade she quietly remarked leaving the false miss garths announcement of herself as completely unnoticed as it she had not spoken at all  i find a shade over my eyes keeps them too hot at this time of the year rejoined magdalen steadily matching the housekeepers composure may i ask whether you heard what i said just now on the subject of my errand in this house  may i inquire on my side maam in what way that errand can possibly concern me retorted mrs lecount  certainly said magdalen i come to you because mr noel vanstones intentions toward the two young ladies were made known to them in the form of a letter from yourself  that plain answer had its effect it warned mrs lecount that the strange lady was better informed than she had at first suspected and that it might hardly be wise under the circumstances to dismiss her unheard  pray pardon me said the housekeeper i scarcely understood before i perfectly understand now you are mistaken maam in supposing that i am of any importance or that i exercise any influence in this painful matter i am the mouthpiece of mr noel vanstone the pen he holds if you will excuse the expressionnothing more he is an invalid and like other invalids he has his bad days and his good it was his bad day when that answer was written to the young personshall i call her miss vanstone i will with pleasure poor girl for who am i to make distinctions and what is it to me whether her parents were married or not as i was saying it was one of mr noel vanstones bad days when that answer was sent and therefore i had to write it simply as his secretary for want of a better if you wish to speak on the subject of these young ladiesshall i call them young ladies as you did just now no poor things i will call them the misses vanstoneif you wish to speak on the subject of these misses vanstone i will mention your name and your object in favoring me with this call to mr noel vanstone he is alone in the parlor and this is one of his good days i have the influence of an old servant over him and i will use that influence with pleasure in your behalf shall i go at once asked mrs lecount rising with the friendliest anxiety to make herself useful  if you please replied magdalen and if i am not taking any undue advantage of your kindness  on the contrary rejoined mrs lecount you are laying me under an obligationyou are permitting me in my very limited way to assist the performance of a benevolent action she bowed smiled and glided out of the room  left by herself magdalen allowed the anger which she had suppressed in mrs lecounts presence to break free from her for want of a nobler object to attack it took the direction of the toad the sight of the hideous little reptile sitting placid on his rock throne with his bright eyes staring impenetrably into vacancy irritated every nerve in her body she looked at the creature with a shrinking intensity of hatred she whispered at it maliciously through her set teeth i wonder whose blood runs coldest she said yours you little monster or mrs lecounts i wonder which is the slimiest her heart or your back you hateful wretch do you know what your mistress is your mistress is a devil  the speckled skin under the toads mouth mysteriously wrinkled itself then slowly expanded again as if he had swallowed the words just addressed to him magdalen started back in disgust from the first perceptible movement in the creatures body trifling as it was and returned to her chair she had not seated herself again a moment too soon the door opened noiselessly and mrs lecount appeared once more  mr vanstone will see you she said if you will kindly wait a few minutes he will ring the parlor bell when his present occupation is at an end and he is ready to receive you be careful maam not to depress his spirits nor to agitate him in any way his heart has been a cause of serious anxiety to those about him from his earliest years there is no positive disease there is only a chronic feeblenessa fatty degenerationa want of vital power in the organ itself his heart will go on well enough if you dont give his heart too much to dothat is the advice of all the medical men who have seen him you will not forget it and you will keep a guard over your conversation accordingly talking of medical men have you ever tried the golden ointment for that sad affliction in your eyes it has been described to me as an excellent remedy  it has not succeeded in my case replied magdalen sharply before i see mr noel vanstone she continued may i inquire  i beg your pardon interposed mrs lecount does your question refer in any way to those two poor girls  it refers to the misses vanstone  then i cant enter into it excuse me i really cant discuss these poor girls i am so glad to hear you call them the misses vanstone except in my masters presence and by my masters express permission let us talk of something else while we are waiting here will you notice my glass tank i have every reason to believe that it is a perfect novelty in england  i looked at the tank while you were out of the room said magdalen  did you you take no interest in the subject i dare say quite natural i took no interest either until i was married my dear husbanddead many years sinceformed my tastes and elevated me to himself you have heard of the late professor lecomte the eminent swiss naturalist i am his widow the english circle at zurich where i lived in my late masters service anglicized my name to lecount your generous country people will have nothing foreign about themnot even a name if they can help it but i was speaking of my husbandmy dear husband who permitted me to assist him in his pursuits i have had only one interest since his deathan interest in science eminent in many things the professor was great at reptiles he left me his subjects and his tank i had no other legacy there is the tank all the subjects died but this quiet little fellowthis nice little toad are you surprised at my liking him there is nothing to be surprised at the professor lived long enough to elevate me above the common prejudice against the reptile creation properly understood the reptile creation is beautiful properly dissected the reptile creation is instructive in the last degree she stretched out her little finger and gently stroked the toads back with the tip of it so refreshing to the touch said mrs lecountso nice and cool this summer weather  the bell from the parlor rang mrs lecount rose bent fondly over the aquarium and chirruped to the toad at parting as if it had been a bird mr vanstone is ready to receive you follow me if you please miss garth with these words she opened the door and led the way out of the room    chapter iii  miss garth sir said mrs lecount opening the parlor door and announcing the visitors appearance with the tone and manner of a wellbred servant  magdalen found herself in a long narrow room consisting of a back parlor and a front parlor which had been thrown into one by opening the foldingdoors between them seated not far from the front window with his back to the light she saw a frail flaxenhaired selfsatisfied little man clothed in a fair white dressinggown many sizes too large for him with a nosegay of violets drawn neatly through the buttonhole over his breast he looked from thirty to fiveandthirty years old his complexion was as delicate as a young girls his eyes were of the lightest blue his upper lip was adorned by a weak little white mustache waxed and twisted at either end into a thin spiral curl when any object specially attracted his attention he half closed his eyelids to look at it when he smiled the skin at his temples crumpled itself up into a nest of wicked little wrinkles he had a plate of strawberries on his lap with a napkin under them to preserve the purity of his white dressinggown at his right hand stood a large round table covered with a collection of foreign curiosities which seemed to have been brought together from the four quarters of the globe stuffed birds from africa porcelain monsters from china silver ornaments and utensils from india and peru mosaic work from italy and bronzes from france were all heaped together pellmell with the coarse deal boxes and dingy leather cases which served to pack them for traveling the little man apologized with a cheerful and simpering conceit for his litter of curiosities his dressinggown and his delicate health and waving his hand toward a chair placed his attention with pragmatical politeness at the visitors disposal magdalen looked at him with a momentary doubt whether mrs lecount had not deceived her was this the man who mercilessly followed the path on which his merciless father had walked before him she could hardly believe it take a seat miss garth he repeated observing her hesitation and announcing his own name in a high thin fretfullyconsequential voice i am mr noel vanstone you wished to see mehere i am  may i be permitted to retire sir inquired mrs lecount  certainly not replied her master stay here lecount and keep us company mrs lecount has my fullest confidence he continued addressing magdalen whatever you say to me maam you say to her she is a domestic treasure there is not another house in england has such a treasure as mrs lecount  the housekeeper listened to the praise of her domestic virtues with eyes immovably fixed on her elegant chemisette but magdalens quick penetration had previously detected a look that passed between mrs lecount and her master which suggested that noel vanstone had been instructed beforehand what to say and do in his visitors presence the suspicion of this and the obstacles which the room presented to arranging her position in it so as to keep her face from the light warned magdalen to be on her guard  she had taken her chair at first nearly midway in the room an instants afterreflection induced her to move her seat toward the left hand so as to place herself just inside and close against the left post of the foldingdoor in this position she dexterously barred the only passage by which mrs lecount could have skirted round the large table and contrived to front magdalen by taking a chair at her masters side on the right hand of the table the empty space was well occupied by the fireplace and fender by some travelingtrunks and a large packingcase there was no alternative left for mrs lecount but to place herself on a line with magdalen against the opposite post of the foldingdoor or to push rudely past the visitor with the obvious intention of getting in front of her with an expressive little cough and with one steady look at her master the housekeeper conceded the point and took her seat against the righthand doorpost wait a little thought mrs lecount my turn next  mind what you are about maam cried noel vanstone as magdalen accidentally approached the table in moving her chair mind the sleeve of your cloak excuse me you nearly knocked down that silver candlestick pray dont suppose its a common candlestick its nothing of the sortits a peruvian candlestick there are only three of that pattern in the world one is in the possession of the president of peru one is locked up in the vatican and one is on my table it cost ten pounds its worth fifty one of my fathers bargains maam all these things are my fathers bargains there is not another house in england which has such curiosities as these sit down lecount i beg you will make yourself comfortable mrs lecount is like the curiosities miss garthshe is one of my fathers bargains you are one of my fathers bargains are you not lecount my father was a remarkable man maam you will be reminded of him here at every turn i have got his dressinggown on at this moment no such linen as this is made nowyou cant get it for love or money would you like to feel the texture perhaps youre no judge of texture perhaps you would prefer talking to me about these two pupils of yours they are two are they not are they fine girls plump fresh fullblown english beauties  excuse me sir interposed mrs lecount sorrowfully i must really beg permission to retire if you speak of the poor things in that way i cant sit by sir and hear them turned into ridicule consider their position consider miss garth  you good creature said noel vanstone surveying the housekeeper through his halfclosed eyelids you excellent lecount i assure you maam mrs lecount is a worthy creature you will observe that she pities the two girls i dont go so far as that myself but i can make allowances for them i am a largeminded man i can make allowances for them and for you he smiled with the most cordial politeness and helped himself to a strawberry from the dish on his lap  you shock miss garth indeed sir without meaning it you shock miss garth remonstrated mrs lecount she is not accustomed to you as i am consider miss garth sir as a favor to me consider miss garth  thus far magdalen had resolutely kept silence the burning anger which would have betrayed her in an instant if she had let it flash its way to the surface throbbed fast and fiercely at her heart and warned her while noel vanstone was speaking to close her lips she would have allowed him to talk on uninterruptedly for some minutes more if mrs lecount had not interfered for the second time the refined insolence of the housekeepers pity was a womans insolence and it stung her into instantly controlling herself she had never more admirably imitated miss garths voice and manner than when she spoke her next words  you are very good she said to mrs lecount i make no claim to be treated with any extraordinary consideration i am a governess and i dont expect it i have only one favor to ask i beg mr noel vanstone for his own sake to hear what i have to say to him  you understand sir observed mrs lecount it appears that miss garth has some serious warning to give you she says you are to hear her for your own sake  mr noel vanstones fair complexion suddenly turned white he put away the plate of strawberries among his fathers bargains his hand shook and his little figure twisted itself uneasily in the chair magdalen observed him attentively one discovery already she thought he is a coward  what do you mean maam asked noel vanstone with visible trepidation of look and manner what do you mean by telling me i must listen to you for my own sake if you come her to intimidate me you come to the wrong man my strength of character was universally noticed in our circle at zurichwasnt it lecount  universally sir said mrs lecount but let us hear miss garth perhaps i have misinterpreted her meaning  on the contrary replied magdalen you have exactly expressed my meaning my object in coming here is to warn mr noel vanstone against the course which he is now taking  dont pleaded mrs lecount oh if you want to help these poor girls dont talk in that way soften his resolution maam by entreaties dont strengthen it by threats she a little overstrained the tone of humility in which she spoke those wordsa little overacted the look of apprehension which accompanied them if magdalen had not seen plainly enough already that it was mrs lecounts habitual practice to decide everything for her master in the first instance and then to persuade him that he was not acting under his housekeepers resolution but under his own she would have seen it now  you hear what lecount has just said remarked noel vanstone you hear the unsolicited testimony of a person who has known me from childhood take care miss garthtake care he complacently arranged the tails of his white dressinggown over his knees and took the plate of strawberries back on his lap  i have no wish to offend you said magdalen i am only anxious to open your eyes to the truth you are not acquainted with the characters of the two sisters whose fortunes have fallen into your possession i have known them from childhood and i come to give you the benefit of my experience in their interests and in yours you have nothing to dread from the elder of the two she patiently accepts the hard lot which you and your father before you have forced on her the younger sisters conduct is the very opposite of this she has already declined to submit to your fathers decision and she now refuses to be silenced by mrs lecounts letter take my word for it she is capable of giving you serious trouble if you persist in making an enemy of her  noel vanstone changed color once more and began to fidget again in his chair serious trouble he repeated with a blank look if you mean writing letters maam she has given trouble enough already she has written once to me and twice to my father one of the letters to my father was a threatening letterwasnt it lecount  she expressed her feelings poor child said mrs lecount i thought it hard to send her back her letter but your dear father knew best what i said at the time was why not let her express her feelings what are a few threatening words after all in her position poor creature they are words and nothing more  i advise you not to be too sure of that said magdalen i know her better than you do  she paused at those wordspaused in a momentary terror the sting of mrs lecounts pity had nearly irritated her into forgetting her assumed character and speaking in her own voice  you have referred to the letters written by my pupil she resumed addressing noel vanstone as soon as she felt sure of herself again we will say nothing about what she has written to your father we will only speak of what she has written to you is there anything unbecoming in her letter anything said in it that is false is it not true that these two sisters have been cruelly deprived of the provision which their father made for them his will to this day speaks for him and for them and it only speaks to no purpose because he was not aware that his marriage obliged him to make it again and because he died before he could remedy the error can you deny that  noel vanstone smiled and helped himself to a strawberry i dont attempt to deny it he said go on miss garth  is it not true persisted magdalen that the law which has taken the money from these sisters whose father made no second will has now given that very money to you whose father made no will at all surely explain it how you may this is hard on those orphan girls  very hard replied noel vanstone it strikes you in that light toodoesnt it lecount  mrs lecount shook her head and closed her handsome black eyes harrowing she said i can characterize it miss garth by no other wordharrowing how the young personno how miss vanstone the youngerdiscovered that my late respected master made no will i am at a loss to understand perhaps it was put in the papers but i am interrupting you miss garth do have something more to say about your pupils letter she noiselessly drew her chair forward as she said these words a few inches beyond the line of the visitors chair the attempt was neatly made but it proved useless magdalen only kept her head more to the left and the packingcase on the floor prevented mrs lecount from advancing any further  i have only one more question to put said magdalen my pupils letter addressed a proposal to mr noel vanstone i beg him to inform me why he has refused to consider it  my good lady cried noel vanstone arching his white eyebrows in satirical astonishment are you really in earnest do you know what the proposal is have you seen the letter  i am quite in earnest said magdalen and i have seen the letter it entreats you to remember how mr andrew vanstones fortune has come into your hands it informs you that onehalf of that fortune divided between his daughters was what his will intended them to have and it asks of your sense of justice to do for his children what he would have done for them himself if he had lived in plainer words still it asks you to give onehalf of the money to the daughters and it leaves you free to keep the other half yourself that is the proposal why have you refused to consider it  for the simplest possible reason miss garth said noel vanstone in high goodhumor allow me to remind you of a wellknown proverb a fool and his money are soon parted whatever else i may be maam im not a fool  dont put it in that way sir remonstrated mrs lecount be seriouspray be serious  quite impossible lecount rejoined her master i cant be serious my poor father miss garth took a high moral point of view in this matter lecount there takes a high moral point of viewdont you lecount i do nothing of the sort i have lived too long in the continental atmosphere to trouble myself about moral points of view my course in this business is as plain as two and two make four i have got the money and i should be a born idiot if i parted with it there is my point of view simple enough isnt it i dont stand on my dignity i dont meet you with the law which is all on my side i dont blame your coming here as a total stranger to try and alter my resolution i dont blame the two girls for wanting to dip their fingers into my purse all i say is i am not fool enough to open it pas si bete as we used to say in the english circle at zurich you understand french miss garth pas si bete he set aside his plate of strawberries once more and daintily dried his fingers on his fine white napkin  magdalen kept her temper if she could have struck him dead by lifting her hand at that moment it is probable she would have lifted it but she kept her temper  am i to understand she asked that the last words you have to say in this matter are the words said for you in mrs lecounts letter  precisely so replied noel vanstone  you have inherited your own fathers fortune as well as the fortune of mr andrew vanstone and yet you feel no obligation to act from motives of justice or generosity toward these two sisters all you think it necessary to say to them is you have got the money and you refuse to part with a single farthing of it  most accurately stated miss garth you are a woman of business lecount miss garth is a woman of business  dont appeal to me sir cried mrs lecount gracefully wringing her plump white hands i cant bear it i must interfere let me suggestoh what do you call it in englisha compromise dear mr noel you are perversely refusing to do yourself justice you have better reasons than the reason you have given to miss garth you follow your honored fathers example you feel it due to his memory to act in this matter as he acted before you that is his reason miss garth i implore you on my knees to take that as his reason he will do what his dear father did no more no less his dear father made a proposal and he himself will now make that proposal over again yes mr noel you will remember what this poor girl says in her letter to you her sister has been obliged to go out as a governess and she herself in losing her fortune has lost the hope of her marriage for years and years to come you will remember thisand you will give the hundred pounds to one and the hundred pounds to the other which your admirable father offered in the past time if he does this miss garth will he do enough if he gives a hundred pounds each to these unfortunate sisters  he will repent the insult to the last hour of his life said magdalen  the instant that answer passed her lips she would have given worlds to recall it mrs lecount had planted her sting in the right place at last those rash words of magdalens had burst from her passionately in her own voice  nothing but the habit of public performance saved her from making the serious error that she had committed more palpable still by attempting to set it right here her past practice in the entertainment came to her rescue and urged her to go on instantly in miss garths voice as if nothing had happened  you mean well mrs lecount she continued but you are doing harm instead of good my pupils will accept no such compromise as you propose i am sorry to have spoken violently just now i beg you will excuse me she looked hard for information in the housekeepers face while she spoke those conciliatory words mrs lecount baffled the look by putting her handkerchief to her eyes had she or had she not noticed the momentary change in magdalens voice from the tones that were assumed to the tones that were natural impossible to say  what more can i do murmured mrs lecount behind her handkerchief give me time to thinkgive me time to recover myself may i retire sir for a moment my nerves are shaken by this sad scene i must have a glass of water or i think i shall faint dont go yet miss garth i beg you will give us time to set this sad matter right if we cani beg you will remain until i come back  there were two doors of entrance to the room one the door into the front parlor close at magdalens left hand the other the door into the back parlor situated behind her mrs lecount politely retiredthrough the open foldingdoorsby this latter means of exit so as not to disturb the visitor by passing in front of her magdalen waited until she heard the door open and close again behind her and then resolved to make the most of the opportunity which left her alone with noel vanstone the utter hopelessness of rousing a generous impulse in that base nature had now been proved by her own experience the last chance left was to treat him like the craven creature he was and to influence him through his fears  before she could speak noel vanstone himself broke the silence cunningly as he strove to hide it he was half angry half alarmed at his housekeepers desertion of him he looked doubtingly at his visitor he showed a nervous anxiety to conciliate her until mrs lecounts return  pray remember maam i never denied that this case was a hard one he began you said just now you had no wish to offend meand im sure i dont want to offend you may i offer you some strawberries would you like to look at my fathers bargains i assure you maam i am naturally a gallant man and i feel for both these sistersespecially the younger one touch me on the subject of the tender passion and you touch me on a weak place nothing would please me more than to hear that miss vanstones lover im sure i always call her miss vanstone and so does lecounti say maam nothing would please me more than to hear that miss vanstones lover had come back and married her if a loan of money would be likely to bring him back and if the security offered was good and if my lawyer thought me justified  stop mr vanstone said magdalen you are entirely mistaken in your estimate of the person you have to deal with you are seriously wrong in supposing that the marriage of the younger sisterif she could be married in a weeks timewould make any difference in the convictions which induced her to write to your father and to you i dont deny that she may act from a mixture of motives i dont deny that she clings to the hope of hastening her marriage and to the hope of rescuing her sister from a life of dependence but if both those objects were accomplished by other means nothing would induce her to leave you in possession of the inheritance which her father meant his children to have i know her mr vanstone she is a nameless homeless friendless wretch the law which takes care of you the law which takes care of all legitimate children casts her like carrion to the winds it is your lawnot hers she only knows it as the instrument of a vile oppression an insufferable wrong the sense of that wrong haunts her like a possession of the devil the resolution to right that wrong burns in her like fire if that miserable girl was married and rich with millions tomorrow do you think she would move an inch from her purpose i tell you she would resist to the last breath in her body the vile injustice which has struck at the helpless children through the calamity of their fathers death i tell you she would shrink from no means which a desperate woman can employ to force that closed hand of yours open or die in the attempt  she stopped abruptly once more her own indomitable earnestness had betrayed her once more the inborn nobility of that perverted nature had risen superior to the deception which it had stooped to practice the scheme of the moment vanished from her minds view and the resolution of her life burst its way outward in her own words in her own tones pouring hotly and more hotly from her heart she saw the abject manikin before her cowering silent in his chair had his fears left him sense enough to perceive the change in her voice no his face spoke the truthhis fears had bewildered him this time the chance of the moment had befriended her the door behind her chair had not opened again yet no ears but his have heard me she thought with a sense of unutterable relief i have escaped mrs lecount  she had done nothing of the kind mrs lecount had never left the room  after opening the door and closing it again without going out the housekeeper had noiselessly knelt down behind magdalens chair steadying herself against the post of the foldingdoor she took a pair of scissors from her pocket waited until noel vanstone from whose view she was entirely hidden had attracted magdalens attention by speaking to her and then bent forward with the scissors ready in her hand the skirt of the false miss garths gownthe brown alpaca dress with the white spots on ittouched the floor within the housekeepers reach mrs lecount lifted the outer of the two flounces which ran round the bottom of the dress one over the other softly cut away a little irregular fragment of stuff from the inner flounce and neatly smoothed the outer one over it again so as to hide the gap by the time she had put the scissors back in her pocket and had risen to her feet sheltering herself behind the post of the foldingdoor magdalen had spoken her last words mrs lecount quietly repeated the ceremony of opening and shutting the back parlor door and returned to her place  what has happened sir in my absence she inquired addressing her master with a look of alarm you are pale you are agitated oh miss garth have you forgotten the caution i gave you in the other room  miss garth has forgotten everything cried noel vanstone recovering his lost composure on the reappearance of mrs lecount miss garth has threatened me in the most outrageous manner i forbid you to pity either of those two girls any more lecountespecially the younger one she is the most desperate wretch i ever heard of if she cant get my money by fair means she threatens to have it by foul miss garth has told me that to my face to my face he repeated folding his arms and looking mortally insulted  compose yourself sir said mrs lecount pray compose yourself and leave me to speak to miss garth i regret to hear maam that you have forgotten what i said to you in the next room you have agitated mr noel you have compromised the interests you came here to plead and you have only repeated what we knew before the language you have allowed yourself to use in my absence is the same language which your pupil was foolish enough to employ when she wrote for the second time to my late master how can a lady of your years and experience seriously repeat such nonsense this girl boasts and threatens she will do this she will do that you have her confidence maam tell me if you please in plain words what can she do  sharply as the taunt was pointed it glanced off harmless mrs lecount had planted her sting once too often magdalen rose in complete possession of her assumed character and composedly terminated the interview ignorant as she was of what had happened behind her chair she saw a change in mrs lecounts look and manner which warned her to run no more risks and to trust herself no longer in the house  i am not in my pupils confidence she said her own acts will answer your question when the time comes i can only tell you from my own knowledge of her that she is no boaster what she wrote to mr michael vanstone was what she was prepared to dowhat i have reason to think she was actually on the point of doing when her plans were overthrown by his death mr michael vanstones son has only to persist in following his fathers course to find before long that i am not mistaken in my pupil and that i have not come here to intimidate him by empty threats my errand is done i leave mr noel vanstone with two alternatives to choose from i leave him to share mr andrew vanstones fortune with mr andrew vanstones daughtersor to persist in his present refusal and face the consequences she bowed and walked to the door  noel vanstone started to his feet with anger and alarm struggling which should express itself first in his blank white face before he could open his lips mrs lecounts plump hands descended on his shoulders put him softly back in his chair and restored the plate of strawberries to its former position on his lap  refresh yourself mr noel with a few more strawberries she said and leave miss garth to me  she followed magdalen into the passage and closed the door of the room after her  are you residing in london maam asked mrs lecount  no replied magdalen i reside in the country  if i want to write to you where can i address my letter  to the postoffice birmingham said magdalen mentioning the place which she had last left and at which all letters were still addressed to her  mrs lecount repeated the direction to fix it in her memory advanced two steps in the passage and quietly laid her right hand on magdalens arm  a word of advice maam she said one word at parting you are a bold woman and a clever woman dont be too bold dont be too clever you are risking more than you think for she suddenly raised herself on tiptoe and whispered the next words in magdalens ear i hold you in the hollow of my hand said mrs lecount with a fierce hissing emphasis on every syllable her left hand clinched itself stealthily as she spoke it was the hand in which she had concealed the fragment of stuff from magdalens gownthe hand which held it fast at that moment  what do you mean asked magdalen pushing her back  mrs lecount glided away politely to open the house door  i mean nothing now she said wait a little and time may show one last question maam before i bid you goodby when your pupil was a little innocent child did she ever amuse herself by building a house of cards  magdalen impatiently answered by a gesture in the affirmative  did you ever see her build up the house higher and higher proceeded mrs lecount till it was quite a pagoda of cards did you ever see her open her little childs eyes wide and look at it and feel so proud of what she had done already that she wanted to do more did you ever see her steady her pretty little hand and hold her innocent breath and put one other card on the top and lay the whole house the instant afterward a heap of ruins on the table ah you have seen that give her if you please a friendly message from me i venture to say she has built the house high enough already and i recommend her to be careful before she puts on that other card  she shall have your message said magdalen with miss garths bluntness and miss garths emphatic nod of the head but i doubt her minding it her hand is rather steadier than you suppose and i think she will put on the other card  and bring the house down said mrs lecount  and build it up again rejoined magdalen i wish you goodmorning  goodmorning said mrs lecount opening the door one last word miss garth do think of what i said in the back room do try the golden ointment for that sad affliction in your eyes  as magdalen crossed the threshold of the door she was met by the postman ascending the house steps with a letter picked out from the bundle in his hand noel vanstone esquire she heard the man say interrogatively as she made her way down the front garden to the street  she passed through the garden gates little thinking from what new difficulty and new danger her timely departure had saved her the letter which the postman had just delivered into the housekeepers hands was no other than the anonymous letter addressed to noel vanstone by captain wragge    chapter iv  mrs lecount returned to the parlor with the fragment of magdalens dress in one hand and with captain wragges letter in the other  have you got rid of her asked noel vanstone have you shut the door at last on miss garth  dont call her miss garth sir said mrs lecount smiling contemptuously she is as much miss garth as you are we have been favored by the performance of a clever masquerade and if we had taken the disguise off our visitor i think we should have found under it miss vanstone herselfhere is a letter for you sir which the postman has just left  she put the letter on the table within her masters reach noel vanstones amazement at the discovery just communicated to him kept his whole attention concentrated on the housekeepers face he never so much as looked at the letter when she placed it before him  take my word for it sir proceeded mrs lecount composedly taking a chair when our visitor gets home she will put her gray hair away in a box and will cure that sad affliction in her eyes with warm water and a sponge if she had painted the marks on her face as well as she painted the inflammation in her eyes the light would have shown me nothing and i should certainly have been deceived but i saw the marks i saw a young womans skin under that dirty complexion of hers i heard in this room a true voice in a passion as well as a false voice talking with an accent and i dont believe in one morsel of that ladys personal appearance from top to toe the girl herself in my opinion mr noeland a bold girl too  why didnt you lock the door and send for the police asked mr noel my father would have sent for the police you know as well as i do lecount my father would have sent for the police  pardon me sir said mrs lecount i think your father would have waited until he had got something more for the police to do than we have got for them yet we shall see this lady again sir perhaps she will come here next time with her own face and her own voice i am curious to see what her own face is like i am curious to know whether what i have heard of her voice in a passion is enough to make me recognize her voice when she is calm i possess a little memorial of her visit of which she is not aware and she will not escape me so easily as she thinks if it turns out a useful memorial you shall know what it is if not i will abstain from troubling you on so trifling a subjectallow me to remind you sir of the letter under your hand you have not looked at it yet  noel vanstone opened the letter he started as his eye fell on the first lineshesitatedand then hurriedly read it through the paper dropped from his hand and he sank back in his chair mrs lecount sprang to her feet with the alacrity of a young woman and picked up the letter  what has happened sir she asked her face altered as she put the question and her large black eyes hardened fiercely in genuine astonishment and alarm  send for the police exclaimed her master lecount i insist on being protected send for the police  may i read the letter sir  he feebly waved his hand mrs lecount read the letter attentively and put it aside on the table without a word when she had done  have you nothing to say to me asked noel vanstone staring at his housekeeper in blank dismay lecount im to be robbed the scoundrel who wrote that letter knows all about it and wont tell me anything unless i pay him im to be robbed heres property on this table worth thousands of poundsproperty that can never be replacedproperty that all the crowned heads in europe could not produce if they tried lock me in lecount and send for the police  instead of sending for the police mrs lecount took a large green paper fan from the chimneypiece and seated herself opposite her master  you are agitated mr noel she said you are heated let me cool you  with her face as hard as everwith less tenderness of look and manner than most women would have shown if they had been rescuing a halfdrowned fly from a milkjugshe silently and patiently fanned him for five minutes or more no practiced eye observing the peculiar bluish pallor of his complexion and the marked difficulty with which he drew his breath could have failed to perceive that the great organ of life was in this man what the housekeeper had stated it to be too weak for the function which it was called on to perform the heart labored over its work as if it had been the heart of a wornout old man  are you relieved sir asked mrs lecount can you think a little can you exercise your better judgment  she rose and put her hand over his heart with as much mechanical attention and as little genuine interest as if she had been feeling the plates at dinner to ascertain if they had been properly warmed yes she went on seating herself again and resuming the exercise of the fan you are getting better already mr noeldont ask me about this anonymous letter until you have thought for yourself and have given your own opinion first she went on with the fanning and looked him hard in the face all the time think she said think sir without troubling yourself to express your thoughts trust to my intimate sympathy with you to read them yes mr noel this letter is a paltry attempt to frighten you what does it say it says you are the object of a conspiracy directed by miss vanstone we know that alreadythe lady of the inflamed eyes has told us we snap our fingers at the conspiracy what does the letter say next it says the writer has valuable information to give you if you will pay for it what did you call this person yourself just now sir  i called him a scoundrel said noel vanstone recovering his selfimportance and raising himself gradually in his chair  i agree with you in that sir as i agree in everything else proceeded mrs lecount he is a scoundrel who really has this information and who means what he says or he is a mouthpiece of miss vanstones and she has caused this letter to be written for the purpose of puzzling us by another form of disguise whether the letter is true or whether the letter is falseam i not reading your own wiser thoughts now mr noelyou know better than to put your enemies on their guard by employing the police in this matter too soon i quite agree with youno police just yet you will allow this anonymous man or anonymous woman to suppose you are easily frightened you will lay a trap for the information in return for the trap laid for your money you will answer the letter and see what comes of the answer and you will only pay the expense of employing the police when you know the expense is necessary i agree with you againno expense if we can help it in every particular mr noel my mind and your mind in this matter are one  it strikes you in that light lecountdoes it said noel vanstone i think so myself i certainly think so i wont pay the police a farthing if i can possibly help it he took up the letter again and became fretfully perplexed over a second reading of it but the man wants money he broke out impatiently you seem to forget lecount that the man wants money  money which you offer him sir rejoined mrs lecount butas your thoughts have already anticipatedmoney which you dont give him no no you say to this man hold out your hand sir and when he has held it you give him a smack for his pains and put your own hand back in your pocketi am so glad to see you laughing mr noel so glad to see you getting back your good spirits we will answer the letter by advertisement as the writer directsadvertisement is so cheap your poor hand is trembling a littleshall i hold the pen for you i am not fit to do more but i can always promise to hold the pen  without waiting for his reply she went into the back parlor and returned with pen ink and paper arranging a blottingbook on her knees and looking a model of cheerful submission she placed herself once more in front of her masters chair  shall i write from your dictation sir she inquired or shall i make a little sketch and will you correct it afterward i will make a little sketch let me see the letter we are to advertise in the times and we are to address an unknown friend what shall i say mr noel stay i will write it and then you can see for yourself an unknown friend is requested to mention by advertisement an address at which a letter can reach him the receipt of the information which he offers will be acknowledged by a reward of what sum of money do you wish me to set down sir  set down nothing said noel vanstone with a sudden outbreak of impatience money matters are my businessi say money matters are my business lecount leave it to me  certainly sir replied mrs lecount handing her master the blottingbook you will not forget to be liberal in offering money when you know beforehand you dont mean to part with it  dont dictate lecount i wont submit to dictation said noel vanstone asserting his own independence more and more impatiently i mean to conduct this business for myself i am master lecount  you are master sir  my father was master before me and i am my fathers son i tell you lecount i am my fathers son  mrs lecount bowed submissively  i mean to set down any sum of money i think right pursued noel vanstone nodding his little flaxen head vehemently i mean to send this advertisement myself the servant shall take it to the stationers to be put into the times when i ring the bell twice send the servant you understand lecount send the servant  mrs lecount bowed again and walked slowly to the door she knew to a nicety when to lead her master and when to let him go alone experience had taught her to govern him in all essential points by giving way to him afterward on all points of minor detail it was a characteristic of his weak natureas it is of all weak naturesto assert itself obstinately on trifles the filling in of the blank in the advertisement was the trifle in this case and mrs lecount quieted her masters suspicions that she was leading him by instantly conceding it my mule has kicked she thought to herself in her own language as she opened the door i can do no more with him today  lecount cried her master as she stepped into the passage come back  mrs lecount came back  youre not offended with me are you asked noel vanstone uneasily  certainly not sir replied mrs lecount as you said just nowyou are master  good creature give me your hand he kissed her hand and smiled in high approval of his own affectionate proceeding lecount you are a worthy creature  thank you sir said mrs lecount she courtesied and went out if he had any brains in that monkey head of his she said to herself in the passage what a rascal he would be  left by himself noel vanstone became absorbed in anxious reflection over the blank space in the advertisement mrs lecounts apparently superfluous hint to him to be liberal in offering money when he knew he had no intention of parting with it had been founded on an intimate knowledge of his character he had inherited his fathers sordid love of money without inheriting his fathers hardheaded capacity for seeing the uses to which money can be put his one idea in connection with his wealth was the idea of keeping it he was such an inborn miser that the bare prospect of being liberal in theory only daunted him he took up the pen laid it down again and read the anonymous letter for the third time shaking his head over it suspiciously if i offer this man a large sum of money he thought on a sudden how do i know he may not find a means of actually making me pay it women are always in a hurry lecount is always in a hurry i have got the afternoon before meill take the afternoon to consider it  he fretfully put away the blottingbook and the sketch of the advertisement on the chair which mrs lecount had just left as he returned to his own seat he shook his little head solemnly and arranged his white dressinggown over his knees with the air of a man absorbed in anxious thought minute after minute passed away the quarters and the halfhours succeeded each other on the dial of mrs lecounts watch and still noel vanstone remained lost in doubt still no summons for the servants disturbed the tranquillity of the parlor bell        meanwhile after parting with mrs lecount magdalen had cautiously abstained from crossing the road to her lodgings and had only ventured to return after making a circuit in the neighborhood when she found herself once more in vauxhall walk the first object which attracted her attention was a cab drawn up before the door of the lodgings a few steps more in advance showed her the landladys daughter standing at the cab door engaged in a dispute with the driver on the subject of his fare noticing that the girls back was turned toward her magdalen instantly profited by that circumstance and slipped unobserved into the house  she glided along the passage ascended the stairs and found herself on the first landing face to face with her traveling companion there stood mrs wragge with a pile of small parcels hugged up in her arms anxiously waiting the issue of the dispute with the cabman in the street to return was impossiblethe sound of the angry voices below was advancing into the passage to hesitate was worse than useless but one choice was leftthe choice of going onand magdalen desperately took it she pushed by mrs wragge without a word ran into her own room tore off her cloak bonnet and wig and threw them down out of sight in the blank space between the sofabedstead and the wall  for the first few moments astonishment bereft mrs wragge of the power of speech and rooted her to the spot where she stood two out of the collection of parcels in her arms fell from them on the stairs the sight of that catastrophe roused her thieves cried mrs wragge suddenly struck by an idea thieves  magdalen heard her through the room door which she had not had time to close completely is that you mrs wragge she called out in her own voice what is the matter she snatched up a towel while she spoke dipped it in water and passed it rapidly over the lower part of her face at the sound of the familiar voice mrs wragge turned rounddropped a third parceland forgetting it in her astonishment ascended the second flight of stairs magdalen stepped out on the firstfloor landing with the towel held over her forehead as if she was suffering from headache her false eyebrows required time for their removal and a headache assumed for the occasion suggested the most convenient pretext she could devise for hiding them as they were hidden now  what are you disturbing the house for she asked pray be quiet i am half blind with the headache  anything wrong maam inquired the landlady from the passage  nothing whatever replied magdalen my friend is timid and the dispute with the cabman has frightened her pay the man what he wants and let him go  where is she asked mrs wragge in a tremulous whisper wheres the woman who scuttled by me into your room  pooh said magdalen no woman scuttled by youas you call it look in and see for yourself  she threw open the door mrs wragge walked into the roomlooked all over itsaw nobodyand indicated her astonishment at the result by dropping a fourth parcel and trembling helplessly from head to foot  i saw her go in here said mrs wragge in awestruck accents a woman in a gray cloak and a poke bonnet a rude woman she scuttled by me on the stairsshe did heres the room and no woman in it give us a prayerbook cried mrs wragge turning deadly pale and letting her whole remaining collection of parcels fall about her in a little cascade of commodities i want to read something good i want to think of my latter end ive seen a ghost  nonsense said magdalen youre dreaming the shopping has been too much for you go into your own room and take your bonnet off  ive heard tell of ghosts in nightgowns ghosts in sheets and ghosts in chains proceeded mrs wragge standing petrified in her own magic circle of linendrapers parcels heres a worse ghost than any of ema ghost in a gray cloak and a poke bonnet i know what it is continued mrs wragge melting into penitent tears its a judgment on me for being so happy away from the captain its a judgment on me for having been down at heel in half the shops in london first with one shoe and then with the other all the time ive been out im a sinful creature dont let go of mewhatever you do my dear dont let go of me she caught magdalen fast by the arm and fell into another trembling fit at the bare idea of being left by herself  the one remaining chance in such an emergency as this was to submit to circumstances magdalen took mrs wragge to a chair having first placed it in such a position as might enable her to turn her back on her travelingcompanion while she removed the false eyebrows by the help of a little water wait a minute there she said and try if you can compose yourself while i bathe my head  compose myself repeated mrs wragge how am i to compose myself when my head feels off my shoulders the worst buzzing i ever had with the cookerybook was nothing to the buzzing ive got now with the ghost heres a miserable end to a holiday you may take me back again my dear whenever you likeive had enough of it already  having at last succeeded in removing the eyebrows magdalen was free to combat the unfortunate impression produced on her companions mind by every weapon of persuasion which her ingenuity could employ  the attempt proved useless mrs wragge persistedon evidence which it may be remarked in parenthesis would have satisfied many wiser ghostseers than herselfin believing that she had been supernaturally favored by a visitor from the world of spirits all that magdalen could do was to ascertain by cautious investigation that mrs wragge had not been quick enough to identify the supposed ghost with the character of the old northcountry lady in the entertainment having satisfied herself on this point she had no resource but to leave the rest to the natural incapability of retaining impressionsunless those impressions were perpetually renewedwhich was one of the characteristic infirmities of her companions weak mind after fortifying mrs wragge by reiterated assurances that one appearance according to all the laws and regulations of ghosts meant nothing unless it was immediately followed by two moreafter patiently leading back her attention to the parcels dropped on the floor and on the stairsand after promising to keep the door of communication ajar between the two rooms if mrs wragge would engage on her side to retire to her own chamber and to say no more on the terrible subject of the ghostmagdalen at last secured the privilege of reflecting uninterruptedly on the events of that memorable day  two serious consequences had followed her first step forward mrs lecount had entrapped her into speaking in her own voice and accident had confronted her with mrs wragge in disguise  what advantage had she gained to set against these disasters the advantage of knowing more of noel vanstone and of mrs lecount than she might have discovered in months if she had trusted to inquiries made for her by others one uncertainty which had hitherto perplexed her was set at rest already the scheme she had privately devised against michael vanstonewhich captain wragges sharp insight had partially penetrated when she first warned him that their partnership must be dissolvedwas a scheme which she could now plainly see must be abandoned as hopeless in the case of michael vanstones son the fathers habits of speculation had been the pivot on which the whole machinery of her meditated conspiracy had been constructed to turn no such vantageground was discoverable in the doubly sordid character of the son noel vanstone was invulnerable on the very point which had presented itself in his father as open to attack  having reached this conclusion how was she to shape her future course what new means could she discover which would lead her secretly to her end in defiance of mrs lecounts malicious vigilance and noel vanstones miserly distrust  she was seated before the lookingglass mechanically combing out her hair while that allimportant consideration occupied her mind the agitation of the moment had raised a feverish color in her cheeks and had brightened the light in her large gray eyes she was conscious of looking her best conscious how her beauty gained by contrast after the removal of the disguise her lovely light brown hair looked thicker and softer than ever now that it had escaped from its imprisonment under the gray wig she twisted it this way and that with quick dexterous fingers she laid it in masses on her shoulders she threw it back from them in a heap and turned sidewise to see how it fellto see her back and shoulders freed from the artificial deformities of the padded cloak after a moment she faced the lookingglass once more plunged both hands deep in her hair and resting her elbows on the table looked closer and closer at the reflection of herself until her breath began to dim the glass i can twist any man alive round my finger she thought with a smile of superb triumph as long as i keep my looks if that contemptible wretch saw me now she shrank from following that thought to its end with a sudden horror of herself she drew back from the glass shuddering and put her hands over her face oh frank she murmured but for you what a wretch i might be her eager fingers snatched the little white silk bag from its hidingplace in her bosom her lips devoured it with silent kisses my darling my angel oh frank how i love you the tears gushed into her eyes she passionately dried them restored the bag to its place and turned her back on the lookingglass no more of myself she thought no more of my mad miserable self for today  shrinking from all further contemplation of her next step in advanceshrinking from the fastdarkening future with which noel vanstone was now associated in her inmost thoughtsshe looked impatiently about the room for some homely occupation which might take her out of herself the disguise which she had flung down between the wall and the bed recurred to her memory it was impossible to leave it there mrs wragge now occupied in sorting her parcels might weary of her employment might come in again at a moments notice might pass near the bed and see the gray cloak what was to be done  her first thought was to put the disguise back in her trunk but after what had happened there was danger in trusting it so near to herself while she and mrs wragge were together under the same roof she resolved to be rid of it that evening and boldly determined on sending it back to birmingham her bonnetbox fitted into her trunk she took the box out thrust in the wig and cloak and remorselessly flattened down the bonnet at the top the gown which she had not yet taken off was her own mrs wragge had been accustomed to see her in itthere was no need to send the gown back before closing the box she hastily traced these lines on a sheet of paper i took the inclosed things away by mistake please keep them for me with the rest of my luggage in your possession until you hear from me again putting the paper on the top of the bonnet she directed the box to captain wragge at birmingham took it downstairs immediately and sent the landladys daughter away with it to the nearest receivinghouse that difficulty is disposed of she thought as she went back to her own room again  mrs wragge was still occupied in sorting her parcels on her narrow little bed she turned round with a faint scream when magdalen looked in at her i thought it was the ghost again said mrs wragge im trying to take warning my dear by whats happened to me ive put all my parcels straight just as the captain would like to see em im up at heel with both shoes if i close my eyes tonightwhich i dont think i shallill go to sleep as straight as my legs will let me and ill never have another holiday as long as i live i hope i shall be forgiven said mrs wragge mournfully shaking her head i humbly hope i shall be forgiven  forgiven repeated magdalen if other women wanted as little forgiving as you dowell well suppose you open some of these parcels come i want to see what you have been buying today  mrs wragge hesitated sighed penitently considered a little stretched out her hand timidly toward one of the parcels thought of the supernatural warning and shrank back from her own purchases with a desperate exertion of selfcontrol  open this one said magdalen to encourage her what is it  mrs wragges faded blue eyes began to brighten dimly in spite of her remorse but she selfdenyingly shook her head the masterpassion of shopping might claim his own againbut the ghost was not laid yet  did you get it at a bargain asked magdalen confidentially  dirt cheap cried poor mrs wragge falling headlong into the snare and darting at the parcel as eagerly as if nothing had happened  magdalen kept her gossiping over her purchases for an hour or more and then wisely determined to distract her attention from all ghostly recollections in another way by taking her out for a walk  as they left the lodgings the door of noel vanstones house opened and the womanservant appeared bent on another errand she was apparently charged with a letter on this occasion which she carried carefully in her hand conscious of having formed no plan yet either for attack or defense magdalen wondered with a momentary dread whether mrs lecount had decided already on opening fresh communications and whether the letter was directed to miss garth  the let ter bore no such address noel vanstone had solved his pecuniary problem at last the blank space in the advertisement was filled up and mrs lecounts acknowledgment of the captains anonymous warning was now on its way to insertion in the times  the end of the third scene     between the scenes  progress of the story through the post  i  extract from the advertising columns of the times  an unknown friend is requested to mention by advertisement an address at which a letter can reach him the receipt of the information which he offers will be acknowledged by a reward of five pounds   ii  from captain wragge to magdalen  birmingham july 2d 1847  my dear girlthe box containing the articles of costumes which you took away by mistake has come safely to hand consider it under my special protection until i hear from you again  i embrace this opportunity to assure you once more of my unalterable fidelity to your interests without attempting to intrude myself into your confidence may i inquire whether mr noel vanstone has consented to do you justice i greatly fear he has declinedin which case i can lay my hand on my heart and solemnly declare that his meanness revolts me why do i feel a foreboding that you have appealed to him in vain why do i find myself viewing this fellow in the light of a noxious insect we are total strangers to each other i have no sort of knowledge of him except the knowledge i picked up in making your inquiries has my intense sympathy with your interests made my perceptions prophetic or to put it fancifully is there really such a thing as a former state of existence and has mr noel vanstone mortally insulted mesay in some other planet  i write my dear magdalen as you see with my customary dash of humor but i am serious in placing my services at your disposal dont let the question of terms cause you an instants hesitation i accept beforehand any terms you like to mention if your present plans point that way i am ready to squeeze mr noel vanstone in your interests till the gold oozes out of him at every pore pardon the coarseness of this metaphor my anxiety to be of service to you rushes into words lays my meaning in the rough at your feet and leaves your taste to polish it with the choicest ornaments of the english language  how is my unfortunate wife i am afraid you find it quite impossible to keep her up at heel or to mold her personal appearance into harmony with the eternal laws of symmetry and order does she attempt to be too familiar with you i have always been accustomed to check her in this respect she has never been permitted to call me anything but captain and on the rare occasions since our union when circumstances may have obliged her to address me by letter her opening form of salutation has been rigidly restricted to dear sir accept these trifling domestic particulars as suggesting hints which may be useful to you in managing mrs wragge and believe me in anxious expectation of hearing from you again  devotedly yours  horatio wragge   iii  from norah to magdalen  forwarded with the two letters that follow it from the postoffice birmingham  westmoreland house kensington july 1st  my dearest magdalenwhen you write next and pray write soon address your letter to me at miss garths i have left my situation and some little time may elapse before i find another  now it is all over i may acknowledge to you my darling that i was not happy i tried hard to win the affection of the two little girls i had to teach but they seemed i am sure i cant tell why to dislike me from the first their mother i have no reason to complain of but their grandmother who was really the ruling power in the house made my life very hard to me my inexperience in teaching was a constant subject of remark with her and my difficulties with the children were always visited on me as if they had been entirely of my own making i tell you this so that you may not suppose i regret having left my situation far from it my lovei am glad to be out of the house  i have saved a little money magdalen and i should so like to spend it in staying a few days with you my heart aches for a sight of my sister my ears are weary for the sound of her voice a word from you telling me where we can meet is all i want think of itpray think of it  dont suppose i am discouraged by this first check there are many kind people in the world and some of them may employ me next time the way to happiness is often very hard to find harder i almost think for women than for men but if we only try patiently and try long enough we reach it at lastin heaven if not on earth i think my way now is the way which leads to seeing you again dont forget that my love the next time you think of  norah   iv  from miss garth to magdalen  westmoreland house july 1st  my dear magdalenyou have no useless remonstrances to apprehend at the sight of my handwriting my only object in this letter is to tell you something which i know your sister will not tell you of her own accord she is entirely ignorant that i am writing to you keep her in ignorance if you wish to spare her unnecessary anxiety and me unnecessary distress  norahs letter no doubt tells you that she has left her situation i feel it my painful duty to add that she has left it on your account  the matter occurred in this manner messrs wyatt pendril and gwilt are the solicitors of the gentleman in whose family norah was employed the life which you have chosen for yourself was known as long ago as december last to all the partners you were discovered performing in public at derby by the person who had been employed to trace you at york and that discovery was communicated by mr wyatt to norahs employer a few days since in reply to direct inquiries about you on that gentlemans part his wife and his mother who lives with him had expressly desired that he would make those inquiries their doubts having been aroused by norahs evasive answers when they questioned her about her sister you know norah too well to blame her for this evasion was the only escape your present life had left her from telling a downright falsehood  that same day the two ladies of the family the elder and the younger sent for your sister and told her they had discovered that you were a public performer roaming from place to place in the country under an assumed name they were just enough not to blame norah for this they were just enough to acknowledge that her conduct had been as irreproachable as i had guaranteed it should be when i got her the situation but at the same time they made it a positive condition of her continuing in their employment that she should never permit you to visit her at their house or to meet her and walk out with her when she was in attendance on the children your sisterwho has patiently borne all hardships that fell on herselfinstantly resented the slur cast on you she gave her employers warning on the spot high words followed and she left the house that evening  i have no wish to distress you by representing the loss of this situation in the light of a disaster norah was not so happy in it as i had hoped and believed she would be it was impossible for me to know beforehand that the children were sullen and intractable or that the husbands mother was accustomed to make her domineering disposition felt by every one in the house i will readily admit that norah is well out of this situation but the harm does not stop here for all you and i know to the contrary the harm may go on what has happened in this situation may happen in another your way of life however pure your conduct may beand i will do you the justice to believe it pureis a suspicious way of life to all respectable people i have lived long enough in this world to know that the sense of propriety in nine englishwomen out of ten makes no allowances and feels no pity norahs next employers may discover you and norah may throw up a situation next time which we may never be able to find for her again  i leave you to consider this my child dont think i am hard on you i am jealous for your sisters tranquillity if you will forget the past magdalen and come back trust to your old governess to forget it too and to give you the home which your father and mother once gave her your friend my dear always  harriet garth   v  from francis clare jun to magdalen  shanghai china april 23d 1847  my dear magdaleni have deferred answering your letter in consequence of the distracted state of my mind which made me unfit to write to you i am still unfit but i feel i ought to delay no longer my sense of honor fortifies me and i undergo the pain of writing this letter  my prospects in china are all at an end the firm to which i was brutally consigned as if i was a bale of merchandise has worn out my patience by a series of petty insults and i have felt compelled from motives of selfrespect to withdraw my services which were undervalued from the first my returning to england under these circumstances is out of the question i have been too cruelly used in my own country to wish to go back to it even if i could i propose embarking on board a private tradingvessel in these seas in a mercantile capacity to make my way if i can for myself how it will end or what will happen to me next is more than i can say it matters little what becomes of me i am a wanderer and an exile entirely through the fault of others the unfeeling desire at home to get rid of me has accomplished its object i am got rid of for good  there is only one more sacrifice left for me to makethe sacrifice of my hearts dearest feelings with no prospects before me with no chance of coming home what hope can i feel of performing my engagement to yourself none a more selfish man than i am might hold you to that engagement a less considerate man than i am might keep you waiting for yearsand to no purpose after all cruelly as they have been trampled on my feelings are too sensitive to allow me to do this i write it with the tears in my eyesyou shall not link your fate to an outcast accept these heartbroken lines as releasing you from your promise our engagement is at an end  the one consolation which supports me in bidding you farewell is that neither of us is to blame you may have acted weakly under my fathers influence but i am sure you acted for the best nobody knew what the fatal consequences of driving me out of england would be but myselfand i was not listened to i yielded to my father i yielded to you and this is the end of it  i am suffering too acutely to write more may you never know what my withdrawal from our engagement has cost me i beg you will not blame yourself it is not your fault that i have had all my energies misdirected by othersit is not your fault that i have never had a fair chance of getting on in life forget the deserted wretch who breathes his heartfelt prayers for your happiness and who will ever remain your friend and wellwisher  francis clare jun   vi  from francis clare sen to magdalen  inclosing the preceding letter  i always told your poor father my son was a fool but i never knew he was a scoundrel until the mail came in from china i have every reason to believe that he has left his employers under the most disgraceful circumstances forget him from this time forth as i do when you and i last set eyes on each other you behaved well to me in this business all i can now say in return i do say my girl i am sorry for you  f c   vii  from mrs wragge to her husband  dear sir for mercys sake come here and help us she had a dreadful letter i dont know what yesterday but she read it in bed and when i went in with her breakfast i found her dead and if the doctor had not been two doors off nobody else could have brought her to life again and she sits and looks dreadful and wont speak a word her eyes frighten me so i shake from head to foot oh please do come i keep things as tidy as i can and i do like her so and she used to be so kind to me and the landlord says hes afraid shell destroy herself i wish i could write straight but i do shake so your dutiful wife matilda wragge excuse faults and beg you on my knees come and help us the doctor good man will put some of his own writing into this for fear you cant make out mine and remain once more your dutiful wife matilda wragge  added by the doctor  siri beg to inform you that i was yesterday called into a neighbors in vauxhall walk to attend a young lady who had been suddenly taken ill i recovered her with great difficulty from one of the most obstinate faintingfits i ever remember to have met with since that time she has had no relapse but there is apparently some heavy distress weighing on her mind which it has hitherto been found impossible to remove she sits as i am informed perfectly silent and perfectly unconscious of what goes on about her for hours together with a letter in her hand which she will allow nobody to take from her if this state of depression continues very distressing mental consequences may follow and i only do my duty in suggesting that some relative or friend should interfere who has influence enough to rouse her your obedient servant  richard jarvis mrcs   viii  from norah to magdalen  july 5th  for gods sake write me one line to say if you are still at birmingham and where i can find you there i have just heard from old mr clare oh magdalen if you have no pity on yourself have some pity on me the thought of you alone among strangers the thought of you heartbroken under this dreadful blow never leaves me for an instant no words can tell how i feel for you my own love remember the better days at home before that cowardly villain stole his way into your heart remember the happy time at comberaven when we were always together oh dont dont treat me like a stranger we are alone in the world nowlet me come and comfort you let me be more than a sister to you if i can one lineonly one line to tell me where i can find you   ix  from magdalen to norah  july 7th  my dearest norahall that your love for me can wish your letter has done you and you alone have found your way to my heart i could think again i could feel again after reading what you have written to me let this assurance quiet your anxieties my mind lives and breathes once moreit was dead until i got your letter  the shock i have suffered has left a strange quietness in me i feel as if i had parted from my former selfas if the hopes once so dear to me had all gone back to some past time from which i am now far removed i can look at the wreck of my life more calmly norah than you could look at it if we were both together again i can trust myself already to write to frank  my darling i think no woman ever knows how utterly she has given herself up to the man she lovesuntil that man has illtreated her can you pity my weakness if i confess to having felt a pang at my heart when i read that part of your letter which calls frank a coward and a villain nobody can despise me for this as i despise myself i am like a dog who crawls back and licks the masters hand that has beaten him but it is soi would confess it to nobody but youindeed indeed it is so he has deceived and deserted me he has written me a cruel farewell but dont call him a villain if he repented and came back to me i would die rather than marry him nowbut it grates on me to see that word coward written against him in your hand if he is weak of purpose who tried his weakness beyond what it could bear do you think this would have happened if michael vanstone had not robbed us of our own and forced frank away from me to china in a week from today the year of waiting would have come to an end and i should have been franks wife if my marriage portion had not been taken from me  you will say after what has hap pened it is well that i have escaped my love there is something perverse in my heart which answers no better have been franks wretched wife than the free woman i am now  i have not written to him he sends me no address at which i could write even if i would but i have not the wish i will wait before i send him my farewell if a day ever comes when i have the fortune which my father once promised i should bring to him do you know what i would do with it i would send it all to frank as my revenge on him for his letter as the last farewell word on my side to the man who has deserted me let me live for that day let me live norah in the hope of better times for you which is all the hope i have left when i think of your hard life i can almost feel the tears once more in my weary eyes i can almost think i have come back again to my former self  you will not think me hardhearted and ungrateful if i say that we must wait a little yet before we meet i want to be more fit to see you than i am now i want to put frank further away from me and to bring you nearer still are these good reasons i dont knowdont ask me for reasons take the kiss i have put for you here where the little circle is drawn on the paper and let that bring us together for the present till i write again goodby my love my heart is true to you norah but i dare not see you yet  magdalen   x  from magdalen to miss garth  my dear miss garthi have been long in answering your letter but you know what has happened and you will forgive me  all that i have to say may be said in a few words you may depend on my never making the general sense of propriety my enemy again i am getting knowledge enough of the world to make it my accomplice next time norah will never leave another situation on my accountmy life as a public performer is at an end it was harmless enough god knowsi may live and so may you to mourn the day when i parted from itbut i shall never return to it again it has left me as frank has left me as all my better thoughts have left me except my thoughts of norah  enough of myself shall i tell you some news to brighten this dull letter mr michael vanstone is dead and mr noel vanstone has succeeded to the possession of my fortune and norahs he is quite worthy of his inheritance in his fathers place he would have ruined us as his father did  i have no more to say that you would care to know dont be distressed about me i am trying to recover my spiritsi am trying to forget the poor deluded girl who was foolish enough to be fond of frank in the old days at comberaven sometimes a pang comes which tells me the girl wont be forgottenbut not often  it was very kind of you when you wrote to such a lost creature as i am to sign yourselfalways my friend always is a bold word my dear old governess i wonder whether you will ever want to recall it it will make no difference if you do in the gratitude i shall always feel for the trouble you took with me when i was a little girl i have ill repaid that troubleill repaid your kindness to me in after life i ask your pardon and your pity the best thing you can do for both of us is to forget me affectionately yours  magdalen  psi open the envelope to add one line for gods sake dont show this letter to norah   xi  from magdalen to captain wragge  vauxhall walk july 17th  if i am not mistaken it was arranged that i should write to you at birmingham as soon as i felt myself composed enough to think of the future my mind is settled at last and i am now able to accept the services which you have so unreservedly offered to me  i beg you will forgive the manner in which i received you on your arrival in this house after hearing the news of my sudden illness i was quite incapable of controlling myselfi was suffering an agony of mind which for the time deprived me of my senses it is only your due that i should now thank you for treating me with great forbearance at a time when forbearance was mercy  i will mention what i wish you to do as plainly and briefly as i can  in the first place i request you to dispose as privately as possible of every article of costume used in the dramatic entertainment i have done with our performances forever and i wish to be set free from everything which might accidentally connect me with them in the future the key of my box is inclosed in this letter  the other box which contains my own dresses you will be kind enough to forward to this house i do not ask you to bring it yourself because i have a far more important commission to intrust to you  referring to the note which you left for me at your departure i conclude that you have by this time traced mr noel vanstone from vauxhall walk to the residence which he is now occupying if you have made the discoveryand if you are quite sure of not having drawn the attention either of mrs lecount or her master to yourselfi wish you to arrange immediately for my residing with you and mrs wragge in the same town or village in which mr noel vanstone has taken up his abode i write this it is hardly necessary to say under the impression that wherever he may now be living he is settled in the place for some little time  if you can find a small furnished house for me on these conditions which is to be let by the month take it for a month certain to begin with say that it is for your wife your niece and yourself and use any assumed name you please as long as it is a name that can be trusted to defeat the most suspicious inquiries i leave this to your experience in such matters the secret of who we really are must be kept as strictly as if it was a secret on which our lives depend  any expenses to which you may be put in carrying out my wishes i will immediately repay if you easily find the sort of house i want there is no need for your returning to london to fetch us we can join you as soon as we know where to go the house must be perfectly respectable and must be reasonably near to mr noel vanstones present residence wherever that is  you must allow me to be silent in this letter as to the object which i have now in view i am unwilling to risk an explanation in writing when all our preparations are made you shall hear what i propose to do from my own lips and i shall expect you to tell me plainly in return whether you will or will not give me the help i want on the best terms which i am able to offer you  one word more before i seal up this letter  if any opportunity falls in your way after you have taken the house and before we join you of exchanging a few civil words either with mr noel vanstone or mrs lecount take advantage of it it is very important to my present object that we should become acquainted with each otheras the purely accidental result of our being near neighbors i want you to smooth the way toward this end if you can before mrs wragge and i come to you pray throw away no chance of observing mrs lecount in particular very carefully whatever help you can give me at the outset in blindfolding that womans sharp eyes will be the most precious help i have ever received at your hands  there is no need to answer this letter immediatelyunless i have written it under a mistaken impression of what you have accomplished since leaving london i have taken our lodgings on for another week and i can wait to hear from you until you are able to send me such news as i wish to receive you may be quite sure of my patience for the future under all possible circumstances my caprices are at an end and my violent temper has tried your forbearance for the last time  magdalen   xii  from captain wragge to magdalen  north shingles villa aldborough suffolk july 22d  my dear

explosion iswords  everything you wanted me to do is done the house is taken the name is found and i am personally acquainted with mrs lecount after reading this general statement you will naturally

yesterday in the grocers shop here keeping my ears open i found that mrs lecount wanted a particular kind of tea which the man had not got and which he believed could not be procured any nearer than ipswich i instantly saw my way to beginning an acquaintance at the trifling expense of a journey to that flourishing city i have business today in ipswich i said and i propose returning to aldborough if i can get back in time this evening pray allow me to take your order for the tea and to bring it back with my own parcels mrs lecount politely declined giving me the troublei politely insisted on taking it we fell into conversation there is no need to trouble you with our talk the result of it on my mind isthat mrs lecounts one weak point if she has such a thing at all is a taste for science implanted by her deceased husband the professor i think i see a chance here of working my way into her good graces and casting a little needful dust into those handsome black eyes of hers acting on this idea when i purchased the ladys tea at ipswich i also bought on my own account that farfamed pocketmanual of knowledge joyces scientific dialogues possessing as i do a quick memory and boundless confidence in myself i propose privately inflating my new skin with as much readymade science as it will hold and presenting mr bygrave to mrs lecounts notice in the character of the most highly informed man she has met with since the professors death the necessity of blindfolding that woman to use your own admirable expression is as clear to me as to you if it is to be done in the way i propose make your mind easywragge inflated by joyce is the man to do it  you now have my whole budget of news am i or am i not worthy of your confidence in me i say nothing of my devouring anxiety to know what your objects really arethat anxiety will be satisfied when we meet never yet my dear girl did i long to administer a productive pecuniary squeeze to any human creature as i long to administer it to mr noel vanstone i say no more verbum sap pardon the pedantry of a latin quotation and believe me  entirely yours  horatio wragge  psi await my instructions as you requested you have only to say whether i shall return to london for the purpose of escorting you to this place or whether i shall wait here to receive you the house is in perfect order the weather is charming and the sea is as smooth as mrs lecounts apron she has just passed the window and we have exchanged bows a sharp woman my dear magdalen but joyce and i together may prove a trifle too much for her   xiii  extract from the east suffolk argus  aldboroughwe notice with pleasure the arrival of visitors to this healthful and farfamed wateringplace earlier in the season than usual during the present year esto perpetua is all we have to say  visitors listarrivals since our last north shingles villamrs bygrave miss bygrave      the fourth scene  aldborough suffolk    chapter i  the most striking spectacle presented to a stranger by the shores of suffolk is the extraordinary defenselessness of the land against the encroachments of the sea  at aldborough as elsewhere on this coast local traditions are for the most part traditions which have been literally drowned the site of the old town once a populous and thriving port has almost entirely disappeared in the sea the german ocean has swallowed up streets marketplaces jetties and public walks and the merciless waters consummating their work of devastation closed no longer than eighty years since over the saltmasters cottage at aldborough now famous in memory only as the birthplace of the poet crabbe  thrust back year after year by the advancing waves the inhabitants have receded in the present century to the last morsel of land which is firm enough to be built ona strip of ground hemmed in between a marsh on one side and the sea on the other here trusting for their future security to certain sandhills which the capricious waves have thrown up to encourage them the people of aldborough have boldly established their quaint little wateringplace the first fragment of their earthly possessions is a low natural dike of shingle surmounted by a public path which runs parallel with the sea bordering this path in a broken uneven line are the villa residences of modern aldboroughfanciful little houses standing mostly in their own gardens and possessing here and there as horticultural ornaments staring figureheads of ships doing duty for statues among the flowers viewed from the low level on which th ese villas stand the sea in certain conditions of the atmosphere appears to be higher than the land coastingvessels gliding by assume gigantic proportions and look alarmingly near the windows intermixed with the houses of the better sort are buildings of other forms and periods in one direction the tiny gothic townhall of old aldboroughonce the center of the vanished port and boroughnow stands fronting the modern villas close on the margin of the sea at another point a wooden tower of observation crowned by the figurehead of a wrecked russian vessel rises high above the neighboring houses and discloses through its scuttlewindow grave men in dark clothing seated on the topmost story perpetually on the watchthe pilots of aldborough looking out from their tower for ships in want of help behind the row of buildings thus curiously intermingled runs the one straggling street of the town with its sturdy pilots cottages its mouldering marine storehouses and its composite shops toward the northern end this street is bounded by the one eminence visible over all the marshy flata low wooded hill on which the church is built at its opposite extremity the street leads to a deserted martello tower and to the forlorn outlying suburb of slaughden between the river alde and the sea such are the main characteristics of this curious little outpost on the shores of england as it appears at the present time   on a hot and cloudy july afternoon and on the second day which had elapsed since he had written to magdalen captain wragge sauntered through the gate of north shingles villa to meet the arrival of the coach which then connected aldborough with the eastern counties railway he reached the principal inn as the coach drove up and was ready at the door to receive magdalen and mrs wragge on their leaving the vehicle  the captains reception of his wife was not characterized by an instants unnecessary waste of time he looked distrustfully at her shoesraised himself on tiptoeset her bonnet straight for her with a sharp tugsaid in a loud whisper hold your tongueand left her for the time being without further notice his welcome to magdalen beginning with the usual flow of words stopped suddenly in the middle of the first sentence captain wragges eye was a sharp one and it instantly showed him something in the look and manner of his old pupil which denoted a serious change  there was a settled composure on her face which except when she spoke made it look as still and cold as marble her voice was softer and more equable her eyes were steadier her step was slower than of old when she smiled the smile came and went suddenly and showed a little nervous contraction on one side of her mouth never visible there before she was perfectly patient with mrs wragge she treated the captain with a courtesy and consideration entirely new in his experience of herbut she was interested in nothing the curious little shops in the back street the high impending sea the old townhall on the beach the pilots the fishermen the passing shipsshe noticed all these objects as indifferently as if aldborough had been familiar to her from her infancy even when the captain drew up at the gardengate of north shingles and introduced her triumphantly to the new house she hardly looked at it the first question she asked related not to her own residence but to noel vanstones  how near to us does he live she inquired with the only betrayal of emotion which had escaped her yet  captain wragge answered by pointing to the fifth villa from north shingles on the slaughden side of aldborough magdalen suddenly drew back from the gardengate as he indicated the situation and walked away by herself to obtain a nearer view of the house captain wragge looked after her and shook his head discontentedly  may i speak now inquired a meek voice behind him articulating respectfully ten inches above the top of his straw hat  the captain turned round and confronted his wife the more than ordinary bewilderment visible in her face at once suggested to him that magdalen had failed to carry out the directions in his letter and that mrs wragge had arrived at aldborough without being properly aware of the total transformation to be accomplished in her identity and her name the necessity of setting this doubt at rest was too serious to be trifled with and captain wragge instituted the necessary inquiries without a moments delay  stand straight and listen to me he began i have a question to ask you do you know whose skin you are in at this moment do you know that you are dead and buried in london and that you have risen like a phoenix from the ashes of mrs wragge no you evidently dont know it this is perfectly disgraceful what is your name  matilda answered mrs wragge in a state of the densest bewilderment  nothing of the sort cried the captain fiercely how dare you tell me your names matilda your name is julia who am ihold that basket of sandwiches straight or ill pitch it into the seawho am i  i dont know said mrs wragge meekly taking refuge in the negative side of the question this time  sit down said her husband pointing to the low garden wall of north shingles villa more to the right more still that will do you dont know repeated the captain sternly confronting his wife as soon as he had contrived by seating her to place her face on a level with his own dont let me hear you say that a second time dont let me have a woman who doesnt know who i am to operate on my beard tomorrow morning look at me more to the leftmore stillthat will do who am i im mr bygravechristian name thomas who are you youre mrs bygravechristian name julia who is that young lady who traveled with you from london that young lady is miss bygravechristian name susan im her clever uncle tom and youre her addleheaded aunt julia say it all over to me instantly like the catechism what is your name  spare my poor head pleaded mrs wragge oh please spare my poor head till ive got the stagecoach out of it  dont distress her said magdalen joining them at that moment she will learn it in time come into the house  captain wragge shook his wary head once more we are beginning badly he said with less politeness than usual my wifes stupidity stands in our way already  they went into the house magdalen was perfectly satisfied with all the captains arrangements she accepted the room which he had set apart for her approved of the woman servant whom he had engaged presented herself at teatime the moment she was summoned but still showed no interest whatever in the new scene around her soon after the table was cleared although the daylight had not yet faded out mrs wragges customary drowsiness after fatigue of any kind overcame her and she received her husband s orders to leave the room taking care that she left it up at heel and to betake herself strictly in the character of mrs bygrave to bed as soon as they were left alone the captain looked hard at magdalen and waited to be spoken to she said nothing he ventured next on opening the conversation by a polite inquiry after the state of her health you look fatigued he remarked in his most insinuating manner i am afraid the journey has been too much for you  no she said looking out listlessly through the window i am not more tired than usual i am always weary now weary at going to bed weary at getting up if you would like to hear what i have to say to you tonight i am willing and ready to say it cant we go out it is very hot here and the droning of those mens voices is beyond all endurance she pointed through the window to a group of boatmen idling as only nautical men can idle against the garden wall is there no quiet walk in this wretched place she asked impatiently cant we breathe a little fresh air and escape being annoyed by strangers  there is perfect solitude within half an hours walk of the house replied the ready captain  very well come out then  with a weary sigh she took up her straw bonnet and her light muslin scarf from the sidetable upon which she had thrown them on coming in and carelessly led the way to the door captain wragge followed her to the garden gate then stopped struck by a new idea  excuse me he whispered confidentially in my wifes existing state of ignorance as to who she is we had better not trust her alone in the house with a new servant ill privately turn the key on her in case she wakes before we come back safe bind safe findyou know the proverbi will be with you again in a moment  he hastened back to the house and magdalen seated herself on the garden wall to await his return  she had hardly settled herself in that position when two gentlemen walking together whose approach along the public path she had not previously noticed passed close by her  the dress of one of the two strangers showed him to be a clergyman his companions station in life was less easily discernible to ordinary observation practiced eyes would probably have seen enough in his look his manner and his walk to show that he was a sailor he was a man in the prime of life tall spare and muscular his face sunburned to a deep brown his black hair just turning gray his eyes dark deep and firmthe eyes of a man with an iron resolution and a habit of command he was the nearest of the two to magdalen as he and his friend passed the place where she was sitting and he looked at her with a sudden surprise at her beauty with an open hearty undisguised admiration which was too evidently sincere too evidently beyond his own control to be justly resented as insolent and yet in her humor at that moment magdalen did resent it she felt the mans resolute black eyes strike through her with an electric suddenness and frowning at him impatiently she turned away her head and looked back at the house  the next moment she glanced round again to see if he had gone on he had advanced a few yardshad then evidently stoppedand was now in the very act of turning to look at her once more his companion the clergyman noticing that magdalen appeared to be annoyed took him familiarly by the arm and half in jest half in earnest forced him to walk on the two disappeared round the corner of the next house as they turned it the sunburned sailor twice stopped his companion again and twice looked back  a friend of yours inquired captain wragge joining magdalen at that moment  certainly not she replied a perfect stranger he stared at me in the most impertinent manner does he belong to this place  ill find out in a moment said the compliant captain joining the group of boatmen and putting his questions right and left with the easy familiarity which distinguished him he returned in a few minutes with a complete budget of information the clergyman was well known as the rector of a place situated some few miles inland the dark man with him was his wifes brother commander of a ship in the merchantservice he was supposed to be staying with his relatives as their guest for a short time only preparatory to sailing on another voyage the clergymans name was strickland and the merchantcaptains name was kirke and that was all the boatmen knew about either of them  it is of no consequence who they are said magdalen carelessly the mans rudeness merely annoyed me for the moment let us have done with him i have something else to think of and so have you where is the solitary walk you mentioned just now which way do we go  the captain pointed southward toward slaughden and offered his arm  magdalen hesitated before she took it her eyes wandered away inquiringly to noel vanstones house he was out in the garden pacing backward and forward over the little lawn with his head high in the air and with mrs lecount demurely in attendance on him carrying her masters green fan seeing this magdalen at once took captain wragges right arm so as to place herself nearest to the garden when they passed it on their walk  the eyes of our neighbors are on us and the least your niece can do is to take your arm she said with a bitter laugh come let us go on  they are looking this way whispered the captain shall i introduce you to mrs lecount  not tonight she answered wait and hear what i have to say to you first  they passed the garden wall captain wragge took off his hat with a smart flourish and received a gracious bow from mrs lecount in return magdalen saw the housekeeper survey her face her figure and her dress with that reluctant interest that distrustful curiosity which women feel in observing each other as she walked on beyond the house the sharp voice of noel vanstone reached her through the evening stillness a fine girl lecount she heard him say you know i am a judge of that sort of thinga fine girl  as those words were spoken captain wragge looked round at his companion in sudden surprise her hand was trembling violently on his arm and her lips were fast closed with an expression of speechless pain  slowly and in silence the two walked on until they reached the southern limit of the houses and entered on a little wilderness of shingle and withered grassthe desolate end of aldborough the lonely beginning of slaughden  it was a dull airless evening eastward was the gray majesty of the sea hushed in breathless calm the horizon line invisibly melting into the monotonous misty sky the idle ships shadowy and still on the idle water southward the high ridge of the sea dike and the grim massive circle of a martello tower reared high on its mound of grass closed the view darkly on all that lay beyond westward a lurid streak of sunset glowed red in the dreary heaven blackened the fringing trees on the far borders of the great inland marsh and turned its little gleaming waterpools to pools of blood nearer to the eye the sullen flow of the tidal river alde ebbed noiselessly from the muddy banks and nearer still lonely and unprosperous by the bleak waterside lay the lost little port of slaughden with its forlorn wharfs and warehouses of decaying wood and its few scattered coastingvessels deserted on the oozy rivershore no fall of waves was heard on the beach no trickling of waters bubbled audibly from the idle stream now and then the cry of a seabird rose from the region of the marsh and at intervals from farmhouses far in the inland waste the faint winding of horns to call the cattle home traveled mournfully through the evening calm  magdalen drew her hand from the captains arm and led the way to the mound of the martello tower i am weary of walking she said let us stop and rest here  she seated herself on the slope and resting on her elbow mechanically pulled up and scattered from her into the air the tufts of grass growing under her hand after silently occupying herself in this way for some minutes she turned suddenly on captain wragge do i surprise you she asked with a startling abruptness do you find me changed  the captains ready tact warned him that the time had come to be plain with her and to reserve his flowers of speech for a more appropriate occasion  if you ask the question i must answer it he replied yes i do find you changed  she pulled up another tuft of grass i suppose you can guess the reason she said  the captain was wisely silent he only answered by a bow  i have lost all care for myself she went on tearing faster and faster at the tufts of grass saying that is not saying much perhaps but it may help you to understand me there are things i would have died sooner than do at one timethings it would have turned me cold to think of i dont care now whether i do them or not i am nothing to myself i am no more interested in myself than i am in these handfuls o f grass i suppose i have lost something what is it heart conscience i dont know do you w hat nonsense i am talking who cares what i have lost it has gone and theres an end of it i suppose my outside is the best side of meand thats left at any rate i have not lost my good looks have i there there never mind answering dont trouble yourself to pay me compliments i have been admired enough today first the sailor and then mr noel vanstoneenough for any womans vanity surely have i any right to call myself a woman perhaps not i am only a girl in my teens oh me i feel as if i was forty she scattered the last fragments of grass to the winds and turning her back on the captain let her head droop till her cheek touched the turf bank it feels soft and friendly she said nestling to it with a hopeless tenderness horrible to see it doesnt cast me off mother earth the only mother i have left  captain wragge looked at her in silent surprise such experience of humanity as he possessed was powerless to sound to its depths the terrible selfabandonment which had burst its way to the surface in her reckless wordswhich was now fast hurrying her to actions more reckless still devilish odd he thought to himself uneasily has the loss of her lover turned her brain he considered for a minute longer and then spoke to her leave it till tomorrow suggested the captain confidentially you are a little tired tonight no hurry my dear girlno hurry  she raised her head instantly and looked round at him with the same angry resolution with the same desperate defiance of herself which he had seen in her face on the memorable day at york when she had acted before him for the first time i came here to tell you what is in my mind she said and i will tell it she seated herself upright on the slope and clasping her hands round her knees looked out steadily straight before her at the slowly darkening view in that strange position she waited until she had composed herself and then addressed the captain without turning her head to look round at him in these words  when you and i first met she began abruptly i tried hard to keep my thoughts to myself i know enough by this time to know that i failed when i first told you at york that michael vanstone had ruined us i believe you guessed for yourself that i for one was determined not to submit to it whether you guessed or not it is so i left my friends with that determination in my mind and i feel it in me now stronger ten times stronger than ever  ten times stronger than ever echoed the captain exactly sothe natural result of firmness of character  nothe natural result of having nothing else to think of i had something else to think of before you found me ill in vauxhall walk i have nothing else to think of now remember that if you find me for the future always harping on the same string one question first did you guess what i meant to do on that morning when you showed me the newspaper and when i read the account of michael vanstones death  generally replied captain wraggei guessed generally that you proposed dipping your hand into his purse and taking from it most properly what was your own i felt deeply hurt at the time by your not permitting me to assist you why is she so reserved with me i remarked to myselfwhy is she so unreasonably reserved  you shall have no reserve to complain of now pursued magdalen i tell you plainly if events had not happened as they did you would have assisted me if michael vanstone had not died i should have gone to brighton and have found my way safely to his acquaintance under an assumed name i had money enough with me to live on respectably for many months together i would have employed that timei would have waited a whole year if necessary to destroy mrs lecounts influence over himand i would have ended by getting that influence on my own terms into my own hands i had the advantage of years the advantage of novelty the advantage of downright desperation all on my side and i should have succeeded before the year was outbefore half the year was outyou should have seen mrs lecount dismissed by her master and you should have seen me taken into the house in her place as michael vanstones adopted daughteras the faithful friendwho had saved him from an adventuress in his old age girls no older than i am have tried deceptions as hopeless in appearance as mine and have carried them through to the end i had my story ready i had my plans all considered i had the weak point in that old man to attack in my way which mrs lecount had found out before me to attack in hers and i tell you again i should have succeeded  i think you would said the captain and what next  mr michael vanstone would have changed his man of business next you would have succeeded to the place and those clever speculations on which he was so fond of venturing would have cost him the fortunes of which he had robbed my sister and myself to the last farthing captain wragge as certainly as you sit there to the last farthing a bold conspiracy a shocking deceptionwasnt it i dont care any conspiracy any deception is justified to my conscience by the vile law which has left us helpless you talked of my reserve just now have i dropped it at last have i spoken out at the eleventh hour  the captain laid his hand solemnly on his heart and launched himself once more on his broadest flow of language  you fill me with unavailing regret he said if that old man had lived what a crop i might have reaped from him what enormous transactions in moral agriculture it might have been my privilege to carry on ars longa said captain wragge pathetically drifting into latinvita brevis let us drop a tear on the lost opportunities of the past and try what the present can do to console us one conclusion is clear to my mindthe experiment you proposed to try with mr michael vanstone is totally hopeless my dear girl in the case of his son his son is impervious to all common forms of pecuniary temptation you may trust my solemn assurance continued the captain speaking with an indignant recollection of the answer to his advertisement in the times when i inform you that mr noel vanstone is emphatically the meanest of mankind  i can trust my own experience as well said magdalen i have seen him and spoken to himi know him better than you do another disclosure captain wragge for your private ear i sent you back certain articles of costume when they had served the purpose for which i took them to london that purpose was to find my way to noel vanstone in disguise and to judge for myself of mrs lecount and her master i gained my object and i tell you again i know the two people in that house yonder whom we have now to deal with better than you do  captain wragge expressed the profound astonishment and asked the innocent questions appropriate to the mental condition of a person taken completely by surprise  well he resumed when magdalen had briefly answered him and what is the result on your own mind there must be a result or we should not be here you see your way of course my dear girl you see your way  yes she said quickly i see my way  the captain drew a little nearer to her with eager curiosity expressed in every line of his vagabond face  go on he said in an anxious whisper pray go on  she looked out thoughtfully into the gathering darkness without answering without appearing to have heard him her lips closed and her clasped hands tightened mechanically round her knees  there is no disguising the fact said captain wragge warily rousing her into speaking to him the son is harder to deal with than the father  not in my way she interposed suddenly  indeed said the captain well they say there is a short cut to everything if we only look long enough to find it you have looked long enough i suppose and the natural result has followedyou have found it  i have not troubled myself to look i have found it without looking  the deuce you have cried captain wragge in great perplexity my dear girl is my view of your present position leading me altogether astray as i understand it here is mr noel vanstone in possession of your fortune and your sisters as his father was and determined to keep it as his father was  yes  and here are youquite helpless to get it by persuasionquite helpless to get it by lawjust as resolute in his ease as you were in his fathers to take it by stratagem in spite of him  just as resolute not for the sake of the fortunemind that for the sake of the right  just so and the means of coming at that right which were hard with the fatherwho was not a miserare easy with the son who is  perfectly easy  write me down an ass for the first time in my life cried the captain at the end of his patience hang me if i know what you mean  she looked round at him for the first timelooked him straight and steadily in the face  i will tell you what i mean she said i mean to marry him  captain wragge started up on his knees and stopped on them petrified by astonishment  remember what i told you said magdalen looking away from him again i have lost all care for myself i have only one end in life now and the sooner i reach itand diethe better if she stopped altered her position a little and pointed with one hand to the fastebbing stream beneath her gleaming dim in the darkening twilightif i had been what i once was i would have thrown myself into that river sooner than do what i am going to do now as it is i trouble myself no longer i weary my mind with no more schemes the short way and the vile way lies before me i take it captain wragge and marry him  keeping him in total ignorance of who you are said the captain slowly rising to his feet and slowly moving round so as to see her face marrying him as my niece miss bygrave  as your niece miss bygrave  and after the marriage his voice faltered as he began the question and he left it unfinished  after the marriage she said i shall stand in no further need of your assistance  the captain stooped as she gave him that answer looked close at her and suddenly drew back without uttering a word he walked away some paces and sat down again doggedly on the grass if magdalen could have seen his face in the dying light his face would have startled her for the first time probably since his boyhood captain wragge had changed color he was deadly pale  have you nothing to say to me she asked perhaps you are waiting to hear what terms i have to offer these are my terms i pay all our expenses here and when we part on the day of the marriage you take a farewell gift away with you of two hundred pounds do you promise me your assistance on those conditions  what am i expected to do he asked with a furtive glance at her and a sudden distrust in his voice  you are expected to preserve my assumed character and your own she answered and you are to prevent any inquiries of mrs lecounts from discovering who i really am i ask no more the rest is my responsibilitynot yours  i have nothing to do with what happensat any time or in any placeafter the marriage  nothing whatever  i may leave you at the church door if i please  at the church door with your fee in your pocket  paid from the money in your own possession  certainly how else should i pay it  captain wragge took off his hat and passed his handkerchief over his face with an air of relief  give me a minute to consider it he said  as many minutes as you like she rejoined reclining on the bank in her former position and returning to her former occupation of tearing up the tufts of grass and flinging them out into the air   the captains reflections were not complicated by any unnecessary divergences from the contemplation of his own position to the contemplation of magdalens utterly incapable of appreciating the injury done her by franks infamous treachery to his engagementan injury which had severed her at one cruel blow from the aspiration which delusion though it was had been the saving aspiration of her lifecaptain wragge accepted the simple fact of her despair just as he found it and then looked straight to the consequences of the proposal which she had made to him  in the prospect before the marriage he saw nothing more serious involved than the practice of a deception in no important degree differentexcept in the end to be attained by itfrom the deceptions which his vagabond life had long since accustomed him to contemplate and to carry out in the prospect after the marriage he dimly discerned through the ominous darkness of the future the lurking phantoms of terror and crime and the black gulfs behind them of ruin and death a man of boundless audacity and resource within his own mean limits beyond those limits the captain was as deferentially submissive to the majesty of the law as the most harmless man in existence as cautious in looking after his own personal safety as the veriest coward that ever walked the earth but one serious question now filled his mind could he on the terms proposed to him join the conspiracy against noel vanstone up to the point of the marriage and then withdraw from it without risk of involving himself in the consequences which his experience told him must certainly ensue  strange as it may seem his decision in this emergency was mainly influenced by no less a person than noel vanstone himself the captain might have resisted the moneyoffer which magdalen had made to himfor the profits of the entertainment had filled his pockets with more than three times two hundred pounds but the prospect of dealing a blow in the dark at the man who had estimated his information and himself at the value of a five pound note proved too much for his caution and his selfcontrol on the small neutral ground of selfimportance the best men and the worst meet on the same terms captain wragges indignation when he saw the answer to his advertisement stooped to no retrospective estimate of his own conduct he was as deeply offended as sincerely angry as if he had made a perfectly honorable proposal and had been rewarded for it by a personal insult he had been too full of his own grievance to keep it out of his first letter to magdalen he had more or less forgotten himself on every subsequent occasion when noel vanstones name was mentioned and in now finally deciding the course he should take it is not too much to say that the motive of money receded for the first time in his life into the second place and the motive of malice carried the day   i accept the terms said captain wragge getting briskly on his legs again subject of course to the conditions agreed on between us we part on the weddingday i dont ask where you go you dont ask where i go from that time forth we are strangers to each other  magdalen rose slowly from the mound a hopeless depression a sullen despair showed itself in her look and manner she refused the captains offered hand and her tones when she answered him were so low that he could hardly hear her  we understand each other she said and we can now go back you may introduce me to mrs lecount tomorrow  i must ask a few questions first said the captain gravely there are more risks to be run in this matter and more pitfalls in our way than you seem to suppose i must know the whole history of your morning call on mrs lecount before i put you and that woman on speaking terms with each other  wait till tomorrow she broke out impatiently dont madden me by talking about it tonight  the captain said no more they turned their faces toward aldborough and walked slowly back  by the time they reached the houses night had overtaken them neither moon nor stars were visible a faint noiseless breeze blowing from the land had come with the darkness magdalen paused on the lonely public walk to breathe the air more freely after a while she turned her face from the breeze and looked out toward the sea the immeasurable silence of the calm waters lost in the black void of night was awful she stood looking into the darkness as if its mystery had no secrets for hershe advanced toward it slowly as if it drew her by some hidden attraction into itself  i am going down to the sea she said to her companion wait here and i will come back  he lost sight of her in an instant it was as if the night had swallowed her up he listened and counted her footsteps by the crashing of them on the shingle in the deep stillness they retreated slowly further and further away into the night suddenly the sound of them ceased had she paused on her course or had she reached one of the strips of sand left bare by the ebbing tide  he waited and listened anxiously the time passed and no sound reached him he still listened with a growing distrust of the darkness another moment and there came a sound from the invisible shore far and faint from the beach below a long cry moaned through the silence then all was still once more  in sudden alarm he stepped forward to descend to the beach and to call to her before he could cross the path footsteps rapidly advancing caught his ear he waited an instant and the figure of a man passed quickly along the walk between him and the sea it was too dark to discern anything of the strangers face it was only possible to see that he was a tall manas tall as that officer in the merchantservice whose name was kirke  the figure passed on northward and was instantly lost to view captain wragge crossed the path and advancing a few steps down the beach stopped and listened again the crash of footsteps on the shingle caught his ear once more slowly as the sound had left him that sound now came back he called to guide her to him she came on till he could just see hera shadow ascending the shingly slope and growing out of the blackness of the night  you alarmed me he whispered nervously i was afraid something had happened i heard you cry out as if you were in pain  did you she said carelessly i was in pain it doesnt matterits over now  her hand mechanically swung something to and fro as she answered him it was the little white silk bag which she had always kept hidden in her bosom up to this time one of the relics which it heldone of the relics which she had not had the heart to part with beforewas gone from its keeping forever alone on a strange shore she had torn from her the fondest of her virgin memories the dearest of her virgin hopes alone on a strange shore she had taken the lock of franks hair from its oncetreasured place and had cast it away from her to the sea and the night    chapter ii  the tall man who had passed captain wragge in the dark proceeded rapidly along the public walk struck off across a little waste patch of ground and entered the open door of the aldborough hotel the light in the passage falling full on his face as he passed it proved the truth of captain wragges surmise and showed the stranger to be mr kirke of the merchant service  meeting the landlord in the passage mr kirke nodded to him with the familiarity of an old customer have you got the paper he asked i want to look at the visitors list  i have got it in my room sir said the landlord leading the way into a parlor at the back of the house are there any friends of yours staying here do you think  without replying the seaman turned to the list as soon as the newspaper was placed in his hand and ran his finger down it name by name the finger suddenly stopped at this line seaview cottage mr noel vanstone kirke of the merchantservice repeated the name to himself and put down the paper thoughtfully  have you found anybody you know captain asked the landlord  i have found a name i knowa name my father used often to speak of in his time is this mr vanstone a family man do you know if there is a young lady in the house  i cant say captain my wife will be here directly she is sure to know it must have been some time ago if your father knew this mr vanstone  it was some time ago my father knew a subaltern officer of that name when he was with his regiment in canada it would be curious if the person here turned out to be the same man and if that young lady was his daughter  excuse me captainbut the young lady seems to hang a little on your mind said the landlord with a pleasant smile  mr kirke looked as if the form which his hosts goodhumor had just taken was not quite to his mind he returned abruptly to the subaltern officer and the regiment in canada that poor fellows story was as miserable a one as ever i heard he said looking back again absently at the visitors list  would there be any harm in telling it sir asked the landlord miserable or not a storys a story when you know it to be true  mr kirke hesitated i hardly think i should be doing right to tell it he said if this man or any relations of his are still alive it is not a story they might like strangers to know all i can tell you is that my father was the salvation of that young officer under very dreadful circumstances they parted in canada my father remained with his regiment the young officer sold out and returned to england and from that moment they lost sight of each other it would be curious if this vanstone here was the same man it would be curious  he suddenly checked himself just as another reference to the young lady was on the point of passing his lips at the same moment the landlords wife came in and mr kirke at once transferred his inquiries to the higher authority in the house  do you know anything of this mr vanstone who is down here on the visitors list asked the sailor is he an old man  hes a miserable little creature to look at replied the landlady but hes not old captain  then hes not the man i mean perhaps he is the mans son has he got any ladies with him  the landlady tossed her head and pursed up her lips disparagingly  he has a housekeeper with him she said a middleaged personnot one of my sort i dare say im wrongbut i dont like a dressy woman in her station of life  mr kirke began to look puzzled i must have made some mistake about the house he said surely theres a lawn cut octagonshape at seaview cottage and a white flagstaff in the middle of the gravelwalk  thats not seaview sir its north shingles youre talking of mr bygraves his wife and his niece came here by the coach today his wifes tall enough to be put in a show and the worstdressed woman i ever set eyes on but miss bygrave is worth looking at if i may venture to say so shes the finest girl to my mind weve had at aldborough for many a long day i wonder who they are do you know the name captain  no said mr kirke with a shade of disappointment on his dark weatherbeaten face i never heard the name before  after replying in those words he rose to take his leave the landlord vainly invited him to drink a parting glass the landlady vainly pressed him to stay another ten minutes and try a cup of tea he only replied that his sister expected him and that he must return to the parsonage immediately  on leaving the hotel mr kirke set his face westward and walked inland along the highroad as fast as the darkness would let him  bygrave he thought to himself now i know her name how much am i the wiser for it if it had been vanstone my fathers son might have had a chance of making acquaintance with her he stopped and looked back in the direction of aldborough what a fool i am he burst out suddenly striking his stick on the ground i was forty last birthday he turned and went on again faster than everhis head down his resolute black eyes searching the darkness on the land as they had searched it many a time on the sea from the deck of his ship  after more than an hours walking he reached a village with a primitive little church and parsonage nestled together in a hollow he entered the house by the back way and found his sister the clergymans wife sitting alone over her work in the parlor  where is your husband lizzie he asked taking a chair in a corner  william has gone out to see a sick person he had just time enough before he went she added with a smile to tell me about the young lady and he declares he will never trust himself at aldborough with you again until you are a steady married man she stopped and looked at her brother more attentively than she had looked at him yet robert she said laying aside her work and suddenly crossing the room to him you look anxious you look distressed william only laughed about your meeting with the young lady is it serious tell me what is she like  he turned his head away at the question  she took a stool at his feet and persisted in looking up at him is it serious robert she repeated softly  kirkes weatherbeaten face was accustomed to no concealmentsit answered for him before he spoke a word dont tell your husband till i am gone he said with a roughness quite new in his sisters experience of him i know i only deserve to be laughed at but it hurts me for all that  hurts you she repeated in astonishment  you cant think me half such a fool lizzie as i think myself pursued kirke bitterly a man at my age ought to know better i didnt set eyes on her for as much as a minute altogether and there i have been hanging about the place till after nightfall on the chance of seeing her againskulking i should have called it if i had found one of my men doing what i have been doing myself i believe im bewitched shes a mere girl lizziei doubt if shes out of her teensim old enough to be her father its all one she stops in my mind in spite of me ive had her face looking at me through the pitch darkness every step of the way to this house and its looking at me nowas plain as i see yours and plainer  he rose impatiently and began to walk backward and forward in the room his sister looked after him with surprise as well as sympathy expressed in her face from his boyhood upward she had always been accustomed to see him master of himself years since in the failing fortunes of the family he had been their example and their support she had heard of him in the desperate emergencies of a life at sea when hundreds of his fellowcreatures had looked to his steady selfpossession for rescue from closethreatening deathand had not looked in vain never in all her life before had his sister seen the balance of that calm and equal mind lost as she saw it lost now  how can you talk so unreasonably about your age and yourself she said there is not a woman alive robert who is good enough for you what is her name  bygrave do you know it  no but i might soon make acquaintance with her if we only had a little time before us if i could only get to aldborough and see herbut you are going away tomorrow your ship sails at the end of the week  thank god for that said kirke fervently  are you glad to be going away she asked more and more amazed at him  right glad lizzie for my own sake if i ever get to my senses again i shall find my way back to them on the deck of my ship this girl has got between me and my thoughts already she shant go a step further and get between me and my duty im determined on that fool as i am i have sense enough left not to trust myself within easy hail of aldborough tomorrow morning im good for another twenty miles of walking and ill begin my journey back tonight  his sister started up and caught him fast by the arm robert she exclaimed youre not serious you dont mean to leave us on foot alone in the dark  its only saying goodby my dear the last thing at night instead of the first thing in the morning he answered with a smile try and make allowances for me lizzie my life has been passed at sea and im not used to having my mind upset in this way men ashore are used to it men ashore can take it easy i cant if i stopped here i shouldnt rest if i waited till tomorrow i should only be going back to have another look at her i dont want to feel more ashamed of myself than i do already i want to fight my way back to my duty and myself without stopping to think twice about it darkness is nothing to meim used to darkness i have got the highroad to walk on and i cant lose my way let me go lizzie the only sweetheart i have any business with at my age is my ship let me get back to her  his sister still kept her hold of his arm and still pleaded with him to stay till the morning he listened to her with perfect patience and kindness but she never shook his determination for an instant  what am i to say to william she pleaded what will he think when he comes back and finds you gone  tell him i have taken the advice he gave us in his sermon last sunday say i have turned my back on the world the flesh and the devil  how can you talk so robert and the boys tooyou promised not to go without bidding the boys goodby  thats true i made my little nephews a promise and ill keep it he kicked off his shoes as he spoke on the mat outside the door light me upstairs lizzie ill bid the two boys goodby without waking them  she saw the uselessness of resisting him any longer and taking the candle went before him upstairs  the boysboth young childrenwere sleeping together in the same bed the youngest was his uncles favorite and was called by his uncles name he lay peacefully asleep with a rough little toy ship hugged fast in his arms kirkes eyes softened as he stole on tiptoe to the childs side and kissed him with the gentleness of a woman poor little man said the sailor tenderly he is as fond of his ship as i was at his age ill cut him out a better one when i come back will you give me my nephew one of these days lizzie and will you let me make a sailor of him  oh robert if you were only married and happy as i am  the time has gone by my dear i must make the best of it as i am with my little nephew there to help me  he left the room his sisters tears fell fast as she followed him into the parlor there is something so forlorn and dreadful in your leaving us like this she said shall i go to aldborough tomorrow robert and try if i can get acquainted with her for your sake  no he replied let her be if its ordered that i am to see that girl again i shall see her leave it to the future and you leave it right he put on his shoes and took up his hat and stick i wont overwalk myself he said cheerfully if the coach doesnt overtake me on the road i can wait for it where i stop to breakfast dry your eyes my dear and give me a kiss  she was like her brother in features and complexion and she had a touch of her brothers spirit she dashed away the tears and took her leave of him bravely  i shall be back in a years time said kirke falling into his old sailorlike way at the door ill bring you a china shawl lizzie and a chest of tea for your storeroom dont let the boys forget me and dont think im doing wrong to leave you in this way i know i am doing right god bless you and keep you my dearand your husband and your children goodby  he stooped and kissed her she ran to the door to look after him a puff of air extinguished the candle and the black night shut him out from her in an instant   three days afterward the firstclass merchantman deliverance kirke commander sailed from london for the china sea    chapter iii  the threatening of storm and change passed away with the night when morning rose over aldborough the sun was master in the blue heaven and the waves were rippling gayly under the summer breeze  at an hour when no other visitors to the wateringplace were yet astir the indefatigable wragge appeared at the door of north shingles villa and directed his steps northward with a neatlybound copy of joyces scientific dialogues in his hand arriving at the waste ground beyond the houses he descended to the beach and opened his book the interview of the past night had sharpened his perception of the difficulties to be encountered in the coming enterprise he was now doubly determined to try the characteristic experiment at which he had hinted in his letter to magdalen and to concentrate on himselfin the character of a remarkably wellinformed manthe entire interest and attention of the formidable mrs lecount  having taken his dose of readymade science to use his own expression the first thing in the morning on an empty stomach captain wragge joined his small family circle at breakfasttime inflated with information for the day he observed that magdalens face showed plain signs of a sleepless night she made no complaint her manner was composed and her temper perfectly under control mrs wraggerefreshed by some thirteen consecutive hours of uninterrupted reposewas in excellent spirits and up at heel for a wonder with both shoes she brought with her into the room several large sheets of tissuepaper cut crisply into mysterious and manyvarying forms which immediately provoked from her husband the short and sharp question what have you got there  patterns captain said mrs wragge in timidly conciliating tones i went shopping in london and bought an oriental cashmere robe it cost a deal of money and im going to try and save by making it myself ive got my patterns and my dressmaking directions written out as plain as print ill be very tidy captain ill keep in my own corner if youll please to give me one and whether my head buzzes or whether it dont ill sit straight at my work all the same  you will do your work said the captain sternly when you know who you are who i am and who that young lady isnot before show me your shoes good show me you cap good make the breakfast  when breakfast was over mrs wragge received her orders to retire into an adjoining room and to wait there until her husband came to release her as soon as her back was turned captain wragge at once resumed the conversation which had been suspended by magdalens own desire on the preceding night the questions he now put to her all related to the subject of her visit in disguise to noel vanstones house they were the questions of a thoroughly clearheaded manshort searching and straight to the point in less than half an hours time he had made himself acquainted with every incident that had happened in vauxhall walk  the conclusions which the captain drew after gaining his information were clear and easily stated  on the adverse side of the question he expressed his conviction that mrs lecount had certainly detected her visitor to be disguised that she had never really left the room though she might have opened and shut the door and that on both the occasions therefore when magdalen had been betrayed into speaking in her own voice mrs lecount had heard her on the favorable side of the question he was perfectly satisfied that the painted face and eyelids the wig and the padded cloak had so effectually concealed magdalens identity that she might in her own person defy the housekeepers closest scrutiny so far as the matter of appearance was concerned the difficulty of deceiving mrs lecounts ears as well as her eyes was he readily admitted not so easily to be disposed of but looking to the fact that magdalen on both the occasions when she had forgotten herself had spoken in the heat of anger he was of opinion that her voice had every reasonable chance of escaping detection if she carefully avoided all outbursts of temper for the future and spoke in those more composed and ordinary tones which mrs lecount had not yet heard upon the whole the captain was inclined to pronounce the prospect hopeful if one serious obstacle were cleared away at the outsetthat obstacle being nothing less than the presence on the scene of action of mrs wragge  to magdalens surprise when the course of her narrative brought her to the story of the ghost captain wragge listened with the air of a man who was more annoyed than amused by what he heard when she had done he plainly told her that her unlucky meeting on the stairs of the lodginghouse with mrs wragge was in his opinion the most serious of all the accidents that had happened in vauxhall walk  i can deal with the difficulty of my wifes stupidity he said as i have often dealt with it before i can hammer her new identity into her head but i cant hammer the ghost out of it we have no security that the woman in the gray cloak and poke bonnet may not come back to her recollection at the most critical time and under the most awkward circumstances in plain english my dear girl mrs wragge is a pitfall under our feet at every step we take  if we are aware of the pitfall said magdalen we can take our measures for avoiding it what do you propose  i propose replied the captain the temporary removal of mrs wragge speaking purely in a pecuniary point of view i cant afford a total separation from her you have often read of very poor people being suddenly enriched by legacies reaching them from remote and unexpected quarters mrs wragges case when i married her was one of these an elderly female relative shared the favors of fortune on that occasion with my wife and if i only keep up domestic appearances i happen to know that mrs wragge will prove a second time profitable to me on that elderly relatives death but for this circumstance i should probably long since have transferred my wife to the care of society at largein the agreeable conviction that if i didnt support her somebody else would although i cant afford to take this course i see no objection to having her comfortably boarded and lodged out of our way for the time beingsay at a retired farmhouse in the character of a lady in infirm mental health you would find the expense trifling i should find the relief unutterable what do you say shall i pack her up at once and take her away by the next coach  no replied magdalen firmly the poor creatures life is hard enough already i wont help to make it harder she was affectionately and truly kind to me when i was ill and i wont allow her to be shut up among strangers while i can help it the risk of keeping her here is only one risk more i will face it captain wragge if you wont  think twice said the captain gravely before you decide on keeping mrs wragge  once is enough rejoined magdalen i wont have her sent away  very good said the captain resignedly i never interfere with questions of sentiment but i have a word to say on my own behalf if my services are to be of any use to you i cant have my hands tied at starting this is serious i wont trust my wife and mrs lecount together im afraid if youre not and i make it a condition that if mrs wragge stops here she keeps her room if you think her health requires it you can take her for a walk early in the morning or late in the evening but you must never trust her out with the servant and never trust her out by herself i put the matter plainly it is too important to be trifled with what do you sayyes or no  i say yes replied magdalen after a moments consideration on the understanding that i am to take her out walking as you propose  captain wragge bowed and recovered his suavity of manner what are our plans he inquired shall we start our enterprise this afternoon are you ready for your introduction to mrs lecount and her master  quite ready  good again we will meet them on the parade at their usual hour for going outtwo oclock it is no t twelve yet i have two hours before mejust time enough to fit my wife into her new skin the process is absolutely necessary to prevent her compromising us with the servant dont be afraid about the results mrs wragge has had a copious selection of assumed names hammered into her head in the course of her matrimonial career it is merely a question of hammering hard enoughnothing more i think we have settled everything now is there anything i can do before two oclock have you any employment for the morning  no said magdalen i shall go back to my own room and try to rest  you had a disturbed night i am afraid said the captain politely opening the door for her  i fell asleep once or twice she answered carelessly i suppose my nerves are a little shaken the bold black eyes of that man who stared so rudely at me yesterday evening seemed to be looking at me again in my dreams if we see him today and if he annoys me any more i must trouble you to speak to him we will meet here again at two oclock dont be hard with mrs wragge teach her what she must learn as tenderly as you can  with those words she left him and went upstairs  she lay down on her bed with a heavy sigh and tried to sleep it was useless the dull weariness of herself which now possessed her was not the weariness which finds its remedy in repose she rose again and sat by the window looking out listlessly over the sea  a weaker nature than hers would not have felt the shock of franks desertion as she had felt itas she was feeling it still a weaker nature would have found refuge in indignation and comfort in tears the passionate strength of magdalens love clung desperately to the sinking wreck of its own delusionclung until she tore herself from it by plain force of will all that her native pride her keen sense of wrong could do was to shame her from dwelling on the thoughts which still caught their breath of life from the undying devotion of the past which still perversely ascribed franks heartless farewell to any cause but the inborn baseness of the man who had written it the woman never lived yet who could cast a truelove out of her heart because the object of that love was unworthy of her all she can do is to struggle against it in secretto sink in the contest if she is weak to win her way through it if she is strong by a process of selflaceration which is of all moral remedies applied to a womans nature the most dangerous and the most desperate of all moral changes the change that is surest to mark her for life magdalens strong nature had sustained her through the struggle and the issue of it had left her what she now was  after sitting by the window for nearly an hour her eyes looking mechanically at the view her mind empty of all impressions and conscious of no thoughts she shook off the strange waking stupor that possessed her and rose to prepare herself for the serious business of the day  she went to the wardrobe and took down from the pegs two bright delicate muslin dresses which had been made for summer wear at comberaven a year since and which had been of too little value to be worth selling when she parted with her other possessions after placing these dresses side by side on the bed she looked into the wardrobe once more it only contained one other summer dressthe plain alpaca gown which she had worn during her memorable interview with noel vanstone and mrs lecount this she left in its place resolving not to wear itless from any dread that the housekeeper might recognize a pattern too quiet to be noticed and too common to be remembered than from the conviction that it was neither gay enough nor becoming enough for her purpose after taking a plain white muslin scarf a pair of light gray kid gloves and a gardenhat of tuscan straw from the drawers of the wardrobe she locked it and put the key carefully in her pocket  instead of at once proceeding to dress herself she sat idly looking at the two muslin gowns careless which she wore and yet inconsistently hesitating which to choose what does it matter she said to herself with a reckless laugh i am equally worthless in my own estimation whichever i put on she shuddered as if the sound of her own laughter had startled her and abruptly caught up the dress which lay nearest to her hand its colors were blue and whitethe shade of blue which best suited her fair complexion she hurriedly put on the gown without going near her lookingglass for the first time in her life she shrank from meeting the reflection of herselfexcept for a moment when she arranged her hair under her gardenhat leaving the glass again immediately she drew her scarf over her shoulders and fitted on her gloves with her back to the toilettable shall i paint she asked herself feeling instinctively that she was turning pale the rouge is still left in my box it cant make my face more false than it is already she looked round toward the glass and again turned away from it no she said i have mrs lecount to face as well as her master no paint after consulting her watch she left the room and went downstairs again it wanted ten minutes only of two oclock  captain wragge was waiting for her in the parlorrespectable in a frockcoat a stiff summer cravat and a high white hat specklessly and cheerfully rural in a buff waistcoat gray trousers and gaiters to match his collars were higher than ever and he carried a brandnew campstool in his hand any tradesman in england who had seen him at that moment would have trusted him on the spot  charming said the captain paternally surveying magdalen when she entered the room so fresh and cool a little too pale my dear and a great deal too serious otherwise perfect try if you can smile  when the time comes for smiling said magdalen bitterly trust my dramatic training for any change of face that may be necessary where is mrs wragge  mrs wragge has learned her lesson replied the captain and is rewarded by my permission to sit at work in her own room i sanction her new fancy for dressmaking because it is sure to absorb all her attention and to keep her at home there is no fear of her finishing the oriental robe in a hurry for there is no mistake in the process of making it which she is not certain to commit she will sit incubating her gownpardon the expressionlike a hen over an addled egg i assure you her new whim relieves me nothing could be more convenient under existing circumstances  he strutted away to the window looked out and beckoned to magdalen to join him there they are he said and pointed to the parade  noel vanstone slowly walked by as she looked dressed in a complete suit of oldfashioned nankeen it was apparently one of the days when the state of his health was at the worst he leaned on mrs lecounts arm and was protected from the sun by a light umbrella which she held over him the housekeeperdressed to perfection as usual in a quiet lavendercolored summer gown a black mantilla an unassuming straw bonnet and a crisp blue veilescorted her invalid master with the tenderest attention sometimes directing his notice respectfully to the various objects of the sea view sometimes bending her head in graceful acknowledgment of the courtesy of passing strangers on the parade who stepped aside to let the invalid pass by she produced a visible effect among the idlers on the beach they looked after her with unanimous interest and exchanged confidential nods of approval which said as plainly as words could have expressed it a very domestic person a truly superior woman  captain wragges partycolored eyes followed mrs lecount with a steady distrustful attention tough work for us there he whispered in magdalens ear tougher work than you think before we turn that woman out of her place  wait said magdalen quietly wait and see  she walked to the door the captain followed her without making any further remark ill wait till youre married he thought to himselfnot a moment longer offer me what you may  at the h ouse door magdalen addressed him again  we will go that way she said pointing southward then turn and meet them as they come back  captain wragge signified his approval of the arrangement and followed magdalen to the garden gate as she opened it to pass through her attention was attracted by a lady with a nurserymaid and two little boys behind her loitering on the path outside the garden wall the lady started looked eagerly and smiled to herself as magdalen came out curiosity had got the better of kirkes sister and she had come to aldborough for the express purpose of seeing miss bygrave  something in the shape of the ladys face something in the expression of her dark eyes reminded magdalen of the merchantcaptain whose uncontrolled admiration had annoyed her on the previous evening she instantly returned the strangers scrutiny by a frowning ungracious look the lady colored paid the look back with interest and slowly walked on  a hard bold bad girl thought kirkes sister what could robert be thinking of to admire her i am almost glad he is gone i hope and trust he will never set eyes on miss bygrave again  what boors the people are here said magdalen to captain wragge that woman was even ruder than the man last night she is like him in the face i wonder who she is  ill find out directly said the captain we cant be too cautious about strangers he at once appealed to his friends the boatmen they were close at hand and magdalen heard the questions and answers plainly  how are you all this morning said captain wragge in his easy jocular way and hows the wind norwest and by west is it very good who is that lady  thats mrs strickland sir  ay ay the clergymans wife and the captains sister wheres the captain today  on his way to london i should think sir his ship sails for china at the end of the week  china as that one word passed the mans lips a pang of the old sorrow struck magdalen to the heart stranger as he was she began to hate the bare mention of the merchantcaptains name he had troubled her dreams of the past night and now when she was most desperately and recklessly bent on forgetting her old homeexistence he had been indirectly the cause of recalling her mind to frank  come she said angrily to her companion what do we care about the man or his ship come away  by all means said captain wragge as long as we dont find friends of the bygraves what do we care about anybody  they walked on southward for ten minutes or more then turned and walked back again to meet noel vanstone and mrs lecount    chapter iv  captain wragge and magdalen retraced their steps until they were again within view of north shingles villa before any signs appeared of mrs lecount and her master at that point the housekeepers lavendercolored dress the umbrella and the feeble little figure in nankeen walking under it became visible in the distance the captain slackened his pace immediately and issued his directions to magdalen for her conduct at the coming interview in these words  dont forget your smile he said in all other respects you will do the walk has improved your complexion and the hat becomes you look mrs lecount steadily in the face show no embarrassment when you speak and if mr noel vanstone pays you pointed attention dont take too much notice of him while his housekeepers eye is on you mind one thing i have been at joyces scientific dialogues all the morning and i am quite serious in meaning to give mrs lecount the full benefit of my studies if i cant contrive to divert her attention from you and her master i wont give sixpence for our chance of success smalltalk wont succeed with that woman compliments wont succeed jokes wont succeedreadymade science may recall the deceased professor and readymade science may do we must establish a code of signals to let you know what i am about observe this campstool when i shift it from my left hand to my right i am talking joyce when i shift it from my right hand to my left i am talking wragge in the first case dont interrupt mei am leading up to my point in the second case say anything you like my remarks are not of the slightest consequence would you like a rehearsal are you sure you understand very goodtake my arm and look happy steady here they are  the meeting took place nearly midway between seaview cottage and north shingles captain wragge took off his tall white hat and opened the interview immediately on the friendliest terms  goodmorning mrs lecount he said with the frank and cheerful politeness of a naturally sociable man goodmorning mr vanstone i am sorry to see you suffering today mrs lecount permit me to introduce my niecemy niece miss bygrave my dear girl this is mr noel vanstone our neighbor at seaview cottage we must positively be sociable at aldborough mrs lecount there is only one walk in the place as my niece remarked to me just now mr vanstone and on that walk we must all meet every time we go out and why not are we formal people on either side nothing of the sort we are just the reverse you possess the continental facility of manner mr vanstonei match you with the blunt cordiality of an oldfashioned englishmanthe ladies mingle together in harmonious variety like flowers on the same bedand the result is a mutual interest in making our sojourn at the seaside agreeable to each other pardon my flow of spirits pardon my feeling so cheerful and so young the iodine in the seaair mrs lecountthe notorious effect of the iodine in the seaair  you arrived yesterday miss bygrave did you not said the housekeeper as soon as the captains deluge of language had come to an end  she addressed those words to magdalen with a gentle motherly interest in her youth and beauty chastened by the deferential amiability which became her situation in noel vanstones household not the faintest token of suspicion or surprise betrayed itself in her face her voice or her manner while she and magdalen now looked at each other it was plain at the outset that the true face and figure which she now saw recalled nothing to her mind of the false face and figure which she had seen in vauxhall walk the disguise had evidently been complete enough even to baffle the penetration of mrs lecount  my aunt and i came here yesterday evening said magdalen we found the latter part of the journey very fatiguing i dare say you found it so too  she designedly made her answer longer than was necessary for the purpose of discovering at the earliest opportunity the effect which the sound of her voice produced on mrs lecount  the housekeepers thin lips maintained their motherly smile the housekeepers amiable manner lost none of its modest deference but the expression of her eyes suddenly changed from a look of attention to a look of inquiry magdalen quietly said a few words more and then waited again for results the change spread gradually all over mrs lecounts face the motherly smile died away and the amiable manner betrayed a slight touch of restraint still no signs of positive recognition appeared the housekeepers expression remained what it had been from the firstan expression of inquiry and nothing more  you complained of fatigue sir a few minutes since she said dropping all further conversation with magdalen and addressing her master will you go indoors and rest  the proprietor of seaview cottage had hitherto confined himself to bowing simpering and admiring magdalen through his halfclosed eyelids there was no mistaking the sudden flutter and agitation in his manner and the heightened color in his wizen little face even the reptile temperament of noel vanstone warmed under the influence of the sex he had an undeniably appreciative eye for a handsome woman and magdalens grace and beauty were not thrown away on him  will you go indoors sir and rest asked the housekeeper repeating her quest ion  not yet lecount said her master i fancy i feel stronger i fancy i can go on a little he turned simpering to magdalen and added in a lower tone i have found a new interest in my walk miss bygrave dont desert us or you will take the interest away with you  he smiled and smirked in the highest approval of the ingenuity of his own complimentfrom which captain wragge dexterously diverted the housekeepers attention by ranging himself on her side of the path and speaking to her at the same moment they all four walked on slowly mrs lecount said nothing more she kept fast hold of her masters arm and looked across him at magdalen with the dangerous expression of inquiry more marked than ever in her handsome black eyes that look was not lost on the wary wragge he shifted his indicative campstool from the left hand to the right and opened his scientific batteries on the spot  a busy scene mrs lecount said the captain politely waving his campstool over the sea and the passing ships the greatness of england maamthe true greatness of england pray observe how heavily some of those vessels are laden i am often inclined to wonder whether the british sailor is at all aware when he has got his cargo on board of the hydrostatic importance of the operation that he has performed if i were suddenly transported to the deck of one of those ships which heaven forbid for i suffer at sea and if i said to a member of the crew jack you have done wonders you have grasped the theory of floating vesselshow the gallant fellow would stare and yet on that theory jacks life depends if he loads his vessel onethirtieth part more than he ought what happens he sails past aldborough i grant you in safety he enters the thames i grant you again in safety he gets on into the fresh water as far let us say as greenwich anddown he goes down maam to the bottom of the river as a matter of scientific certainty  here he paused and left mrs lecount no polite alternative but to request an explanation  with infinite pleasure maam said the captain drowning in the deepest notes of his voice the feeble treble in which noel vanstone paid his compliments to magdalen we will start if you please with a first principle all bodies whatever that float on the surface of the water displace as much fluid as is equal in weight to the weight of the bodies good we have got our first principle what do we deduce from it manifestly this that in order to keep a vessel above water it is necessary to take care that the vessel and its cargo shall be of less weight than the weight of a quantity of waterpray follow me hereof a quantity of water equal in bulk to that part of the vessel which it will be safe to immerse in the water now maam saltwater is specifically thirty times heavier than fresh or river water and a vessel in the german ocean will not sink so deep as a vessel in the thames consequently when we load our ship with a view to the london market we have hydrostatically speaking three alternatives either we load with onethirtieth part less than we can carry at sea or we take onethirtieth part out at the mouth of the river or we do neither the one nor the other and as i have already had the honor of remarkingdown we go such said the captain shifting the campstool back again from his right hand to his left in token that joyce was done with for the time being such my dear madam is the theory of floating vessels permit me to add in conclusion you are heartily welcome to it  thank you sir said mrs lecount you have unintentionally saddened me but the information i have received is not the less precious on that account it is long long ago mr bygrave since i have heard myself addressed in the language of science my dear husband made me his companionmy dear husband improved my mind as you have been trying to improve it nobody has taken pains with my intellect since many thanks sir your kind consideration for me is not thrown away  she sighed with a plaintive humility and privately opened her ears to the conversation on the other side of her  a minute earlier she would have heard her master expressing himself in the most flattering terms on the subject of miss bygraves appearance in her seaside costume but magdalen had seen captain wragges signal with the campstool and had at once diverted noel vanstone to the topic of himself and his possessions by a neatlytimed question about his house at aldborough  i dont wish to alarm you miss bygrave were the first words of noel vanstones which caught mrs lecounts attention but there is only one safe house in aldborough and that house is mine the sea may destroy all the other housesit cant destroy mine my father took care of that my father was a remarkable man he had my house built on piles i have reason to believe they are the strongest piles in england nothing can possibly knock them downi dont care what the sea doesnothing can possibly knock them down  then if the sea invades us said magdalen we must all run for refuge to you  noel vanstone saw his way to another compliment and at the same moment the wary captain saw his way to another burst of science  i could almost wish the invasion might happen murmured one of the gentlemen to give me the happiness of offering the refuge  i could almost swear the wind had shifted again exclaimed the other where is a man i can ask oh there he is boatman hows the wind now norwest and by west stillhey and southeast and by south yesterday eveningha is there anything more remarkable mrs lecount than the variableness of the wind in this climate proceeded the captain shifting the campstool to the scientific side of him is there any natural phenomenon more bewildering to the scientific inquirer you will tell me that the electric fluid which abounds in the air is the principal cause of this variableness you will remind me of the experiment of that illustrious philosopher who measured the velocity of a great storm by a flight of small feathers my dear madam i grant all your propositions  i beg your pardon sir said mrs lecount you kindly attribute to me a knowledge that i dont possess propositions i regret to say are quite beyond me  dont misunderstand me maam continued the captain politely unconscious of the interruption my remarks apply to the temperate zone only place me on the coasts beyond the tropicsplace me where the wind blows toward the shore in the daytime and toward the sea by nightand i instantly advance toward conclusive experiments for example i know that the heat of the sun during the day rarefies the air over the land and so causes the wind you challenge me to prove it i escort you down the kitchen stairs with your kind permission take my largest piedish out of the cooks hands i fill it with cold water good that dish of cold water represents the ocean i next provide myself with one of our most precious domestic conveniences a hotwater plate i fill it with hot water and i put it in the middle of the piedish good again the hotwater plate represents the land rarefying the air over it bear that in mind and give me a lighted candle i hold my lighted candle over the cold water and blow it out the smoke immediately moves from the dish to the plate before you have time to express your satisfaction i light the candle once more and reverse the whole proceeding i fill the piedish with hotwater and the plate with cold i blow the candle out again and the smoke moves this time from the plate to the dish the smell is disagreeablebut the experiment is conclusive  he shifted the campstool back again and looked at mrs lecount with his ingratiating smile you dont find me longwinded maamdo you he said in his easy cheerful way just as the housekeeper was privately opening her e ars once more to the conversation on the other side of her  i am amazed sir by the range of y our information replied mrs lecount observing the captain with some perplexitybut thus far with no distrust she thought him eccentric even for an englishman and possibly a little vain of his knowledge but he had at least paid her the implied compliment of addressing that knowledge to herself and she felt it the more sensibly from having hitherto found her scientific sympathies with her deceased husband treated with no great respect by the people with whom she came in contact have you extended your inquiries sir she proceeded after a momentary hesitation to my late husbands branch of science i merely ask mr bygrave because though i am only a woman i think i might exchange ideas with you on the subject of the reptile creation  captain wragge was far too sharp to risk his readymade science on the enemys ground the old militiaman shook his wary head  too vast a subject maam he said for a smatterer like me the life and labors of such a philosopher as your husband mrs lecount warn men of my intellectual caliber not to measure themselves with a giant may i inquire proceeded the captain softly smoothing the way for future intercourse with seaview cottage whether you possess any scientific memorials of the late professor  i possess his tank sir said mrs lecount modestly casting her eyes on the ground and one of his subjectsa little foreign toad  his tank exclaimed the captain in tones of mournful interest and his toad pardon my blunt way of speaking my mind maam you possess an object of public interest and as one of the public i acknowledge my curiosity to see it  mrs lecounts smooth cheeks colored with pleasure the one assailable place in that cold and secret nature was the place occupied by the memory of the professor her pride in his scientific achievements and her mortification at finding them but little known out of his own country were genuine feelings never had captain wragge burned his adulterated incense on the flimsy altar of human vanity to better purpose than he was burning it now  you are very good sir said mrs lecount in honoring my husbands memory you honor me but though you kindly treat me on a footing of equality i must not forget that i fill a domestic situation i shall feel it a privilege to show you my relics if you will allow me to ask my masters permission first  she turned to noel vanstone her perfectly sincere intention of making the proposed request minglingin that strange complexity of motives which is found so much oftener in a womans mind than in a manswith her jealous distrust of the impression which magdalen had produced on her master  may i make a request sir asked mrs lecount after waiting a moment to catch any fragments of tenderlypersonal talk that might reach her and after being again neatly baffled by magdalenthanks to the campstool mr bygrave is one of the few persons in england who appreciate my husbands scientific labors he honors me by wishing to see my little world of reptiles may i show it to him  by all means lecount said noel vanstone graciously you are an excellent creature and i like to oblige you lecounts tank mr bygrave is the only tank in englandlecounts toad is the oldest toad in the world will you come and drink tea at seven oclock tonight and will you prevail on miss bygrave to accompany you i want her to see my house i dont think she has any idea what a strong house it is come and survey my premises miss bygrave you shall have a stick and rap on the walls you shall go upstairs and stamp on the floors and then you shall hear what it all cost his eyes wrinkled up cunningly at the corners and he slipped another tender speech into magdalens ear under cover of the allpredominating voice in which captain wragge thanked him for the invitation come punctually at seven he whispered and pray wear that charming hat  mrs lecounts lips closed ominously she set down the captains niece as a very serious drawback to the intellectual luxury of the captains society  you are fatiguing yourself sir she said to her master this is one of your bad days let me recommend you to be careful let me beg you to walk back  having carried his point by inviting the new acquaintances to tea noel vanstone proved to be unexpectedly docile he acknowledged that he was a little fatigued and turned back at once in obedience to the housekeepers advice  take my arm sirtake my arm on the other side said captain wragge as they turned to retrace their steps his partycolored eyes looked significantly at magdalen while he spoke and warned her not to stretch mrs lecounts endurance too far at starting she instantly understood him and in spite of noel vanstones reiterated assertions that he stood in no need of the captains arm placed herself at once by the housekeepers side mrs lecount recovered her goodhumor and opened another conversation with magdalen by making the one inquiry of all others which under existing circumstances was the hardest to answer  i presume mrs bygrave is too tired after her journey to come out today said mrs lecount shall we have the pleasure of seeing her tomorrow  probably not replied magdalen my aunt is in delicate health  a complicated case my dear madam added the captain conscious that mrs wragges personal appearance if she happened to be seen by accident would offer the flattest of all possible contradictions to what magdalen had just said of her there is some remote nervous mischief which doesnt express itself externally you would think my wife the picture of health if you looked at her and yet so delusive are appearances i am obliged to forbid her all excitement she sees no societyour medical attendant i regret to say absolutely prohibits it  very sad said mrs lecount the poor lady must often feel lonely sir when you and your niece are away from her  no replied the captain mrs bygrave is a naturally domestic woman when she is able to employ herself she finds unlimited resources in her needle and thread having reached this stage of the explanation and having purposely skirted as it were round the confines of truth in the event of the housekeepers curiosity leading her to make any private inquiries on the subject of mrs wragge the captain wisely checked his fluent tongue from carrying him into any further details i have great hope from the air of this place he remarked in conclusion the iodine as i have already observed does wonders  mrs lecount acknowledged the virtues of iodine in the briefest possible form of words and withdrew into the innermost sanctuary of her own thoughts some mystery here said the housekeeper to herself a lady who looks the picture of health a lady who suffers from a complicated nervous malady and a lady whose hand is steady enough to use her needle and threadis a living mass of contradictions i dont quite understand do you make a long stay at aldborough sir she added aloud her eyes resting for a moment in steady scrutiny on the captains face  it all depends my dear madam on mrs bygrave i trust we shall stay through the autumn you are settled at seaview cottage i presume for the season  you must ask my master sir it is for him to decide not for me  the answer was an unfortunate one noel vanstone had been secretly annoyed by the change in the walking arrangements which had separated him from magdalen he attributed that change to the meddling influence of mrs lecount and he now took the earliest opportunity of resenting it on the spot  i have nothing to do with our stay at aldborough he broke out peevishly you know as well as i do lecount it all depends on you mrs lecount has a brother in switzerland he went on addressing himself to the captaina brother who is seriously ill if he gets worse she will have to go the re to see him i cant accompany her and i cant be left in the house by myself i shall have t o break up my establishment at aldborough and stay with some friends it all depends on you lecountor on your brother which comes to the same thing if it depended on me continued mr noel vanstone looking pointedly at magdalen across the housekeeper i should stay at aldborough all through the autumn with the greatest pleasure with the greatest pleasure he reiterated repeating the words with a tender look for magdalen and a spiteful accent for mrs lecount  thus far captain wragge had remained silent carefully noting in his mind the promising possibilities of a separation between mrs lecount and her master which noel vanstones little fretful outbreak had just disclosed to him an ominous trembling in the housekeepers thin lips as her master openly exposed her family affairs before strangers and openly set her jealously at defiance now warned him to interfere if the misunderstanding were permitted to proceed to extremities there was a chance that the invitation for that evening to seaview cottage might be put off now as ever equal to the occasion captain wragge called his useful information once more to the rescue under the learned auspices of joyce he plunged for the third time into the ocean of science and brought up another pearl he was still haranguing on pneumatics this time still improving mrs lecounts mind with his politest perseverance and his smoothest flow of languagewhen the walking party stopped at noel vanstones door  bless my soul here we are at your house sir said the captain interrupting himself in the middle of one of his graphic sentences i wont keep you standing a moment not a word of apology mrs lecount i beg and pray i will put that curious point in pneumatics more clearly before you on a future occasion in the meantime i need only repeat that you can perform the experiment i have just mentioned to your own entire satisfaction with a bladder an exhausted receiver and a square box at seven oclock this evening sirat seven oclock mrs lecount we have had a remarkably pleasant walk and a most instructive interchange of ideas now my dear girl your aunt is waiting for us  while mrs lecount stepped aside to open the garden gate noel vanstone seized his opportunity and shot a last tender glance at magdalen under shelter of the umbrella which he had taken into his own hands for that express purpose dont forget he said with the sweetest smile dont forget when you come this evening to wear that charming hat before he could add any last words mrs lecount glided back to her place and the sheltering umbrella changed hands again immediately  an excellent mornings work said captain wragge as he and magdalen walked on together to north shingles you and i and joyce have all three done wonders we have secured a friendly invitation at the first days fishing for it  he paused for an answer and receiving none observed magdalen more attentively than he had observed her yet her face had turned deadly pale again her eyes looked out mechanically straight before her in heedless reckless despair  what is the matter he asked with the greatest surprise are you ill  she made no reply she hardly seemed to hear him  are you getting alarmed about mrs lecount he inquired next there is not the least reason for alarm she may fancy she has heard something like your voice before but your face evidently bewilders her keep your temper and you keep her in the dark keep her in the dark and you will put that two hundred pounds into my hands before the autumn is over  he waited again for an answer and again she remained silent the captain tried for the third time in another direction  did you get any letters this morning he went on is there bad news again from home any fresh difficulties with your sister  say nothing about my sister she broke out passionately neither you nor i are fit to speak of her  she said those words at the gardengate and hurried into the house by herself he followed her and heard the door of her own room violently shut to violently locked and doublelocked solacing his indignation by an oath captain wragge sullenly went into one of the parlors on the groundfloor to look after his wife the room communicated with a smaller and darker room at the back of the house by means of a quaint little door with a window in the upper half of it softly approaching this door the captain lifted the white muslin curtain which hung over the window and looked into the inner room  there was mrs wragge with her cap on one side and her shoes down at heel with a row of pins between her teeth with the oriental cashmere robe slowly slipping off the table with her scissors suspended uncertain in one hand and her written directions for dressmaking held doubtfully in the otherso absorbed over the invincible difficulties of her employment as to be perfectly unconscious that she was at that moment the object of her husbands superintending eye under other circumstances she would have been soon brought to a sense of her situation by the sound of his voice but captain wragge was too anxious about magdalen to waste any time on his wife after satisfying himself that she was safe in her seclusion and that she might be trusted to remain there  he left the parlor and after a little hesitation in the passage stole upstairs and listened anxiously outside magdalens door a dull sound of sobbinga sound stifled in her handkerchief or stifled in the bedclotheswas all that caught his ear he returned at once to the groundfloor with some faint suspicion of the truth dawning on his mind at last  the devil take that sweetheart of hers thought the captain mr noel vanstone has raised the ghost of him at starting     chapter v  when magdalen appeared in the parlor shortly before seven oclock not a trace of discomposure was visible in her manner she looked and spoke as quietly and unconcernedly as usual  the lowering distrust on captain wragges face cleared away at the sight of her there had been moments during the afternoon when he had seriously doubted whether the pleasure of satisfying the grudge he owed to noel vanstone and the prospect of earning the sum of two hundred pounds would not be dearly purchased by running the risk of discovery to which magdalens uncertain temper might expose him at any hour of the day the plain proof now before him of her powers of selfcontrol relieved his mind of a serious anxiety it mattered little to the captain what she suffered in the privacy of her own chamber as long as she came out of it with a face that would bear inspection and a voice that betrayed nothing  on the way to seaview cottage captain wragge expressed his intention of asking the housekeeper a few sympathizing questions on the subject of her invalid brother in switzerland he was of opinion that the critical condition of this gentlemans health might exercise an important influence on the future progress of the conspiracy any chance of a separation he remarked between the housekeeper and her master was under existing circumstances a chance which merited the closest investigation if we can only get mrs lecount out of the way at the right time whispered the captain as he opened his hosts garden gate our man is caught  in a minute more magdalen was again under noel vanstones roof this time in the character of his own invited guest  the proceedings of the evening were for the most part a repetition of the proceedings during the morning walk noel vanstone vibrated between his admiration of magdalens beauty and his glorification of his own possessions captain wragges inexhaustible outbursts of informationrelieved by delicatelyindirect inquiries relating to mrs lecounts brotherperpetually diverted the housekeepers jealous vigilance from dwelling on the looks and language of her master so the evening passed until ten oclock by that time the captains readymade science was exhausted and the housekeepers temper was forcing its way to the surface once more captain wragge warned magdalen by a look and in spite of noel vanstones hospitable protest wisely rose to say goodnight  i have got my information remarked the captain on the way back mrs lecounts brother lives at zurich he is a bachelor he possesses a little money and his sister is his nearest relation if he will only be so obliging as to break up altogether he will save us a world of trouble with mrs lecount  it was a fine moonlight night he looked round at magdalen as he said those words to see if her intractable depression of spirits had seized on her again  no her variable humor had changed once more she looked about her with a flaunting feverish gayety she scoffed at the bare idea of any serious difficulty with mrs lecount she mimicked noel vanstones highpitched voice and repeated noel vanstones highflown compliments with a bitter enjoyment of turning him into ridicule instead of running into the house as before she sauntered carelessly by her companions side humming little snatches of song and kicking the loose pebbles right and left on the gardenwalk captain wragge hailed the change in her as the best of good omens he thought he saw plain signs that the family spirit was at last coming back again  well he said as he lit her bedroom candle for her when we all meet on the parade tomorrow we shall see as our nautical friends say how the land lies one thing i can tell you my dear girli have used my eyes to very little purpose if there is not a storm brewing tonight in mr noel vanstones domestic atmosphere  the captains habitual penetration had not misled him as soon as the door of seaview cottage was closed on the parting guests mrs lecount made an effort to assert the authority which magdalens influence was threatening already  she employed every artifice of which she was mistress to ascertain magdalens true position in noel vanstones estimation she tried again and again to lure him into an unconscious confession of the pleasure which he felt already in the society of the beautiful miss bygrave she twined herself in and out of every weakness in his character as the frogs and efts twined themselves in and out of the rockwork of her aquarium but she made one serious mistake which very clever people in their intercourse with their intellectual inferiors are almost universally apt to commitshe trusted implicitly to the folly of a fool she forgot that one of the lowest of human qualitiescunningis exactly the capacity which is often most largely developed in the lowest of intellectual natures if she had been honestly angry with her master she would probably have frightened him if she had opened her mind plainly to his view she would have astonished him by presenting a chain of ideas to his limited perceptions which they were not strong enough to grasp his curiosity would have led him to ask for an explanation and by practicing on that curiosity she might have had him at her mercy as it was she set her cunning against his and the fool proved a match for her noel vanstone to whom all largeminded motives under heaven were inscrutable mysteries saw the smallminded motive at the bottom of his housekeepers conduct with as instantaneous a penetration as if he had been a man of the highest ability mrs lecount left him for the night foiled and knowing she was foiledleft him with the tigerish side of her uppermost and a lowlived longing in her elegant fingernails to set them in her masters face  she was not a woman to be beaten by one defeat or by a hundred she was positively determined to think and think again until she had found a means of checking the growing intimacy with the bygraves at once and forever in the solitude of her own room she recovered her composure and set herself for the first time to review the conclusions which she had gathered from the events of the day  there was something vaguely familiar to her in the voice of this miss bygrave and at the same time in unaccountable contradiction something strange to her as well the face and figure of the young lady were entirely new to her it was a striking face and a striking figure and if she had seen either at any former period she would certainly have remembered it miss bygrave was unquestionably a stranger and yet  she had got no further than this during the day she could get no further now the chain of thought broke her mind took up the fragments and formed another chain which attached itself to the lady who was kept in seclusionto the aunt who looked well and yet was nervous who was nervous and yet able to ply her needle and thread an incomprehensible resemblance to some unremembered voice in the niece an unintelligible malady which kept the aunt secluded from public view an extraordinary range of scientific cultivation in the uncle associated with a coarseness and audacity of manner which by no means suggested the idea of a man engaged in studious pursuitswere the members of this small family of three what they seemed on the surface of them  with that question on her mind she went to bed  as soon as the candle was out the darkness seemed to communicate some inexplicable perversity to her thoughts they wandered back from present things to past in spite of her they brought her old master back to life again they revived forgotten sayings and doings in the english circle at zurich they veered away to the old mans deathbed at brighton they moved from brighton to london they entered the bare comfortless room at vauxhall walk they set the aquarium back in its place on the kitchen table and put the false miss garth in the chair by the side of it shading her inflamed eyes from the light they placed the anonymous letter the letter which glanced darkly at a conspiracy in her hand again and brought her with it into her masters presence they recalled the discussion about filling in the blank space in the advertisement and the quarrel that followed when she told noel vanstone that the sum he had offered was preposterously small they revived an old doubt which had not troubled her for weeks pasta doubt whether the threatened conspiracy had evaporated in mere words or whether she and her master were likely to hear of it again at this point her thoughts broke off once more and there was a momentary blank the next instant she started up in bed her heart beating violently her head whirling as if she had lost her senses with electric suddenness her mind pieced together its scattered multitude of thoughts and put them before her plainly under one intelligible form in the allmastering agitation of the moment she clapped her hands together and cried out suddenly in the darkness  miss vanstone again  she got out of bed and kindled the light once more steady as her nerves were the shock of her own suspicion had shaken them her firm hand trembled as she opened her dressingcase and took from it a little bottle of salvolatile in spite of her smooth cheeks and her wellpreserved hair she looked every year of her age as she mixed the spirit with water greedily drank it and wrapping her dressinggown round her sat down on the bedside to get possession again of her calmer self  she was quite incapable of tracing the mental process which had led her to discovery she could not get sufficiently far from herself to see that her halfformed conclusions on the subject of the bygraves had ended in making that family objects of suspicion to her that the association of ideas had thereupon carried her mind back to that other object of suspicion which was represented by the conspiracy against her master and that the two ideas of those two separate subjects of distrust coming suddenly in contact had struck the light she was not able to reason back in this way from the effect to the cause she could only feel that the suspicion had become more than a suspicion already conviction itself could not have been more firmly rooted in her mind  looking back at magdalen by the new light now thrown on her mrs lecount would fain have persuaded herself that she recognized some traces left of the false miss garths face and figure in the graceful and beautiful girl who had sat at her masters table hardly an hour sincethat she found resemblances now which she had never thought of before between the angry voice she had heard in vauxhall walk and the smooth wellbred tones which still hung on her ears after the evenings experience downstairs she would fain have persuaded herself that she had reached these results with no undue straining of the truth as she really knew it but the effort was in vain  mrs lecount was not a woman to waste time and thought in trying to impose on herself she accepted the inevitable conclusion that the guesswork of a moment had led her to discovery and more than that she recognized the plain truthunwelcome as it wasthat the conviction now fixed in her own mind was thus far unsupported by a single fragment of producible evidence to justify it to the minds of others  under these circumstances what was the safe course to take with her master  if she candidly told him when they met the next morning what had passed through her mind that night her knowledge of noel vanstone warned her that one of two results would certainly happen either he would be angry and disputatious would ask for proofs and finding none forthcoming would accuse her of alarming him without a cause to serve her own jealous end of keeping magdalen out of the house or he would be seriously startled would clamor for the protection of the law and would warn the bygraves to stand on their defense at the outset if magdalen only had been concerned in the plot this latter consequence would have assumed no great importance in the housekeepers mind but seeing the deception as she now saw it she was far too clever a woman to fail in estimating the captains inexhaustible fertility of resource at its true value if i cant meet this impudent villain with plain proofs to help me thought mrs lecount i may open my master s eyes tomorrow morning and mr bygrave will shut them up again before night the rascal is playing with all his own cards under the table and he will win the game to a certainty if he sees my hand at starting  this policy of waiting was so manifestly the wise policythe wily mr bygrave was so sure to have provided himself in case of emergency with evidence to prove the identity which he and his niece had assumed for their purposethat mrs lecount at once decided to keep her own counsel the next morning and to pause before attacking the conspiracy until she could produce unanswerable facts to help her her masters acquaintance with the bygraves was only an acquaintance of one days standing there was no fear of its developing into a dangerous intimacy if she merely allowed it to continue for a few days more and if she permanently checked it at the latest in a weeks time  in that period what measures could she take to remove the obstacles which now stood in her way and to provide herself with the weapons which she now wanted  reflection showed her three different chances in her favorthree different ways of arriving at the necessary discovery  the first chance was to cultivate friendly terms with magdalen and then taking her unawares to entrap her into betraying herself in noel vanstones presence the second chance was to write to the elder miss vanstone and to ask with some alarming reason for putting the question for information on the subject of her younger sisters whereabouts and of any peculiarities in her personal appearance which might enable a stranger to identify her the third chance was to penetrate the mystery of mrs bygraves seclusion and to ascertain at a personal interview whether the invalid ladys real complaint might not possibly be a defective capacity for keeping her husbands secrets resolving to try all three chances in the order in which they are here enumerated and to set her snares for magdalen on the day that was now already at hand mrs lecount at last took off her dressinggown and allowed her weaker nature to plead with her for a little sleep  the dawn was breaking over the cold gray sea as she lay down in her bed again the last idea in her mind before she fell asleep was characteristic of the womanit was an idea that threatened the captain he has trifled with the sacred memory of my husband thought the professors widow on my life and honor i will make him pay for it   early the next morning magdalen began the day according to her agreement with the captain by taking mrs wragge out for a little exercise at an hour when there was no fear of her attracting the public attention she pleaded hard to be left at home having the oriental cashmere robe still on her mind and feeling it necessary to read her directions for dressmaking for the hundredth time at least before to use her own expression she could screw up her courage to put the scissors into the stuff but her companion would take no denial and she was forced to go out the one guileless purpose of the life which magdalen now led was the resolution that poor mrs wragge should not be made a prisoner on her account and to that resolution she mechanically clung as the last token left her by which she knew her betterself  they returned later than usual to breakfast while mrs wragge was upstairs straightening herself from head to foot to meet the morning inspection of her husbands orderly eye and while magdalen and the captain were waiting for her in the parlor the servant came in with a note from seaview cottage the messenger was waiting for an answer and the note was addressed to captain wragge  the captain opened the note and read these lines   dear sirmr noel vanstone desires me to write and tell you that he proposes enjoying this fine day by taking a long drive to a place on the coast here called dunwich he is anxious to know if you will share the expense of a carriage and give him the pleasure of your company and miss bygraves company on this excursion i am kindly permitted to be one of the party and if i may say so without impropriety i would venture to add that i shall feel as much pleasure as my master if you and your young lady will consent to join us we propose leaving aldborough punctually at eleven oclock believe me dear sir your humble servant  virginie lecount   who is the letter from asked magdalen noticing a change in captain wragges face as he read it what do they want with us at seaview cottage  pardon me said the captain gravely this requires consideration let me have a minute or two to think  he took a few turns up and down the room then suddenly stepped aside to a table in a corner on which his writing materials were placed i was not born yesterday maam said the captain speaking jocosely to himself he winked his brown eye took up his pen and wrote the answer  can you speak now inquired magdalen when the servant had left the room what does that letter say and how have you answered it  the captain placed the letter in her hand i have accepted the invitation he replied quietly  magdalen read the letter hidden enmity yesterday she said and open friendship today what does it mean  it means said captain wragge that mrs lecount is even sharper than i thought her she has found you out  impossible cried magdalen quite impossible in the time  i cant say how she has found you out proceeded the captain with perfect composure she may know more of your voice than we supposed she knew or she may have thought us on reflection rather a suspicious family and anything suspicious in which a woman was concerned may have taken her mind back to that morning call of yours in vauxhall walk whichever way it may be the meaning of this sudden change is clear enough she has found you out and she wants to put her discovery to the proof by slipping in an awkward question or two under cover of a little friendly talk my experience of humanity has been a varied one and mrs lecount is not the first sharp practitioner in petticoats whom i have had to deal with all the worlds a stage my dear girl and one of the scenes on our little stage is shut in from this moment  with those words he took his copy of joyces scientific dialogues out of his pocket youre done with already my friend said the captain giving his useful information a farewell smack with his hand and locking it up in the cupboard such is human popularity continued the indomitable vagabond putting the key cheerfully in his pocket yesterday joyce was my allinall today i dont care that for him he snapped his fingers and sat down to breakfast  i dont understand you said magdalen looking at him angrily are you leaving me to my own resources for the future  my dear girl cried captain wragge cant you accustom yourself to my dash of humor yet i have done with my readymade science simply because i am quite sure that mrs lecount has done believing in me havent i accepted the invitation to dunwich make your mind easy the help i have given you already counts for nothing compared with the help i am going to give you now my honor is concerned in bowling out mrs lecount this last move of hers has made it a personal matter between us the woman actually thinks she can take me in cried the captain striking his knifehandle on the table in a transport of virtuous indignation by heavens i never was so insulted before in my life draw your chair in to the table my dear and give me half a minutes attention to what i have to say next  magdalen obeyed him captain wragge cautiously lowered his voice before he went on  i have told you all along he said the one thing needful is never to let mrs lecount catch you with your wits woolgathering i say the same after what has happened this morning let her suspect you i defy her to find a fragment of foundation for her suspicions unless we help her we shall see today if she has been foolish enough to betray herself to her master before she has any facts to support her i doubt it if she has told him we will rain down proofs of our identity with the bygraves on his feeble little head till it absolutely aches with conviction you have two things to do on this excursion first to distrust every word mrs lecount says to you secondly to exert all your fascinations and make sure of mr noel vanstone dating from today i will give you the opportunity when we leave the carriage and take our walk at dunwich wear your hat wear your smile do your figure justice lace tight put on your neatest boots and brightest gloves tie the miserable little wretch to your apronstringtie him fast and leave the whole management of the matter after that to me steady here is mrs wragge we must be doubly careful in looking after her now show me your cap mrs wragge show me your shoes what do i see on your apron a spot i wont have spots take it off after breakfast and put on another pull your chair to the middle of the tablemore to the leftmore still make the breakfast  at a quarter before eleven mrs wragge with her own entire concurrence was dismissed to the back room to bewilder herself over the science of dressmaking for the rest of the day punctually as the clock struck the hour mrs lecount and her master drove up to the gate of north shingles and found magdalen and captain wragge waiting for them in the garden  on the way to dunwich nothing occurred to disturb the enjoyment of the drive noel vanstone was in excellent health and high goodhumor lecount had apologized for the little misunderstanding of the previous night lecount had petitioned for the excursion as a treat to herself he thought of these concessions and looked at magdalen and smirked and simpered without intermission mrs lecount acted her part to perfection she was motherly with magdalen and tenderly attentive to noel vanstone she was deeply interested in captain wragges conversation and meekly disappointed to find it turn on general subjects to the exclusion of science not a word or look escaped her which hinted in the remotest degree at her real purpose she was dressed with her customary elegance and propriety and she was the only one of the party on that sultry summers day who was perfectly cool in the hottest part of the journey  as they left the carriage on their arrival at dunwich the captain seized a moment when mrs lecounts eye was off him and fortified magdalen by a last warning word  ware the cat he whispered she will show her claws on the way back  they left the village and walked to the ruins of a convent near at handthe last relic of the once populous city of dunwich which has survived the destruction of the place centuries since by the alldevouring sea after looking at the ruins they sought the shade of a little wood between the village and the low sandhills which overlook the german ocean here captain wragge maneuvered so as to let magdalen and noel vanstone advance some distance in front of mrs lecount and himself took the wrong path and immediately lost his way with the most consummate dexterity after a few minutes wandering in the wrong direction he reached an open space near the sea and politely opening his campstool for the housekeepers accommodation proposed waiting where they were until the missing members of the party came that way and discovered them  mrs lecount accepted the proposal she was perfectly well aware that her escort had lost himself on purpose but that discovery exercised no disturbing influence on the smooth amiability of her manner her day of reckoning with the captain had not come yetshe merely added the new item to her list and availed herself of the campstool captain wragge stretched himself in a romantic attitude at her feet and the two determined enemies grouped like two lovers in a picture fell into as easy and pleasant a conversation as if they had been friends of twenty years standing  i know you maam thought the captain while mrs lecount was talking to him you would like to catch me tripping in my readymade science and you wouldnt object to drown me in the professors tank  you villain with the brown eye and the green thought mrs lecount as the captain caught the ball of conversation in his turn thick as your skin is ill sting you through it yet  in this frame of mind toward each other they talked fluently on general subjects on public affairs on local scenery on society in england and society in switzerland on health climate books marriage and moneytalked without a moments pause without a single misunderstanding on either side for nearly an hour before magdalen and noel vanstone strayed that way and made the party of four complete again  when they reached the inn at which the carriage was waiting for them captain wragge left mrs lecount in undisturbed possession of her master and signed to magdalen to drop back for a moment and speak to him  well asked the captain in a whisper is he fast to your apronstring  she shuddered from head to foot as she answered  he has kissed my hand she said does that tell you enough dont let him sit next me on the way home i have borne all i can bearspare me for the rest of the day  ill put you on the front seat of the carriage replied the captain side by side with me  on the journey back mrs lecount verified captain wragges prediction she showed her claws  the time could not have been better chosen the circumstances could hardly have favored her more magdalens spirits were depressed she was weary in body and mind and she sat exactly opposite the housekeeper who had been compelled by the new arrangement to occupy the seat of honor next her master with every facility for observing the slightest changes that passed over magdalens face mrs lecount tried he r first experiment by leading the conversation to the subject of london and to the relative advantages offered to residents by the various quarters of the metropolis on both sides of the river the everready wragge penetrated her intention sooner than she had anticipated and interposed immediately youre coming to vauxhall walk maam thought the captain ill get there before you  he entered at once into a purely fictitious description of the various quarters of london in which he had himself resided and adroitly mentioning vauxhall walk as one of them saved magdalen from the sudden question relating to that very locality with which mrs lecount had proposed startling her to begin with from his residences he passed smoothly to himself and poured his whole family history in the character of mr bygrave into the housekeepers earsnot forgetting his brothers grave in honduras with the monument by the selftaught negro artist and his brothers hugely corpulent widow on the groundfloor of the boardinghouse at cheltenham as a means of giving magdalen time to compose herself this outburst of autobiographical information attained its object but it answered no other purpose mrs lecount listened without being imposed on by a single word the captain said to her he merely confirmed her conviction of the hopelessness of taking noel vanstone into her confidence before she had facts to help her against captain wragges otherwise unassailable position in the identity which he had assumed she quietly waited until he had done and then returned to the charge  it is a coincidence that your uncle should have once resided in vauxhall walk she said addressing herself to magdalen mr noel has a house in the same place and we lived there before we came to aldborough may i inquire miss bygrave whether you know anything of a lady named miss garth  this time she put the question before the captain could interfere magdalen ought to have been prepared for it by what had already passed in her presence but her nerves had been shaken by the earlier events of the day and she could only answer the question in the negative after an instants preliminary pause to control herself her hesitation was of too momentary a nature to attract the attention of any unsuspicious person but it lasted long enough to confirm mrs lecounts private convictions and to encourage her to advance a little further  i only asked she continued steadily fixing her eyes on magdalen steadily disregarding the efforts which captain wragge made to join in the conversation because miss garth is a stranger to me and i am curious to find out what i can about her the day before we left town miss bygrave a person who presented herself under the name i have mentioned paid us a visit under very extraordinary circumstances  with a smooth ingratiating manner with a refinement of contempt which was little less than devilish in its ingenious assumption of the language of pity she now boldly described magdalens appearance in disguise in magdalens own presence she slightingly referred to the master and mistress of comberaven as persons who had always annoyed the elder and more respectable branch of the family she mourned over the children as following their parents example and attempting to take a mercenary advantage of mr noel vanstone under the protection of a respectable persons character and a respectable persons name cleverly including her master in the conversation so as to prevent the captain from effecting a diversion in that quarter sparing no petty aggravation striking at every tender place which the tongue of a spiteful woman can wound she would beyond all doubt have carried her point and tortured magdalen into openly betraying herself if captain wragge had not checked her in full career by a loud exclamation of alarm and a sudden clutch at magdalens wrist  ten thousand pardons my dear madam cried the captain i see in my nieces face i feel in my nieces pulse that one of her violent neuralgic attacks has come on again my dear girl why hesitate among friends to confess that you are in pain what mistimed politeness her face shows she is sufferingdoesnt it mrs lecount darting pains mr vanstone darting pains on the left side of the head pull down your veil my dear and lean on me our friends will excuse you our excellent friends will excuse you for the rest of the day  before mrs lecount could throw an instants doubt on the genuineness of the neuralgic attack her masters fidgety sympathy declared itself exactly as the captain had anticipated in the most active manifestations he stopped the carriage and insisted on an immediate change in the arrangement of the placesthe comfortable back seat for miss bygrave and her uncle the front seat for lecount and himself had lecount got her smellingbottle excellent creature let her give it directly to miss bygrave and let the coachman drive carefully if the coachman shook miss bygrave he should not have a halfpenny for himself mesmerism was frequently useful in these cases mr noel vanstones father had been the most powerful mesmerist in europe and mr noel vanstone was his fathers son might he mesmerize might he order that infernal coachman to draw up in a shady place adapted for the purpose would medical help be preferred could medical help be found any nearer than aldborough that ass of a coachman didnt know stop every respectable man who passed in a gig and ask him if he was a doctor so mr noel vanstone ran on with brief intervals for breathingtime in a continuallyascending scale of sympathy and selfimportance throughout the drive home  mrs lecount accepted her defeat without uttering a word from the moment when captain wragge interrupted her her thin lips closed and opened no more for the remainder of the journey the warmest expressions of her masters anxiety for the suffering young lady provoked from her no outward manifestations of anger she took as little notice of him as possible she paid no attention whatever to the captain whose exasperating consideration for his vanquished enemy made him more polite to her than ever the nearer and the nearer they got to aldborough the more and more fixedly mrs lecounts hard black eyes looked at magdalen reclining on the opposite seat with her eyes closed and her veil down  it was only when the carriage stopped at north shingles and when captain wragge was handing magdalen out that the housekeeper at last condescended to notice him as he smiled and took off his hat at the carriage door the strong restraint she had laid on herself suddenly gave way and she flashed one look at him which scorched up the captains politeness on the spot he turned at once with a hasty acknowledgment of noel vanstones last sympathetic inquiries and took magdalen into the house i told you she would show her claws he said it is not my fault that she scratched you before i could stop her she hasnt hurt you has she  she has hurt me to some purpose said magdalenshe has given me the courage to go on say what must be done tomorrow and trust me to do it she sighed heavily as she said those words and went up to her room  captain wragge walked meditatively into the parlor and sat down to consider he felt by no means so certain as he could have wished of the next proceeding on the part of the enemy after the defeat of that day the housekeepers farewell look had plainly informed him that she was not at the end of her resources yet and the old militiaman felt the full importance of preparing himself in good time to meet the next step which she took in advance he lit a cigar and bent his wary mind on the dangers of the future  while captain wragge was considering in the parlor at north shingles mrs lecount was meditating in her bedroom at sea view her exasperation at the failure of her first attempt to expose the conspiracy had not blinded her to the instant necessity of making a second effort before noel vanstones growing infatuation got beyond her control the snare set for magdalen having failed the chance of entrapping magdalens sister was the next chance to try mrs lecount ordered a cup of tea opened her writingcase and began the rough draft of a letter to be sent to miss vanstone the elder by the morrows post  so the days skirmish ended the heat of the battle was yet to come    chapter vi  all human penetration has its limits accurately as captain wragge had seen his way hitherto even his sharp insight was now at fault he finished his cigar with the mortifying conviction that he was totally unprepared for mrs lecounts next proceeding in this emergency his experience warned him that there was one safe course and one only which he could take he resolved to try the confusing effect on the housekeeper of a complete change of tactics before she had time to press her advantage and attack him in the dark with this view he sent the servant upstairs to request that miss bygrave would come down and speak to him  i hope i dont disturb you said the captain when magdalen entered the room allow me to apologize for the smell of tobacco and to say two words on the subject of our next proceedings to put it with my customary frankness mrs lecount puzzles me and i propose to return the compliment by puzzling her the course of action which i have to suggest is a very simple one i have had the honor of giving you a severe neuralgic attack already and i beg your permission when mr noel vanstone sends to inquire tomorrow morning to take the further liberty of laying you up altogether question from seaview cottage how is miss bygrave this morning answer from north shingles much worse miss bygrave is confined to her room question repeated every day say for a fortnight how is miss bygrave answer repeated if necessary for the same time no better can you bear the imprisonment i see no objection to your getting a breath of fresh air the first thing in the morning or the last thing at night but for the whole of the day there is no disguising it you must put yourself in the same category with mrs wraggeyou must keep your room  what is your object in wishing me to do this inquired magdalen  my object is twofold replied the captain i blush for my own stupidity but the fact is i cant see my way plainly to mrs lecounts next move all i feel sure of is that she means to make another attempt at opening her masters eyes to the truth whatever means she may employ to discover your identity personal communication with you must be necessary to the accomplishment of her object very good if i stop that communication i put an obstacle in her way at startingor as we say at cards i force her hand do you see the point  magdalen saw it plainly the captain went on  my second reason for shutting you up he said refers entirely to mrs lecounts master the growth of love my dear girl is in one respect unlike all other growthsit flourishes under adverse circumstances our first course of action is to make mr noel vanstone feel the charm of your society our next is to drive him distracted by the loss of it i should have proposed a few more meetings with a view to furthering this end but for our present critical position toward mrs lecount as it is we must trust to the effect you produced yesterday and try the experiment of a sudden separation rather sooner than i could have otherwise wished i shall see mr noel vanstone though you dont and if there is a raw place established anywhere about the region of that gentlemans heart trust me to hit him on it you are now in full possession of my views take your time to consider and give me your answeryes or no  any change is for the better said magdalen which keeps me out of the company of mrs lecount and her master let it be as you wish  she had hitherto answered faintly and wearily but she spoke those last words with a heightened tone and a rising colorsigns which warned captain wragge not to press her further  very good said the captain as usual we understand each other i see you are tired and i wont detain you any longer  he rose to open the door stopped halfway to it and came back again leave me to arrange matters with the servant downstairs he continued you cant absolutely keep your bed and we must purchase the girls discretion when she answers the door without taking her into our confidence of course i will make her understand that she is to say you are ill just as she might say you are not at home as a way of keeping unwelcome acquaintances out of the house allow me to open the door for youi beg your pardon you are going into mrs wragges workroom instead of going to your own  i know i am said magdalen i wish to remove mrs wragge from the miserable room she is in now and to take her upstairs with me  for the evening  for the whole fortnight  captain wragge followed her into the diningroom and wisely closed the door before he spoke again  do you seriously mean to inflict my wifes society on yourself for a fortnight he asked in great surprise  your wife is the only innocent creature in this guilty house she burst out vehemently i must and will have her with me  pray dont agitate yourself said the captain take mrs wragge by all means i dont want her having resigned the partner of his existence in those terms he discreetly returned to the parlor the weakness of the sex thought the captain tapping his sagacious head lay a strain on the female intellect and the female temper gives way directly  the strain to which the captain alluded was not confined that evening to the female intellect at north shingles it extended to the female intellect at sea view for nearly two hours mrs lecount sat at her desk writing correcting and writing again before she could produce a letter to miss vanstone the elder which exactly accomplished the object she wanted to attain at last the rough draft was completed to her satisfaction and she made a fair copy of it forthwith to be posted the next day  her letter thus produced was a masterpiece of ingenuity after the first preliminary sentences the housekeeper plainly informed norah of the appearance of the visitor in disguise at vauxhall walk of the conversation which passed at the interview and of her own suspicion that the person claiming to be miss garth was in all probability the younger miss vanstone herself having told the truth thus far mrs lecount next proceeded to say that her master was in possession of evidence which would justify him in putting the law in force that he knew the conspiracy with which he was threatened to be then in process of direction against him at aldborough and that he only hesitated to protect himself in deference to family considerations and in the hope that the elder miss vanstone might so influence her sister as to render it unnecessary to proceed to extremities  under these circumstances the letter continued it was plainly necessary that the disguised visitor to vauxhall walk should be properly identified for if mrs lecounts guess proved to be wrong and if the person turned out to be a stranger mr noel vanstone was positively resolved to prosecute in his own defense events at aldborough on which it was not necessary to dwell would enable mrs lecount in a few days to gain sight of the suspected person in her own character but as the housekeeper was entirely unacquainted with the younger miss vanstone it was obviously desirable that some better informed person should in this particular take the matter in hand if the elder miss vanstone happened to be at liberty to come to aldborough herself would she kindly write and say so and mrs lecount would write back again to appoint a day if on the other hand miss vanstone was prevented from taking the journey mrs lecount suggested that her reply should contain the fullest description of her sisters personal appearanceshould mention any little peculiarities which might exist in the way of marks on her face or her handsand should state in case she had written lately what the address was in her last letter and failing that what the postmark was on the envelope with this information to help her mrs lecount would in the interest of the misguided young lady herself accept the responsibility of privately identifying her and would write back immediately to acquaint the elder miss vanstone with the result  the difficulty of sending this letter to the right address gave mrs lecount very little trouble remembering the name of the lawyer who had pleaded the cause of the two sisters in michael vanstones time she directed her letter to miss vanstone care ofpendril esquire london this she inclosed in a second envelope addressed to mr noel vanstones solicitor with a line inside requesting that gentleman to send it at once to the office of mr pendril  now thought mrs lecount as she locked the letter up in her desk preparatory to posting it the next day with her own hand now i have got her   the next morning the servant from sea view came with her masters compliments to make inquiries after miss bygraves health captain wragges bulletin was duly announcedmiss bygrave was so ill as to be confined to her room  on the reception of this intelligence noel vanstones anxiety led him to call at north shingles himself when he went out for his afternoon walk miss bygrave was no better he inquired if he could see mr bygrave the worthy captain was prepared to meet this emergency he thought a little irritating suspense would do noel vanstone no harm and he had carefully charged the servant in case of necessity with her answer mr bygrave begged to be excused he was not able to see any one  on the second day inquiries were made as before by message in the morning and by noel vanstone himself in the afternoon the morning answer relating to magdalen was a shade better the afternoon answer relating to captain wragge was mr bygrave has just gone out that evening noel vanstones temper was very uncertain and mrs lecounts patience and tact were sorely tried in the effort to avoid offending him  on the third morning the report of the suffering young lady was less favorablemiss bygrave was still very poorly and not able to leave her bed the servant returning to sea view with this message met the postman and took into the breakfastroom with her two letters addressed to mrs lecount  the first letter was in a handwriting familiar to the housekeeper it was from the medical attendant on her invalid brother at zurich and it announced that the patients malady had latterly altered in so marked a manner for the better that there was every hope now of preserving his life  the address on the second letter was in a strange handwriting mrs lecount concluding that it was the answer from miss vanstone waited to read it until breakfast was over and she could retire to her own room  she opened the letter looked at once for the name at the end and started a little as she read it the signature was not norah vanstone but harriet garth   miss garth announced that the elder miss vanstone had a week since accepted an engagement as governess subject to the condition of joining the family of her employer at their temporary residence in the south of france and of returning with them when they came back to england probably in a month or six weeks time during the interval of this necessary absence miss vanstone had requested miss garth to open all her letters her main object in making that arrangement being to provide for the speedy answering of any communication which might arrive for her from her sister miss magdalen vanstone had not written since the middle of julyon which occasion the postmark on the letter showed that it must have been posted in london in the district of lambethand her elder sister had left england in a state of the most distressing anxiety on her account  having completed this explanation miss garth then mentioned that family circumstances prevented her from traveling personally to aldborough to assist mrs lecounts object but that she was provided with a substitute in every way fitter for the purpose in the person of mr pendril that gentleman was well acquainted with miss magdalen vanstone and his professional experience and discretion would render his assistance doubly valuable he had kindly consented to travel to aldborough whenever it might be thought necessary but as his time was very valuable miss garth specially requested that he might not be sent for until mrs lecount was quite sure of the day on which his services might be required  while proposing this arrangement miss garth added that she thought it right to furnish her correspondent with a written description of the younger miss vanstone as well an emergency might happen which would allow mrs lecount no time for securing mr pendrils services and the execution of mr noel vanstones intentions toward the unhappy girl who was the object of his forbearance might be fatally delayed by an unforeseen difficulty in establishing her identity the personal description transmitted under these circumstances then followed it omitted no personal peculiarity by which magdalen could be recognized and it included the two little moles close together on the left side of the neck which had been formerly mentioned in the printed handbills sent to york  in conclusion miss garth expressed her fears that mrs lecounts suspicions were only too likely to be proved true while however there was the faintest chance that the conspiracy might turn out to be directed by a stranger miss garth felt bound in gratitude toward mr noel vanstone to assist the legal proceedings which would in that case be instituted she accordingly appended her own formal denialwhich she would personally repeat if necessaryof any identity between herself and the person in disguise who had made use of her name she was the miss garth who had filled the situation of the late mr andrew vanstones governess and she had never in her life been in or near the neighborhood of vauxhall wall  with this disclaimer and with the writers fervent assurances that she would do all for magdalens advantage which her sister might have done if her sister had been in england the letter concluded it was signed in full and was dated with the businesslike accuracy in such matters which had always distinguished miss garths character   this letter placed a formidable weapon in the housekeepers hands  it provided a means of establishing magdalens identity through the intervention of a lawyer by profession it contained a personal description minute enough to be used to advantage if necessary before mr pendrils appearance it presented a signed exposure of the false miss garth under the hand of the true miss garth and it established the fact that the last letter received by the elder miss vanstone from the younger had been posted and therefore probably written in the neighborhood of vauxhall walk if any later letter had been received with the aldborough postmark the chain of evidence so far as the question of localities was concerned might doubtless have been more complete but as it was there was testimony enough aided as that testimony might be by the fragment of the brown alpaca dress still in mrs lecounts possession to raise the veil which hung over the conspiracy and to place mr noel vanstone face to face with the plain and startling truth  the one obstacle which now stood in the way of immediate action on the housekeepers part was the obstacle of miss bygraves present seclusion within the limits of her own room the question of gaining personal access to her was a question which must be decided before any communication could be opened with mr pendril mrs lecount put on her bonnet at once and called at north shingles to try what discoveries she could make for herself before posttime  on this occasion mr bygrave was at home and she was admitted without the least difficulty  careful consideration that morning had dec ided captain wragge on advancing matters a little nearer to the crisis the means by which he proposed achieving this result made it necessary for him to see the housekeeper and her master separately and to set them at variance by producing two totally opposite impressions relating to himself on their minds mrs lecounts visit therefore instead of causing him any embarrassment was the most welcome occurrence he could have wished for he received her in the parlor with a marked restraint of manner for which she was quite unprepared his ingratiating smile was gone and an impenetrable solemnity of countenance appeared in its stead  i have ventured to intrude on you sir said mrs lecount to express the regret with which both my master and i have heard of miss bygraves illness is there no improvement  no maam replied the captain as briefly as possible my niece is no better  i have had some experience mr bygrave in nursing if i could be of any use  thank you mrs lecount there is no necessity for our taking advantage of your kindness  this plain answer was followed by a moments silence the housekeeper felt some little perplexity what had become of mr bygraves elaborate courtesy and mr bygraves many words did he want to offend her if he did mrs lecount then and there determined that he should not gain his object  may i inquire the nature of the illness she persisted it is not connected i hope with our excursion to dunwich  i regret to say maam replied the captain it began with that neuralgic attack in the carriage  so so thought mrs lecount he doesnt even try to make me think the illness a real one he throws off the mask at startingis it a nervous illness sir she added aloud  the captain answered by a solemn affirmative inclination of the head  then you have two nervous sufferers in the house mr bygrave  yes maamtwo my wife and my niece  that is rather a strange coincidence of misfortunes  it is maam very strange  in spite of mrs lecounts resolution not to be offended captain wragges exasperating insensibility to every stroke she aimed at him began to ruffle her she was conscious of some little difficulty in securing her selfpossession before she could say anything more  is there no immediate hope she resumed of miss bygrave being able to leave her room  none whatever maam  you are satisfied i suppose with the medical attendance  i have no medical attendance said the captain composedly i watch the case myself  the gathering venom in mrs lecount swelled up at that reply and overflowed at her lips  your smattering of science sir she said with a malicious smile includes i presume a smattering of medicine as well  it does maam answered the captain without the slightest disturbance of face or manner i know as much of one as i do of the other  the tone in which he spoke those words left mrs lecount but one dignified alternative she rose to terminate the interview the temptation of the moment proved too much for her and she could not resist casting the shadow of a threat over captain wragge at parting  i defer thanking you sir for the manner in which you have received me she said until i can pay my debt of obligation to some purpose in the meantime i am glad to infer from the absence of a medical attendant in the house that miss bygraves illness is much less serious than i had supposed it to be when i came here  i never contradict a lady maam rejoined the incorrigible captain if it is your pleasure when we next meet to think my niece quite well i shall bow resignedly to the expression of your opinion with those words he followed the housekeeper into the passage and politely opened the door for her i mark the trick maam he said to himself as he closed it again the trumpcard in your hand is a sight of my niece and ill take care you dont play it  he returned to the parlor and composedly awaited the next event which was likely to happena visit from mrs lecounts master in less than an hour results justified captain wragges anticipations and noel vanstone walked in  my dear sir cried the captain cordially seizing his visitors reluctant hand i know what you have come for mrs lecount has told you of her visit here and has no doubt declared that my nieces illness is a mere subterfuge you feel surprisedyou feel hurtyou suspect me of trifling with your kind sympathiesin short you require an explanation that explanation you shall have take a seat mr vanstone i am about to throw myself on your sense and judgment as a man of the world i acknowledge that we are in a false position sir and i tell you plainly at the outsetyour housekeeper is the cause of it  for once in his life noel vanstone opened his eyes lecount he exclaimed in the utmost bewilderment  the same sir replied captain wragge i am afraid i offended mrs lecount when she came here this morning by a want of cordiality in my manner i am a plain man and i cant assume what i dont feel far be it from me to breathe a word against your housekeepers character she is no doubt a most excellent and trustworthy woman but she has one serious failing common to persons at her time of life who occupy her situationshe is jealous of her influence over her master although you may not have observed it  i beg your pardon interposed noel vanstone my observation is remarkably quick nothing escapes me  in that case sir resumed the captain you cannot fail to have noticed that mrs lecount has allowed her jealousy to affect her conduct toward my niece  noel vanstone thought of the domestic passage at arms between mrs lecount and himself when his guests of the evening had left sea view and failed to see his way to any direct reply he expressed the utmost surprise and distresshe thought lecount had done her best to be agreeable on the drive to dunwichhe hoped and trusted there was some unfortunate mistake  do you mean to say sir pursued the captain severely that you have not noticed the circumstance yourself as a man of honor and a man of observation you cant tell me that your housekeepers superficial civility has not hidden your housekeepers real feeling my niece has seen it and so have you and so have i my niece mr vanstone is a sensitive highspirited girl and she has positively declined to cultivate mrs lecounts society for the future dont misunderstand me to my niece as well as to myself the attraction of your society mr vanstone remains the same miss bygrave simply declines to be an apple of discord if you will permit the classical allusion cast into your household i think she is right so far and i frankly confess that i have exaggerated a nervous indisposition from which she is really suffering into a serious illnesspurely and entirely to prevent these two ladies for the present from meeting every day on the parade and from carrying unpleasant impressions of each other into your domestic establishment and mine  i allow nothing unpleasant in my establishment remarked noel vanstone im masteryou must have noticed that already mr bygraveim master  no doubt of it my dear sir but to live morning noon and night in the perpetual exercise of your authority is more like the life of a governor of a prison than the life of a master of a household the wear and tearconsider the wear and tear  it strikes you in that light does it said noel vanstone soothed by captain wragges ready recognition of his authority i dont know that youre not right but i must take some steps directly i wont be made ridiculousill send lecount away altogether sooner than be made ridiculous his color rose and he folded his little arms fiercely captain wragges artfully irritating explanation had awakened that dormant suspicion of his housekeepers influence over him which habitually lay hidden in his mind and which mrs lecount was now not present to charm back to repose as usual what must miss bygrave think of me he exclaimed with a sudden outburst of vexation ill send lecount away damme ill send lecount away on the spot  no no no said the captain whose interest it was to avoid driving mrs lecount to any desperate extremities why take strong measures when mild measures will do mrs lecount is an old servant mrs lecount is attached and useful she has this little drawback of jealousyjealousy of her domestic position with her bachelor master she sees you paying courteous attention to a handsome young lady she sees that young lady properly sensible of your politeness and poor soul she loses her temper what is the obvious remedy humor hermake a manly concession to the weaker sex if mrs lecount is with you the next time we meet on the parade walk the other way if mrs lecount is not with you give us the pleasure of your company by all means in short my dear sir try the suaviter in modo as we classical men say before you commit yourself to the fortiter in re  there was one excellent reason why noel vanstone should take captain wragges conciliatory advice an open rupture with mrs lecounteven if he could have summoned the courage to face itwould imply the recognition of her claims to a provision in acknowledgment of the services she had rendered to his father and to himself his sordid nature quailed within him at the bare prospect of expressing the emotion of gratitude in a pecuniary form and after first consulting appearances by a show of hesitation he consented to adopt the captains suggestion and to humor mrs lecount  but i must be considered in this matter proceeded noel vanstone my concession to lecounts weakness must not be misunderstood miss bygrave must not be allowed to suppose i am afraid of my housekeeper  the captain declared that no such idea ever had entered or ever could enter miss bygraves mind noel vanstone returned to the subject nevertheless again and again with his customary pertinacity would it be indiscreet if he asked leave to set himself right personally with miss bygrave was there any hope that he might have the happiness of seeing her on that day or if not on the next day or if not on the day after captain wragge answered cautiously he felt the importance of not rousing noel vanstones distrust by too great an alacrity in complying with his wishes  an interview today my dear sir is out of the question he said she is not well enough she wants repose tomorrow i propose taking her out before the heat of the day beginsnot merely to avoid embarrassment after what has happened with mrs lecount but because the morning air and the morning quiet are essential in these nervous cases we are early people herewe shall start at seven oclock if you are early too and if you would like to join us i need hardly say that we can feel no objection to your company on our morning walk the hour i am aware is an unusual onebut later in the day my niece may be resting on the sofa and may not be able to see visitors  having made this proposal purely for the purpose of enabling noel vanstone to escape to north shingles at an hour in the morning when his housekeeper would be probably in bed captain wragge left him to take the hint if he could as indirectly as it had been given he proved sharp enough the case being one in which his own interests were concerned to close with the proposal on the spot politely declaring that he was always an early man when the morning presented any special attraction to him he accepted the appointment for seven oclock and rose soon afterward to take his leave  one word at parting said captain wragge this conversation is entirely between ourselves mrs lecount must know nothing of the impression she has produced on my niece i have only mentioned it to you to account for my apparently churlish conduct and to satisfy your own mind in confidence mr vanstonestrictly in confidence goodmorning  with these parting words the captain bowed his visitor out unless some unexpected disaster occurred he now saw his way safely to the end of the enterprise he had gained two important steps in advance that morning he had sown the seeds of variance between the housekeeper and her master and he had given noel vanstone a common interest with magdalen and himself in keeping a secret from mrs lecount we have caught our man thought captain wragge cheerfully rubbing his handswe have caught our man at last  on leaving north shingles noel vanstone walked straight home fully restored to his place in his own estimation and sternly determined to carry matters with a high hand if he found himself in collision with mrs lecount  the housekeeper received her master at the door with her mildest manner and her gentlest smile she addressed him with downcast eyes she opposed to his contemplated assertion of independence a barrier of impenetrable respect  may i venture to ask sir she began if your visit to north shingles has led you to form the same conclusion as mine on the subject of miss bygraves illness  certainly not lecount i consider your conclusion to have been both hasty and prejudiced  i am sorry to hear it sir i felt hurt by mr bygraves rude reception of me but i was not aware that my judgment was prejudiced by it perhaps he received you sir with a warmer welcome  he received me like a gentlemanthat is all i think it necessary to say lecounthe received me like a gentleman  this answer satisfied mrs lecount on the one doubtful point that had perplexed her whatever mr bygraves sudden coolness toward herself might mean his polite reception of her master implied that the risk of detection had not daunted him and that the plot was still in full progress the housekeepers eyes brightened she had expressly calculated on this result after a moments thinking she addressed her master with another question you will probably visit mr bygrave again sir  of course i shall visit himif i please  and perhaps see miss bygrave if she gets better  why not i should be glad to know why not is it necessary to ask your leave first lecount  by no means sir as you have often said and as i have often agreed with you you are master it may surprise you to hear it mr noel but i have a private reason for wishing that you should see miss bygrave again  mr noel started a little and looked at his housekeeper with some curiosity  i have a strange fancy of my own sir about that young lady proceeded mrs lecount if you will excuse my fancy and indulge it you will do me a favor for which i shall be very grateful  a fancy repeated her master in growing surprise what fancy  only this sir said mrs lecount  she took from one of the neat little pockets of her apron a morsel of notepaper carefully folded into the smallest possible compass and respectfully placed it in noel vanstones hands  if you are willing to oblige an old and faithful servant mr noel she said in a very quiet and very impressive manner you will kindly put that morsel of paper into your waistcoat pocket you will open and read it for the first time when you are next in miss bygraves company and you will say nothing of what has now passed between us to any living creature from this time to that i promise to explain my strange request sir when you have done what i ask and when your next interview with miss bygrave has come to an end  she courtesied with her best grace and quietly left the room  noel vanstone looked from the folded paper to the door and from the door back to the folded paper in unutterable astonishment a mystery in his own house under his own nose what did it mean  it meant that mrs lecount had not wasted her time that morning while the captain was casting the net over his visitor at north shingles the housekeeper was steadily mining the ground under his feet the folded paper contained nothing less than a carefully written extract from the personal description of magdalen in miss garths letter with a daring ingenuity which even captain wragge might have envied mrs lecount had found her instrument for exposing the conspiracy in the unsuspecting person of the victim himself    chapter vii  late that evening when magdalen and mrs wragge came back from their walk in the dark the captain stopped magdalen on her way upstairs to inform her of the proceedings of the day he added the expression of his opinion that the time had come for bringing noel vanstone with the least possible delay to the point of making a proposal she merely answered that she understood him and that she would do what was required of her captain wragge requested her in that case to oblige him by joining a walking excursion in mr noel vanstones company at seven oclock the next morning i will be ready she replied is there anything more there was nothing more magdalen bade him goodnight and returned to her own room  she had shown the same disinclination to remain any longer than was necessary in the captains company throughout the three days of her seclusion in the house  during all that time instead of appearing to weary of mrs wragges society she had patiently almost eagerly associated herself with her companions one absorbing pursuit she who had often chafed and fretted in past days under the monotony of her life in the freedom of comberaven now accepted without a murmur the monotony of her life at mrs wragges worktable she who had hated the sight of her needle and thread in old timeswho had never yet worn an article of dress of her own makingnow toiled as anxiously over the making of mrs wragges gown and bore as patiently with mrs wragges blunders as if the sole object of her existence had been the successful completion of that one dress anything was welcome to herthe trivial difficulties of fitting a gown the small ceaseless chatter of the poor halfwitted creature who was so proud of her assistance and so happy in her companyanything was welcome that shut her out from the coming future from the destiny to which she stood selfcondemned that sorelywounded nature was soothed by such a trifle now as the grasp of her companions rough and friendly handthat desolate heart was cheered when night parted them by mrs wragges kiss  the captains isolated position in the house produced no depressing effect on the captains easy and equal spirits instead of resenting magdalens systematic avoidance of his society he looked to results and highly approved of it the more she neglected him for his wife the more directly useful she became in the character of mrs wragges selfappointed guardian he had more than once seriously contemplated revoking the concession which had been extorted from him and removing his wife at his own sole responsibility out of harms way and he had only abandoned the idea on discovering that magdalens resolution to keep mrs wragge in her own company was really serious while the two were together his main anxiety was set at rest they kept their door locked by his own desire while he was out of the house and whatever mrs wragge might do magdalen was to be trusted not to open it until he came back that night captain wragge enjoyed his cigar with a mind at ease and sipped his brandyandwater in happy ignorance of the pitfall which mrs lecount had prepared for him in the morning  punctually at seven oclock noel vanstone made his appearance the moment he entered the room captain wragge detected a change in his visitors look and manner something wrong thought the captain we have not done with mrs lecount yet  how is miss bygrave this morning asked noel vanstone well enough i hope for our early walk his halfclosed eyes weak and watery with the morning light and the morning air looked about the room furtively and he shifted his place in a restless manner from one chair to another as he made those polite inquiries  my niece is bettershe is dressing for the walk replied the captain steadily observing his restless little friend while he spoke mr vanstone he added on a sudden i am a plain englishmanexcuse my blunt way of speaking my mind you dont meet me this morning as cordially as you met me yesterday there is something unsettled in your face i distrust that housekeeper of yours sir has she been presuming on your forbearance has she been trying to poison your mind against me or my niece  if noel vanstone had obeyed mrs lecounts injunctions and had kept her little morsel of notepaper folded in his pocket until the time came to use it captain wragges designedly blunt appeal might not have found him unprepared with an answer but curiosity had got the better of him he had opened the note at night and again in the morning it had seriously perplexed and startled him and it had left his mind far too disturbed to allow him the possession of his ordinary resources he hesitated and his answer when he succeeded in making it began with a prevarication  captain wragge stopped him before he had got beyond his first sentence  pardon me sir said the captain in his loftiest manner if you have secrets to keep you have only to say so and i have done i intrude on no mans secrets at the same time mr vanstone you must allow me to recall to your memory that i met you yesterday without any reserves on my side i admitted you to my frankest and fullest confidence sirand highly as i prize the advantages of your society i cant consent to cultivate your friendship on any other than equal terms he threw open his respectable frockcoat and surveyed his visitor with a manly and virtuous severity  i mean no offense cried noel vanstone piteously why do you interrupt me mr bygrave why dont you let me explain i mean no offense  no offense is taken sir said the captain you have a perfect right to the exercise of your own discretion i am not offendedi only claim for myself the same privilege which i accord to you he rose with great dignity and rang the bell tell miss bygrave he said to the servant that our walk this morning is put off until another opportunity and that i wont trouble her to come downstairs  this strong proceeding had the desired effect noel vanstone vehemently pleaded for a moments private conversation before the message was delivered captain wragges severity partially relaxed he sent the servant downstairs again and resuming his chair waited confidently for results in calculating the facilities for practicing on his visitors weakness he had one great superiority over mrs lecount his judgment was not warped by latent female jealousies and he avoided the error into which the housekeeper had fallen selfdeludedthe error of underrating the impression on noel vanstone that magdalen had produced one of the forces in this world which no middleaged woman is capable of estimating at its full value when it acts against her is the force of beauty in a woman younger than herself  you are so hasty mr bygraveyou wont give me timeyou wont wait and hear what i have to say cried noel vanstone piteously when the servant had closed the parlor door  my family failing sirthe blood of the bygraves accept my excuses we are alone as you wished pray proceed  placed between the alternatives of losing magdalens society or betraying mrs lecount unenlightened by any suspicion of the housekeepers ultimate object cowed by the immovable scrutiny of captain wragges inquiring eye noel vanstone was not long in making his choice he confusedly described his singular interview of the previous evening with mrs lecount and taking the folded paper from his pocket placed it in the captains hand  a suspicion of the truth dawned on captain wragges mind the moment he saw the mysterious note he withdrew to the window before he opened it the first lines that attracted his attention were these oblige me mr noel by comparing the young lady who is now in your company with the personal description which follows these lines and which has been communicated to me by a friend you shall know the name of the person describedwhich i have left a blankas soon as the evidence of your own eyes has forced you to believe what you would refuse to credit on the unsupported testimony of virginie lecount  that was enough for the captain before he had read a word of the description itself he knew what mrs lecount had done and felt with a profound sense of humiliation that his female enemy had taken him by surprise  there was no time to think the whole enterprise was threatened with irrevocable overthrow the one resource in captain wragges present situation was to act instantly on the first impulse of his own audacity line by line he read on and still the ready inventiveness which had never deserted him yet failed to answer the call made on it now he came to the closing sentenceto the last words which mentioned the two little moles on magdalens neck at that crowning point of the description an idea crossed his mind his partycolored eyes twinkled his curly lips twisted up at the corners wragge was himself again he wheeled round suddenly from the window and looked noel vanstone straight in the face with a grimlyquiet suggestiveness of something serious to come  pray sir do you happen to know anything of mrs lecounts family he inquired  a respectable family said noel vanstonethats all i know why do you ask  i am not usually a betting man pursued captain wragge but on this occasion i will lay you any wager you like there is madness in your housekeepers family  madness repeated noel vanstone amazedly  madness reiterated the captain sternly tapping the note with his forefinger i see the cunning of insanity the suspicion of insanity the feline treachery of insanity in every line of this deplorable document there is a far more alarming reason sir than i had supposed for mrs lecounts behavior to my niece it is clear to me that miss bygrave resembles some other lady who has seriously offended your housekeeperwho has been formerly connected perhaps with an outbreak of insanity in your housekeeperand who is now evidently confused with my niece in your housekeepers wandering mind that is my conviction mr vanstone i may be right or i may be wrong all i say is thisneither you nor any man can assign a sane motive for the production of that incomprehensible document and for the use which you are requested to make of it  i dont think lecounts mad said noel vanstone with a very blank look and a very discomposed manner it couldnt have escaped me with my habits of observation it couldnt possibly have escaped me if lecount had been mad  very good my dear sir in my opinion she is the subject of an insane delusion in your opinion she is in possession of her senses and has some mysterious motive which neither you nor i can fathom either way there can be no harm in putting mrs lecounts description to the test not only as a matter of curiosity but for our own private satisfaction on both sides it is of course impossible to tell my niece that she is to be made the subject of such a preposterous experiment as that note of yours suggests but you can use your own eyes mr vanstone you can keep your own counsel andmad or notyou can at least tell your housekeeper on the testimony of your own senses that she is wrong let me look at the description again the greater part of it is not worth two straws for any purpose of identification hundreds of young ladies have tall figures fair complexions light brown hair and light gray eyes you will say on the other hand hundreds of young ladies have not got two little moles close together on the left side of the neck quite true the moles supply us with what we scientific men call a crucial test when my niece comes downstairs sir you have my full permission to take the liberty of looking at her neck  noel vanstone expressed his high approval of the crucial test by smirking and simpering for the first time that morning  of looking at her neck repeated the captain returning the note to his visitor and then making for the door i will go upstairs myself mr vanstone he continued and inspect miss bygraves walkingdress if she has innocently placed any obstacles in your way if her hair is a little too low or her frill is a little too high i will exert my authority on the first harmless pretext i can think of to have those obstacles removed all i ask is that you will choose your opportunity discreetly and that you will not allow my niece to suppose that her neck is the object of a gentlemans inspection  the moment he was out of the parlor captain wragge ascended the stairs at the top of his speed and knocked at magdalens door she opened it to him in her walkingdress obedient to the signal agreed on between them which summoned her downstairs  what have you done with your paints and powders asked the captain without wasting a word in preliminary explanations they were not in the box of costumes which i sold for you at birmingham where are they  i have got them here replied magdalen what can you possibly mean by wanting them now  bring them instantly into my dressingroomthe whole collection brushes palette and everything dont waste time in asking questions ill tell you what has happened as we go on every moment is precious to us follow me instantly  his face plainly showed that there was a serious reason for his strange proposal magdalen secured her collection of cosmetics and followed him into the dressingroom he locked the door placed her on a chair close to the light and then told her what had happened  we are on the brink of detection proceeded the captain carefully mixing his colors with liquid glue and with a strong drier added from a bottle in his own possession there is only one chance for us lift up your hair from the left side of your necki have told mr noel vanstone to take a private opportunity of looking at you and i am going to give the lie direct to that shedevil lecount by painting out your moles  they cant be painted out said magdalen no color will stop on them  my color will remarked captain wragge i have tried a variety of professions in my timethe profession of painting among the rest did you ever hear of such a thing as a black eye i lived some months once in the neighborhood of drury lane entirely on black eyes my fleshcolor stood on bruises of all sorts shades and sizes and it will stand i promise you on your moles  with this assurance the captain dipped his brush into a little lump of opaque color which he had mixed in a saucer and which he had graduated as nearly as the materials would permit to the color of magdalens skin after first passing a cambric handkerchief with some white powder on it over the part of her neck on which he designed to operate he placed two layers of color on the moles with the tip of the brush the process was performed in a few moments and the moles as if by magic disappeared from view nothing but the closest inspection could have discovered the artifice by which they had been concealed at the distance of two or three feet only it was perfectly invisible  wait here five minutes said captain wragge to let the paint dryand then join us in the parlor mrs lecount herself would be puzzled if she looked at you now  stop said magdalen there is one thing you have not told me yet how did mrs lecount get the description which you read downstairs whatever else she has seen of me she has not seen the mark on my neckit is too far back and too high up my hair hides it  who knows of the mark asked captain wragge  she turned deadly pale under the anguish of a sudden recollection of frank  my sister knows it s he said faintly  mrs lecount may have written to your sister suggested the captain  do you think my sister would tell a stranger what no stranger has a right to know never never  is there nobody else who could tell mrs lecount the mark was mentioned in the handbills at york who put it there  not norah perhaps mr pendril perhaps miss garth  then mrs lecount has written to mr pendril or miss garthmore likely to miss garth the governess would be easier to deal with than the lawyer  what can she have said to miss garth  captain wragge considered a little  i cant say what mrs lecount may have written he said but i can tell you what i should have written in mrs lecounts place i should have frightened miss garth by false reports about you to begin with and then i should have asked for personal particulars to help a benevolent stranger in restoring you to your friends the angry glitter flashed up instantly in magdalens eyes  what you would have done is what mrs lecount has done she said indignantly neither lawyer nor governess shall dispute my right to my own will and my own way if miss garth thinks she can control my actions by corresponding with mrs lecount i will show miss garth she is mistaken it is high time captain wragge to have done with these wretched risks of discovery we will take the short way to the end we have in view sooner than mrs lecount or miss garth think for how long can you give me to wring an offer of marriage out of that creature downstairs  i dare not give you long replied captain wragge now your friends know where you are they may come down on us at a days notice could you manage it in a week  ill manage it in half the time she said with a hard defiant laugh leave us together this morning as you left us at dunwich and take mrs wragge with you as an excuse for parting company is the paint dry yet go downstairs and tell him i am coming directly  so for the second time miss garths wellmeant efforts defeated their own end so the fatal force of circumstance turned the hand that would fain have held magdalen back into the hand that drove her on  the captain returned to his visitor in the parlor after first stopping on his way to issue his orders for the walking excursion to mrs wragge  i am shocked to have kept you waiting he said sitting down again confidentially by noel vanstones side my only excuse is that my niece had accidentally dressed her hair so as to defeat our object i have been persuading her to alter it and young ladies are apt to be a little obstinate on questions relating to their toilet give her a chair on that side of you when she comes in and take your look at her neck comfortably before we start for our walk  magdalen entered the room as he said those words and after the first greetings were exchanged took the chair presented to her with the most unsuspicious readiness noel vanstone applied the crucial test on the spot with the highest appreciation of the fair material which was the subject of experiment not the vestige of a mole was visible on any part of the smooth white surface of miss bygraves neck it mutely answered the blinking inquiry of noel vanstones halfclosed eyes by the flattest practical contradiction of mrs lecount that one central incident in the events of the morning was of all the incidents that had hitherto occurred the most important in its results that one discovery shook the housekeepers hold on her master as nothing had shaken it yet  in a few minutes mrs wragge made her appearance and excited as much surprise in noel vanstones mind as he was capable of feeling while absorbed in the enjoyment of magdalens society the walkingparty left the house at once directing their steps northward so as not to pass the windows of seaview cottage to mrs wragges unutterable astonishment her husband for the first time in the course of their married life politely offered her his arm and led her on in advance of the young people as if the privilege of walking alone with her presented some special attraction to him step out whispered the captain fiercely leave your niece and mr vanstone alone if i catch you looking back at them ill put the oriental cashmere robe on the top of the kitchen fire turn your toes out and keep stepconfound you keep step mrs wragge kept step to the best of her limited ability her sturdy knees trembled under her she firmly believed the captain was intoxicated  the walk lasted for rather more than an hour before nine oclock they were all back again at north shingles the ladies went at once into the house noel vanstone remained with captain wragge in the garden well said the captain what do you think now of mrs lecount  damn lecount replied noel vanstone in great agitation im half inclined to agree with you im half inclined to think my infernal housekeeper is mad  he spoke fretfully and unwillingly as if the merest allusion to mrs lecount was distasteful to him his color came and went his manner was absent and undecided he fidgeted restlessly about the garden walk it would have been plain to a far less acute observation than captain wragges that magdalen had met his advances by an unexpected grace and readiness of encouragement which had entirely overthrown his selfcontrol  i never enjoyed a walk so much in my life he exclaimed with a sudden outburst of enthusiasm i hope miss bygrave feels all the better for it do you go out at the same time tomorrow morning may i join you again  by all means mr vanstone said the captain cordially excuse me for returning to the subjectbut what do you propose saying to mrs lecount  i dont know lecount is a perfect nuisance what would you do mr bygrave if you were in my place  allow me to ask a question my dear sir before i tell you what is your breakfasthour  halfpast nine  is mrs lecount an early riser  no lecount is lazy in the morning i hate lazy women if you were in my place what should you say to her  i should say nothing replied captain wragge i should return at once by the back way i should let mrs lecount see me in the front garden as if i was taking a turn before breakfast and i should leave her to suppose that i was only just out of my room if she asks you whether you mean to come here today say no secure a quiet life until circumstances force you to give her an answer then tell the plain truthsay that mr bygraves niece and mrs lecounts description are at variance with each other in the most important particular and beg that the subject may not be mentioned again there is my advice what do you think of it  if noel vanstone could have looked into his counselors mind he might have thought the captains advice excellently adapted to serve the captains interests as long as mrs lecount could be kept in ignorance of her masters visits to north shingles so long she would wait until the opportunity came for trying her experiment and so long she might be trusted not to endanger the conspiracy by any further proceedings necessarily incapable of viewing captain wragges advice under this aspect noel vanstone simply looked at it as offering him a temporary means of escape from an explanation with his housekeeper he eagerly declared that the course of action suggested to him should be followed to the letter and returned to sea view without further delay  on this occasion captain wragges anticipations were in no respect falsified by mrs lecounts conduct she had no suspicion of her masters visit to north shingles she had made up her mind if necessary to wait patiently for his interview with miss bygrave until the end of the week and she did not embarrass him by any unexpected questions when he announced his intention of holding no personal communication with the bygraves on that day all she said was dont you feel well enough mr noel or dont you feel inclined he answered shortly i dont feel well enough and there the conversation ended  the next day the proceedings of the previous morning were exactly repeated this time noel vanstone went home rapturously with a keepsake in his breastpocket he had taken tender possession of one of miss bygraves gloves at intervals during the day whenever he was alone he took out the glove and kissed it with a devotion which was almost passionate in its fervor the miserable little creature luxuriated in his moments of stolen happiness with a speechless and stealthy delight which was a new sensation to him the few young girls whom he had met with in his fathers narrow circle at zurich had felt a mischievous pleasure in treating him like a quaint little plaything the strongest impression he could make on their hearts was an impression in which their lapdogs might have rivaled him the deepest interest he could create in them was the interest they might have felt in a new trinket or a new dress the only women who had hitherto invited his admiration and taken his compliments seriously had been women whose charms were on the wane and whose chances of marriage were fast failing them for the first time in his life he had now passed hours of happiness in the society of a beautiful girl who had left him to think of her afterward without a single humiliating remembrance to lower him in his own esteem  anxiously as he tried to hide it the change produced in his look and manner by the new feeling awakened in him was not a change which could be concealed from mrs lecount on the second day she pointedly asked him whether he had not made an arrangement to call on the bygraves he denied it as before perhaps you are going tomorrow mr noel persisted the housekeeper he was at the end of his resources he was impatient to be rid of her inquiries he trusted to his friend at north shingles to help him and this time he answered yes if you see the young lady proceeded mrs lecount dont forget that note of mine sir which you have in your waistcoatpocket no more was said on either side but by that nights post the housekeeper wrote to miss garth the letter merely acknowledged with thanks the receipt of miss garths communication and informed her that in a few days mrs lecount hoped to be in a position to write again and summon mr pendril to aldborough  late in the evening when the parlor at north shingles began to get dark and when the captain rang the bell for candles as usual he was surprised by hearing magdalens voice in the passage telling the servant to take the lights downstairs again she knocked at the door immediately afterward and glided into the obscurity of the room like a ghost  i have a question to ask you about your plans for tomorrow she said my eyes are very weak this evening and i hope you will not object to dispense with the candles for a few minutes  she spoke in low stifled tones and felt her way noiselessly to a chair far removed from the captain in the darkest part of the room sitting near the window he could just discern the dim outline of her dress he could just hear the faint accents of her voice for the last two days he had seen nothing of her except during their morning walk on that afternoon he had found his wife crying in the little backroom downstairs she could only tell him that magdalen had frightened herthat magdalen was going the way again which she had gone when the letter came from china in the terrible past time at vauxhall walk  i was sorry to her that you were ill today from mrs wragge said the captain unconsciously dropping his voice almost to a whisper as he spoke  it doesnt matter she answered quietly out of the darkness i am strong enough to suffer and live other girls in my place would have been happierthey would have suffered and died it doesnt matter it will be all the same a hundred years hence is he coming again tomorrow morning at seven oclock  he is coming if you feel no objection to it  i have no objection to make i have done with objecting but i should like to have the time altered i dont look my best in the early morningi have bad nights and i rise haggard and worn write him a note this evening and tell him to come at twelve oclock  twelve is rather late under the circumstances for you to be seen out walking  i have no intention of walking let him be shown into the parlor  her voice died away in silence before she ended the sentence  yes said captain wragge  and leave me alone in the parlor to receive him  i understand said the captain an admirable idea ill be out of the way in the diningroom while he is here and you can come and tell me about it when he has gone  there was another moment of silence  is there no way but telling you she asked suddenly i can control myself while he is with me but i cant answer for what i may say or do afterward is there no other way  plenty of ways said the captain here is the first that occurs to me leave the blind down over the window of your room upstairs before he comes i will go out on the beach and wait there within sight of the house when i see him come out again i will look at the window if he has said nothing leave the blind down if he has made you an offer draw the blind up the signal is simplicity itself we cant misunderstand each other look your best tomorrow make sure of him my dear girlmake sure of him if you possibly can  he had spoken loud enough to feel certain that she had heard him but no answering word came from her the dead silence was only disturbed by the rustling of her dress which told him she had risen from her chair her shadowy presence crossed the room again the door shut softly she was gone he rang the bell hurriedly for the lights the servant found him standing close at the window looking less selfpossessed than usual he told her he felt a little poorly and sent her to the cupboard for the brandy  at a few minutes before twelve the next day captain wragge withdrew to his post of observation concealing himself behind a fishingboat drawn up on the beach punctually as the hour struck he saw noel vanstone approach north shingles and open the garden gate when the house door had closed on the visitor captain wragge settled himself comfortably against the side of the boat and lit his cigar  he smoked for half an hourfor ten minutes over the halfhour by his watch he finished the cigar down to the last morsel of it that he could hold in his lips just as he had thrown away the end the door opened again and noel vanstone came out  the captain looked up instantly at magdalens window in the absorbing excitement of the moment he counted the seconds she might get from the parlor to her own room in less than a minute he counted to thirty and nothing happened he counted to fifty and nothing happened he gave up counting and left the boat impatiently to return to the house  as he took his first step forward he saw the signal  the blind was drawn up  cautiously ascending the eminence of the beach captain wragge looked toward seaview cottage before he showed himself on the parade noel vanstone had reached home again he was just entering his own door  if all your money was offered me to stand in your shoes said the captain looking after himrich as you are i wouldnt take it    chapter viii  on returning to the house captain wragge received a significant message from the servant mr noel vanstone would call again at two oclock that afternoon when he hoped to have the pleasure of finding mr bygrave at home  the captains first inquiry after hearing this message referred to magdalen where was miss bygrave in her own room where was mrs bygrave in the back parlor captain wragge turned his steps at once in the latter direction and found his wife for the second time in tears she had been sent out of magdalens room for the whole day and she was at her wits end to know what she had done to deserve it shortening her lamentations without ceremony her husband sent her upstairs on t he spot with instructions to knock at the door and to inquire whether magdalen could give five minutes attention to a question of importance which must be settled before two oclock  the answer returned was in the negative magdalen requested that the subject on which she was asked to decide might be mentioned to her in writing she engaged to reply in the same way on the understanding that mrs wragge and not the servant should be employed to deliver the note and to take back the answer  captain wragge forthwith opened his papercase and wrote these lines accept my warmest congratulations on the result of your interview with mr n v he is coming again at two oclockno doubt to make his proposals in due form the question to decide is whether i shall press him or not on the subject of settlements the considerations for your own mind are two in number first whether the said pressure without at all underrating your influence over him may not squeeze for a long time before it squeezes money out of mr n v secondly whether we are altogether justifiedconsidering our present position toward a certain sharp practitioner in petticoatsin running the risk of delay consider these points and let me have your decision as soon as convenient  the answer returned to this note was written in crooked blotted characters strangely unlike magdalens usually firm and clear handwriting it only contained these words give yourself no trouble about settlements leave the use to which he is to put his money for the future in my hands  did you see her asked the captain when his wife had delivered the answer  i tried said mrs wragge with a fresh burst of tearsbut she only opened the door far enough to put out her hand i took and gave it a little squeezeand oh poor soul it felt so cold in mine  when mrs lecounts master made his appearance at two oclock he stood alarmingly in need of an anodyne application from mrs lecounts green fan the agitation of making his avowal to magdalen the terror of finding himself discovered by the housekeeper the tormenting suspicion of the hard pecuniary conditions which magdalens relative and guardian might impose on himall these emotions stirring in conflict together had overpowered his feeblyworking heart with a trial that strained it sorely he gasped for breath as he sat down in the parlor at north shingles and that ominous bluish pallor which always overspread his face in moments of agitation now made its warning appearance again captain wragge seized the brandy bottle in genuine alarm and forced his visitor to drink a wineglassful of the spirit before a word was said between them on either side  restored by the stimulant and encouraged by the readiness with which the captain anticipated everything that he had to say noel vanstone contrived to state the serious object of his visit in tolerably plain terms all the conventional preliminaries proper to the occasion were easily disposed of the suitors family was respectable his position in life was undeniably satisfactory his attachment though hasty was evidently disinterested and sincere all that captain wragge had to do was to refer to these various considerations with a happy choice of language in a voice that trembled with manly emotion and this he did to perfection for the first halfhour of the interview no allusion whatever was made to the delicate and dangerous part of the subject the captain waited until he had composed his visitor and when that result was achieved came smoothly to the point in these terms  there is one little difficulty mr vanstone which i think we have both overlooked your housekeepers recent conduct inclines me to fear that she will view the approaching change in your life with anything but a friendly eye probably you have not thought it necessary yet to inform her of the new tie which you propose to form  noel vanstone turned pale at the bare idea of explaining himself to mrs lecount  i cant tell what im to do he said glancing aside nervously at the window as if he expected to see the housekeeper peeping in i hate all awkward positions and this is the most unpleasant position i ever was placed in you dont know what a terrible woman lecount is im not afraid of her pray dont suppose im afraid of her  at those words his fears rose in his throat and gave him the lie direct by stopping his utterance  pray dont trouble yourself to explain said captain wragge coming to the rescue this is the common story mr vanstone here is a woman who has grown old in your service and in your fathers service before you a woman who has contrived in all sorts of small underhand ways to presume systematically on her position for years and years past a woman in short whom your inconsiderate but perfectly natural kindness has allowed to claim a right of property in you  property cried noel vanstone mistaking the captain and letting the truth escape him through sheer inability to conceal his fears any longer i dont know what amount of property she wont claim shell make me pay for my father as well as for myself thousands mr bygravethousands of pounds sterling out of my pocket he clasped his hands in despair at the picture of pecuniary compulsion which his fancy had conjured uphis own golden lifeblood spouting from him in great jets of prodigality under the lancet of mrs lecount  gently mr vanstonegently the woman knows nothing so far and the money is not gone yet  no no the money is not gone as you say im only nervous about it i cant help being nervous you were saying something just now you were going to give me advice i value your advice you dont know how highly i value your advice he said those words with a conciliatory smile which was more than helpless it was absolutely servile in its dependence on his judicious friend  i was only assuring you my dear sir that i understood your position said the captain i see your difficulty as plainly as you can see it yourself tell a woman like mrs lecount that she must come off her domestic throne to make way for a young and beautiful successor armed with the authority of a wife and an unpleasant scene must be the inevitable result an unpleasant scene mr vanstone if your opinion of your housekeepers sanity is well founded something far more serious if my opinion that her intellect is unsettled happens to turn out the right one  i dont say it isnt my opinion too rejoined noel vanstone especially after what has happened today  captain wragge immediately begged to know what the event alluded to might be  noel vanstone thereupon explainedwith an infinite number of parentheses all referring to himselfthat mrs lecount had put the dreaded question relating to the little note in her masters pocket barely an hour since he had answered her inquiry as mr bygrave had advised him on hearing that the accuracy of the personal description had been fairly put to the test and had failed in the one important particular of the moles on the neck mrs lecount had considered a little and had then asked him whether he had shown her note to mr bygrave before the experiment was tried he had answered in the negative as the only safe form of reply that he could think of on the spur of the moment and the housekeeper had then addressed him in these strange and startling words you are keeping the truth from me mr noel you are trusting strangers and doubting your old servant and your old friend every time you go to mr bygraves house every time you see miss bygrave you are drawing nearer and nearer to your destruction they have got the bandage over your eyes in spite of me but i tell them and tell you before many days are over i will take it off to this extraordinary outbreakaccompanied as it was by an expression in mrs lecounts face which he had never seen there beforenoel vanstone had made no reply mr bygraves conviction that there was a lurking taint of insanity in the housekeepers blood had recurred to his memory and he had left the room at the first opportunity  captain wragge listened with the closest attention to the narrative thus presented to him but one conclusion could be drawn from itit was a plain warning to him to hasten the end  i am not surprised he said gravely to hear that you are inclining more favorably to my opinion after what you have just told me mr vanstone no sensible man could do otherwise this is becoming serious i hardly know what results may not be expected to follow the communication of your approaching change in life to mrs lecount my niece may be involved in those results she is nervous she is sensitive in the highest degree she is the innocent object of this womans unreasoning hatred and distrust you alarm me sir i am not easily thrown off my balance but i acknowledge you alarm me for the future he frowned shook his head and looked at his visitor despondently  noel vanstone began to feel uneasy the change in mr bygraves manner seemed ominous of a reconsideration of his proposals from a new and unfavorable point of view he took counsel of his inborn cowardice and his inborn cunning and proposed a solution of the difficulty discovered by himself  why should we tell lecount at all he asked what right has lecount to know cant we be married without letting her into the secret and cant somebody tell her afterward when we are both out of her reach  captain wragge received this proposal with an expression of surprise which did infinite credit to his power of control over his own countenance his foremost object throughout the interview had been to conduct it to this point or in other words to make the first idea of keeping the marriage a secret from mrs lecount emanate from noel vanstone instead of from himself no one knew better than the captain that the only responsibilities which a weak man ever accepts are responsibilities which can be perpetually pointed out to him as resting exclusively on his own shoulders  i am accustomed to set my face against clandestine proceedings of all kinds said captain wragge but there are exceptions to the strictest rules and i am bound to admit mr vanstone that your position in this matter is an exceptional position if ever there was one yet the course you have just proposedhowever unbecoming i may think it however distasteful it may be to myselfwould not only spare you a very serious embarrassment to say the least of it but would also protect you from the personal assertion of those pecuniary claims on the part of your housekeeper to which you have already adverted these are both desirable results to achieveto say nothing of the removal on my side of all apprehension of annoyance to my niece on the other hand however a marriage solemnized with such privacy as you propose must be a hasty marriage for as we are situated the longer the delay the greater will be the risk that our secret may escape our keeping i am not against hasty marriages where a mutual flame is fanned by an adequate income my own was a lovematch contracted in a hurry there are plenty of instances in the experience of every one of short courtships and speedy marriages which have turned up trumpsi beg your pardonwhich have turned out well after all but if you and my niece mr vanstone are to add one to the number of these eases the usual preliminaries of marriage among the higher classes must be hastened by some means you doubtless understand me as now referring to the subject of settlements  ill take another teaspoonful of brandy said noel vanstone holding out his glass with a trembling hand as the word settlements passed captain wragges lips  ill take a teaspoonful with you said the captain nimbly dismounting from the pedestal of his respectability and sipping his brandy with the highest relish noel vanstone after nervously following his hosts example composed himself to meet the coming ordeal with reclining head and grasping hands in the position familiarly associated to all civilized humanity with a seat in a dentists chair  the captain put down his empty glass and got up again on his pedestal  we were talking of settlements he resumed i have already mentioned mr vanstone at an early period of our conversation that my niece presents the man of her choice with no other dowry than the most inestimable of all giftsthe gift of herself this circumstance however as you are no doubt aware does not disentitle me to make the customary stipulations with her future husband according to the usual course in this matter my lawyer would see yoursconsultations would take placedelays would occurstrangers would be in possession of your intentionsand mrs lecount would sooner or later arrive at that knowledge of the truth which you are anxious to keep from her do you agree with me so far  unutterable apprehension closed noel vanstones lips he could only reply by an inclination of the head  very good said the captain now sir you may possibly have observed that i am a man of a very original turn of mind if i have not hitherto struck you in that light it may then be necessary to mention that there are some subjects on which i persist in thinking for myself the subject of marriage settlements is one of them what let me ask you does a parent or guardian in my present condition usually do after having trusted the man whom he has chosen for his soninlaw with the sacred deposit of a womans happiness he turns round on that man and declines to trust him with the infinitely inferior responsibility of providing for her pecuniary future he fetters his soninlaw with the most binding document the law can produce and employs with the husband of his own child the same precautions which he would use if he were dealing with a stranger and a rogue i call such conduct as this inconsistent and unbecoming in the last degree you will not find it my course of conduct mr vanstoneyou will not find me preaching what i dont practice if i trust you with my niece i trust you with every inferior responsibility toward her and toward me give me your hand sir tell me on your word of honor that you will provide for your wife as becomes her position and your means and the question of settlements is decided between us from this moment at once and forever having carried out magdalens instructions in this lofty tone he threw open his respectable frockcoat and sat with head erect and hand extended the model of parental feeling and the picture of human integrity  for one moment noel vanstone remained literally petrified by astonishment the next he started from his chair and wrung the hand of his magnanimous friend in a perfect transport of admiration never yet throughout his long and varied career had captain wragge felt such difficulty in keeping his countenance as he felt now contempt for the outburst of miserly gratitude of which he was the object triumph in the sense of successful conspiracy against a man who had rated the offer of his protection at five pounds regret at the lost opportunity of effecting a fine stroke of moral agriculture which his dread of involving himself in coming consequences had forced him to let slipall these varied emotions agitated the captains mind all strove together to find their way to the surface through the outlets of his face or his tongue he allowed noel vanstone to keep possession of his hand and to heap one series of shrill protestations and promises on another until he had regained his usual mastery over himself that result achieved he put the little man back in his chair and returned forthwith to the subject of mrs lecount  suppose we now revert to the difficulty which we have not conquered yet said the captain let us say that i do violence to my own habits and feelings that i allow the considerations i have already mentioned to weigh with me and that i sanction your wish to be united to my niece without the knowledge of mrs lecount allow me to inquire in that case what means you can suggest for the accomplishment of your end  i cant suggest anything replied noel vanstone helplessly would you object to suggest for me  you are making a bolder request than you think mr vanstone i never do things by halves when i am acting with my customary candor i am frank as you know already to the utmost verge of imprudence when exceptional circumstances compel me to take an opposite course there isnt a slyer fox alive than i am if at your express request i take off my honest english coat here and put on a jesuits gownif purely out of sympathy for your awkward position i consent to keep your secret for you from mrs lecounti must have no unseasonable scruples to contend with on your part if it is neck or nothing on my side sir it must be neck or nothing on yours also  neck or nothing by all means said noel vanstone brisklyon the understanding that you go first i have no scruples about keeping lecount in the dark but she is devilish cunning mr bygrave how is it to be done  you shall hear directly replied the captain before i develop my views i should like to have your opinion on an abstract question of morality what do you think my dear sir of pious frauds in general  noel vanstone looked a little embarrassed by the question  shall i put it more plainly continued captain wragge what do you say to the universallyaccepted maxim that all stratagems are fair in love and waryes or no  yes answered noel vanstone with the utmost readiness  one more question and i have done said the captain do you see any particular objection to practicing a pious fraud on mrs lecount  noel vanstones resolution began to falter a little  is lecount likely to find it out he asked cautiously  she cant possibly discover it until you are married and out of her reach  you are sure of that  quite sure  play any trick you like on lecount said noel vanstone with an air of unutterable relief i have had my suspicions lately that she is trying to domineer over me i am beginning to feel that i have borne with lecount long enough i wish i was well rid of her  you shall have your wish said captain wragge you shall be rid of her in a week or ten days  noel vanstone rose eagerly and approached the captains chair  you dont say so he exclaimed how do you mean to send her away  i mean to send her on a journey replied captain wragge  where  from your house at aldborough to her brothers bedside at zurich  noel vanstone started back at the answer and returned suddenly to his chair  how can you do that he inquired in the greatest perplexity her brother hang him is much better she had another letter from zurich to say so this morning  did you see the letter  yes she always worries about her brothershe would show it to me  who was it from and what did it say  it was from the doctorhe always writes to her i dont care two straws about her brother and i dont remember much of the letter except that it was a short one the fellow was much better and if the doctor didnt write again she might take it for granted that he was getting well that was the substance of it  did you notice where she put the letter when you gave it her back again  yes she put it in the drawer where she keeps her accountbooks  can you get at that drawer  of course i can i have got a duplicate keyi always insist on a duplicate key of the place where she keeps her account books i never allow the accountbooks to be locked up from my inspection its a rule of the house  be so good as to get that letter today mr vanstone without your housekeepers knowledge and add to the favor by letting me have it here privately for an hour or two  what do you want it for  i have some more questions to ask before i tell you have you any intimate friend at zurich whom you could trust to help you in playing a trick on mrs lecount  what sort of help do you mean asked noel vanstone  suppose said the captain you were to send a letter addressed to mrs lecount at aldborough inclosed in another letter addressed to one of your friends abroad and suppose you were to instruct that friend to help a harmless practical joke by posting mrs lecounts letter at zurich do you know any one who could be trusted to do that  i know two people who could be trusted cried noel vanstone both ladiesboth spinstersboth bitter enemies of lecounts but what is your drift mr bygrave though i am not usually wanting in penetration i dont altogether see your drift  you shall see it directly mr vanstone  with those words he rose withdrew to his desk in the corner of the room and wrote a few lines on a sheet of notepaper after first reading them carefully to himself he beckoned to noel vanstone to come and read them too  a few minutes since said the captain pointing complacently to his own composition with the feather end of his pen i had the honor of suggesting a pious fraud on mrs lecount there it is  he resigned his chair at the writingtable to his visitor noel vanstone sat down and read these lines   my dear madamsince i last wrote i deeply regret to inform you that your brother has suffered a relapse the symptoms are so serious that it is my painful duty to summon you instantly to his bedside i am making every effort to resist the renewed progress of the malady and i have not yet lost all hope of success but i cannot reconcile it to my conscience to leave you in ignorance of a serious change in my patient for the worse which may be attended by fatal results with much sympathy i remain etc etc   captain wragge waited with some anxiety for the effect which this letter might produce mean selfish and cowardly as he was even noel vanstone might feel some compunction at practicing such a deception as was here suggested on a woman who stood toward him in the position of mrs lecount she had served him faithfully however interested her motives might beshe had lived since he was a lad in the full possession of his fathers confidenceshe was living now under the protection of his own roof could be fail to remember this and remembering it could he lend his aid without hesitation to the scheme which was now proposed to him captain wragge unconsciously retained belief enough in human nature to doubt it to his surprise and it must be added to his relief also his apprehensions proved to be groundless the only emotions aroused in noel vanstones mind by a perusal of the letter were a hearty admiration of his friends idea and a vainglorious anxiety to claim the credit to himself of being the person who carried it out examples may be found every day of a fool who is no coward examples may be found occasionally of a fool who is not cunning but it may reasonably be doubted whether there is a producible instance anywhere of a fool who is not cruel  perfect cried noel vanstone clapping his hands mr bygrave you are as good as figaro in the french comedy talking of french there is one serious mistake in this clever letter of yoursit is written in the wrong language when the doctor writes to lecount he writes in french perhaps you meant me to translate it you cant manage without my help can you i write french as fluently as i write english just look at me ill translate it while i sit here in two strokes of the pen  he completed the translation almost as rapidly as captain wragge had produced the original wait a minute he cried in high critical triumph at discovering another defect in the composition of his ingenious friend the doctor always dates his letters here is no date to yours  i leave the date to you said the captain with a sardonic smile you have discovered the fault my dear sirpray correct it  noel vanstone mentally looked into the great gulf which separates the faculty that can discover a defect from the faculty that can apply a remedy and following the example of many a wiser man declined to cross over it  i couldnt think of ta king the liberty he said politely perhaps you had a motive for leaving the date out  perhaps i had replied captain wragge with his easiest goodhumor the date must depend on the time a letter takes to get to zurich i have had no experience on that pointyou must have had plenty of experience in your fathers time give me the benefit of your information and we will add the date before you leave the writingtable  noel vanstones experience was as captain wragge had anticipated perfectly competent to settle the question of time the railway resources of the continent in the year eighteen hundred and fortyseven were but scanty and a letter sent at that period from england to zurich and from zurich back again to england occupied ten days in making the double journey by post  date the letter in french five days on from tomorrow said the captain when he had got his information very good the next thing is to let me have the doctors note as soon as you can i may be obliged to practice some hours before i can copy your translation in an exact imitation of the doctors handwriting have you got any foreign notepaper let me have a few sheets and send at the same time an envelope addressed to one of those ladyfriends of yours at zurich accompanied by the necessary request to post the inclosure this is all i need trouble you to do mr vanstone dont let me seem inhospitable but the sooner you can supply me with my materials the better i shall be pleased we entirely understand each other i suppose having accepted your proposal for my nieces hand i sanction a private marriage in consideration of the circumstances on your side a little harmless stratagem is necessary to forward your views i invent the stratagem at your request and you make use of it without the least hesitation the result is that in ten days from tomorrow mrs lecount will be on her way to switzerland in fifteen days from tomorrow mrs lecount will reach zurich and discover the trick we have played her in twenty days from tomorrow mrs lecount will be back at aldborough and will find her masters weddingcards on the table and her master himself away on his honeymoon trip i put it arithmetically for the sake of putting it plain god bless you goodmorning  i suppose i may have the happiness of seeing miss bygrave tomorrow said noel vanstone turning round at the door  we must be careful replied captain wragge i dont forbid tomorrow but i make no promise beyond that permit me to remind you that we have got mrs lecount to manage for the next ten days  i wish lecount was at the bottom of the german ocean exclaimed noel vanstone fervently its all very well for you to manage heryou dont live in the house what am i to do  ill tell you tomorrow said the captain go out for your walk alone and drop in here as you dropped in today at two oclock in the meantime dont forget those things i want you to send me seal them up together in a large envelope when you have done that ask mrs lecount to walk out with you as usual and while she is upstairs putting her bonnet on send the servant across to me you understand goodmorning  an hour afterward the sealed envelope with its inclosures reached captain wragge in perfect safety the double task of exactly imitating a strange handwriting and accurately copying words written in a language with which he was but slightly acquainted presented more difficulties to be overcome than the captain had anticipated it was eleven oclock before the employment which he had undertaken was successfully completed and the letter to zurich ready for the post  before going to bed he walked out on the deserted parade to breathe the cool night air all the lights were extinguished in seaview cottage when he looked that way except the light in the housekeepers window captain wragge shook his head suspiciously he had gained experience enough by this time to distrust the wakefulness of mrs lecount    chapter ix  if captain wragge could have looked into mrs lecounts room while he stood on the parade watching the light in her window he would have seen the housekeeper sitting absorbed in meditation over a worthless little morsel of brown stuff which lay on her toilettable  however exasperating to herself the conclusion might be mrs lecount could not fail to see that she had been thus far met and baffled successfully at every point what was she to do next if she sent for mr pendril when he came to aldborough with only a few hours spared from his business at her disposal what definite course would there be for him to follow if she showed noel vanstone the original letter from which her note had been copied he would apply instantly to the writer for an explanation would expose the fabricated story by which mrs lecount had succeeded in imposing on miss garth and would in any event still declare on the evidence of his own eyes that the test by the marks on the neck had utterly failed miss vanstone the elder whose unexpected presence at aldborough might have done wonderswhose voice in the hall at north shingles even if she had been admitted no further might have reached her sisters ears and led to instant resultsmiss vanstone the elder was out of the country and was not likely to return for a month at least look as anxiously as mrs lecount might along the course which she had hitherto followed she failed to see her way through the accumulated obstacles which now barred her advance  other women in this position might have waited until circumstances altered and helped them mrs lecount boldly retraced her steps and determined to find her way to her end in a new direction resigning for the present all further attempt to prove that the false miss bygrave was the true magdalen vanstone she resolved to narrow the range of her next efforts to leave the actual question of magdalens identity untouched and to rest satisfied with convincing her master of this simple factthat the young lady who was charming him at north shingles and the disguised woman who had terrified him in vauxhall walk were one and the same person  the means of effecting this new object were to all appearance far less easy of attainment than the means of effecting the object which mrs lecount had just resigned here no help was to be expected from others no ostensibly benevolent motives could be put forward as a blindno appeal could be made to mr pendril or to miss garth here the housekeepers only chance of success depended in the first place on her being able to effect a stolen entrance into mr bygraves house and in the second place on her ability to discover whether that memorable alpaca dress from which she had secretly cut the fragment of stuff happened to form part of miss bygraves wardrobe  taking the difficulties now before her in their order as they occurred mrs lecount first resolved to devote the next few days to watching the habits of the inmates of north shingles from early in the morning to late at night and to testing the capacity of the one servant in the house to resist the temptation of a bribe assuming that results proved successful and that either by money or by stratagem she gained admission to north shingles without the knowledge of mr bygrave or his niece she turned next to the second difficulty of the twothe difficulty of obtaining access to miss bygraves wardrobe  if the servant proved corruptible all obstacles in this direction might be considered as removed beforehand but if the servant proved honest the new problem was no easy one to solve  long and careful consideration of the question led the housekeeper at last to the bold resolution of obtaining an interviewif the servant failed herwith mrs bygrave herself what was the true cause of this ladys mysterious seclusion was she a person of the strictest and the most inconvenient integrity or a person who could not be depended on to preserve a secret or a person who was as artful as mr bygrave himself and who was kept in reserve to forward the object of some new deception which was yet to come in the first two cases mrs lecount could trust in her own powers of dissimulation and in the results which they might achieve in the last case if no other end was gained it might be of vital importance to her to discover an enemy hidden in the dark in any event she determined to run the risk of the three chances in her favor on which she had reckoned at the outset of the strugglethe chance of entrapping magdalen by word of mouth the chance of entrapping her by the help of her friends and the chance of entrapping her by means of mrs bygravetwo had been tried and two had failed the third remained to be tested yet and the third might succeed  so the captains enemy plotted against him in the privacy of her own chamber while the captain watched the light in her window from the beach outside   before breakfast the next morning captain wragge posted the forged letter to zurich with his own hand he went back to north shingles with his mind not quite decided on the course to take with mrs lecount during the allimportant interval of the next ten days  greatly to his surprise his doubts on this point were abruptly decided by magdalen herself  he found her waiting for him in the room where the breakfast was laid she was walking restlessly to and fro with her head drooping on her bosom and her hair hanging disordered over her shoulders the moment she looked up on his entrance the captain felt the fear which mrs wragge had felt before himthe fear that her mind would be struck prostrate again as it had been struck once already when franks letter reached her in vauxhall walk  is he coming again today she asked pushing away from her the chair which captain wragge offered with such violence that she threw it on the floor  yes said the captain wisely answering her in the fewest words he is coming at two oclock  take me away she exclaimed tossing her hair back wildly from her face take me away before he comes i cant get over the horror of marrying him while i am in this hateful place take me somewhere where i can forget it or i shall go mad give me two days resttwo days out of sight of that horrible seatwo days out of prison in this horrible housetwo days anywhere in the wide world away from aldborough ill come back with you ill go through with it to the end only give me two days escape from that man and everything belonging to him do you hear you villain she cried seizing his arm and shaking it in a frenzy of passion i have been tortured enoughi can bear it no longer  there was but one way of quieting her and the captain instantly took it  if you will try to control yourself he said you shall leave aldborough in an hours time  she dropped his arm and leaned back heavily against the wall behind her  ill try she answered struggling for breath but looking at him less wildly you shant complain of me if i can help it she attempted confusedly to take her handkerchief from her apron pocket and failed to find it the captain took it out for her her eyes softened and she drew her breath more freely as she received the handkerchief from him you are a kinder man than i thought you were she said i am sorry i spoke so passionately to you just nowi am very very sorry the tears stole into her eyes and she offered him her hand with the native grace and gentleness of happier days be friends with me again she said pleadingly im only a girl captain wraggeim only a girl  he took her hand in silence patted it for a moment and then opened the door for her to go back to her own room again there was genuine regret in his face as he showed her that trifling attention he was a vagabond and a cheat he had lived a mean shuffling degraded life but he was human and she had found her way to the lost sympathies in him which not even the selfprofanation of a swindlers existence could wholly destroy damn the breakfast he said when the servant came in for her orders go to the inn directly and say i want a carriage and pair at the door in an hours time he went out into the passage still chafing under a sense of mental disturbance which was new to him and shouted to his wife more fiercely than everpack up what we want for a weeks absence and be ready in half an hour having issued those directions he returned to the breakfastroom and looked at the halfspread table with an impatient wonder at his disinclination to do justice to his own meal she has rubbed off the edge of my appetite he said to himself with a forced laugh ill try a cigar and a turn in the fresh air  if he had been twenty years younger those remedies might have failed him but where is the man to be found whose internal policy succumbs to revolution when that man is on the wrong side of fifty exercise and change of place gave the captain back into the possession of himself he recovered the lost sense of the flavor of his cigar and recalled his wandering attention to the question of his approaching absence from aldborough a few minutes consideration satisfied his mind that magdalens outbreak had forced him to take the course of all others which on a fair review of existing emergencies it was now most desirable to adopt  captain wragges inquiries on the evening when he and magdalen had drunk tea at sea view had certainly informed him that the housekeepers brother possessed a modest competence that his sister was his nearest living relative and that there were some unscrupulous cousins on the spot who were anxious to usurp the place in his will which properly belonged to mrs lecount here were strong motives to take the housekeeper to zurich when the false report of her brothers relapse reached england but if any idea of noel vanstones true position dawned on her in the meantime who could say whether she might not at the eleventh hour prefer asserting her large pecuniary interest in her master to defending her small pecuniary interest at her brothers bedside while that question remained undecided the plain necessity of checking the growth of noel vanstones intimacy with the family at north shingles did not admit of a doubt and of all means of effecting that object none could be less open to suspicion than the temporary removal of the household from their residence at aldborough thoroughly satisfied with the soundness of this conclusion captain wragge made straight for seaview cottage to apologize and explain before the carriage came and the departure took place  noel vanstone was easily accessible to visitors he was walking in the garden before breakfast his disappointment and vexation were freely expressed when he heard the news which his friend had to communicate the captains fluent tongue however soon impressed on him the necessity of resignation to present circumstances the bare hint that the pious fraud might fail after all if anything happened in the ten days interval to enlighten mrs lecount had an instant effect in making noel vanstone as patient and as submissive as could be wished  i wont tell you where we are going for two good reasons said captain wragge when his preliminary explanations were completed in the first place i havent made up my mind yet and in the second place if you dont know where our destination is mrs lecount cant worm it out of you i have not the least doubt she is watching us at this moment from behind her windowcurtain when she asks what i wanted with you this morning tell her i came to say goodby for a few days finding my niece not so well again and wishing to take her on a short visit to some friends to try change of air if you could produce an impression on mrs lecounts mind without overdoing it that you are a little disappointed in me and that you are rather inclined to doubt my heartiness in cultivating your acquaintance you will greatly help our present object you may depend on our return to north shingles in four or five days at furthest if anything strikes me in the meanwhile the post is always at our service and i wont fail to write to you  wont miss bygrave write to me inquired noel vanstone piteously did she know you were coming here did she send me no message  unpardonable on my part to have forgotten it cried the captain she sent you her love  noel vanstone closed his eyes in silent ecstasy  when he opened them again captain wragge had passed through the garden gate and was on his way back to north shingles as soon as his own door had closed on him mrs lecount descended from the post of observation which the captain had rightly suspected her of occupying and addressed the inquiry to her master which the captain had rightly foreseen would follow his departure the reply she received produced but one impression on her mind she at once set it down as a falsehood and returned to her own window to keep watch over north shingles more vigilantly than ever  to her utter astonishment after a lapse of less than half an hour she saw an empty carriage draw up at mr bygraves door luggage was brought out and packed on the vehicle miss bygrave appeared and took her seat in it she was followed into the carriage by a lady of great size and stature whom the housekeeper conjectured to be mrs bygrave the servant came next and stood waiting on the path the last person to appear was mr bygrave he locked the house door and took the key away with him to a cottage near at hand which was the residence of the landlord of north shingles on his return he nodded to the servant who walked away by herself toward the humbler quarter of the little town and joined the ladies in the carriage the coachman mounted the box and the vehicle disappeared  mrs lecount laid down the operaglass through which she had been closely investigating these proceedings with a feeling of helpless perplexity which she was almost ashamed to acknowledge to herself the secret of mr bygraves object in suddenly emptying his house at aldborough of every living creature in it was an impenetrable mystery to her  submitting herself to circumstances with a ready resignation which captain wragge had not shown on his side in a similar situation mrs lecount wasted neither time nor temper in unprofitable guesswork she left the mystery to thicken or to clear as the future might decide and looked exclusively at the uses to which she might put the mornings event in her own interests whatever might have become of the family at north shingles the servant was left behind and the servant was exactly the person whose assistance might now be of vital importance to the housekeepers projects mrs lecount put on her bonnet inspected the collection of loose silver in her purse and set forth on the spot to make the servants acquaintance  she went first to the cottage at which mr bygrave had left the key of north shingles to discover the servants present address from the landlord so far as this object was concerned her errand proved successful the landlord knew that the girl had been allowed to go home for a few days to her friends and knew in what part of aldborough her friends lived but here his sources of information suddenly dried up he knew nothing of the destination to which mr bygrave and his family had betaken themselves and he was perfectly ignorant of the number of days over which their absence might be expected to extend all he could say was that he had not received a notice to quit from his tenant and that he had been requested to keep the key of the house in his possession until mr bygrave returned to claim it in his own person  baffled but not discouraged mrs lecount turned her steps next toward the back street of aldborough and astonished the servants relatives by conferring on them the honor of a morning call  easily imposed on at starting by mrs lecounts pretense of calling to engage her under the impression that she had left mr bygraves service the servant did her best to answer the questions put to her but she knew as little as the landlord of her masters plans all she could say about them was that she had not been dismissed and that she was to await the receipt of a note recalling her when necessary to her situation at north shingles not having expected to find her better informed on this part of the subject mrs lecount smoothly shifted her ground and led the woman into talking generally of the advantages and defects of her situation in mr bygraves family  profiting by the knowledge gained in this indirect manner of the little secrets of the household mrs lecount made two discoveries she found out in the first place that the servant having enough to do in attending to the coarser part of the domestic work was in no position to disclose the secrets of miss bygraves wardrobe which were known only to the young lady herself and to her aunt in the second place the housekeeper ascertained that the true reason of mrs bygraves rigid seclusion was to be found in the simple fact that she was little better than an idiot and that her husband was probably ashamed of allowing her to be seen in public these apparently trivial discoveries enlightened mrs lecount on a very important point which had been previously involved in doubt she was now satisfied that the likeliest way to obtaining a private investigation of magdalens wardrobe lay through deluding the imbecile lady and not through bribing the ignorant servant  having reached that conclusionpregnant with coming assaults on the weaklyfortified discretion of poor mrs wraggethe housekeeper cautiously abstained from exhibiting herself any longer under an inquisitive aspect she changed the conversation to local topics waited until she was sure of leaving an excellent impression behind her and then took her leave   three days passed and mrs lecount and her mastereach with their widelydifferent ends in viewwatched with equal anxiety for the first signs of returning life in the direction of north shingles in that interval no letter either from the uncle or the niece arrived for noel vanstone his sincere feeling of irritation under this neglectful treatment greatly assisted the effect of those feigned doubts on the subject of his absent friends which the captain had recommended him to express in the housekeepers presence he confessed his apprehensions of having been mistaken not in mr bygrave only but even in his niece as well with such a genuine air of annoyance that he actually contributed a new element of confusion to the existing perplexities of mrs lecount  on the morning of the fourth day noel vanstone met the postman in the garden and to his great relief discovered among the letters delivered to him a note from mr bygrave  the date of the note was woodbridge and it contained a few lines only mr bygrave mentioned that his niece was better and that she sent her love as before he proposed returning to aldborough on the next day when he would have some new considerations of a strictly private nature to present to mr noel vanstones mind in the meantime he would beg mr vanstone not to call at north shingles until he received a special invitation to do sowhich invitation should certainly be given on the day when the family returned the motive of this apparently strange request should be explained to mr vanstones perfect satisfaction when he was once more united to his friends until that period arrived the strictest caution was enjoined on him in all his communications with mrs lecount and the instant destruction of mr bygraves letter after due perusal of it was if the classical phrase might be pardoned a sine qua non  the fifth day came noel vanstone after submitting himself to the sine qua non and destroying the letter waited anxiously for results while mrs lecount on her side watched patiently for events toward three oclock in the afternoon th e carriage appeared again at the gate of north shingles mr bygrave got out and tripped away briskly to the landlords cottage for the key he returned with the servant at his heels miss bygrave left the carriage her giant relative followed her example the house door was opened the trunks were taken off the carriage disappeared and the bygraves were at home again  four oclock struck five oclock six oclock and nothing happened in half an hour more mr bygravespruce speckless and respectable as everappeared on the parade sauntering composedly in the direction of sea view  instead of at once entering the house he passed it stopped as if struck by a sudden recollection and retracing his steps asked for mr vanstone at the door mr vanstone came out hospitably into the passage pitching his voice to a tone which could be easily heard by any listening individual through any open door in the bedroom regions mr bygrave announced the object of his visit on the doormat in the fewest possible words he had been staying with a distant relative the distant relative possessed two picturesgems by the old masterswhich he was willing to dispose of and which he had intrusted for that purpose to mr bygraves care if mr noel vanstone as an amateur in such matters wished to see the gems they would be visible in half an hours time when mr bygrave would have returned to north shingles  having delivered himself of this incomprehensible announcement the archconspirator laid his significant forefinger along the side of his short roman nose said fine weather isnt it goodafternoon and sauntered out inscrutably to continue his walk on the parade  on the expiration of the halfhour noel vanstone presented himself at north shingles with the ardor of a lover burning inextinguishably in his bosom through the superincumbent mental fog of a thoroughly bewildered man to his inexpressible happiness he found magdalen alone in the parlor never yet had she looked so beautiful in his eyes the rest and relief of her four days absence from aldborough had not failed to produce their results she had more than recovered her composure vibrating perpetually from one violent extreme to another she had now passed from the passionate despair of five days since to a feverish exaltation of spirits which defied all remorse and confronted all consequences her eyes sparkled her cheeks were bright with color she talked incessantly with a forlorn mockery of the girlish gayety of past days she laughed with a deplorable persistency in laughing she imitated mrs lecounts smooth voice and mrs lecounts insinuating graces of manner with an overcharged resemblance to the original which was but the coarse reflection of the delicatelyaccurate mimicry of former times noel vanstone who had never yet seen her as he saw her now was enchanted his weak head whirled with an intoxication of enjoyment his wizen cheeks flushed as if they had caught the infection from hers the halfhour during which he was alone with her passed like five minutes to him when that time had elapsed and when she suddenly left himto obey a previouslyarranged summons to her aunts presencemiser as he was he would have paid at that moment five golden sovereigns out of his pocket for five golden minutes more passed in her society  the door had hardly closed on magdalen before it opened again and the captain walked in he entered on the explanations which his visitor naturally expected from him with the unceremonious abruptness of a man hard pressed for time and determined to make the most of every moment at his disposal  since we last saw each other he began i have been reckoning up the chances for and against us as we stand at present the result on my own mind is this if you are still at aldborough when that letter from zurich reaches mrs lecount all the pains we have taken will have been pains thrown away if your housekeeper had fifty brothers all dying together she would throw the whole fifty over sooner than leave you alone at sea view while we are your neighbors at north shingles  noel vanstones flushed cheek turned pale with dismay his own knowledge of mrs lecount told him that this view of the case was the right one  if we go away again proceeded the captain nothing will be gained for nothing would persuade your housekeeper in that case that we have not left you the means of following us you must leave aldborough this time and what is more you must go without leaving a single visible trace behind you for us to follow if we accomplish this object in the course of the next five days mrs lecount will take the journey to zurich if we fail she will be a fixture at sea view to a dead certainty dont ask questions i have got your instructions ready for you and i want your closest attention to them your marriage with my niece depends on your not forgetting a word of what i am now going to tell youone question first have you followed my advice have you told mrs lecount you are beginning to think yourself mistaken in me  i did worse than that replied noel vanstone penitently i committed an outrage on my own feelings i disgraced myself by saying that i doubted miss bygrave  go on disgracing yourself my dear sir doubt us both with all your might and ill help you one question more did i speak loud enough this afternoon did mrs lecount hear me  yes lecount opened her door lecount heard you what made you give me that message i see no pictures here is this another pious fraud mr bygrave  admirably guessed mr vanstone you will see the object of my imaginary picturedealing in the very next words which i am now about to address to you when you get back to sea view this is what you are to say to mrs lecount tell her that my relatives works of art are two worthless picturescopies from the old masters which i have tried to sell you as originals at an exorbitant price say you suspect me of being little better than a plausible impostor and pity my unfortunate niece for being associated with such a rascal as i am there is your text to speak from say in many words what i have just said in a few you can do that cant you  of course i can do it said noel vanstone but i can tell you one thinglecount wont believe me  wait a little mr vanstone i have not done with my instructions yet you understand what i have just told you very good we may get on from today to tomorrow go out tomorrow with mrs lecount at your usual time i will meet you on the parade and bow to you instead of returning my bow look the other way in plain english cut me that is easy enough to do isnt it  she wont believe me mr bygraveshe wont believe me  wait a little again mr vanstone there are more instructions to come you have got your directions for today and you have got your directions for tomorrow now for the day after the day after is the seventh day since we sent the letter to zurich on the seventh day decline to go out walking as before from dread of the annoyance of meeting me again grumble about the smallness of the place complain of your health wish you had never come to aldborough and never made acquaintances with the bygraves and when you have well worried mrs lecount with your discontent ask her on a sudden if she cant suggest a change for the better if you put that question to her naturally do you think she can be depended on to answer it  she wont want to be questioned at all replied noel vanstone irritably i have only got to say i am tired of aldborough and if she believes mewhich she wont im quite positive mr bygrave she wontshe will have her suggestion ready before i can ask for it  ay ay said the captain eagerly there is some place then that mrs lecount wants to go to this autumn  she wants to go there hang her every autumn  to go where  to admiral bartramsyou dont know him do youat st cruxinthemarsh  dont lose your patience mr vanstone what you are now telling me is of the most vital importance to the object we ha ve in view who is admiral bartram  an old friend of my fathers my father laid him under obligationsmy father lent him money when they were both young men i am like one of the family at st crux my room is always kept ready for me not that theres any family at the admirals except his nephew george bartram george is my cousin im as intimate with george as my father was with the admiral and ive been sharper than my father for i havent lent my friend any money lecount always makes a show of liking georgei believe to annoy me she likes the admiral too he flatters her vanity he always invites her to come with me to st crux he lets her have one of the best bedrooms and treats her as if she was a lady she is as proud as lucifershe likes being treated like a ladyand she pesters me every autumn to go to st crux whats the matter what are you taking out your pocketbook for  i want the admirals address mr vanstone for a purpose which i will explain immediately  with those words captain wragge opened his pocketbook and wrote down the address from noel vanstones dictation as follows admiral bartram st cruxinthemarsh near ossory essex  good cried the captain closing his pocketbook again the only difficulty that stood in our way is now cleared out of it patience mr vanstonepatience let us take up my instructions again at the point where we dropped them give me five minutes more attention and you will see your way to your marriage as plainly as i see it on the day after tomorrow you declare you are tired of aldborough and mrs lecount suggests st crux you dont say yes or no on the spot you take the next day to consider it and you make up your mind the last thing at night to go to st crux the first thing in the morning are you in the habit of superintending your own packing up or do you usually shift all the trouble of it on mrs lecounts shoulders  lecount has all the trouble of course lecount is paid for it but i dont really go do i  you go as fast as horses can take you to the railway without having held any previous communication with this house either personally or by letter you leave mrs lecount behind to pack up your curiosities to settle with the tradespeople and to follow you to st crux the next morning the next morning is the tenth morning on the tenth morning she receives the letter from zurich and if you only carry out my instructions mr vanstone as sure as you sit there to zurich she goes  noel vanstones color began to rise again as the captains stratagem dawned on him at last in its true light  and what am i to do at st crux he inquired  wait there till i call for you replied the captain as soon as mrs lecounts back is turned i will go to the church here and give the necessary notice of the marriage the same day or the next i will travel to the address written down in my pocketbook pick you up at the admirals and take you on to london with me to get the license with that document in our possession we shall be on our way back to aldborough while mrs lecount is on her way out to zurich and before she starts on her return journey you and my niece will be man and wife there are your future prospects for you what do you think of them  what a head you have got cried noel vanstone in a sudden outburst of enthusiasm youre the most extraordinary man i ever met with one would think you had done nothing all your life but take people in  captain wragge received that unconscious tribute to his native genius with the complacency of a man who felt that he thoroughly deserved it  i have told you already my dear sir he said modestly that i never do things by halves pardon me for reminding you that we have no time for exchanging mutual civilities are you quite sure about your instructions i dare not write them down for fear of accidents try the system of artificial memory count your instructions off after me on your thumb and your four fingers today you tell mrs lecount i have tried to take you in with my relatives works of art tomorrow you cut me on the parade the day after you refuse to go out you get tired of aldborough and you allow mrs lecount to make her suggestion the next day you accept the suggestion and the next day to that you go to st crux once more my dear sir thumbworks of art forefingercut me on the parade middle fingertired of aldborough third fingertake lecounts advice little fingeroff to st crux nothing can be clearernothing can be easier to do is there anything you dont understand anything that i can explain over again before you go  only one thing said noel vanstone is it settled that i am not to come here again before i go to st crux  most decidedly answered the captain the whole success of the enterprise depends on your keeping away mrs lecount will try the credibility of everything you say to her by one testthe test of your communicating or not with this house she will watch you night and day dont call here dont send messages dont write letters dont even go out by yourself let her see you start for st crux on her suggestion with the absolute certainty in her own mind that you have followed her advice without communicating it in any form whatever to me or to my niece do that and she must believe you on the best of all evidence for our interests and the worst for hersthe evidence of her own senses  with those last words of caution he shook the little man warmly by the hand and sent him home on the spot    chapter x  on returning to sea view noel vanstone executed the instructions which prescribed his line of conduct for the first of the five days with unimpeachable accuracy a faint smile of contempt hovered about mrs lecounts lips while the story of mr bygraves attempt to pass off his spurious pictures as originals was in progress but she did not trouble herself to utter a single word of remark when it had come to an end just what i said thought noel vanstone cunningly watching her face she doesnt believe a word of it  the next day the meeting occurred on the parade mr bygrave took off his hat and noel vanstone looked the other way the captains start of surprise and scowl of indignation were executed to perfection but they plainly failed to impose on mrs lecount i am afraid sir you have offended mr bygrave today she ironically remarked happily for you he is an excellent christian and i venture to predict that he will forgive you tomorrow  noel vanstone wisely refrained from committing himself to an answer once more he privately applauded his own penetration once more he triumphed over his ingenious friend  thus far the captains instructions had been too clear and simple to be mistaken by any one but they advanced in complication with the advance of time and on the third day noel vanstone fell confusedly into the commission of a slight error after expressing the necessary weariness of aldborough and the consequent anxiety for change of scene he was met as he had anticipated by an immediate suggestion from the housekeeper recommending a visit to st crux in giving his answer to the advice thus tendered he made his first mistake instead of deferring his decision until the next day he accepted mrs lecounts suggestion on the day when it was offered to him  the consequences of this error were of no great importance the housekeeper merely set herself to watch her master one day earlier than had been calculated ona result which had been already provided for by the wise precautionary measure of forbidding noel vanstone all communication with north shingles doubting as captain wragge had foreseen the sincerity of her masters desire to break off his connection with the bygraves by going to st crux mrs lecount tested the truth or falsehood of the impression produced on her own mind by vigilantly watching for sign s of secret communication on one side or on the other the close attention with which she had hitherto observed the outgoings and incomings at north shingles was now entirely transferred to her master for the rest of that third day she never let him out of her sight she never allowed any third person who came to the house on any pretense whatever a minutes chance of private communication with him at intervals through the night she stole to the door of his room to listen and assure herself that he was in bed and before sunrise the next morning the coastguardsman going his rounds was surprised to see a lady who had risen as early as himself engaged over her work at one of the upper windows of sea view  on the fourth morning noel vanstone came down to breakfast conscious of the mistake that he had committed on the previous day the obvious course to take for the purpose of gaining time was to declare that his mind was still undecided he made the assertion boldly when the housekeeper asked him if he meant to move that day again mrs lecount offered no remark and again the signs and tokens of incredulity showed themselves in her face vacillation of purpose was not at all unusual in her experience of her master but on this occasion she believed that his caprice of conduct was assumed for the purpose of gaining time to communicate with north shingles and she accordingly set her watch on him once more with doubled and trebled vigilance  no letters came that morning toward noon the weather changed for the worse and all idea of walking out as usual was abandoned hour after hour while her master sat in one of the parlors mrs lecount kept watch in the other with the door into the passage open and with a full view of north shingles through the convenient sidewindow at which she had established herself not a sign that was suspicious appeared not a sound that was suspicious caught her ear as the evening closed in her masters hesitation came to an end he was disgusted with the weather he hated the place he foresaw the annoyance of more meetings with mr bygrave and he was determined to go to st crux the first thing the next morning lecount could stay behind to pack up the curiosities and settle with the tradespeople and could follow him to the admirals on the next day the housekeeper was a little staggered by the tone and manner in which he gave these orders he had to her own certain knowledge effected no communication of any sort with north shingles and yet he seemed determined to leave aldborough at the earliest possible opportunity for the first time she hesitated in her adherence to her own conclusions she remembered that her master had complained of the bygraves before they returned to aldborough and she was conscious that her own incredulity had once already misled her when the appearance of the travelingcarriage at the door had proved even mr bygrave himself to be as good as his word  still mrs lecount determined to act with unrelenting caution to the last that night when the doors were closed she privately removed the keys from the door in front and the door at the back she then softly opened her bedroom window and sat down by it with her bonnet and cloak on to prevent her taking cold noel vanstones window was on the same side of the house as her own if any one came in the dark to speak to him from the garden beneath they would speak to his housekeeper as well prepared at all points to intercept every form of clandestine communication which stratagem could invent mrs lecount watched through the quiet night when morning came she stole downstairs before the servant was up restored the keys to their places and reoccupied her position in the parlor until noel vanstone made his appearance at the breakfasttable had he altered his mind no he declined posting to the railway on account of the expense but he was as firm as ever in his resolution to go to st crux he desired that an inside place might be secured for him in the early coach suspicious to the last mrs lecount sent the bakers man to take the place he was a public servant and mr bygrave would not suspect him of performing a private errand  the coach called at sea view mrs lecount saw her master established in his place and ascertained that the other three inside seats were already occupied by strangers she inquired of the coachman if the outside places all of which were not yet filled up had their full complement of passengers also the man replied in the affirmative he had two gentlemen to call for in the town and the others would take their places at the inn mrs lecount forthwith turned her steps toward the inn and took up her position on the parade opposite from a point of view which would enable her to see the last of the coach on its departure in ten minutes more it rattled away full outside and in and the housekeepers own eyes assured her that neither mr bygrave himself nor any one belonging to north shingles was among the passengers  there was only one more precaution to take and mrs lecount did not neglect it mr bygrave had doubtless seen the coach call at sea view he might hire a carriage and follow it to the railway on pure speculation mrs lecount remained within view of the inn the only place at which a carriage could be obtained for nearly an hour longer waiting for events nothing happened no carriage made its appearance no pursuit of noel vanstone was now within the range of human possibility the long strain on mrs lecounts mind relaxed at last she left her seat on the parade and returned in higher spirits than usual to perform the closing household ceremonies at sea view  she sat down alone in the parlor and drew a long breath of relief captain wragges calculations had not deceived him the evidence of her own senses had at last conquered the housekeepers incredulity and had literally forced her into the opposite extreme of belief  estimating the events of the last three days from her own experience of them knowing as she certainly knew that the first idea of going to st crux had been started by herself and that her master had found no opportunity and shown no inclination to inform the family at north shingles that he had accepted her proposal mrs lecount was fairly compelled to acknowledge that not a fragment of foundation remained to justify the continued suspicion of treachery in her own mind looking at the succession of circumstances under the new light thrown on them by results she could see nothing unaccountable nothing contradictory anywhere the attempt to pass off the forged pictures as originals was in perfect harmony with the character of such a man as mr bygrave her masters indignation at the attempt to impose on him his plainlyexpressed suspicion that miss bygrave was privy to it his disappointment in the niece his contemptuous treatment of the uncle on the parade his weariness of the place which had been the scene of his rash intimacy with strangers and his readiness to quit it that morning all commended themselves as genuine realities to the housekeepers mind for one sufficient reason her own eyes had seen noel vanstone take his departure from aldborough without leaving or attempting to leave a single trace behind him for the bygraves to follow  thus far the housekeepers conclusions led her but no further she was too shrewd a woman to trust the future to chance and fortune her masters variable temper might relent accident might at any time give mr bygrave an opportunity of repairing the error that he had committed and of artfully regaining his lost place in noel vanstones estimation admitting that circumstances had at last declared themselves unmistakably in her favor mrs lecount was not the less convinced that nothing would permanently assure her masters security for the future but the plain exposure of the conspiracy which she had striven to accomplish from the firstwhich she was resolved to accomplish still  i always enjoy myself at st crux thought mrs lecount opening her accountbooks and sorting the tradesmens bills the admiral is a gentleman the house is noble the table is excellent no matter here at sea view i stay by myself till i have seen the inside of miss bygraves wardrobe  she packed her masters collection of curiosities in their various cases settled the claims of the tradespeople and superintended the covering of the furniture in the course of the day toward nightfall she went out bent on investigation and ventured into the garden at north shingles under cover of the darkness she saw the light in the parlor window and the lights in the windows of the rooms upstairs as usual after an instants hesitation she stole to the house door and noiselessly tried the handle from the outside it turned the lock as she had expected from her experience of houses at aldborough and at other wateringplaces but the door resisted her the door was distrustfully bolted on the inside after making that discovery she went round to the back of the house and ascertained that the door on that side was secured in the same manner bolt your doors mr bygrave as fast as you like said the housekeeper stealing back again to the parade you cant bolt the entrance to your servants pocket the best lock you have may be opened by a golden key  she went back to bed the ceaseless watching the unrelaxing excitement of the last two days had worn her out  the next morning she rose at seven oclock in half an hour more she saw the punctual mr bygraveas she had seen him on many previous mornings at the same timeissue from the gate of north shingles with his towels under his arm and make his way to a boat that was waiting for him on the beach swimming was one among the many personal accomplishments of which the captain was master he was rowed out to sea every morning and took his bath luxuriously in the deep blue water mrs lecount had already computed the time consumed in this recreation by her watch and had discovered that a full hour usually elapsed from the moment when he embarked on the beach to the moment when he returned  during that period she had never seen any other inhabitant of north shingles leave the house the servant was no doubt at her work in the kitchen mrs bygrave was probably still in her bed and miss bygrave if she was up at that early hour had perhaps received directions not to venture out in her uncles absence the difficulty of meeting the obstacle of magdalens presence in the house had been for some days past the one difficulty which all mrs lecounts ingenuity had thus far proved unable to overcome  she sat at the window for a quarter of an hour after the captains boat had left the beach with her mind hard at work and her eyes fixed mechanically on north shinglesshe sat considering what written excuse she could send to her master for delaying her departure from aldborough for some days to comewhen the door of the house she was watching suddenly opened and magdalen herself appeared in the garden there was no mistaking her figure and her dress she took a few steps hastily toward the gate stopped and pulled down the veil of her garden hat as if she felt the clear morning light too much for her then hurried out on the parade and walked away northward in such haste or in such preoccupation of mind that she went through the garden gate without closing it after her  mrs lecount started up from her chair with a moments doubt of the evidence of her own eyes had the opportunity which she had been vainly plotting to produce actually offered itself to her of its own accord had the chances declared themselves at last in her favor after steadily acting against her for so long there was no doubt of it in the popular phrase her luck had turned she snatched up her bonnet and mantilla and made for north shingles without an instants hesitation mr bygrave out at sea miss bygrave away for a walk mrs bygrave and the servant both at home and both easily dealt withthe opportunity was not to be lost the risk was well worth running  this time the house door was easily opened no one had bolted it again after magdalens departure mrs lecount closed the door softly listened for a moment in the passage and heard the servant noisily occupied in the kitchen with her pots and pans if my lucky star leads me straight into miss bygraves room thought the housekeeper stealing noiselessly up the stairs i may find my way to her wardrobe without disturbing anybody  she tried the door nearest to the front of the house on the righthand side of the landing capricious chance had deserted her already the lock was turned she tried the door opposite on her left hand the boots ranged symmetrically in a row and the razors on the dressingtable told her at once that she had not found the right room yet she returned to the righthand side of the landing walked down a little passage leading to the back of the house and tried a third door the door opened and the two opposite extremes of female humanity mrs wragge and mrs lecount stood face to face in an instant  i beg ten thousand pardons said mrs lecount with the most consummate selfpossession  lord bless us and save us cried mrs wragge with the most helpless amazement  the two exclamations were uttered in a moment and in that moment mrs lecount took the measure of her victim nothing of the least importance escaped her she noticed the oriental cashmere robe lying half made and half unpicked again on the table she noticed the imbecile foot of mrs wragge searching blindly in the neighborhood of her chair for a lost shoe she noticed that there was a second door in the room besides the door by which she had entered and a second chair within easy reach on which she might do well to seat herself in a friendly and confidential way pray dont resent my intrusion pleaded mrs lecount taking the chair pray allow me to explain myself  speaking in her softest voice surveying mrs wragge with a sweet smile on her insinuating lips and a melting interest in her handsome black eyes the housekeeper told her little introductory series of falsehoods with an artless truthfulness of manner which the father of lies himself might have envied she had heard from mr bygrave that mrs bygrave was a great invalid she had constantly reproached herself in her idle halfhours at sea view where she filled the situation of mr noel vanstones housekeeper for not having offered her friendly services to mrs bygrave she had been directed by her master doubtless well known to mrs bygrave as one of her husbands friends and naturally one of her charming nieces admirers to join him that day at the residence to which he had removed from aldborough she was obliged to leave early but she could not reconcile it to her conscience to go without calling to apologize for her apparent want of neighborly consideration she had found nobody in the house she had not been able to make the servant hear she had presumed not discovering that apartment downstairs that mrs bygraves boudoir might be on the upper story she had thoughtlessly committed an intrusion of which she was sincerely ashamed and she could now only trust to mrs bygraves indulgence to excuse and forgive her  a less elaborate apology might have served mrs lecounts purpose as soon as mrs wragges struggling perceptions had grasped the fact that her unexpected visitor was a neighbor well known to her by repute her whole being became absorbed in admiration of mrs lecounts ladylike manners and mrs lecounts perfectlyfitting gown what a noble way she has of talking thought poor mrs wragge as the housekeeper reached her closing sentence and oh my heart alive how nicely shes dressed  i see i disturb you pursued mrs lecount artfully availing herself of the oriental cashmere robe as a means ready at hand of reaching the end she had in viewi see i disturb you maam over an occupation which i know by experience requires the closest attention dear dear me you are un picking the dress again i see after it has been made this is my own experience again mrs bygrave some dresses are so obstinate some dresses seem to say to one in so many words no you may do what you like with me i wont fit  mrs wragge was greatly struck by this happy remark she burst out laughing and clapped her great hands in hearty approval  thats what this gown has been saying to me ever since i first put the scissors into it she exclaimed cheerfully i know ive got an awful big back but thats no reason why should a gown be weeks on hand and then not meet behind you after all it hangs over my boasom like a sackit does look here maam at the skirt it wont come right it draggles in front and cocks up behind it shows my heelsand lord knows i get into scrapes enough about my heels without showing them into the bargain  may i ask a favor inquired mrs lecount confidentially may i try mrs bygrave if i can make my experience of any use to you i think our bosoms maam are our great difficulty now this bosom of yoursshall i say in plain words what i think this bosom of yours is an enormous mistake  dont say that cried mrs wragge imploringly dont please theres a good soul its an awful big one i know but its modeled for all that from one of magdalens own  she was far too deeply interested on the subject of the dress to notice that she had forgotten herself already and that she had referred to magdalen by her own name mrs lecounts sharp ears detected the mistake the instant it was committed so so she thought one discovery already if i had ever doubted my own suspicions here is an estimable lady who would now have set me righti beg your pardon she proceeded aloud did you say this was modeled from one of your nieces dresses  yes said mrs wragge its as like as two peas  then replied mrs lecount adroitly there must be some serious mistake in the making of your nieces dress can you show it to me  bless your heartyes cried mrs wragge step this way maam and bring the gown along with you please it keeps sliding off out of pure aggravation if you lay it out on the table theres lots of room on the bed in here  she opened the door of communication and led the way eagerly into magdalens room as mrs lecount followed she stole a look at her watch never before had time flown as it flew that morning in twenty minutes more mr bygrave would be back from his bath  there said mrs wragge throwing open the wardrobe and taking a dress down from one of the pegs look there theres plaits on her boasom and plaits on mine six of one and half a dozen of the other and mine are the biggestthats all  mrs lecount shook her head gravely and entered forthwith into subtleties of disquisition on the art of dressmaking which had the desired effect of utterly bewildering the proprietor of the oriental cashmere robe in less than three minutes  dont cried mrs wragge imploringly dont go on like that im miles behind you and my heads buzzing already tell us like a good soul whats to be done you said something about the pattern just now perhaps im too big for the pattern i cant help it if i am manys the good cry i had when i was a growing girl over my own size theres half too much of me maammeasure me along or measure me across i dont deny ittheres half too much of me anyway  my dear madam protested mrs lecount you do yourself a wrong permit me to assure you that you possess a commanding figurea figure of minerva a majestic simplicity in the form of a woman imperatively demands a majestic simplicity in the form of that womans dress the laws of costume are classical the laws of costume must not be trifled with plaits for venus puffs for juno folds for minerva i venture to suggest a total change of pattern your niece has other dresses in her collection why may we not find a minerva pattern among them  as she said those words she led the way back to the wardrobe  mrs wragge followed and took the dresses out one by one shaking her head despondently silk dresses appeared muslin dresses appeared the one dress which remained invisible was the dress of which mrs lecount was in search  theres the lot of em said mrs wragge they may do for venus and the two other ones ive seen em in picters without a morsel of decent linen among the three but they wont do for me  surely there is another dress left said mrs lecount pointing to the wardrobe but touching nothing in it surely i see something hanging in the corner behind that dark shawl  mrs wragge removed the shawl mrs lecount opened the door of the wardrobe a little wider therehitched carelessly on the innermost pegthere with its white spots and its double flounce was the brown alpaca dress  the suddenness and completeness of the discovery threw the housekeeper practiced dissembler as she was completely off her guard she started at the sight of the dress the instant afterward her eyes turned uneasily toward mrs wragge had the start been observed it had passed entirely unnoticed mrs wragges whole attention was fixed on the alpaca dress she was staring at it incomprehensibly with an expression of the utmost dismay  you seem alarmed maam said mrs lecount what is there in the wardrobe to frighten you  id have given a crown piece out of my pocket said mrs wragge not to have set my eyes on that gown it had gone clean out of my head and now its come back again cover it up cried mrs wragge throwing the shawl over the dress in a sudden fit of desperation if i look at it much longer i shall think im back again in vauxhall walk  vauxhall walk those two words told mrs lecount she was on the brink of another discovery she stole a second look at her watch there was barely ten minutes to spare before the time when mr bygrave might return there was not one of those ten minutes which might not bring his niece back to the house caution counseled mrs lecount to go without running any more risks curiosity rooted her to the spot and gave the courage to stay at all hazards until the time was up her amiable smile began to harden a little as she probed her way tenderly into mrs wragges feeble mind  you have some unpleasant remembrances of vauxhall walk she said with the gentlest possible tone of inquiry in her voice or perhaps i should say unpleasant remembrances of that dress belonging to your niece  the last time i saw her with that gown on said mrs wragge dropping into a chair and beginning to tremble was the time when i came back from shopping and saw the ghost  the ghost repeated mrs lecount clasping her hands in graceful astonishment dear madam pardon me is there such a thing in the world where did you see it in vauxhall walk tell meyou are the first lady i ever met with who has seen a ghostpray tell me  flattered by the position of importance which she had suddenly assumed in the housekeepers eyes mrs wragge entered at full length into the narrative of her supernatural adventure the breathless eagerness with which mrs lecount listened to her description of the specters costume the specters hurry on the stairs and the specters disappearance in the bedroom the extraordinary interest which mrs lecount displayed on hearing that the dress in the wardrobe was the very dress in which magdalen happened to be attired at the awful moment when the ghost vanished encouraged mrs wragge to wade deeper and deeper into details and to involve herself in a confusion of collateral circumstances out of which there seemed to be no prospect of her emerging for hours to come faster and faster the inexorable minutes flew by nearer and nearer came the fatal moment of mr bygraves return mrs lecount looked at her watch for the third time without an attempt on this occasion to conceal the action from her companions notice there were literally two minutes left for her to get clear of north shingles two minutes would be enough if no accident happened she had discovered the alpaca dress she had heard the whole story of the adventure in vauxhall walk and more than that she had even informed herself of the number of the housewhich mrs wragge happened to remember because it answered to the number of years in her own age all that was necessary to her masters complete enlightenment she had now accomplished even if there had been time to stay longer there was nothing worth staying for ill strike this worthy idiot dumb with a coup detat thought the housekeeper and vanish before she recovers herself  horrible cried mrs lecount interrupting the ghostly narrative by a shrill little scream and making for the door to mrs wragges unutterable astonishment without the least ceremony you freeze the very marrow of my bones goodmorning she coolly tossed the oriental cashmere robe into mrs wragges expansive lap and left the room in an instant  as she swiftly descended the stairs she heard the door of the bedroom open  where are your manners cried a voice from above hailing her feebly over the banisters what do you mean by pitching my gown at me in that way you ought to be ashamed of yourself pursued mrs wragge turning from a lamb to a lioness as she gradually realized the indignity offered to the cashmere robe you nasty foreigner you ought to be ashamed of yourself  pursued by this valedictory address mrs lecount reached the house door and opened it without interruption she glided rapidly along the garden path passed through the gate and finding herself safe on the parade stopped and looked toward the sea  the first object which her eyes encountered was the figure of mr bygrave standing motionless on the beacha petrified bather with his towels in his hand one glance at him was enough to show that he had seen the housekeeper passing out through his garden gate  rightly conjecturing that mr bygraves first impulse would lead him to make instant inquiries in his own house mrs lecount pursued her way back to sea view as composedly as if nothing had happened when she entered the parlor where her solitary breakfast was waiting for her she was surprised to see a letter lying on the table she approached to take it up with an expression of impatience thinking it might be some tradesmans bill which she had forgotten  it was the forged letter from zurich    chapter xi  the postmark and the handwriting on the address admirably imitated from the original warned mrs lecount of the contents of the letter before she opened it  after waiting a moment to compose herself she read the announcement of her brothers relapse  there was nothing in the handwriting there was no expression in any part of the letter which could suggest to her mind the faintest suspicion of foul play not the shadow of a doubt occurred to her that the summons to her brothers bedside was genuine the hand that held the letter dropped heavily into her lap she became pale and old and haggard in a moment thoughts far removed from her present aims and interests remembrances that carried her back to other lands than england to other times than the time of her life in service prolonged their inner shadows to the surface and showed the traces of their mysterious passage darkly on her face the minutes followed each other and still the servant below stairs waited vainly for the parlor bell the minutes followed each other and still she sat tearless and quiet dead to the present and the future living in the past  the entrance of the servant uncalled roused her with a heavy sigh the cold and secret woman folded the letter up again and addressed herself to the interests and the duties of the passing time  she decided the question of going or not going to zurich after a very brief consideration of it before she had drawn her chair to the breakfasttable she had resolved to go  admirably as captain wragges stratagem had worked it might have failedunassisted by the occurrence of the morningto achieve this result the very accident against which it had been the captains chief anxiety to guardthe accident which had just taken place in spite of himwas of all the events that could have happened the one event which falsified every previous calculation by directly forwarding the main purpose of the conspiracy if mrs lecount had not obtained the information of which she was in search before the receipt of the letter from zurich the letter might have addressed her in vain she would have hesitated before deciding to leave england and that hesitation might have proved fatal to the captains scheme  as it was with the plain proofs in her possession with the gown discovered in magdalens wardrobe with the piece cut out of it in her own pocketbook and with the knowledge obtained from mrs wragge of the very house in which the disguise had been put on mrs lecount had now at her command the means of warning noel vanstone as she had never been able to warn him yet or in other words the means of guarding against any dangerous tendencies toward reconciliation with the bygraves which might otherwise have entered his mind during her absence at zurich the only difficulty which now perplexed her was the difficulty of deciding whether she should communicate with her master personally or by writing before her departure from england  she looked again at the doctors letter the word instantly in the sentence which summoned her to her dying brother was twice underlined admiral bartrams house was at some distance from the railway the time consumed in driving to st crux and driving back again might be time fatally lost on the journey to zurich although she would infinitely have preferred a personal interview with noel vanstone there was no choice on a matter of life and death but to save the precious hours by writing to him  after sending to secure a place at once in the early coach she sat down to write to her master  her first thought was to tell him all that had happened at north shingles that morning on reflection however she rejected the idea once already in copying the personal description from miss garths letter she had trusted her weapons in her masters hands and mr bygrave had contrived to turn them against her she resolved this time to keep them strictly in her own possession the secret of the missing fragment of the alpaca dress was known to no living creature but herself and until her return to england she determined to keep it to herself the necessary impression might be produced on noel vanstones mind without venturing into details she knew by experience the form of letter which might be trusted to produce an effect on him and she now wrote it in these words   dear mr noelsad news has reached me from switzerland my beloved brother is dying and his medical attendant summons me instantly to zurich the serious necessity of availing myself of the earliest means of conveyance to the continent leaves me but one alternative i must profit by the permission to leave england if necessary which you kindly granted to me at the beginning of my brothers illness and i must avoid all delay by going straight to london instead of turning aside as i should have liked to see you first at st crux  painfully as i am affected by the family calamity which has fallen on me i cannot let this opportunity pass without adverting to another subject which seriously concerns your welfare and in which on that account your old housekeeper feels the deepest interest  i am going to surprise and shock you mr noel pray dont be agitated pray compose yourself  the impudent attempt to cheat you which has happily opened your eyes to the true character of our neighbors at north shingles was not the only object which mr bygrave had in forcing himself on your acquaintance the infamous conspiracy with which you were threatened in london has been in full progress against you under mr bygraves direction at aldborough accidenti will tell you what accident when we meethas put me in possession of information precious to your future security i have discovered to an absolute certainty that the person calling herself miss bygrave is no other than the woman who visited us in disguise at vauxhall walk  i suspected this from the first but i had no evidence to support my suspicions i had no means of combating the false impression produced on you my hands i thank heaven are tied no longer i possess absolute proof of the assertion that i have just madeproof that your own eyes can seeproof that would satisfy you if you were judge in a court of justice  perhaps even yet mr noel you will refuse to believe me be it so believe me or not i have one last favor to ask which your english sense of fair play will not deny me  this melancholy journey of mine will keep me away from england for a fortnight or at most for three weeks you will oblige meand you will certainly not sacrifice your own convenience and pleasureby staying through that interval with your friends at st crux if before my return some unexpected circumstance throws you once more into the company of the bygraves and if your natural kindness of heart inclines you to receive the excuses which they will in that case certainly address to you place one trifling restraint on yourself for your own sake if not for mine suspend your flirtation with the young lady i beg pardon of all other young ladies for calling her so until my return if when i come back i fail to prove to you that miss bygrave is the woman who wore that disguise and used those threatening words in vauxhall wall i will engage to leave your service at a days notice and i will atone for the sin of bearing false witness against my neighbor by resigning every claim i have to your grateful remembrance on your fathers account as well as on your own i make this engagement without reserves of any kind and i promise to abide by itif my proofs failon the faith of a good catholic and the word of an honest woman your faithful servant  virginie lecount   the closing sentences of this letteras the housekeeper well knew when she wrote themembodied the one appeal to noel vanstone which could be certainly trusted to produce a deep and lasting effect she might have staked her oath her life or her reputation on proving the assertion which she had made and have failed to leave a permanent impression on his mind but when she staked not only her position in his service but her pecuniary claims on him as well she at once absorbed the ruling passion of his life in expectation of the result there was not a doubt of it in the strongest of all his intereststhe interest of saving his moneyhe would wait  checkmate for mr bygrave thought mrs lecount as she sealed and directed the letter the battle is overthe game is played out  while mrs lecount was providing for her masters future security at sea view events were in full progress at north shingles  as soon as captain wragge recovered his astonishment at the housekeepers appearance on his own premises he hurried into the house and guided by his own forebodings of the disaster that had happened made straight for his wifes room  never in all her former experience had poor mrs wragge felt the full weight of the captains indignation as she felt it now all the little intelligence she naturally possessed vanished at once in the whirlwind of her husbands rage the only plain facts which he could extract from her were two in number in the first place magdalens rash desertion of her post proved to have no better reason to excuse it than magdalens incorrigible impatience she had passed a sleepless night she had risen feverish and wretched and she had gone out reckless of all consequences to cool her burning head in the fresh air in the second place mrs wragge had on her own confession seen mrs lecount had talked with mrs lecount and had ended by telling mrs lecount the story of the ghost having made these discoveries captain wragge wasted no time in contending with his wifes terror and confusion he withdrew at once to a window which commanded an uninterrupted prospect of noel vanstones house and there established himself on the watch for events at sea view precisely as mrs lecount had established herself on the watch for events at north shingles  not a word of comment on the disaster of the morning escaped him when magdalen returned and found him at his post his flow of language seemed at last to have run dry i told you what mrs wragge would do he said and mrs wragge has done it he sat unflinchingly at the window with a patience which mrs lecount herself could not have surpassed the one active proceeding in which he seemed to think it necessary to engage was performed by deputy he sent the servant to the inn to hire a chaise and a fast horse and to say that he would call himself before noon that day and tell the hostler when the vehicle would be wanted not a sign of impatience escaped him until the time drew near for the departure of the early coach then the captains curly lips began to twitch with anxiety and the captains restless fingers beat the devils tattoo unremittingly on the windowpane  the coach appeared at last and drew up at sea view in a minute more captain wragges own observation informed him that one among the passengers who left aldborough that morning wasmrs lecount  the main uncertainty disposed of a serious questionsuggested by the events of the morningstill remained to be solved which was the destined end of mrs lecounts journeyzurich or st crux that she would certainly inform her master of mrs wragges ghost story and of every other disclosure in relation to names and places which might have escaped mrs wragges lips was beyond all doubt but of the two ways at her disposal of doing the mischiefeither personally or by letterit was vitally important to the captain to know which she had chosen if she had gone to the admirals no choice would be left him but to follow the coach to catch the train by which she traveled and to outstrip her afterward on the drive from the station in essex to st crux if on the contrary she had been contented with writing to her master it would only be necessary to devise measures for intercepting the letter the captain decided on going to the postoffice in the first place assuming that the housekeeper had written she would not have left the letter at the mercy of the servantshe would have seen it safely in the letterbox before leaving aldborough  goodmorning said the captain cheerfully addressing the postmaster i am mr bygrave of north shingles i think you have a letter in the box addressed to mr  the postmaster was a short man and consequently a man with a proper idea of his own importance he solemnly checked captain wragge in full career  when a letter is once posted sir he said nobody out of the office has any business with it until it reaches its address  the captain was not a man to be daunted even by a postmaster a bright idea struck him he took out his pocketbook in which admiral bartrams address was written and returned to the charge  suppose a letter has been wrongly directed by mistake he began and suppose the writer wants to correct the error after the letter is put into the box  when a letter is once posted sir reiterated the impenetrable local authority nobody out of the office touches it on any pretense whatever  granted with all my heart persisted the captain i dont want to touch iti only want to explain myself a lady has posted a letter here addressed to noel vanstone esq admiral bartrams st cruxinthemarsh essex she wrote in a great hurry and she is not quite certain whether she added the name of the posttown ossory it is of the last importance that the delivery of the letter should not be delayed what is to hinder your facilitating the postoffice work and obliging a lady by adding the name of the posttown if it happens to be left out with your own hand i put it to you as a zealous officer what possible objection can there be to granting my request  the postmaster was compelled to acknowledge that there could be no objection provided nothing but a necessary line was added to the address provided nobody touched the letter but himself and provided the precious time of the postoffice was not suffered to run to waste as there happened to be nothing particular to do at that moment he would readily oblige the lady at mr bygraves request  captain wragge watched the postmasters hands as they sorted the letters in the box with breathless eagerness was the letter there would the hands of the zealous public servant suddenly stop yes they stopped and picked out a letter from the rest  noel vanstone esquire did you say asked the postmaster keeping the letter in his own hand  noel vanstone esquire replied the captain admiral bartrams st cruxinthemarsh  ossory essex chimed in the postmaster throwing the letter back into the box the lady has made no mistake sir the address is quite right  nothing but a timely consideration of the heavy debt he owed to appearances prevented captain wragge from throwing his tall white hat up in the air as soon as he found the street once more all further doubt was now at an end mrs lecount had written to her mastertherefore mrs lecount was on her way to zurich  with his head higher than ever with the tails of his respectable frockcoat floating behind him in the breeze with his bosoms native impudence sitting lightly on its throne the captain strutted to the inn and called for the railway timetable after making certain calculations in black and white as a matter of course he ordered his chaise to be ready in an hourso as to reach the railway in time for the second train running to londonwith which there happened to be no communication from aldborough by coach  his next proceeding was of a far more serious kind his next proceeding implied a terrible certainty of success the day of the week was thursday from the inn he went to the church saw the clerk and gave the necessary notice for a marriage by license on the following monday  bold as he was his nerves were a little shaken by this last achievement his hand trembled as it lifted the latch of the garden gate he doctored his nerves with brandy and water before he sent for magdalen to inform her of the proceedings of the morning another outbreak might reasonably be expected when she heard that the last irrevocable step had been taken and that notice had been given of the weddingday  the captains watch warned him to lose no time in emptying his glass in a few minutes he sent the necessary message upstairs while waiting for magdalens appearance he provided himself with certain materials which were now necessary to carry the enterprise to its crowning point in the first place he wrote his assumed name by no means in so fine a hand as usual on a blank visitingcard and added underneath these words not a moment is to be lost i am waiting for you at the doorcome down to me directly his next proceeding was to take some halfdozen envelopes out of the case and to direct them all alike to the following address thomas bygrave esq mussareds hotel salisbury street strand london after carefully placing the envelopes and the card in his breastpocket he shut up the desk as he rose from the writingtable magdalen came into the room  the captain took a moment to decide on the best method of opening the interview and determined in his own phrase to dash at it in two words he told magdalen what had happened and informed her that monday was to be her weddingday  he was prepared to quiet her if she burst into a frenzy of passion to reason with her if she begged for time to sympathize with her if she melted into tears to his inexpressible surprise results falsified all his calculations she heard him without uttering a word without shedding a tear when he had done she dropped into a chair her large gray eyes stared at him vacantly in one mysterious instant all her beauty left her her face stiffened awfully like the face of a corpse for the first time in the captains experience of her fearallmastering fearhad taken possession of her body and soul  you are not flinching he said trying to rouse her surely you are not flinching at the last moment  no light of intelligence came into her eyes no change passed over her face but she heard himfor she moved a little in the chair and slowly shook her head  you planned this marriage of your own freewill pursued the captain with the furtive look and the faltering voice of a man ill at ease it was your own ideanot mine i wont have the responsibility laid on my shouldersno not for twice two hundred pounds if your resolution fails you if you think better of it  he stopped her face was changing her lips were moving at last she slowly raised her left hand with the fingers outspread she looked at it as if it was a hand that was strange to her she counted the days on it the days before the marriage  friday one she whispered to herself saturday two sunday three monday her hands dropped into her lap her face stiffened again the deadly fear fastened its paralyzing hold on her once more and the next words died away on her lips  captain wragge took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead  damn the two hundred pounds he said two thousand wouldnt pay me for this  he put the handkerchief back took the envelopes which he had addressed to himself out of his pocket and approaching her closely for the first time laid his hand on her arm  rouse yourself he said i have a last word to say to you can you listen  she struggled and roused herselfa faint tinge of color stole over her white cheeksshe bowed her head  look at these pursued captain wragge holding up the envelopes if i turn these to the use for which they have been written mrs lecounts master will never receive mrs lecounts letter if i tear them up he will know by tomorrows post that you are the woman who visited him in vauxhall walk say the word shall i tear the envelopes up or shall i put them back in my pocket  there was a pause of dead silence the murmur of the summer waves on the shingle of the beach and the voices of the summer idlers on the parade floated through the open window and filled the empty stillness of the room  she raised her head she lifted her hand and pointed steadily to the envelopes  put them back she said  do you mean it he asked  i mean it  as she gave that answer there was a sound of wheels on the road outside  you hear those wheels said captain wragge  i hear them  you see the chaise said the captain pointing through the window as the chaise which had been ordered from the inn made its appearance at the garden gate  i see it  and of your own freewill you tell me to go  yes go  without another word he left her the servant was waiting at the door with his traveling bag miss bygrave is not well he said tell your mistress to go to her in the parlor  he stepped into the chaise and started on the first stage of the journey to st crux   chapter xii  toward three oclock in the afternoon captain wragge stopped at the nearest station to ossory which the railway passed in its course through essex inquiries made on the spot informed him that he might drive to st crux remain there for a quarter of an hour and return to the station in time for an evening train to london in ten minutes more the captain was on the road again driving rapidly in the direction of the coast  after proceeding some miles on the highway the carriage turned off and the coachman involved himself in an intricate network of crossroads  are we far from st crux asked the captain growing impatient after mile on mile had been passed without a sign of reaching the journeys end  youll see the house sir at the next turn in the road said the man  the next turn in the road brought them within view of the open country again ahead of the carriage captain wragge saw a long dark line against the skythe line of the seawall which protects the low coast of essex from inundation the flat intermediate country was intersected by a labyrinth of tidal streams winding up from the invisible sea in strange fantastic curvesrivers at high water and channels of mud at low on his right hand was a quaint little village mostly composed of wooden houses straggling down to the brink of one of the tidal streams on his left hand further away rose the gloomy ruins of an abbey with a desolate pile of buildings which covered two sides of a square attached to it one of the streams from the sea called in essex backwaters curled almost entirely round the house another from an opposite quarter appeared to run straight through the grounds and to separate one side of the shapeless mass of buildings which was in moderate repair from another which was little better than a ruin bridges of wood and bridges of brick crossed the stream and gave access to the house from all points of the compass no human creature appeared in the neighborhood and no sound was heard but the hoarse barking of a housedog from an invisible courtyard  which door shall i drive to sir asked the coachman the front or the back  the back said captain wragge feeling that the less notice he attracted in his present position the safer that position might be  the carriage twice crossed the stream before the coachman made his way through the grounds into a dreary inclosure of stone at an open door on the inhabited side of the place sat a weatherbeaten old man busily at work on a halffinished model of a ship he rose and came to the carriage door lifting up his spectacles on his forehead and looking disconcerted at the appearance of a stranger  is mr noel vanstone staying here asked captain wragge  yes sir replied the old man mr noel came yesterday  take that card to mr vanstone if you please said the captain and say i am waiting here to see him  in a few minutes noel vanstone made his appearance breathless and eagerabsorbed in anxiety for news from aldborough captain wragge opened the carriage door seized his outstretched hand and pulled him in without ceremony  your housekeeper has gone whispered the captain and you are to be married on monday dont agitate yourself and dont express your feelingsthere isnt time for it get the first active servant you can find in the house to pack your bag in ten minutes take leave of the admiral and come back at once with me to the london train  noel vanstone faintly attempted to ask a question the captain declined to hear it  as much talk as you like on the road he said time is too precious for talking here how do we know lecount may not think better of it how do we know she may not turn back before she gets to zurich  that startling consideration terrified noel vanstone into instant submission  what shall i say to the admiral he asked helplessly  tell him you are going to be married to be sure what does it matter now lecounts back is turned if he wonders you didnt tell him before say its a runaway match and the bride is waiting for you stop any letters addressed to you in your absence will be sent to this place of course give the admiral these envelopes and tell him to forward your letters under cover to me i am an old customer at the hotel we are going to and if we find the place full the landlord may be depended on to take care of any letters with my name on them a safe address in london for your correspondence may be of the greatest importance how do we know lecount may not write to you on her way to zurich  what a head you have got cried noel vanstone eagerly taking the envelopes you think of everything  he left the carriage in high excitement and ran back into the house in ten minutes more captain wragge had him in safe custody and the horses started on their return journey  the travelers reached london in good time that evening and found accommodation at the hotel  knowing the restless inquisitive nature of the man he had to deal with captain wragge had anticipated some little difficulty and embarrassment in meeting the questions which noel vanstone might put to him on the way to london to his great relief a startling domestic discovery absorbed his traveling companions whole attention at the outset of the journey by some extraordinary oversight miss bygrave had been left on the eve of her marriage unprovided with a maid noel vanstone declared that he would take the whole responsibility of correcting this deficiency in the arrangements on his own shoulders he would not trouble mr bygrave to give him any assistance he would confer when they got to their journeys end with the landlady of the hotel and would examine the candidates for the vacant office himself all the way to london he returned again and again to the same subject all the evening at the hotel he was in and out of the landladys sittingroom until he fairly obliged her to lock the door in every other proceeding which related to his marriage he had been kept in the background he had been compelled to follow in the footsteps of his ingenious friend in the matter of the ladys maid he claimed his fitting position at lasthe followed nobody he took the lead  the forenoon of the next day was devoted to obtaining the licensethe personal distinction of making the declaration on oath being eagerly accepted by noel vanstone who swore in perfect good faith on information previously obtained from the captain that the lady was of age the document procured the bridegroom returned to examine the characters and qualifications of the womenservants out of the place whom the landlady had engaged to summon to the hotel while captain wragge turned his steps on business personal to himself toward the residence of a friend in a distant quarter of london  the captains friend was connected with the law and the captains business was of a twofold nature his first object was to inform himself of the legal bearings of the approaching marriage on the future of the husband and the wife his second object was to provide beforehand for destroying all traces of the destination to which he might betake himself when he left aldborough on the weddingday having reached his end successfully in both these cases he returned to the hotel and found noel vanstone nursing his offended dignity in the landladys sittingroom three ladies maids had appeared to pass their examination and had all on coming to the question of wages impudently declined accepting the place a fourth candidate was expected to present herself on the next day and until she made her appearance noel vanstone positively declined removing from the metropolis captain wragge showed his annoyance openly at the unnecessary delay thus occasioned in the return to aldborough but without producing any effect noel vanstone shook his obstinate little head and solemnly refused to trifle with his responsibilities  the first event which occurred on saturday morning was the arrival of mrs lecounts letter to her master inclosed in one of the envelopes which the captain had addressed to himself he received it by previous arrangement with the waiter in his bedroomread it with the closest attentionand put it away carefully in his pocketbook the letter was ominous of serious events to come when the housekeeper returned to england and it was due to magdalenwho was the person threatenedto place the warning of danger in her own possession  later in the day the fourth candidate appeared for the maids situationa young woman of small expectations and subdued manners who looked as the landlady remarked like a person overtaken by misfortune she passed the ordeal of examination successfully and accepted the wages offered with out a murmur the engagement having been ratified on both sides fresh delays ensued of which noel vanstone was once more the cause he had not yet made up his mind whether he would or would not give more than a guinea for the weddingring and he wasted the rest of the day to such disastrous purpose in one jewelers shop after another that he and the captain and the new ladys maid who traveled with them were barely in time to catch the last train from london that evening it was late at night when they left the railway at the nearest station to aldborough captain wragge had been strangely silent all through the journey his mind was ill at ease he had left magdalen under very critical circumstances with no fit person to control her and he was wholly ignorant of the progress of events in his absence at north shingles    chapter xiii  what had happened at aldborough in captain wragges absence events had occurred which the captains utmost dexterity might have found it hard to remedy  as soon as the chaise had left north shingles mrs wragge received the message which her husband had charged the servant to deliver she hastened into the parlor bewildered by her stormy interview with the captain and penitently conscious that she had done wrong without knowing what the wrong was if magdalens mind had been unoccupied by the one idea of the marriage which now filled itif she had possessed composure enough to listen to mrs wragges rambling narrative of what had happened during her interview with the housekeepermrs lecounts visit to the wardrobe must sooner or later have formed part of the disclosure and magdalen although she might never have guessed the truth must at least have been warned that there was some element of danger lurking treacherously in the alpaca dress as it was no such consequence as this followed mrs wragges appearance in the parlor for no such consequence was now possible  events which had happened earlier in the morning events which had happened for days and weeks past had vanished as completely from magdalens mind as if they had never taken place the horror of the coming mondaythe merciless certainty implied in the appointment of the day and hourpetrified all feeling in her and annihilated all thought mrs wragge made three separate attempts to enter on the subject of the housekeepers visit the first time she might as well have addressed herself to the wind or to the sea the second attempt seemed likely to be more successful magdalen sighed listened for a moment indifferently and then dismissed the subject it doesnt matter she said the end has come all the same im not angry with you say no more later in the day from not knowing what else to talk about mrs wragge tried again this time magdalen turned on her impatiently for gods sake dont worry me about trifles i cant bear it mrs wragge closed her lips on the spot and returned to the subject no more magdalen who had been kind to her at all other times had angrily forbidden it the captainutterly ignorant of mrs lecounts interest in the secrets of the wardrobehad never so much as approached it all the information that he had extracted from his wifes mental confusion he had extracted by putting direct questions derived purely from the resources of his own knowledge he had insisted on plain answers without excuses of any kind he had carried his point as usual and his departure the same morning had left him no chance of reopening the question even if his irritation against his wife had permitted him to do so there the alpaca dress hung neglected in the darkthe unnoticed unsuspected center of dangers that were still to come  toward the afternoon mrs wragge took courage to start a suggestion of her ownshe pleaded for a little turn in the fresh air  magdalen passively put on her hat passively accompanied her companion along the public walk until they reached its northward extremity here the beach was left solitary and here they sat down side by side on the shingle it was a bright exhilarating day pleasureboats were sailing on the calm blue water aldborough was idling happily afloat and ashore mrs wragge recovered her spirits in the gayety of the prospectshe amused herself like a child by tossing pebbles into the sea from time to time she stole a questioning glance at magdalen and saw no encouragement in her manner no change to cordiality in her face she sat silent on the slope of the shingle with her elbow on her knee and her head resting on her hand looking out over the sealooking with rapt attention and yet with eyes that seemed to notice nothing mrs wragge wearied of the pebbles and lost her interest in looking at the pleasureboats her great head began to nod heavily and she dozed in the warm drowsy air when she woke the pleasureboats were far off their sails were white specks in the distance the idlers on the beach were thinned in number the sun was low in the heaven the blue sea was darker and rippled by a breeze changes on sky and earth and ocean told of the waning day change was everywhereexcept close at her side there magdalen sat in the same position with weary eyes that still looked over the sea and still saw nothing  oh do speak to me said mrs wragge  magdalen started and looked about her vacantly  its late she said shivering under the first sensation that reached her of the rising breeze come home you want your tea they walked home in silence  dont be angry with me for asking said mrs wragge as they sat together at the teatable are you troubled my dear in your mind  yes replied magdalen dont notice me my trouble will soon be over  she waited patiently until mrs wragge had made an end of the meal and then went upstairs to her own room  monday she said as she sat down at her toilettable something may happen before monday comes  her fingers wandered mechanically among the brushes and combs the tiny bottles and cases placed on the table she set them in order now in one way and now in anotherthen on a sudden pushed them away from her in a heap for a minute or two her hands remained idle that interval passed they grew restless again and pulled the two little drawers backward and forward in their grooves among the objects laid in one of them was a prayerbook which had belonged to her at comberaven and which she had saved with her other relics of the past when she and her sister had taken their farewell of home she opened the prayerbook after a long hesitation at the marriage service shut it again before she had read a line and put it back hurriedly in one of the drawers after turning the key in the locks she rose and walked to the window the horrible sea she said turning from it with a shudder of disgustthe lonely dreary horrible sea  she went back to the drawer and took the prayerbook out for the second time half opened it again at the marriage service and impatiently threw it back into the drawer this time after turning the lock she took the key away walked with it in her hand to the open window and threw it violently from her into the garden it fell on a bed thickly planted with flowers it was invisible it was lost the sense of its loss seemed to relieve her  something may happen on friday something may happen on saturday something may happen on sunday three days still  she closed the green shutters outside the window and drew the curtains to darken the room still more her head felt heavy her eyes were burning hot she threw herself on her bed with a sullen impulse to sleep away the time the quiet of the house helped her the darkness of the room helped her the stupor of mind into which she had fallen had its effect on her senses she dropped into a broken sleep her restless hands moved incessantly her head tossed from side to side of the pillow but still she slept ere long words fell by ones and twos from her lips words whispered in her sleep growing more and more continuous more and more articulate the longer the sleep lastedwords which seemed to calm her restlessness and to hush her into deeper repose she smiled she was in the happy land of dreams franks name escaped her do you love me frank she whispered oh my darling say it again say it again  the time passed the room grew darker and still she slumbered and dreamed toward sunsetwithout any noise inside the house or out to account for itshe started up on the bed awake again in an instant the drowsy obscurity of the room struck her with terror she ran to the window pushed open the shutters and leaned far out into the evening air and the evening light her eyes devoured the trivial sights on the beach her ears drank in the welcome murmur of the sea anything to deliver her from the waking impression which her dreams had left no more darkness no more repose sleep that came mercifully to others came treacherously to her sleep had only closed her eyes on the future to open them on the past  she went down again into the parlor eager to talkno matter how idly no matter on what trifles the room was empty perhaps mrs wragge had gone to her workperhaps she was too tired to talk magdalen took her hat from the table and went out the sea that she had shrunk from a few hours since looked friendly now how lovely it was in its cool evening blue what a godlike joy in the happy multitude of waves leaping up to the light of heaven  she stayed out until the night fell and the stars appeared the night steadied her  by slow degrees her mind recovered its balance and she looked her position unflinchingly in the face the vain hope that accident might defeat the very end for which of her own freewill she had ceaselessly plotted and toiled vanished and left her selfdissipated in its own weakness she knew the true alternative and faced it on one side was the revolting ordeal of the marriage on the other the abandonment of her purpose was it too late to choose between the sacrifice of the purpose and the sacrifice of herself yes too late the backward path had closed behind her time that no wish could change time that no prayers could recall had made her purpose a part of herself once she had governed it now it governed her the more she shrank the harder she struggled the more mercilessly it drove her on no other feeling in her was strong enough to master itnot even the horror that was maddening herthe horror of her marriage  toward nine oclock she went back to the house  walking again said mrs wragge meeting her at the door come in and sit down my dear how tired you must be  magdalen smiled and patted mrs wragge kindly on the shoulder  you forget how strong i am she said nothing hurts me  she lit her candle and went upstairs again into her room as she returned to the old place by her toilettable the vain hope in the three days of delay the vain hope of deliverance by accident came back to herthis time in a form more tangible than the form which it had hitherto worn  friday saturday sunday something may happen to him something may happen to me something serious something fatal one of us may die  a sudden change came over her face she shivered though there was no cold in the air she started though there was no noise to alarm her  one of us may die i may be the one  she fell into deep thought roused herself after a while and opening the door called to mrs wragge to come and speak to her  you were right in thinking i should fatigue myself she said my walk has been a little too much for me i feel tired and i am going to bed goodnight she kissed mrs wragge and softly closed the door again  after a few turns backward and forward in the room she abruptly opened her writingcase and began a letter to her sister the letter grew and grew under her hands she filled sheet after sheet of notepaper her heart was full of her subject it was her own story addressed to norah she shed no tears she was composed to a quiet sadness her pen ran smoothly on after writing for more than two hours she left off while the letter was still unfinished there was no signature attached to itthere was a blank space reserved to be filled up at some other time after putting away the case with the sheets of writing secured inside it she walked to the window for air and stood there looking out  the moon was waning over the sea the breeze of the earlier hours had died out on earth and ocean the spirit of the night brooded in a deep and awful calm  her head drooped low on her bosom and all the view waned before her eyes with the waning moon she saw no sea no sky death the tempter was busy at her heart death the tempter pointed homeward to the grave of her dead parents in comberaven churchyard  nineteen last birthday she thought only nineteen she moved away from the window hesitated and then looked out again at the view the beautiful night she said gratefully oh the beautiful night  she left the window and lay down on her bed sleep that had come treacherously before came mercifully now came deep and dreamless the image of her last waking thoughtthe image of death  early the next morning mrs wragge went into magdalens room and found that she had risen betimes she was sitting before the glass drawing the comb slowly through and through her hairthoughtful and quiet  how do you feel this morning my dear asked mrs wragge quite well again  yes  after replying in the affirmative she stopped considered for a moment and suddenly contradicted herself  no she said not quite well i am suffering a little from toothache  as she altered her first answer in those words she gave a twist to her hair with the comb so that it fell forward and hid her face  at breakfast she was very silent and she took nothing but a cup of tea  let me go to the chemists and get something said mrs wragge  no thank you  do let me  no  she refused for the second time sharply and angrily as usual mrs wragge submitted and let her have her own way when breakfast was over she rose without a word of explanation and went out mrs wragge watched her from the window and saw that she took the direction of the chemists shop  on reaching the chemists door she stoppedpaused before entering the shop and looked in at the windowhesitated and walked away a littlehesitated again and took the first turning which led back to the beach  without looking about her without caring what place she chose she seated herself on the shingle the only persons who were near to her in the position she now occupied were a nursemaid and two little boys the youngest of the two had a tiny toyship in his hand after looking at magdalen for a little while with the quaintest gravity and attention the boy suddenly approached her and opened the way to an acquaintance by putting his toy composedly on her lap  look at my ship said the child crossing his hands on magdalens knee  she was not usually patient with children in happier days she would not have met the boys advance toward her as she met it now the hard despair in her eyes left them suddenly her fastclosed lips parted and trembled she put the ship back into the childs hands and lifted him on her lap  will you give me a kiss she said faintly the boy looked at his ship as if he would rather have kissed the ship  she repeated the questionrepeated it almost humbly the child put his hand up to her neck and kissed her  if i was your sister would you love me all the misery of her friendless position all the wasted tenderness of her heart poured from her in those words  would you love me she repeated hiding her face on the bosom of the childs frock  yes said the boy look at my ship  she looked at the ship through her gathering tears  what do you call it she asked trying ha rd to find her way even to the interest of a child  i call it uncle kirkes ship said the boy uncle kirke has gone away  the name recalled nothing to her memory no remembrances but old remembrances lived in her now gone she repeated absently thinking what she should say to her little friend next  yes said the boy gone to china  even from the lips of a child that word struck her to the heart she put kirkes little nephew off her lap and instantly left the beach  as she turned back to the house the struggle of the past night renewed itself in her mind but the sense of relief which the child had brought to her the reviving tenderness which she had felt while he sat on her knee influenced her still she was conscious of a dawning hope opening freshly on her thoughts as the boys innocent eyes had opened on her face when he came to her on the beach was it too late to turn back once more she asked herself that question and now for the first time she asked it in doubt  she ran up to her own room with a lurking distrust in her changed self which warned her to act and not to think without waiting to remove her shawl or to take off her hat she opened her writingcase and addressed these lines to captain wragge as fast as her pen could trace them  you will find the money i promised you inclosed in this my resolution has failed me the horror of marrying him is more than i can face i have left aldborough pity my weakness and forget me let us never meet again  with throbbing heart with eager trembling fingers she drew her little white silk bag from her bosom and took out the banknotes to inclose them in the letter her hand searched impetuously her hand had lost its discrimination of touch she grasped the whole contents of the bag in one handful of papers and drew them out violently tearing some and disarranging the folds of others as she threw them down before her on the table the first object that met her eye was her own handwriting faded already with time she looked closer and saw the words she had copied from her dead fathers lettersaw the lawyers brief and terrible commentary on them confronting her at the bottom of the page  mr vanstones daughters are nobodys children and the law leaves them helpless at their uncles mercy  her throbbing heart stopped her trembling hands grew icily quiet all the past rose before her in mute overwhelming reproach she took up the lines which her own hand had written hardly a minute since and looked at the ink still wet on the letters with a vacant incredulity  the color that had risen on her cheeks faded from them once more the hard despair looked out again cold and glittering in her tearless eyes she folded the banknotes carefully and put them back in her bag she pressed the copy of her fathers letter to her lips and returned it to its place with the banknotes when the bag was in her bosom again she waited a little with her face hidden in her hands then deliberately tore up the lines addressed to captain wragge before the ink was dry the letter lay in fragments on the floor  no she said as the last morsel of the torn paper dropped from her hand on the way i go there is no turning back  she rose composedly and left the room while descending the stairs she met mrs wragge coming up going out again my dear asked mrs wragge may i go with you  magdalens attention wandered instead of answering the question she absently answered her own thoughts  thousands of women marry for money she said why shouldnt i  the helpless perplexity of mrs wragges face as she spoke those words roused her to a sense of present things my poor dear she said i puzzle you dont i never mind what i sayall girls talk nonsense and im no better than the rest of them come ill give you a treat you shall enjoy yourself while the captain is away we will have a long drive by ourselves put on your smart bonnet and come with me to the hotel ill tell the landlady to put a nice cold dinner into a basket you shall have all the things you like and ill wait on you when you are an old old woman you will remember me kindly wont you you will say she wasnt a bad girl hundreds worse than she was live and prosper and nobody blames them there there go and put your bonnet on oh my god what is my heart made of how it lives and lives when other girls hearts would have died in them long ago  in half an hour more she and mrs wragge were seated together in the carriage one of the horses was restive at starting flog him she cried angrily to the driver what are you frightened about flog him suppose the carriage was upset she said turning suddenly to her companion and suppose i was thrown out and killed on the spot nonsense dont look at me in that way im like your husband i have a dash of humor and im only joking  they were out the whole day when they reached home again it was after dark the long succession of hours passed in the fresh air left them both with the same sense of fatigue again that night magdalen slept the deep dreamless sleep of the night before and so the friday closed   her last thought at night had been the thought which had sustained her throughout the day she had laid her head on the pillow with the same reckless resolution to submit to the coming trial which had already expressed itself in words when she and mrs wragge met by accident on the stairs when she woke on the morning of saturday the resolution was gone the fridays thoughtsthe fridays events evenwere blotted out of her mind once again creeping chill through the flow of her young blood she felt the slow and deadly prompting of despair which had come to her in the waning moonlight which had whispered to her in the awful calm  i saw the end as the end must be she said to herself on thursday night i have been wrong ever since  when she and her companion met that morning she reiterated her complaint of suffering from the toothache she repeated her refusal to allow mrs wragge to procure a remedy she left the house after breakfast in the direction of the chemists shop exactly as she had left it on the morning before  this time she entered the shop without an instants hesitation  i have got an attack of toothache she said abruptly to an elderly man who stood behind the counter  may i look at the tooth miss  there is no necessity to look it is a hollow tooth i think i have caught cold in it  the chemist recommended various remedies which were in vogue fifteen years since she declined purchasing any of them  i have always found laudanum relieve the pain better than anything else she said trifling with the bottles on the counter and looking at them while she spoke instead of looking at the chemist let me have some laudanum  certainly miss excuse my asking the questionit is only a matter of form you are staying at aldborough i think  yes i am miss bygrave of north shingles  the chemist bowed and turning to his shelves filled an ordinary halfounce bottle with laudanum immediately in ascertaining his customers name and address beforehand the owner of the shop had taken a precaution which was natural to a careful man but which was by no means universal under similar circumstances in the state of the law at that time  shall i put you up a little cotton wool with the laudanum he asked after he had placed a label on the bottle and had written a word on it in large letters  if you please what have you just written on the bottle she put the question sharply with something of distrust as well as curiosity in her manner  the chemist answered the question by turning the label toward her she saw written on it in large letterspoison  i like to be on the safe side miss said the old man smiling very worthy people in other respects are often sadly careless where poisons are concerned  she began trifling again with the bottles on the counter and put another question with an illconcealed anxiety to hear the answer  is there danger she asked in such a little drop of laudanum as that  there is death in it miss replied the chemist quietly  death to a child or to a person in delicate health  death to the strongest man in england let him be who he may  with that answer the chemist sealed up the bottle in its wrapping of white paper and handed the laudanum to magdalen across the counter she laughed as she took it from him and paid for it  there will be no fear of accidents at north shingles she said i shall keep the bottle locked up in my dressingcase if it doesnt relieve the pain i must come to you again and try some other remedy goodmorning  goodmorning miss  she went straight back to the house without once looking up without noticing any one who passed her she brushed by mrs wragge in the passage as she might have brushed by a piece of furniture she ascended the stairs and caught her foot twice in her dress from sheer inattention to the common precaution of holding it up the trivial daily interests of life had lost their hold on her already  in the privacy of her own room she took the bottle from its wrapping and threw the paper and the cotton wool into the fireplace at the moment when she did this there was a knock at the door she hid the little bottle and looked up impatiently mrs wragge came into the room  have you got something for your toothache my dear  yes  can i do anything to help you  no  mrs wragge still lingered uneasily near the door her manner showed plainly that she had something more to say  what is it asked magdalen sharply  dont be angry said mrs wragge im not settled in my mind about the captain hes a great writer and he hasnt written hes as quick as lightning and he hasnt come back heres saturday and no signs of him has he run away do you think has anything happened to him  i should think not go downstairs ill come and speak to you about it directly  as soon as she was alone again magdalen rose from her chair advanced toward a cupboard in the room which locked and paused for a moment with her hand on the key in doubt mrs wragges appearance had disturbed the whole current of her thoughts mrs wragges last question trifling as it was had checked her on the verge of the precipicehad roused the old vain hope in her once more of release by accident  why not she said why may something not have happened to one of them  she placed the laudanum in the cupboard locked it and put the key in her packet time enough still she thought before monday ill wait till the captain comes back  after some consultation downstairs it was agreed that the servant should sit up that night in expectation of her masters return the day passed quietly without events of any kind magdalen dreamed away the hours over a book a weary patience of expectation was all she felt nowthe poignant torment of thought was dulled and blunted at last she passed the day and the evening in the parlor vaguely conscious of a strange feeling of aversion to going back to her own room as the night advanced as the noises ceased indoors and out her restlessness began to return she endeavored to quiet herself by reading books failed to fix her attention the newspaper was lying in a corner of the room she tried the newspaper next  she looked mechanically at the headings of the articles she listlessly turned over page after page until her wandering attention was arrested by the narrative of an execution in a distant part of england there was nothing to strike her in the story of the crime and yet she read it it was a common horribly common act of bloodshedthe murder of a woman in farmservice by a man in the same employment who was jealous of her he had been convicted on no extraordinary evidence he had been hanged under no unusual circumstances he had made his confession when he knew there was no hope for him like other criminals of his class and the newspaper had printed it at the end of the article in these terms  i kept company with the deceased for a year or thereabouts i said i would marry her when i had money enough she said i had money enough now we had a quarrel she refused to walk out with me any more she wouldnt draw me my beer she took up with my fellowservant david crouch i went to her on the saturday and said i would marry her as soon as we could be asked in church if she would give up crouch she laughed at me she turned me out of the washhouse and the rest of them saw her turn me out i was not easy in my mind i went and sat on the gatethe gate in the meadow they call pettits piece i thought i would shoot her i went and fetched my gun and loaded it i went out into pettits piece again i was hard put to it to make up my mind i thought i would try my lucki mean try whether to kill her or notby throwing up the spud of the plow into the air i said to myself if it falls flat ill spare her if it falls point in the earth ill kill her i took a good swing with it and shied it up it fell point in the earth i went and shot her it was a bad job but i did it i did it as they said i did it at the trial i hope the lord will have mercy on me i wish my mother to have my old clothes i have no more to say  in the happier days of her life magdalen would have passed over the narrative of the execution and the printed confession which accompanied it unread the subject would have failed to attract her she read the horrible story nowread it with an interest unintelligible to herself her attention which had wandered over higher and better things followed every sentence of the murderers hideously direct confession from beginning to end if the man or the woman had been known to her if the place had been familiar to her memory she could hardly have followed the narrative more closely or have felt a more distinct impression of it left on her mind she laid down the paper wondering at herself she took it up once more and tried to read some other portion of the contents the effort was useless her attention wandered again she threw the paper away and went out into the garden the night was dark the stars were few and faint she could just see the gravelwalkshe could just pace backward and forward between the house door and the gate  the confession in the newspaper had taken a fearful hold on her mind as she paced the walk the black night opened over the sea and showed her the murderer in the field hurling the spud of the plow into the air she ran shuddering back to the house the murderer followed her into the parlor she seized the candle and went up into her room the vision of her own distempered fancy followed her to the place where the laudanum was hidden and vanished there  it was midnight and there was no sign yet of the captains return  she took from the writingcase the long letter which she had written to norah and slowly read it through the letter quieted her when she reached the blank space left at the end she hurriedly turned back and began it over again  one oclock struck from the church clock and still the captain never appeared  she read the letter for the second time she turned back obstinately despairingly and began it for the third time as she once more reached the last page she looked at her watch it was a quarter to two she had just put the watch back in the belt of her dress when there came to herfar off in the stillness of the morninga sound of wheels  she dropped the letter and clasped her cold hands in her lap and listened the sound came on faster and faster nearer and nearerthe trivial sound to all other ears the sound of doom to hers it passed the side of the house it traveled a little further on it stopped she heard a loud knockingthen the opening of a windowthen voicesthen a long silencethan the wheels again coming backthen the opening of the door below and the sound of the captains voice in the passage  she could endure it no longer she opened her door a little way and called to him  he ran upstairs instantly astonish ed that she was not in bed she spoke to him through the narrow opening of the door keeping herself hidden behind it for she was afraid to let him see her face  has anything gone wrong she asked  make your mind easy he answered nothing has gone wrong  is no accident likely to happen between this and monday  none whatever the marriage is a certainty  a certainty  yes  goodnight  she put her hand out through the door he took it with some little surprise it was not often in his experience that she gave him her hand of her own accord  you have sat up too long he said as he felt the clasp of her cold fingers i am afraid you will have a bad nightim afraid you will not sleep  she softly closed the door  i shall sleep she said sounder than you think for   it was past two oclock when she shut herself up alone in her room her chair stood in its customary place by the toilettable she sat down for a few minutes thoughtfully then opened her letter to norah and turned to the end where the blank space was left the last lines written above the space ran thus  i have laid my whole heart bare to you i have hidden nothing it has come to this the end i have toiled for at such terrible cost to myself is an end which i must reach or die it is wickedness madness what you willbut it is so there are now two journeys before me to choose between if i can marry himthe journey to the church if the profanation of myself is more than i can bearthe journey to the grave  under that last sentence she wrote these lines  my choice is made if the cruel law will let you lay me with my father and mother in the churchyard at home farewell my love be always innocent be always happy if frank ever asks about me say i died forgiving him dont grieve long for me norahi am not worth it  she sealed the letter and addressed it to her sister the tears gathered in her eyes as she laid it on the table she waited until her sight was clear again and then took the banknotes once more from the little bag in her bosom after wrapping them in a sheet of note paper she wrote captain wragges name on the inclosure and added these words below it lock the door of my room and leave me till my sister comes the money i promised you is in this you are not to blame it is my fault and mine only if you have any friendly remembrance of me be kind to your wife for my sake  after placing the inclosure by the letter to norah she rose and looked round the room some few little things in it were not in their places she set them in order and drew the curtains on either side at the head of her bed her own dress was the next object of her scrutiny it was all as neat as pure as prettily arranged as ever nothing about her was disordered but her hair some tresses had fallen loose on one side of her head she carefully put them back in their places with the help of her glass how pale i look she thought with a faint smile shall i be paler still when they find me in the morning  she went straight to the place where the laudanum was hidden and took it out the bottle was so small that it lay easily in the palm of her hand she let it remain there for a little while and stood looking at it  death she said in this drop of brown drinkdeath  as the words passed her lips an agony of unutterable horror seized on her in an instant she crossed the room unsteadily with a maddening confusion in her head with a suffocating anguish at her heart she caught at the table to support herself the faint clink of the bottle as it fell harmlessly from her loosened grasp and rolled against some porcelain object on the table struck through her brain like the stroke of a knife the sound of her own voice sunk to a whisperher voice only uttering that one word deathrushed in her ears like the rushing of a wind she dragged herself to the bedside and rested her head against it sitting on the floor oh my life my life she thought what is my life worth that i cling to it like this  an interval passed and she felt her strength returning she raised herself on her knees and hid her face on the bed she tried to prayto pray to be forgiven for seeking the refuge of death frantic words burst from her lipswords which would have risen to cries if she had not stifled them in the bedclothes she started to her feet despair strengthened her with a headlong fury against herself in one moment she was back at the table in another the poison was once more in her hand  she removed the cork and lifted the bottle to her mouth  at the first cold touch of the glass on her lips her strong young life leaped up in her leaping blood and fought with the whole frenzy of its loathing against the close terror of death every active power in the exuberant vital force that was in her rose in revolt against the destruction which her own will would fain have wreaked on her own life she paused for the second time she paused in spite of herself there in the glorious perfection of her youth and healththere trembling on the verge of human existence she stood with the kiss of the destroyer close at her lips and nature faithful to its sacred trust fighting for the salvation of her to the last  no word passed her lips her cheeks flushed deep her breath came thick and fast with the poison still in her hand with the sense that she might faint in another moment she made for the window and threw back the curtain that covered it  the new day had risen the broad gray dawn flowed in on her over the quiet eastern sea  she saw the waters heaving large and silent in the misty calm she felt the fresh breath of the morning flutter cool on her face her strength returned her mind cleared a little at the sight of the sea her memory recalled the walk in the garden overnight and the picture which her distempered fancy had painted on the black void in thought she saw the picture againthe murderer hurling the spud of the plow into the air and setting the life or death of the woman who had deserted him on the hazard of the falling point the infection of that terrible superstition seized on her mind as suddenly as the new day had burst on her view the premise of release which she saw in it from the horror of her own hesitation roused the last energies of her despair she resolved to end the struggle by setting her life or death on the hazard of a chance  on what chance  the sea showed it to her dimly distinguishable through the mist she saw a little fleet of coastingvessels slowly drifting toward the house all following the same direction with the favoring set of the tide in half an hourperhaps in lessthe fleet would have passed her window the hands of her watch pointed to four oclock she seated herself close at the side of the window with her back toward the quarter from which the vessels were drifting down on herwith the poison placed on the windowsill and the watch on her lap for one halfhour to come she determined to wait there and count the vessels as they went by if in that time an even number passed her the sign given should be a sign to live if the uneven number prevailed the end should be death  with that final resolution she rested her head against the window and waited for the ships to pass  the first came high dark and near in the mist gliding silently over the silent sea an intervaland the second followed with the third close after it another interval longer and longer drawn outand nothing passed she looked at her watch twelve minutes and three ships three  the fourth came slower than the rest larger than the rest further off in the mist than the rest the interval followed a long interval once more then the next vessel passed darkest and nearest of all five the next uneven number  five  she looked at her watch again nineteen minutes and five ships twenty minutes twentyone two threeand no sixth vessel twentyfour and the sixth came by twentyfive twentysix twentyseven twentyeight and the next uneven numberthe fatal sevenglided into view two minutes to the end of the halfhour and seven ships  twentynine and nothing followed in the wake of the seventh ship the minutehand of the watch moved on halfway to thirty and still the white heaving sea was a misty blank without moving her head from the window she took the poison in one hand and raised the watch in the other as the quick seconds counted each other out her eyes as quick as they looked from the watch to the sea from the sea to the watchlooked for the last time at the seaand saw the eighth ship  she never moved she never spoke the death of thought the death of feeling seemed to have come to her already she put back the poison mechanically on the ledge of the window and watched as in a dream the ship gliding smoothly on its silent waygliding till it melted dimly into shadowgliding till it was lost in the mist  the strain on her mind relaxed when the messenger of life had passed from her sight  providence she whispered faintly to herself or chance  her eyes closed and her head fell back when the sense of life returned to her the morning sun was warm on her facethe blue heaven looked down on herand the sea was a sea of gold  she fell on her knees at the window and burst into tears        toward noon that day the captain waiting below stairs and hearing no movement in magdalens room felt uneasy at the long silence he desired the new maid to follow him upstairs and pointing to the door told her to go in softly and see whether her mistress was awake  the maid entered the room remained there a moment and came out again closing the door gently  she looks beautiful sir said the girl and shes sleeping as quietly as a newborn child    chapter xiv  the morning of her husbands return to north shingles was a morning memorable forever in the domestic calendar of mrs wragge she dated from that occasion the first announcement which reached her of magdalens marriage  it had been mrs wragges earthly lot to pass her life in a state of perpetual surprise never yet however had she wandered in such a maze of astonishment as the maze in which she lost herself when the captain coolly told her the truth she had been sharp enough to suspect mr noel vanstone of coming to the house in the character of a sweetheart on approval and she had dimly interpreted certain expressions of impatience which had fallen from magdalens lips as boding ill for the success of his suit but her utmost penetration had never reached as far as a suspicion of the impending marriage she rose from one climax of amazement to another as her husband proceeded with his disclosure a wedding in the family at a days notice and that wedding magdalens and not a single new dress ordered for anybody the bride included and the oriental cashmere robe totally unavailable on the occasion when she might have worn it to the greatest advantage mrs wragge dropped crookedly into a chair and beat her disorderly hands on her unsymmetrical knees in utter forgetfulness of the captains presence and the captains terrible eye it would not have surprised her to hear that the world had come to an end and that the only mortal whom destiny had overlooked in winding up the affairs of this earthly planet was herself  leaving his wife to recover her composure by her own unaided efforts captain wragge withdrew to wait for magdalens appearance in the lower regions of the house it was close on one oclock before the sound of footsteps in the room above warned him that she was awake and stirring he called at once for the maid whose name he had ascertained to be louisa and sent her upstairs to her mistress for the second time  magdalen was standing by her dressingtable when a faint tap at the door suddenly roused her the tap was followed by the sound of a meek voice which announced itself as the voice of her maid and inquired if miss bygrave needed any assistance that morning  not at present said magdalen as soon as she had recovered the surprise of finding herself unexpectedly provided with an attendant i will ring when i want you  after dismissing the woman with that answer she accidentally looked from the door to the window any speculations on the subject of the new servant in which she might otherwise have engaged were instantly suspended by the sight of the bottle of laudanum still standing on the ledge of the window where she had left it at sunrise she took it once more in her hand with a strange confusion of feelingwith a vague doubt even yet whether the sight of it reminded her of a terrible reality or a terrible dream her first impulse was to rid herself of it on the spot she raised the bottle to throw the contents out of the window and paused in sudden distrust of the impulse that had come to her i have accepted my new life she thought how do i know what that life may have in store for me she turned from the window and went back to the table i may be forced to drink it yet she said and put the laudanum into her dressingcase  her mind was not at ease when she had done this there seemed to be some indefinable ingratitude in the act still she made no attempt to remove the bottle from its hidingplace she hurried on her toilet she hastened the time when she could ring for the maid and forget herself and her waking thoughts in a new subject after touching the bell she took from the table her letter to norah and her letter to the captain put them both into her dressingcase with the laudanum and locked it securely with the key which she kept attached to her watchchain  magdalens first impression of her attendant was not an agreeable one she could not investigate the girl with the experienced eye of the landlady at the london hotel who had characterized the stranger as a young person overtaken by misfortune and who had showed plainly by her look and manner of what nature she suspected that misfortune to be but with this drawback magdalen was perfectly competent to detect the tokens of sickness and sorrow lurking under the surface of the new maids activity and politeness she suspected the girl was illtempered she disliked her name and she was indisposed to welcome any servant who had been engaged by noel vanstone but after the first few minutes louisa grew on her liking she answered all the questions put to her with perfect directness she appeared to understand her duties thoroughly and she never spoke until she was spoken to first after making all the inquiries that occurred to her at the time and after determining to give the maid a fair trial magdalen rose to leave the room the very air in it was still heavy to her with the oppression of the past night  have you anything more to say to me she asked turning to the servant with her hand on the door  i beg your pardon miss said louisa very respectfully and very quietly i think my master told me that the marriage was to be tomorrow  magdalen repressed the shudder that stole over her at that reference to the marriage on the lips of a stranger and answered in the affirmative  its a very short time miss to prepare in if you would be so kind as to give me my orders about the packing before you go downstairs  there are no such preparations to make as you suppose said magdalen hastily the few things i have here can be all packed at once if you like i shall wear the same dress tomorrow which i have on today leave out the straw bonnet and the light shawl and put everything else into my boxes i have no new dresses to pack i have nothing ordered for the occasion of any sort she tried to add some commonplace phrases of explanation accounting as probably as might be for the absence of the usual wedding outfit and weddingdress but no further reference to the marriage would pass her lips and without an other word she abruptly left the room  the meek and melancholy louisa stood lost in astonishment something wrong here she thought im half afraid of my new place already she sighed resignedly shook her head and went to the wardrobe she first examined the drawers underneath took out the various articles of linen laid inside and placed them on chairs opening the upper part of the wardrobe next she ranged the dresses in it side by side on the bed her last proceeding was to push the empty boxes into the middle of the room and to compare the space at her disposal with the articles of dress which she had to pack she completed her preliminary calculations with the ready selfreliance of a woman who thoroughly understood her business and began the packing forthwith just as she had placed the first article of linen in the smaller box the door of the room opened and the houseservant eager for gossip came in  what do you want asked louisa quietly  did you ever hear of anything like this said the houseservant entering on her subject immediately  like what  like this marriage to be sure youre london bred they tell me did you ever hear of a young lady being married without a single new thing to her back no wedding veil and no wedding breakfast and no wedding favors for the servants its flying in the face of providencethats what i say im only a poor servant i know but its wicked downright wickedand i dont care who hears me  louisa went on with the packing  look at her dresses persisted the houseservant waving her hand indignantly at the bed im only a poor girl but i wouldnt marry the best man alive without a new gown to my back look here look at this dowdy brown thing here alpaca youre not going to pack this alpaca thing are you why its hardly fit for a servant i dont know that id take a gift of it if it was offered me it would do for me if i took it up in the skirt and let it out in the waistand it wouldnt look so bad with a bit of bright trimming would it  let that dress alone if you please said louisa as quietly as ever  what did you say inquired the other doubting whether her ears had not deceived her  i said let that dress alone it belongs to my mistress and i have my mistresss orders to pack up everything in the room you are not helping me by coming hereyou are very much in my way  well said the houseservant you may be london bred as they say but if these are your london manners give me suffolk she opened the door with an angry snatch at the handle shut it violently opened it again and looked in give me suffolk said the houseservant with a parting nod of her head to point the edge of her sarcasm  louisa proceeded impenetrably with her packing up  having neatly disposed of the linen in the smaller box she turned her attention to the dresses next after passing them carefully in review to ascertain which was the least valuable of the collection and to place that one at the bottom of the trunk for the rest to lie on she made her choice with very little difficulty the first gown which she put into the box wasthe brown alpaca dress  meanwhile magdalen had joined the captain downstairs although he could not fail to notice the languor in her face and the listlessness of all her movements he was relieved to find that she met him with perfect composure she was even selfpossessed enough to ask him for news of his journey with no other signs of agitation than a passing change of color and a little trembling of the lips  so much for the past said captain wragge when his narrative of the expedition to london by way of st crux had come to an end now for the present the bridegroom  if it makes no difference she interposed call him mr noel vanstone  with all my heart mr noel vanstone is coming here this afternoon to dine and spend the evening he will be tiresome in the last degree but like all tiresome people he is not to be got rid of on any terms before he comes i have a last word or two of caution for your private ear by this time tomorrow we shall have partedwithout any certain knowledge on either side of our ever meeting again i am anxious to serve your interests faithfully to the last i am anxious you should feel that i have done all i could for your future security when we say goodby  magdalen looked at him in surprise he spoke in altered tones he was agitated he was strangely in earnest something in his look and manner took her memory back to the first night at aldborough when she had opened her mind to him in the darkening solitudewhen they two had sat together alone on the slope of the martello tower i have no reason to think otherwise than kindly of you she said  captain wragge suddenly left his chair and took a turn backward and forward in the room magdalens last words seemed to have produced some extraordinary disturbance in him  damn it he broke out i cant let you say that you have reason to think ill of me i have cheated you you never got your fair share of profit from the entertainment from first to last there now the murders out  magdalen smiled and signed to him to come back to his chair  i know you cheated me she said quietly you were in the exercise of your profession captain wragge i expected it when i joined you i made no complaint at the time and i make none now if the money you took is any recompense for all the trouble i have given you you are heartily welcome to it  will you shake hands on that asked the captain with an awkwardness and hesitation strongly at variance with his customary ease of manner  magdalen gave him her hand he wrung it hard you are a strange girl he said trying to speak lightly you have laid a hold on me that i dont quite understand im half uncomfortable at taking the money from you now and yet you dont want it do you he hesitated i almost wish he said i had never met you on the walls of york  it is too late to wish that captain wragge say no more you only distress mesay no more we have other subjects to talk about what were those words of caution which you had for my private ear  the captain took another turn in the room and struggled back again into his everyday character he produced from his pocketbook mrs lecounts letter to her master and handed it to magdalen  there is the letter that might have ruined us if it had ever reached its address he said read it carefully i have a question to ask you when you have done  magdalen read the letter what is this proof she inquired which mrs lecount relies on so confidently  the very question i was going to ask you said captain wragge consult your memory of what happened when you tried that experiment in vauxhall walk did mrs lecount get no other chance against you than the chances you have told me of already  she discovered that my face was disguised and she heard me speak in my own voice  and nothing more  nothing more  very good then my interpretation of the letter is clearly the right one the proof mrs lecount relies on is my wifes infernal ghost storywhich is in plain english the story of miss bygrave having been seen in miss vanstones disguise the witness being the very person who is afterward presented at aldborough in the character of miss bygraves aunt an excellent chance for mrs lecount if she can only lay her hand at the right time on mrs wragge and no chance at all if she cant make your mind easy on that point mrs lecount and my wife have seen the last of each other in the meantime dont neglect the warning i give you in giving you this letter tear it up for fear of accidents but dont forget it  trust me to remember it replied magdalen destroying the letter while she spoke have you anything more to tell me  i have some information to give you said captain wragge which may be useful because it relates to your future security mind i want to know nothing about your proceedings when tomorrow is over we settled that when we first discussed this matter i ask no questions and i make no guesses all i want to do now is to warn you of your legal position after your marriage and to leave you to make what use you please of your knowledge at your own sole discretion i took a lawyers opinion on the point when i was in london thinking it might be useful to you  it is sure to be useful what did the lawyer say  to put it plainly this is what he said if mr noel vanstone ever discovers that you have knowingly married him under a false name he can apply to the ecclesiastical court to have his marriage declared null and void the issue of the application would rest with the judges but if he could prove that he had been intentionally deceived the legal opinion is that his case would be a strong one  suppose i chose to apply on my side said magdalen eagerly what then  you might make the application replied the captain but remember one thingyou would come into court with the acknowledgment of your own deception i leave you to imagine what the judges would think of that  did the lawyer tell you anything else  one thing besides said captain wragge whatever the law might do with the marriage in the lifetime of both the parties to iton the death of either one of them no application made by the survivor would avail and as to the case of that survivor the marriage would remain valid you understand if he dies or if you dieand if no application has been made to the courthe the survivor or you the survivor would have no power of disputing the marriage but in the lifetime of both of you if he claimed to have the marriage dissolved the chances are all in favor of his carrying his point  he looked at magdalen with a furtive curiosity as he said those words she turned her head aside absently tying her watchchain into a loop and untying it again evidently thinking with the closest attention over what he had last said to her captain wragge walked uneasily to the window and looked out the first object that caught his eye was mr noel vanstone approaching from sea view he returned instantly to his former place in the room and addressed himself to magdalen once more  here is mr noel vanstone he said one last caution before he comes in be on your guard with him about your age he put the question to me before he got the license i took the shortest way out of the difficulty and told him you were twentyone and he made the declaration accordingly never mind about me after tomorrow i am invisible but in your own interests dont forget if the subject turns up that you were of age when you were married there is nothing more you are provided with every necessary warning that i can give you whatever happens in the future remember i have done my best  he hurried to the door without waiting for an answer and went out into the garden to receive his guest  noel vanstone made his appearance at the gate solemnly carrying his bridal offering to north shingles with both hands the object in question was an ancient casket one of his fathers bargains inside the casket reposed an oldfashioned carbuncle brooch set in silver another of his fathers bargainsbridal presents both possessing the inestimable merit of leaving his money undisturbed in his pocket he shook his head portentously when the captain inquired after his health and spirits he had passed a wakeful night ungovernable apprehensions of lecounts sudden reappearance had beset him as soon as he found himself alone at sea view sea view was redolent of lecount sea view though built on piles and the strongest house in england was henceforth odious to him he had felt this all night he had also felt his responsibilities there was the ladys maid to begin with now he had hired her he began to think she wouldnt do she might fall sick on his hands she might have deceived him by a false character she and the landlady of the hotel might have been in league together horrible really horrible to think of then there was the other responsibilityperhaps the heavier of the twothe responsibility of deciding where he was to go and spend his honeymoon tomorrow he would have preferred one of his fathers empty houses but except at vauxhall walk which he supposed would be objected to and at aldborough which was of course out of the question all the houses were let he would put himself in mr bygraves hands where had mr bygrave spent his own honeymoon given the british islands to choose from where would mr bygrave pitch his tent on a careful review of all the circumstances  at this point the bridegrooms questions suddenly came to an end and the bridegrooms face exhibited an expression of ungovernable astonishment his judicious friend whose advice had been at his disposal in every other emergency suddenly turned round on him in the emergency of the honeymoon and flatly declined discussing the subject  no said the captain as noel vanstone opened his lips to plead for a hearing you must really excuse me my point of view in this matter is as usual a peculiar one for some time past i have been living in an atmosphere of deception to suit your convenience that atmosphere my good sir is getting close my moral being requires ventilation settle the choice of a locality with my niece and leave me at my particular request in total ignorance of the subject mrs lecount is certain to come here on her return from zurich and is certain to ask me where you are gone you may think it strange mr vanstone but when i tell her i dont know i wish to enjoy the unaccustomed luxury of feeling for once in a way that i am speaking the truth  with those words he opened the sittingroom door introduced noel vanstone to magdalens presence bowed himself out of the room again and set forth alone to while away the rest of the afternoon by taking a walk his face showed plain tokens of anxiety and his partycolored eyes looked hither and thither distrustfully as he sauntered along the shore the time hangs heavy on our hands thought the captain i wish tomorrow was come and gone   the day passed and nothing happened the evening and the night followed placidly and uneventfully monday came a cloudless lovely day monday confirmed the captains assertion that the marriage was a certainty toward ten oclock the clerk ascending the church steps quoted the old proverb to the pewopener meeting him under the porch happy the bride on whom the sun shines  in a quarter of an hour more the weddingparty was in the vestry and the clergyman led the way to the altar carefully as the secret of the marriage had been kept the opening of the church in the morning had been enough to betray it a small congregation almost entirely composed of women were scattered here and there among the pews kirkes sister and her children were staying with a friend at aldborough and kirkes sister was one of the congregation  as the weddingparty entered the church the haunting terror of mrs lecount spread from noel vanstone to the captain for the first few minutes the eyes of both of them looked among the women in the pews with the same searching scrutiny and looked away again with the same sense of relief the clergyman noticed that look and investigated the license more closely than usual the clerk began to doubt privately whether the old proverb about the bride was a proverb to be always depended on the female members of the congregation murmured among themselves at the inexcusable disregard of appearances implied in the brides dress kirkes sister whispered venomously in her friends ear thank god for today for roberts sake mrs wragge cried silently with the dread of some threatening calamity she knew not what the one person present who remained outwardly undisturbed was magdalen herself she stood with tearless resignation in her place before the altarstood as if all the sources of human emotion were frozen up within her  the clergyman opened the book        it was done the awful words which speak from earth to heaven were pronounced the children of the two dead brothersinheritors of the implacable enmity which had parted their parentswere man and wife  from that moment events hurried with a headlong rapidity to the parting scene they were back at the house while the words of the marriage service seemed still ringing in their ears before they had been five minutes indoors the carriage drew up at the garden gate in a minute more the opportunity came for which magdalen and the captain had been on the watchthe opportunity of speaking together in private for the last time she still preserved her icy resignation she seemed beyond all reach now of the fear that had once mastered her of the remorse that had once tortured her soul with a firm hand she gave him the promised money with a firm face she looked her last at him im not to blame he whispered eagerly i have only done what you asked me she bowed her head she bent it toward him kindly and let him touch her forehead with his lips take care he said my last words arefor gods sake take care when im gone she turned from him with a smile and spoke her farewell words to his wife mrs wragge tried hard to face her loss bravelythe loss of the friend whose presence had fallen like light from heaven over the dim pathway of her life you have been very good to me my dear i thank you kindly i thank you with all my heart she could say no more she clung to magdalen in a passion of tears as her mother might have clung to her if her mother had lived to see that horrible day im frightened for you cried the poor creature in a wild wailing voice oh my darling im frightened for you magdalen desperately drew herself freekissed herand hurried out to the door the expression of that artless gratitude the cry of that guileless love shook her as nothing else had shaken her that day it was a refuge to get to the carriagea refuge though the man she had married stood there waiting for her at the door  mrs wragge tried to follow her into the garden but the captain had seen magdalens face as she ran out and he steadily held his wife back in the passage from that distance the last farewells were exchanged as long as the carriage was in sight magdalen looked back at them she waved her handkerchief as she turned the corner in a moment more the last thread which bound her to them was broken the familiar companionship of many months was a thing of the past already  captain wragge closed the house door on the idlers who were looking in from the parade he led his wife back into the sittingroom and spoke to her with a forbearance which she had never yet experienced from him  she has gone her way he said and in another hour we shall have gone ours cry your cry outi dont deny shes worth crying for  even theneven when the dread of magdalens future was at its darkest in his mindthe ruling habit of the mans life clung to him mechanically he unlocked his dispatchbox mechanically he opened his book of accounts and made the closing entrythe entry of his last transaction with magdalenin black and white by recd from miss vanstone wrote the captain with a gloomy brow two hundred pounds  you wont be angry with me said mrs wragge looking timidly at her husband through her tears i want a word of comfort captain oh do tell me when shall i see her again  the captain closed the book and answered in one inexorable word never   between eleven and twelve oclock that night mrs lecount drove into zurich  her brothers house when she stopped before it was shut up with some difficulty and delay the servant was aroused she held up her hands in speechless amazement when she opened the door and saw who the visitor was  is my brother alive asked mrs lecount entering the house  alive echoed the servant he has gone holidaymaking into the country to finish his recovery in the fine fresh air  the housekeeper staggered back against the wall of the passage the coachman and the servant put her into a chair her face was livid and her teeth chattered in her head  send for my brothers doctor she said as soon as she could speak  the doctor came she handed him a letter before he could say a word  did you write that letter  he looked it over rapidly and answered her without hesitation  certainly not  it is your handwriting  it is a forgery of my handwriting  she rose from the chair with a new strength in her  when does the return mail start for paris she asked  in half an hour  send instantly and take me a place in it  the servant hesitated the doctor protested she turned a deaf ear to them both  send she reiterated or i will go myself  they obeyed the servant went to take the place the doctor remained and held a conversation with mrs lecount when the halfhour had passed he helped her into her place in the mail and charged the conductor privately to take care of his passenger  she has traveled from england without stopping said the doctor and she is traveling back again without rest be careful of her or she will break down under the double journey  the mail started before the first hour of the new day was at an end mrs lecount was on her way back to england  the end of the fourth scene     between the scenes  progress of the story through the post  i  from george bartram to noel vanstone  st crux september 4th 1847  my dear noelhere are two plain questions at starting in the name of all that is mysterious what are you hiding for and why is everything relating to your marriage kept an impenetrable secret from your oldest friends  i have been to aldborough to try if i could trace you from that place and have come back as wise as i went i have applied to your lawyer in london and have been told in reply that you have forbidden him to disclose the place of your retreat to any one without first receiving your permission to do so all i could prevail on him to say was that he would forward any letter which might be sent to his care i write accordingly and mind this i expect an answer  you may ask in your illtempered way what business i have to meddle with affairs of yours which it is your pleasure to keep private my dear noel there is a serious reason for our opening communications with you from this house you dont know what events have taken place at st crux since you ran away to get married and though i detest writing letters i must lose an hours shooting today in trying to enlighten you  on the twentythird of last month the admiral and i were disturbed over our wine after dinner by the announcement that a visitor had unexpectedly arrived at st crux who do you think the visitor was mrs lecount  my uncle with that oldfashioned bachelor gallantry of his which pays equal respect to all wearers of petticoats left the table directly to welcome mrs lecount while i was debating whether i should follow him or not my meditations were suddenly brought to an end by a loud call from the admiral i ran into the morningroom and there was your unfortunate housekeeper on the sofa with all the women servants about her more dead than alive she had traveled from england to zurich and from zurich back again to england without stopping and she looked seriously and literally at deaths door i immediately agreed with my uncle that the first thing to be done was to send for medical help we dispatched a groom on the spot and at mrs lecounts own request sent all the servants in a body out of the room  as soon as we were alone mrs lecount surprised us by a singular question she asked if you had received a letter which she had addressed to you before leaving england at this house when we told her that the letter had been forwarded under cover to your friend mr bygrave by your own particular request she turned as pale as ashes and when we added that you had left us in company with this same mr bygrave she clasped her hands and stared at us as if she had taken leave of her senses her next question was where is mr noel now we could only give her one replymr noel had not informed us she looked perfectly thunderstruck at that answer he has gone to his ruin she said he has gone away in company with the greatest villain in england i must find him i tell you i must find mr noel if i dont find him at once it will be too late he will be married she burst out quite frantically on my honor and my oath he will be married the admiral incautiously perhaps but with the best intentions told her you were married already she gave a scream that made the windows ring again and dropped back on the sofa in a faintingfit the doctor came in the nick of time and soon brought her to but she was taken ill the same night she has grown worse and worse ever since and the last medical report is that the fever from which she has been suffering is in a fair way to settle on her brain  now my dear noel neither my uncle nor i have any wish to intrude ourselves on your confidence we are naturally astonished at the extraordinary mystery which hangs over you and your marriage and we cannot be blind to the fact that your housekeeper has apparently some strong reason of her own for viewing mrs noel vanstone with an enmity and distrust which we are quite ready to believe that lady has done nothing to deserve whatever strange misunderstanding there may have been in your household is your business if you choose to keep it to yourself and not ours all we have any right to do is to tell you what the doctor says his patient has been delirious he declines to answer for her life if she goes on as she is going on now and he thinksfinding that she is perpetually talking of her masterthat your presence would be useful in quieting her if you could come here at once and exert your influence before it is too late  what do you say will you emerge from the darkness that surrounds you and come to st crux if this was the case of an ordinary servant i could understand your hesitating to leave the delights of your honeymoon for any such object as is here proposed to you but my dear fellow mrs lecount is not an ordinary servant you are under obligations to her fidelity and attachment in your fathers time as well as in your own and if you can quiet the anxieties which seem to be driving this unfortunate woman mad i really think you ought to come here and do so your leaving mrs noel vanstone is of course out of the question there is no necessity for any such hardhearted proceeding the admiral desires me to remind you that he is your oldest friend living and that his house is at your wifes disposal as it has always been at yours in this great ramblingplace she need dread no near association with the sickroom and with all my uncles oddities i am sure she will not think the offer of his friendship an offer to be despised  have i told you already that i went to aldborough to try and find a clew to your whereabouts i cant be at the trouble of looking back to see so if i have told you i tell you again the truth is i made an acquaintance at aldborough of whom you know somethingat least by report  after applying vainly at sea view i went to the hotel to inquire about you the landlady could give me no information but the moment i mentioned your name she asked if i was related to you and when i told her i was your cousin she said there was a young lady then at the hotel whose name was vanstone also who was in great distress about a missing relative and who might prove of some use to meor i to herif we knew of each others errand at aldborough i had not the least idea who she was but i sent in my card at a venture and in five minutes afterward i found myself in the presence of one of the most charming women these eyes ever looked on  our first words of explanation informed me that my family name was known to her by repute who do you think she was the eldest daughter of my uncle and yoursandrew vanstone i had often heard my poor mother in past years speak of her brother andrew and i knew of that sad story at comberaven but our families as you are aware had always been estranged and i had never seen my charming cousin before she has the dark eyes and hair and the gentle retiring manners that i always admire in a woman i dont want to renew our old disagreement about your fathers conduct to those two sisters or to deny that his brother andrew may have behaved badly to him i am willing to admit that the high moral position he took in the matter is quite unassailable by such a miserable sinner as i am and i will not dispute that my own spendthrift habits incapacitate me from offering any opinion on the conduct of other peoples pecuniary affairs but with all these allowances and drawbacks i can tell you one thing noel if you ever see the elder miss vanstone i venture to prophesy that for the first time in your life you will doubt the propriety of following your fathers example  she told me her little story poor thing most simply and unaffectedly she is now occupying her second situation as a governessand as usual i who know everybody know the family they are friends of my uncles whom he has lost sight of latterlythe tyrrels of portland placeand they treat miss vanstone with as much kindness and consideration as if she was a member of the family one of their old servants accompanied her to aldborough her object in traveling to that place being what the landlady of the hotel had stated it to be the family reverses have it seems had a serious effect on miss vanstones younger sister who has left her friends and who has been missing from home for some time she had been last heard of at aldborough and her elder sister on her return from the continent with the tyrrels had instantly set out to make inquiries at that place  this was all miss vanstone told me she asked whether you had seen anything of her sister or whether mrs lecount knew anything of her sisteri suppose because she was aware you had been at aldborough of course i could tell her nothing she entered into no details on the subject and i could not presume to ask her for any all i did was to set to work with might and main to assist her inquiries the attempt was an utter failure nobody could give us any information we tried personal description of course and strange to say the only young lady formerly staying at aldborough who answered the description was of all the people in the world the lady you have married if she had not had an uncle and aunt both of whom have left the place i should have begun to suspect that you had married your cousin without knowing it is this the clew to the mystery dont be angry i must have my little joke and i cant help writing as carelessly as i talk the end of it was our inquiries were all baffled and i traveled back with miss vanstone and her attendant as far as our station here i think i shall call on the tyrrels when i am next in london i have certainly treated that family with the most inexcusable neglect  here i am at the end of my third sheet of notepaper i dont often take the pen in hand but when i do you will agree with me that i am in no hurry to lay it aside again treat the rest of my letter as you like but consider what i have told you about mrs lecount and remember that time is of consequence  ever yours  george bartram   ii  from norah vanstone to miss garth  portland place  my dear miss garthmore sorrow more disappointment i have just returned from aldborough without making any discovery magdalen is still lost to us  i cannot attribute this new overthrow of my hopes to any want of perseverance or penetration in making the necessary inquiries my inexperience in such matters was most kindly and unexpectedly assisted by mr george bartram by a strange coincidence he happened to be at aldborough inquiring after mr noel vanstone at the very time when i was there inquiring aft er magdalen he sent in his card and knowing when i looked at the name that he was my cousinif i may call him soi thought there would be no impropriety in my seeing him and asking his advice i abstained from entering into particulars for magdalens sake and i made no allusion to that letter of mrs lecounts which you answered for me i only told him magdalen was missing and had been last heard of at aldborough the kindness which he showed in devoting himself to my assistance exceeds all description he treated me in my forlorn situation with a delicacy and respect which i shall remember gratefully long after he has himself perhaps forgotten our meeting altogether he is quite youngnot more than thirty i should think in face and figure he reminded me a little of the portrait of my father at comberaveni mean the portrait in the diningroom of my father when he was a young man  useless as our inquiries were there is one result of them which has left a very strange and shocking impression on my mind  it appears that mr noel vanstone has lately married under mysterious circumstances a young lady whom he met with at aldborough named bygrave he has gone away with his wife telling nobody but his lawyer where he has gone to this i heard from mr george bartram who was endeavoring to trace him for the purpose of communicating the news of his housekeepers serious illnessthe housekeeper being the same mrs lecount whose letter you answered so far you may say there is nothing which need particularly interest either of us but i think you will be as much surprised as i was when i tell you that the description given by the people at aldborough of miss bygraves appearance is most startlingly and unaccountably like the description of magdalens appearance this discovery taken in connection with all the circumstances we know of has had an effect on my mind which i cannot describe to youwhich i dare not realize to myself pray come and see me i have never felt so wretched about magdalen as i feel now suspense must have weakened my nerves in some strange way i feel superstitious about the slightest things this accidental resemblance of a total stranger to magdalen fills me every now and then with the most horrible misgivingsmerely because mr noel vanstones name happens to be mixed up with it once more pray come to me i have so much to say to you that i cannot and dare not say in writing  gratefully and affectionately yours  norah   iii  from mr john loscombe solicitor to george bartram esq  lincolns inn london september 6th 1847  siri beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note inclosing a letter addressed to my client mr noel vanstone and requesting that i will forward the same to mr vanstones present address  since i last had the pleasure of communicating with you on this subject my position toward my client is entirely altered three days ago i received a letter from him which stated his intention of changing his place of residence on the next day then ensuing but which left me entirely in ignorance on the subject of the locality to which it was his intention to remove i have not heard from him since and as he had previously drawn on me for a larger sum of money than usual there would be no present necessity for his writing to me againassuming that it is his wish to keep his place of residence concealed from every one myself included  under these circumstances i think it right to return you your letter with the assurance that i will let you know if i happen to be again placed in a position to forward it to its destination  your obedient servant  john loscombe   iv  from norah vanstone to miss garth  portland place  my dear miss garthforget the letter i wrote to you yesterday and all the gloomy forebodings that it contains this mornings post has brought new life to me i have just received a letter addressed to me at your house and forwarded here in your absence from home yesterday by your sister can you guess who the writer ismagdalen  the letter is very short it seems to have been written in a hurry she says she has been dreaming of me for some nights past and the dreams have made her fear that her long silence has caused me more distress on her account than she is worth she writes therefore to assure me that she is safe and wellthat she hopes to see me before longand that she has something to tell me when we meet which will try my sisterly love for her as nothing has tried it yet the letter is not dated but the postmark is allonby which i have found on referring to the gazetteer to be a little seaside place in cumberland there is no hope of my being able to write back for magdalen expressly says that she is on the eve of departure from her present residence and that she is not at liberty to say where she is going to next or to leave instructions for forwarding any letters after her  in happier times i should have thought this letter very far from being a satisfactory one and i should have been seriously alarmed by that allusion to a future confidence on her part which will try my love for her as nothing has tried it yet but after all the suspense i have suffered the happiness of seeing her handwriting again seems to fill my heart and to keep all other feelings out of it i dont send you her letter because i know you are coming to me soon and i want to have the pleasure of seeing you read it  ever affectionately yours  norah  psmr george bartram called on mrs tyrrel today he insisted on being introduced to the children when he was gone mrs tyrrel laughed in her goodhumored way and said that his anxiety to see the children looked to her mind very much like an anxiety to see me you may imagine how my spirits are improved when i can occupy my pen in writing such nonsense as this   v  from mrs lecount to mr de bleriot general agent london  st crux october 23d 1847  dear siri have been long in thanking you for the kind letter which promises me your assistance in friendly remembrance of the commercial relations formerly existing between my brother and yourself the truth is i have overtaxed my strength on my recovery from a long and dangerous illness and for the last ten days i have been suffering under a relapse i am now better again and able to enter on the business which you so kindly offer to undertake for me  the person whose present place of abode it is of the utmost importance to me to discover is mr noel vanstone i have lived for many years past in this gentlemans service as housekeeper and not having received my formal dismissal i consider myself in his service still during my absence on the continent he was privately married at aldborough in suffolk on the eighteenth of august last he left aldborough the same day taking his wife with him to some place of retreat which was kept a secret from everybody except his lawyer mr loscombe of lincolns inn after a short time he again removed on the 4th of september without informing mr loscombe on this occasion of his new place of abode from that date to this the lawyer has remained or has pretended to remain in total ignorance of where he now is application has been made to mr loscombe under the circumstances to mention what that former place of residence was of which mr vanstone is known to have informed him mr loscombe has declined acceding to this request for want of formal permission to disclose his clients proceedings after leaving aldborough i have all these latter particulars from mr loscombes correspondentthe nephew of the gentleman who owns this house and whose charity has given me an asylum during the heavy affliction of my sickness under his own roof  i believe the reasons which have induced mr noel vanstone to keep himself and his wife in hiding are reasons which relate entirely to myself in the first p lace he is aware that the circumstances under which he has married are such as to give me the right of regarding him with a just indignation in the second place he knows that my faithful services rendered through a period of twenty years to his father and to himself forbid him in common decency to cast me out helpless on the world without a provision for the end of my life he is the meanest of living men and his wife is the vilest of living women as long as he can avoid fulfilling his obligations to me he will and his wifes encouragement may be trusted to fortify him in his ingratitude  my object in determining to find him out is briefly this his marriage has exposed him to consequences which a man of ten times his courage could not face without shrinking of those consequences he knows nothing his wife knows and keeps him in ignorance i know and can enlighten him his security from the danger that threatens him is in my hands alone and he shall pay the price of his rescue to the last farthing of the debt that justice claims for me as my dueno more and no less  i have now laid my mind before you as you told me without reserve you know why i want to find this man and what i mean to do when i find him i leave it to your sympathy for me to answer the serious question that remains how is the discovery to be made if a first trace of them can be found after their departure from aldborough i believe careful inquiry will suffice for the rest the personal appearance of the wife and the extraordinary contrast between her husband and herself are certain to be remarked and remembered by every stranger who sees them  when you favor me with your answer please address it to care of admiral bartram st cruxin themarsh near ossory essex your much obliged  virginie lecount   vi  from mr de bleriot to mrs lecount  darks buildings kingsland  october 25th 1847  private and confidential  dear madami hasten to reply to your favor of saturdays date circumstances have enabled me to forward your interests by consulting a friend of mine possessing great experience in the management of private inquiries of all sorts i have placed your case before him without mentioning names and i am happy to inform you that my views and his views of the proper course to take agree in every particular  both myself and friend then are of opinion that little or nothing can be done toward tracing the parties you mention until the place of their temporary residence after they left aldborough has been discovered first if this can be done the sooner it is done the better judging from your letter some weeks must have passed since the lawyer received his information that they had shifted their quarters as they are both remarkablelooking people the strangers who may have assisted them on their travels have probably not forgotten them yet nevertheless expedition is desirable  the question for you to consider is whether they may not possibly have communicated the address of which we stand in need to some other person besides the lawyer the husband may have written to members of his family or the wife may have written to members of her family both myself and friend are of opinion that the latter chance is the likelier of the two if you have any means of access in the direction of the wifes family we strongly recommend you to make use of them if not please supply us with the names of any of her near relations or intimate female friends whom you know and we will endeavor to get access for you  in any case we request you will at once favor us with the most exact personal description that can be written of both the parties we may require your assistance in this important particular at five minutes notice favor us therefore with the description by return of post in the meantime we will endeavor to ascertain on our side whether any information is to be privately obtained at mr loscombes office the lawyer himself is probably altogether beyond our reach but if any one of his clerks can be advantageously treated with on such terms as may not overtax your pecuniary resources accept my assurance that the opportunity shall be made the most of by dear madam your faithful servant  alfred de bleriot   vii  from mr pendril to norah vanstone  serle street october 27th 1847  my dear miss vanstonea lady named lecount formerly attached to mr noel vanstones service in the capacity of housekeeper has called at my office this morning and has asked me to furnish her with your address i have begged her to excuse my immediate compliance with her request and to favor me with a call tomorrow morning when i shall be prepared to meet her with a definite answer  my hesitation in this matter does not proceed from any distrust of mrs lecount personally for i know nothing whatever to her prejudice but in making her request to me she stated that the object of the desired interview was to speak to you privately on the subject of your sister forgive me for acknowledging that i determined to withhold the address as soon as i heard this you will make allowances for your old friend and your sincere wellwisher you will not take it amiss if i express my strong disapproval of your allowing yourself on any pretense whatever to be mixed up for the future with your sisters proceedings  i will not distress you by saying more than this but i feel too deep an interest in your welfare and too sincere an admiration of the patience with which you have borne all your trials to say less  if i cannot prevail on you to follow my advice you have only to say so and mrs lecount shall have your address tomorrow in this case which i cannot contemplate without the greatest unwillingness let me at least recommend you to stipulate that miss garth shall be present at the interview in any matter with which your sister is concerned you may want an old friends advice and an old friends protection against your own generous impulses if i could have helped you in this way i would but mrs lecount gave me indirectly to understand that the subject to be discussed was of too delicate a nature to permit of my presence whatever this objection may be really worth it cannot apply to miss garth who has brought you both up from childhood i say again therefore if you see mrs lecount see her in miss garths company  always most truly yours  william pendril   viii  from norah vanstone to mr pendril  portland place wednesday  dear mr pendrilpray dont think i am ungrateful for your kindness indeed indeed i am not but i must see mrs lecount you were not aware when you wrote to me that i had received a few lines from magdalennot telling me where she is but holding out the hope of our meeting before long perhaps mrs lecount may have something to say to me on this very subject even if it should not be so my sisterdo what she mayis still my sister i cant desert her i cant turn my back on any one who comes to me in her name you know dear mr pendril i have always been obstinate on this subject and you have always borne with me let me owe another obligation to you which i can never return and bear with me still  need i say that i willingly accept that part of your advice which refers to miss garth i have already written to beg that she will come here at four tomorrow afternoon when you see mrs lecount please inform her that miss garth will be with me and that she will find us both ready to receive her here tomorrow at four oclock gratefully yours  norah vanstone   ix  from mr de bleriot to mrs lecount  private  darks buildings october 28th  dear madamone of mr loscombes clerks has proved amenable to a small pecuniary consideration and has mentioned a circumstance which it may be of some importance to you to know  nearly a month since accident gave the clerk in question an opportunity of looking into one of the documents on his masters table which had attracted his attention from a slight peculiar ity in the form and color of the paper he had only time during mr loscombes momentary absence to satisfy his curiosity by looking at the beginning of the document and at the end at the beginning he saw the customary form used in making a will at the end he discovered the signature of mr noel vanstone with the names of two attesting witnesses and the date of which he is quite certainthe thirtieth of september last  before the clerk had time to make any further investigations his master returned sorted the papers on the table and carefully locked up the will in the strong box devoted to the custody of mr noel vanstones documents it has been ascertained that at the close of september mr loscombe was absent from the office if he was then employed in superintending the execution of his clients willwhich is quite possibleit follows clearly that he was in the secret of mr vanstones address after the removal of the 4th of september and if you can do nothing on your side it may be desirable to have the lawyer watched on ours in any case it is certainly ascertained that mr noel vanstone has made his will since his marriage i leave you to draw your own conclusions from that fact and remain in the hope of hearing from you shortly  your faithful servant  alfred de bleriot   x  from miss garth to mr pendril  portland place october 28th  my dear sirmrs lecount has just left us if it was not too late to wish i should wish from the bottom of my heart that norah had taken your advice and had refused to see her  i write in such distress of mind that i cannot hope to give you a clear and complete account of the interview i can only tell you briefly what mrs lecount has done and what our situation now is the rest must be left until i am more composed and until i can speak to you personally  you will remember my informing you of the letter which mrs lecount addressed to norah from aldborough and which i answered for her in her absence when mrs lecount made her appearance today her first words announced to us that she had come to renew the subject as well as i can remember it this is what she said addressing herself to norah  i wrote to you on the subject of your sister miss vanstone some little time since and miss garth was so good as to answer the letter what i feared at that time has come true your sister has defied all my efforts to check her she has disappeared in company with my master mr noel vanstone and she is now in a position of danger which may lead to her disgrace and ruin at a moments notice it is my interest to recover my master it is your interest to save your sister tell mefor time is precioushave you any news of her  norah answered as well as her terror and distress would allow her i have had a letter but there was no address on it  mrs lecount asked was there no postmark on the envelope  norah said yes allonby  allonby is better than nothing said mrs lecount allonby may help you to trace her where is allonby  norah told her it all passed in a minute i had been too much confused and startled to interfere before but i composed myself sufficiently to interfere now  you have entered into no particulars i said you have only frightened usyou have told us nothing  you shall hear the particulars maam said mrs lecount and you and miss vanstone shall judge for yourselves if i have frightened you without a cause  upon this she entered at once upon a long narrative which i cannoti might almost say which i dare notrepeat you will understand the horror we both felt when i tell you the end if mrs lecounts statement is to be relied on magdalen has carried her mad resolution of recovering her fathers fortune to the last and most desperate extremityshe has married michael vanstones son under a false name her husband is at this moment still persuaded that her maiden name was bygrave and that she is really the niece of a scoundrel who assisted her imposture and whom i recognize by the description of him to have been captain wragge  i spare you mrs lecounts cool avowal when she rose to leave us of her own mercenary motives in wishing to discover her master and to enlighten him i spare you the hints she dropped of magdalens purpose in contracting this infamous marriage the one aim and object of my letter is to implore you to assist me in quieting norahs anguish of mind the shock she has received at hearing this news of her sister is not the worst result of what has happened she has persuaded herself that the answers she innocently gave in her distress to mrs lecounts questions on the subject of her letterthe answers wrung from her under the sudden pressure of confusion and alarmmay be used to magdalens prejudice by the woman who purposely startled her into giving the information i can only prevent her from taking some desperate step on her sidesome step by which she may forfeit the friendship and protection of the excellent people with whom she is now livingby reminding her that if mrs lecount traces her master by means of the postmark on the letter we may trace magdalen at the same time and by the same means whatever objection you may personally feel to renewing the efforts for the rescue of this miserable girl which failed so lamentably at york i entreat you for norahs sake to take the same steps now which we took then send me the only assurance which will quiet herthe assurance under your own hand that the search on our side has begun if you will do this you may trust me when the time comes to stand between these two sisters and to defend norahs peace character and future prosperity at any price  most sincerely yours  harriet garth   xi  from mrs lecount to mr de bleriot  october 28th  dear siri have found the trace you wanted mrs noel vanstone has written to her sister the letter contains no address but the postmark is allonby in cumberland from allonby therefore the inquiries must begin you have already in your possession the personal description of both husband and wife i urgently recommend you not to lose one unnecessary moment if it is possible to send to cumberland immediately on receipt of this letter i beg you will do so  i have another word to say before i close my notea word about the discovery in mr loscombes office  it is no surprise to me to hear that mr noel vanstone has made his will since his marriage and i am at no loss to guess in whose favor the will is made if i succeed in finding my master let that person get the money if that person can a course to follow in this matter has presented itself to my mind since i received your letter but my ignorance of details of business and intricacies of law leaves me still uncertain whether my idea is capable of ready and certain execution i know no professional person whom i can trust in this delicate and dangerous business is your large experience in other matters large enough to help me in this i will call at your office tomorrow at two oclock for the purpose of consulting you on the subject it is of the greatest importance when i next see mr noel vanstone that he should find me thoroughly prepared beforehand in this matter of the will your much obliged servant  virginie lecount   xii  from mr pendril to miss garth  serle street october 29th  dear miss garthi have only a moment to assure you of the sorrow with which i have read your letter the circumstances under which you urge your request and the reasons you give for making it are sufficient to silence any objection i might otherwise feel to the course you propose a trustworthy person whom i have myself instructed will start for allonby today and as soon as i receive any news from him you shall hear of it by special messenger tell miss vanstone this and pray add the sincere expression of my sympathy and regard  faithfully yours  william pendril   xiii  from mr de bleriot to mrs lecount  darks buildings november 1st  dear madami have the pleasure of informing you that the discovery has been made with far less trouble than i had anticipated  mr and mrs noel vanstone have been traced across the solway firth to dumfries and thence to a cottage a few miles from the town on the banks of the nith the exact address is baliol cottage near dumfries  this information though easily hunted up has nevertheless been obtained under rather singular circumstances  before leaving allonby the persons in my employ discovered to their surprise that a stranger was in the place pursuing the same inquiry as themselves in the absence of any instructions preparing them for such an occurrence as this they took their own view of the circumstance considering the man as an intruder on their business whose success might deprive them of the credit and reward of making the discovery they took advantage of their superiority in numbers and of their being first in the field and carefully misled the stranger before they ventured any further with their own investigations i am in possession of the details of their proceedings with which i need not trouble you the end is that this person whoever he may be was cleverly turned back southward on a false scent before the men in my employment crossed the firth  i mention the circumstance as you may be better able than i am to find a clew to it and as it may possibly be of a nature to induce you to hasten your journey  your faithful servant  alfred de bleriot   xiv  from mrs lecount to mr de bleriot  november 1st  dear sirone line to say that your letter has just reached me at my lodging in london i think i know who sent the strange man to inquire at allonby it matters little before he finds out his mistake i shall be at dumfries my luggage is packed and i start for the north by the next train  your deeply obliged  virginie lecount      the fifth scene  baliol cottage dumfries    chapter i  toward eleven oclock on the morning of the third of november the breakfasttable at baliol cottage presented that essentially comfortless appearance which is caused by a meal in a state of transitionthat is to say by a meal prepared for two persons which has been already eaten by one and which has not yet been approached by the other it must be a hardy appetite which can contemplate without a momentary discouragement the battered eggshell the fish half stripped to a skeleton the crumbs in the plate and the dregs in the cup there is surely a wise submission to those weaknesses in human nature which must be respected and not reproved in the sympathizing rapidity with which servants in places of public refreshment clear away all signs of the customer in the past from the eyes of the customer in the present although his predecessor may have been the wife of his bosom or the child of his loins no man can find himself confronted at table by the traces of a vanished eater without a passing sense of injury in connection with the idea of his own meal  some such impression as this found its way into the mind of mr noel vanstone when he entered the lonely breakfastparlor at baliol cottage shortly after eleven oclock he looked at the table with a frown and rang the bell with an expression of disgust  clear away this mess he said when the servant appeared has your mistress gone  yes sirnearly an hour ago  is louisa downstairs  yes sir  when you have put the table right send louisa up to me  he walked away to the window the momentary irritation passed away from his face but it left an expression there which remainedan expression of pining discontent personally his marriage had altered him for the worse his wizen little cheeks were beginning to shrink into hollows his frail little figure had already contracted a slight stoop the former delicacy of his complexion had gonethe sickly paleness of it was all that remained his thin flaxen mustaches were no longer pragmatically waxed and twisted into a curl their weak feathery ends hung meekly pendent over the querulous corners of his mouth if the ten or twelve weeks since his marriage had been counted by his locks they might have reckoned as ten or twelve years he stood at the window mechanically picking leaves from a pot of heath placed in front of it and drearily humming the forlorn fragment of a tune  the prospect from the window overlooked the course of the nith at a bend of the river a few miles above dumfries here and there through wintry gaps in the wooded bank broad tracts of the level cultivated valley met the eye boats passed on the river and carts plodded along the highroad on their way to dumfries the sky was clear the november sun shone as pleasantly as if the year had been younger by two good months and the view noted in scotland for its bright and peaceful charm was presented at the best which its wintry aspect could assume if it had been hidden in mist or drenched with rain mr noel vanstone would to all appearance have found it as attractive as he found it now he waited at the window until he heard louisas knock at the door then turned back sullenly to the breakfasttable and told her to come in  make the tea he said i know nothing about it im left here neglected nobody helps me  the discreet louisa silently and submissively obeyed  did your mistress leave any message for me he asked before she went away  no message in particular sir my mistress only said she should be too late if she waited breakfast any longer  did she say nothing else  she told me at the carriage door sir that she would most likely be back in a week  was she in good spirits at the carriage door  no sir i thought my mistress seemed very anxious and uneasy is there anything more i can do sir  i dont know wait a minute  he proceeded discontentedly with his breakfast louisa waited resignedly at the door  i think your mistress has been in bad spirits lately he resumed with a sudden outbreak of petulance  my mistress has not been very cheerful sir  what do you mean by not very cheerful do you mean to prevaricate am i nobody in the house am i to be kept in the dark about everything is your mistress to go away on her own affairs and leave me at home like a childand am i not even to ask a question about her am i to be prevaricated with by a servant i wont be prevaricated with not very cheerful what do you mean by not very cheerful  i only meant that my mistress was not in good spirits sir  why couldnt you say it then dont you know the value of words the most dreadful consequences sometimes happen from not knowing the value of words did your mistress tell you she was going to london  yes sir  what did you think when your mistress told you she was going to london did you think it odd she was going without me  i did not presume to think it odd siris there anything more i can do for you if you please sir  what sort of a morning is it out is it warm is the sun on the garden  yes sir  have you seen the sun yourself on the garden  yes sir  get me my greatcoat ill take a little turn has the man brushed it did you see the man brush it yourself what do you mean by saying he has brushed it when you didnt see him let me look at the tails if theres a speck of dust on the tails ill turn the man offhelp me on with it  louisa helped him on with his coat and gave him his hat he went out irritably the coat was a large one it had belonged to his father the hat was a large one it was a misfit purchased as a bargain by himself he was submerged in his hat and coat he looked singularly small and frail and miserable as he slowly wended his way in the wintry sunlight down the garden walk the path sloped gently from the back of the house to the water side from which it was parted by a low wooden fence after pacing backward and forward slowly for some little time he stopped at the lower extremity of the garden and leaning on the fen ce looked down listlessly at the smooth flow of the river  his thoughts still ran on the subject of his first fretful question to louisahe was still brooding over the circumstances under which his wife had left the cottage that morning and over the want of consideration toward himself implied in the manner of her departure the longer he thought of his grievance the more acutely he resented it he was capable of great tenderness of feeling where any injury to his sense of his own importance was concerned his head drooped little by little on his arms as they rested on the fence and in the deep sincerity of his mortification he sighed bitterly  the sigh was answered by a voice close at his side  you were happier with me sir said the voice in accents of tender regret  he looked up with a screamliterally with a screamand confronted mrs lecount  was it the specter of the woman or the woman herself her hair was white her face had fallen away her eyes looked out large bright and haggard over her hollow cheeks she was withered and old her dress hung loose round her wasted figure not a trace of its buxom autumnal beauty remained the quietly impenetrable resolution the smoothly insinuating voicethese were the only relics of the past which sickness and suffering had left in mrs lecount  compose yourself mr noel she said gently you have no cause to be alarmed at seeing me your servant when i inquired said you were in the garden and i came here to find you i have traced you out sir with no resentment against yourself with no wish to distress you by so much as the shadow of a reproach i come here on what has been and is still the business of my lifeyour service  he recovered himself a little but he was still incapable of speech he held fast by the fence and stared at her  try to possess your mind sir of what i say proceeded mrs lecount i have come here not as your enemy but as your friend i have been tried by sickness i have been tried by distress nothing remains of me but my heart my heart forgives you my heart in your sore needneed which you have yet to feelplaces me at your service take my arm mr noel a little turn in the sun will help you to recover yourself  she put his hand through her arm and marched him slowly up the garden walk before she had been five minutes in his company she had resumed full possession of him in her own right  now down again mr noel she said gently down again in this fine sunlight i have much to say to you sir which you never expected to hear from me let me ask a little domestic question first they told me at the house door mrs noel vanstone was gone away on a journey has she gone for long  her masters hand trembled on her arm as she put that question instead of answering it he tried faintly to plead for himself the first words that escaped him were prompted by his first returning sensethe sense that his housekeeper had taken him into custody he tried to make his peace with mrs lecount  i always meant to do something for you he said coaxingly you would have heard from me before long upon my word and honor lecount you would have heard from me before long  i dont doubt it sir replied mrs lecount but for the present never mind about me you and your interests first  how did you come here he asked looking at her in astonishment how came you to find me out  it is a long story sir i will tell it you some other time let it be enough to say now that i have found you will mrs noel be back again at the house today a little louder sir i can hardly hear you so so not back again for a week and where has she gone to london did you say and what fori am not inquisitive mr noel i am asking serious questions under serious necessity why has your wife left you here and gone to london by herself  they were down at the fence again as she made that last inquiry and they waited leaning against it while noel vanstone answered her reiterated assurances that she bore him no malice were producing their effect he was beginning to recover himself the old helpless habit of addressing all his complaints to his housekeeper was returning already with the reappearance of mrs lecountreturning insidiously in company with that besetting anxiety to talk about his grievances which had got the better of him at the breakfasttable and which had shown the wound inflicted on his vanity to his wifes maid  i cant answer for mrs noel vanstone he said spitefully mrs noel vanstone has not treated me with the consideration which is my due she has taken my permission for granted and she has only thought proper to tell me that the object of her journey is to see her friends in london she went away this morning without bidding me goodby she takes her own way as if i was nobody she treats me like a child you may not believe it lecount but i dont even know who her friends are i am left quite in the dark i am left to guess for myself that her friends in london are her uncle and aunt  mrs lecount privately considered the question by the help of her own knowledge obtained in london she soon reached the obvious conclusion after writing to her sister in the first instance magdalen had now in all probability followed the letter in person there was little doubt that the friends she had gone to visit in london were her sister and miss garth  not her uncle and aunt sir resumed mrs lecount composedly a secret for your private ear she has no uncle and aunt another little turn before i explain myselfanother little turn to compose your spirits  she took him into custody once more and marched him back toward the house  mr noel she said suddenly stopping in the middle of the walk do you know what was the worst mischief you ever did yourself in your life i will tell you that worst mischief was sending me to zurich  his hand began to tremble on her arm once more  i didnt do it he cried piteously it was all mr bygrave  you acknowledge sir that mr bygrave deceived me proceeded mrs lecount i am glad to hear that you will be all the readier to make the next discovery which is waiting for youthe discovery that mr bygrave has deceived you he is not here to slip through my fingers now and i am not the helpless woman in this place that i was at aldborough thank god  she uttered that devout exclamation through her set teeth all her hatred of captain wragge hissed out of her lips in those two words  oblige me sir by holding one side of my travelingbag she resumed while i open it and take something out  the interior of the bag disclosed a series of neatlyfolded papers all laid together in order and numbered outside mrs lecount took out one of the papers and shut up the bag again with a loud snap of the spring that closed it  at aldborough mr noel i had only my own opinion to support me she remarked my own opinion was nothing against miss bygraves youth and beauty and mr bygraves ready wit i could only hope to attack your infatuation with proofs and at that time i had not got them i have got them now i am armed at all points with proofs i bristle from head to foot with proofs i break my forced silence and speak with the emphasis of my proofs do you know this writing sir  he shrank back from the paper which she offered to him  i dont understand this he said nervously i dont know what you want or what you mean  mrs lecount forced the paper into his hand you shall know what i mean sir if you will give me a moments attention she said on the day after you went away to st crux i obtained admission to mr bygraves house and i had some talk in private with mr bygraves wife that talk supplied me with the means to convince you which i had wanted to find for weeks and weeks past i wrote you a letter to say soi wrote to tell you that i would forfeit my place in your service and my expectations from your generosity if i did not prove to you when i came back from switzerland that my own private suspicion of miss bygrave was the truth i directed that letter to you at st crux and i posted it myself now mr noel read the paper which i have forced into your hand it is admiral bartrams written affirmation that my letter came to st crux and that he inclosed it to you under cover to mr bygrave at your own request did mr bygrave ever give you that letter dont agitate yourself sir one word of reply will doyes or no  he read the paper and looked up at her with growing bewilderment and fear she obstinately waited until he spoke no he said faintly i never got the letter  first proof said mrs lecount taking the paper from him and putting it back in the bag one more with your kind permission before we come to things more serious still i gave you a written description sir at aldborough of a person not named and i asked you to compare it with miss bygrave the next time you were in her company after having first shown the description to mr bygraveit is useless to deny it now mr noel your friend at north shingles is not here to help youafter having first shown my note to mr bygrave you made the comparison and you found it fail in the most important particular there were two little moles placed close together on the left side of the neck in my description of the unknown lady and there were no little moles at all when you looked at miss bygraves neck i am old enough to be your mother mr noel if the question is not indelicate may i ask what the present state of your knowledge is on the subject of your wifes neck  she looked at him with a merciless steadiness he drew back a few steps cowering under her eye i cant say he stammered i dont know what do you mean by these questions i never thought about the moles afterward i never looked she wears her hair low  she has excellent reasons to wear it low sir remarked mrs lecount we will try and lift that hair before we have done with the subject when i came out here to find you in the garden i saw a neat young person through the kitchen window with her work in her hand who looked to my eyes like a ladys maid is this young person your wifes maid i beg your pardon sir did you say yes in that case another question if you please did you engage her or did your wife  i engaged her  while i was away while i was in total ignorance that you meant to have a wife or a wifes maid  yes  under those circumstances mr noel you cannot possibly suspect me of conspiring to deceive you with the maid for my instrument go into the house sir while i wait here ask the woman who dresses mrs noel vanstones hair morning and night whether her mistress has a mark on the left side of her neck and if so what that mark is  he walked a few steps toward the house without uttering a word then stopped and looked back at mrs lecount his blinking eyes were steady and his wizen face had become suddenly composed mrs lecount advanced a little and joined him she saw the change but with all her experience of him she failed to interpret the true meaning of it  are you in want of a pretense sir she asked are you at a loss to account to your wifes maid for such a question as i wish you to put to her pretenses are easily found which will do for persons in her station of life say i have come here with news of a legacy for mrs noel vanstone and that there is a question of her identity to settle before she can receive the money  she pointed to the house he paid no attention to the sign his face grew paler and paler without moving or speaking he stood and looked at her  are you afraid asked mrs lecount  those words roused him those words lit a spark of the fire of manhood in him at last he turned on her like a sheep on a dog  i wont be questioned and ordered he broke out trembling violently under the new sensation of his own courage i wont be threatened and mystified any longer how did you find me out at this place what do you mean by coming here with your hints and your mysteries what have you got to say against my wife  mrs lecount composedly opened the travelingbag and took out her smelling bottle in case of emergency  you have spoken to me in plain words she said in plain words sir you shall have your answer are you too angry to listen  her looks and tones alarmed him in spite of himself his courage began to sink again and desperately as he tried to steady it his voice trembled when he answered her  give me my answer he said and give it at once  your commands shall be obeyed sir to the letter replied mrs lecount i have come here with two objects to open your eyes to your own situation and to save your fortuneperhaps your life your situation is this miss bygrave has married you under a false character and a false name can you rouse your memory can you call to mind the disguised woman who threatened you in vauxhall walk that womanas certainly as i stand hereis now your wife  he looked at her in breathless silence his lips falling apart his eyes fixed in vacant inquiry the suddenness of the disclosure had overreached its own end it had stupefied him  my wife he repeated and burst into an imbecile laugh  your wife reiterated mrs lecount  at the repetition of those two words the strain on his faculties relaxed a thought dawned on him for the first time his eyes fixed on her with a furtive alarm and he drew back hastily mad he said to himself with a sudden remembrance of what his friend mr bygrave had told him at aldborough sharpened by his own sense of the haggard change that he saw in her face  he spoke in a whisper but mrs lecount heard him she was close at his side again in an instant for the first time her selfpossession failed her and she caught him angrily by the arm  will you put my madness to the proof sir she asked  he shook off her hold he began to gather courage again in the intense sincerity of his disbelief courage to face the assertion which she persisted in forcing on him  yes he answered what must i do  do what i told you said mrs lecount ask the maid that question about her mistress on the spot and if she tells you the mark is there do one thing more take me up into your wifes room and open her wardrobe in my presence with your own hands  what do you want with her wardrobe he asked  you shall know when you open it  very strange he said to himself vacantly its like a scene in a novelits like nothing in real life he went slowly into the house and mrs lecount waited for him in the garden  after an absence of a few minutes only he appeared again on the top of the flight of steps which led into the garden from the house he held by the iron rail with one hand while with the other he beckoned to mrs lecount to join him on the steps  what does the maid say she asked as she approached him is the mark there  he answered in a whisper yes what he had heard from the maid had produced a marked change in him the horror of the coming discovery had laid its paralyzing hold on his mind he moved mechanically he looked and spoke like a man in a dream  will you take my arm sir  he shook his head and preceding her along the passage and up the stairs led the way into his wifes room when she joined him and locked the door he stood passively waiting for his directions without making any remark without showing any external appearance of surprise he had not removed either his hat or coat mrs lecount took them off for him thank you he said with the docility of a welltrained child its like a scene in a novelits like nothing in real life  the bedchamber was not very large and the furniture was heavy and oldfashioned but evidences of magdalens natural taste and refinement were visible everywhere in the little embellishments that graced and enlivened the aspect of the room the perfume of dried roseleaves hung fra grant on the cool air mrs lecount sniffed the perfume with a disparaging frown and threw the window up to its full height pah she said with a shudder of virtuous disgust the atmosphere of deceit  she seated herself near the window the wardrobe stood against the wall opposite and the bed was at the side of the room on her right hand open the wardrobe mr noel she said i dont go near it i touch nothing in it myself take out the dresses with your own hand and put them on the bed take them out one by one until i tell you to stop  he obeyed her ill do it as well as i can he said my hands are cold and my head feels half asleep  the dresses to be removed were not many for magdalen had taken some of them away with her after he had put two dresses on the bed he was obliged to search in the inner recesses of the wardrobe before he could find a third when he produced it mrs lecount made a sign to him to stop the end was reached already he had found the brown alpaca dress  lay it out on the bed sir said mrs lecount you will see a double flounce running round the bottom of it lift up the outer flounce and pass the inner one through your fingers inch by inch if you come to a place where there is a morsel of the stuff missing stop and look up at me  he passed the flounce slowly through his fingers for a minute or more then stopped and looked up mrs lecount produced her pocketbook and opened it  every word i now speak sir is of serious consequence to you and to me she said listen with your closest attention when the woman calling herself miss garth came to see us in vauxhall walk i knelt down behind the chair in which she was sitting and i cut a morsel of stuff from the dress she wore which might help me to know that dress if i ever saw it again i did this while the womans whole attention was absorbed in talking to you the morsel of stuff has been kept in my pocketbook from that time to this see for yourself mr noel if it fits the gap in that dress which your own hands have just taken from your wifes wardrobe  she rose and handed him the fragment of stuff across the bed he put it into the vacant space in the flounce as well as his trembling fingers would let him  does it fit sir asked mrs lecount  the dress dropped from his hands and the deadly bluish pallorwhich every doctor who attended him had warned his housekeeper to dreadoverspread his face slowly mrs lecount had not reckoned on such an answer to her question as she now saw in his cheeks she hurried round to him with the smellingbottle in her hand he dropped to his knees and caught at her dress with the grasp of a drowning man save me he gasped in a hoarse breathless whisper oh lecount save me  i promise to save you said mrs lecount i am here with the means and the resolution to save you come away from this placecome nearer to the air she raised him as she spoke and led him across the room to the window do you feel the chill pain again on your left side she asked with the first signs of alarm that she had shown yet has your wife got any eaudecologne any salvolatile in her room dont exhaust yourself by speakingpoint to the place  he pointed to a little triangular cupboard of old wormeaten walnutwood fixed high in a corner of the room mrs lecount tried the door it was locked  as she made that discovery she saw his head sink back gradually on the easychair in which she had placed him the warning of the doctors in past yearsif you ever let him faint you let him dierecurred to her memory as if it had been spoken the day before she looked at the cupboard again in a recess under it lay some ends of cord placed there apparently for purposes of packing without an instants hesitation she snatched up a morsel of cord tied one end fast round the knob of the cupboard door and seizing the other end in both hands pulled it suddenly with the exertion of her whole strength the rotten wood gave way the cupboard doors flew open and a heap of little trifles poured out noisily on the floor without stopping to notice the broken china and glass at her feet she looked into the dark recesses of the cupboard and saw the gleam of two glass bottles one was put away at the extreme back of the shelf the other was a little in advance almost hiding it she snatched them both out at once and took them one in each hand to the window where she could read their labels in the clearer light  the bottle in her right hand was the first bottle she looked at it was markedsalvolatile  she instantly laid the other bottle aside on the table without looking at it the other bottle lay there waiting its turn it held a dark liquid and it was labeledpoison    chapter ii  mrs lecount mixed the salvolatile with water and administered it immediately the stimulant had its effect in a few minutes noel vanstone was able to raise himself in the chair without assistance his color changed again for the better and his breath came and went more freely  how do you feel now sir asked mrs lecount are you warm again on your left side  he paid no attention to that inquiry his eyes wandering about the room turned by chance toward the table to mrs lecounts surprise instead of answering her he bent forward in his chair and looked with staring eyes and pointing hand at the second bottle which she had taken from the cupboard and which she had hastily laid aside without paying attention to it seeing that some new alarm possessed him she advanced to the table and looked where he looked the labeled side of the bottle was full in view and there in the plain handwriting of the chemist at aldborough was the one startling word confronting them bothpoison  even mrs lecounts selfpossession was shaken by that discovery she was not prepared to see her own darkest forebodingsthe unacknowledged offspring of her hatred for magdalenrealized as she saw them realized now the suicidedespair in which the poison had been procured the suicidepurpose for which in distrust of the future the poison had been kept had brought with them their own retribution there the bottle lay in magdalens absence a false witness of treason which had never entered her mindtreason against her husbands life  with his hand still mechanically pointing at the table noel vanstone raised his head and looked up at mrs lecount  i took it from the cupboard she said answering the look i took both bottles out together not knowing which might be the bottle i wanted i am as much shocked as much frightened as you are  poison he said to himself slowly poison locked up by my wife in the cupboard in her own room he stopped and looked at mrs lecount once more for me he asked in a vacant inquiring tone  we will not talk of it sir until your mind is more at ease said mrs lecount in the meantime the danger that lies waiting in this bottle shall be instantly destroyed in your presence she took out the cork and threw the laudanum out of window and the empty bottle after it let us try to forget this dreadful discovery for the present she resumed let us go downstairs at once all that i have now to say to you can be said in another room  she helped him to rise from the chair and took his arm in her own it is well for him it is well for me she thought as they went downstairs together that i came when i did  on crossing the passage she stepped to the front door where the carriage was waiting which had brought her from dumfries and instructed the coachman to put up his horses at the nearest inn and to call again for her in two hours time this done she accompanied noel vanstone into the sittingroom stirred up the fire and placed him before it comfortably in an easychair he sat for a few minutes warming his hands feebly like an old man and staring straight into the flame then he spoke  when the woman came and threatened me in vauxhall walk he began still staring into the fire you came back to the parlor after she was gone and you told me he stopped shivered a little and lost the thread of his recollections at that point  i told you sir said mrs lecount that the woman was in my opinion miss vanstone herself dont start mr noel your wife is away and i am here to take care of you say to yourself if you feel frightened lecount is here lecount will take care of me the truth must be told sir however hard to bear the truth may be miss magdalen vanstone was the woman who came to you in disguise and the woman who came to you in disguise is the woman you have married the conspiracy which she threatened you with in london is the conspiracy which has made her your wife that is the plain truth you have seen the dress upstairs if that dress had been no longer in existence i should still have had my proofs to convince you thanks to my interview with mrs bygrave i have discovered the house your wife lodged at in london it was opposite our house in vauxhall walk i have laid my hand on one of the landladys daughters who watched your wife from an inner room and saw her put on the disguise who can speak to her identity and to the identity of her companion mrs bygrave and who has furnished me at my own request with a written statement of facts which she is ready to affirm on oath if any person ventures to contradict her you shall read the statement mr noel if you like when you are fitter to understand it you shall also read a letter in the handwriting of miss garthwho will repeat to you personally every word she has written to mea letter formally denying that she was ever in vauxhall walk and formally asserting that those moles on your wifes neck are marks peculiar to miss magdalen vanstone whom she has known from childhood i say it with a just prideyou will find no weak place anywhere in the evidence which i bring you if mr bygrave had not stolen my letter you would have had your warning before i was cruelly deceived into going to zurich and the proofs which i now bring you after your marriage i should then have offered to you before it dont hold me responsible sir for what has happened since i left england blame your uncles bastard daughter and blame that villain with the brown eye and the green  she spoke her last venomous words as slowly and distinctly as she had spoken all the rest noel vanstone made no answerhe still sat cowering over the fire she looked round into his face he was crying silently i was so fond of her said the miserable little creature and i thought she was so fond of me  mrs lecount turned her back on him in disdainful silence fond of her as she repeated those words to herself her haggard face became almost handsome again in the magnificent intensity of its contempt  she walked to a bookcase at the lower end of the room and began examining the volumes in it before she had been long engaged in this way she was startled by the sound of his voice affrightedly calling her back the tears were gone from his face it was blank again with terror when he now turned it toward her  lecount he said holding to her with both hands can an egg be poisoned i had an egg for breakfast this morning and a little toast  make your mind easy sir said mrs lecount the poison of your wifes deceit is the only poison you have taken yet if she had resolved already on making you pay the price of your folly with your life she would not be absent from the house while you were left living in it dismiss the thought from your mind it is the middle of the day you want refreshment i have more to say to you in the interests of your own safetyi have something for you to do which must be done at once recruit your strength and you will do it i will set you the example of eating if you still distrust the food in this house are you composed enough to give the servant her orders if i ring the bell it is necessary to the object i have in view for you that nobody should think you ill in body or troubled in mind try first with me before the servant comes in let us see how you look and speak when you say bring up the lunch  after two rehearsals mrs lecount considered him fit to give the order without betraying himself  the bell was answered by louisalouisa looked hard at mrs lecount the luncheon was brought up by the housemaidthe housemaid looked hard at mrs lecount when luncheon was over the table was cleared by the cookthe cook looked hard at mrs lecount the three servants were plainly suspicious that something extraordinary was going on in the house it was hardly possible to doubt that they had arranged to share among themselves the three opportunities which the service of the table afforded them of entering the room  the curiosity of which she was the object did not escape the penetration of mrs lecount i did well she thought to arm myself in good time with the means of reaching my end if i let the grass grow under my feet one or the other of those women might get in my way roused by this consideration she produced her travelingbag from a corner as soon as the last of the servants had entered the room and seating herself at the end of the table opposite noel vanstone looked at him for a moment with a steady investigating attention she had carefully regulated the quantity of wine which he had taken at luncheonshe had let him drink exactly enough to fortify without confusing him and she now examined his face critically like an artist examining his picture at the end of the days work the result appeared to satisfy her and she opened the serious business of the interview on the spot  will you look at the written evidence i have mentioned to you mr noel before i say any more she inquired or are you sufficiently persuaded of the truth to proceed at once to the suggestion which i have now to make to you  let me hear your suggestion he said sullenly resting his elbows on the table and leaning his head on his hands  mrs lecount took from her travelingbag the written evidence to which she had just alluded and carefully placed the papers on one side of him within easy reach if he wished to refer to them far from being daunted she was visibly encouraged by the ungraciousness of his manner her experience of him informed her that the sign was a promising one on those rare occasions when the little resolution that he possessed was roused in him it invariably asserted itselflike the resolution of most other weak menaggressively at such times in proportion as he was outwardly sullen and discourteous to those about him his resolution rose and in proportion as he was considerate and polite it fell the tone of the answer he had just given and the attitude he assumed at the table convinced mrs lecount that spanish wine and scotch mutton had done their duty and had rallied his sinking courage  i will put the question to you for forms sake sir if you wish it she proceeded but i am already certain without any question at all that you have made your will  he nodded his head without looking at her  you have made it in your wifes favor  he nodded again  you have left her everything you possess  no  mrs lecount looked surprised  did you exercise a reserve toward her mr noel of your own accord she inquired or is it possible that your wife put her own limits to her interest in your will  he was uneasily silenthe was plainly ashamed to answer the question mrs lecount repeated it in a less direct form  how much have you left your widow mr noel in the event of your death  eighty thousand pounds  that reply answered the question eighty thousand pounds was exactly the fortune which michael vanstone had taken from his brothers orphan children at his brothers deathexactly the fortune of which michael vanstones son had kept possession in his turn as pitilessly as his father before him noel vanstones silence was eloquent of the confession which he was ashamed to make his doting weakness had beyond all doubt placed his whole property at the feet of his wife and thi s girl whose vindictive daring had defied all restraintsthis girl who had not shrunk from her desperate determination even at the church doorhad in the very hour of her triumph taken part only from the man who would willingly have given allhad rigorously exacted her fathers fortune from him to the last farthing and had then turned her back on the hand that was tempting her with tens of thousands more for the moment mrs lecount was fairly silenced by her own surprise magdalen had forced the astonishment from her which is akin to admiration the astonishment which her enmity would fain have refused she hated magdalen with a tenfold hatred from that time  i have no doubt sir she resumed after a momentary silence that mrs noel gave you excellent reasons why the provision for her at your death should be no more and no less than eighty thousand pounds and on the other hand i am equally sure that you in your innocence of all suspicion found those reasons conclusive at the time that time has now gone by your eyes are opened sir and you will not fail to remark as i remark that the comberaven property happens to reach the same sum exactly as the legacy which your wifes own instructions directed you to leave her if you are still in any doubt of the motive for which she married you look in your own willand there the motive is  he raised his head from his hands and became closely attentive to what she was saying to him for the first time since they had faced each other at the table the comberaven property had never been classed by itself in his estimation it had come to him merged in his fathers other possessions at his fathers death the discovery which had now opened before him was one to which his ordinary habits of thought as well as his innocence of suspicion had hitherto closed his eyes he said nothing but he looked less sullenly at mrs lecount his manner was more ingratiating the high tide of his courage was already on the ebb  your position sir must be as plain by this time to you as it is to me said mrs lecount there is only one obstacle now left between this woman and the attainment of her end that obstacle is your life after the discovery we have made upstairs i leave you to consider for yourself what your life is worth  at those terrible words the ebbing resolution in him ran out to the last drop dont frighten me he pleaded i have been frightened enough already he rose and dragged his chair after him round the table to mrs lecounts side he sat down and caressingly kissed her hand you good creature he said in a sinking voice you excellent lecount tell me what to do im full of resolutionill do anything to save my life  have you got writing materials in the room sir asked mrs lecount will you put them on the table if you please  while the writing materials were in process of collection mrs lecount made a new demand on the resources of her travelingbag she took two papers from it each indorsed in the same neat commercial handwriting one was described as draft for proposed will and the other as draft for proposed letter when she placed them before her on the table her hand shook a little and she applied the smellingsalts which she had brought with her in noel vanstones interests to her own nostrils  i had hoped when i came here mr noel she proceeded to have given you more time for consideration than it seems safe to give you now when you first told me of your wifes absence in london i thought it probable that the object of her journey was to see her sister and miss garth since the horrible discovery we have made upstairs i am inclined to alter that opinion your wifes determination not to tell you who the friends are whom she has gone to see fills me with alarm she may have accomplices in londonaccomplices for anything we know to the contrary in this house all three of your servants sir have taken the opportunity in turn of coming into the room and looking at me i dont like their looks neither you nor i know what may happen from day to day or even from hour to hour if you take my advice you will get the start at once of all possible accidents and when the carriage comes back you will leave this house with me  yes yes he said eagerly ill leave the house with you i wouldnt stop here by myself for any sum of money that could be offered me what do we want the pen and ink for are you to write or am i  you are to write sir said mrs lecount the means taken for promoting your own safety are to be means set in motion from beginning to end by yourself i suggest mr noeland you decide recognize your own position sir what is your first and foremost necessity it is plainly this you must destroy your wifes interest in your death by making another will  he vehemently nodded his approval his color rose and his blinking eyes brightened in malicious triumph she shant have a farthing he said to himself in a whispershe shant have a farthing  when your will is made sir proceeded mrs lecount you must place it in the hands of a trustworthy personnot my hands mr noel i am only your servant then when the will is safe and when you are safe write to your wife at this house tell her her infamous imposture is discovered tell her you have made a new will which leaves her penniless at your death tell her in your righteous indignation that she enters your doors no more place yourself in that strong position and it is no longer you who are at your wifes mercy but your wife who is at yours assert your own power sir with the law to help you and crush this woman into submission to any terms for the future that you please to impose  he eagerly took up the pen yes he said with a vindictive selfimportance any terms i please to impose he suddenly checked himself and his face became dejected and perplexed how can i do it now he asked throwing down the pen as quickly as he had taken it up  do what sir inquired mrs lecount  how can i make my will with mr loscombe away in london and no lawyer here to help me  mrs lecount gently tapped the papers before her on the table with her forefinger  all the help you need sir is waiting for you here she said i considered this matter carefully before i came to you and i provided myself with the confidential assistance of a friend to guide me through those difficulties which i could not penetrate for myself the friend to whom i refer is a gentleman of swiss extraction but born and bred in england he is not a lawyer by professionbut he has had his own sufficient experience of the law nevertheless and he has supplied me not only with a model by which you may make your will but with the written sketch of a letter which it is as important for us to have as the model of the will itself there is another necessity waiting for you mr noel which i have not mentioned yet but which is no less urgent in its way than the necessity of the will  what is it he asked with roused curiosity  we will take it in its turn sir answered mrs lecount its turn has not come yet the will if you please first i will dictate from the model in my possession and you will write  noel vanstone looked at the draft for the will and the draft for the letter with suspicious curiosity  i think i ought to see the papers myself before you dictate he said it would be more satisfactory to my own mind lecount  by all means sir rejoined mrs lecount handing him the papers immediately  he read the draft for the will first pausing and knitting his brows distrustfully wherever he found blank spaces left in the manuscript to be filled in with the names of persons and the enumeration of sums bequeathed to them two or three minutes of reading brought him to the end of the paper he gave it back to mrs lecount without making any objection to it  the draft for the letter was a much longer document he obstinately read it through to the end with an expression of perplexity and discontent which showed that it was utterly unintelligible to him i must have this explained he said with a touch of his old selfimportance before i take any steps in the matter  it shall be explained sir as we go on said mrs lecount  every word of it  every word of it mr noel when its turn comes you have no objection to the will to the will then as i said before let us devote ourselves first you have seen for yourself that it is short enough and simple enough for a child to understand it but if any doubts remain on your mind by all means compose those doubts by showing your will to a lawyer by profession in the meantime let me not be considered intrusive if i remind you that we are all mortal and that the lost opportunity can never be recalled while your time is your own sir and while your enemies are unsuspicious of you make your will  she opened a sheet of notepaper and smoothed it out before him she dipped the pen in ink and placed it in his hands he took it from her without speakinghe was to all appearance suffering under some temporary uneasiness of mind but the main point was gained there he sat with the paper before him and the pen in his hand ready at last in right earnest to make his will  the first question for you to decide sir said mrs lecount after a preliminary glance at her draft is your choice of an executor i have no desire to influence your decision but i may without impropriety remind you that a wise choice means in other words the choice of an old and tried friend whom you know that you can trust  it means the admiral i suppose said noel vanstone  mrs lecount bowed  very well he continued the admiral let it be  there was plainly some oppression still weighing on his mind even under the trying circumstances in which he was placed it was not in his nature to take mrs lecounts perfectly sensible and disinterested advice without a word of cavil as he had taken it now  are you ready sir  yes  mrs lecount dictated the first paragraph from the draft as follows   this is the last will and testament of me noel vanstone now living at baliol cottage near dumfries i revoke absolutely and in every particular my former will executed on the thirtieth of september eighteen hundred and fortyseven and i hereby appoint rearadmiral arthur everard bartram of st cruxinthemarsh essex sole executor of this my will   have you written those words sir  yes  mrs lecount laid down the draft noel vanstone laid down the pen they neither of them looked at each other there was a long silence  i am waiting mr noel said mrs lecount at last to hear what your wishes are in respect to the disposal of your fortune your large fortune she added with merciless emphasis  he took up the pen again and began picking the feathers from the quill in dead silence  perhaps your existing will may help you to instruct me sir pursued mrs lecount may i inquire to whom you left all your surplus money after leaving the eighty thousand pounds to your wife  if he had answered that question plainly he must have said i have left the whole surplus to my cousin george bartramand the implied acknowledgment that mrs lecounts name was not mentioned in the will must then have followed in mrs lecounts presence a much bolder man in his situation might have felt the same oppression and the same embarrassment which he was feeling now he picked the last morsel of feather from the quill and desperately leaping the pitfall under his feet advanced to meet mrs lecounts claims on him of his own accord  i would rather not talk of any will but the will i am making now he said uneasily the first thing lecount he hesitatedput the bare end of the quill into his mouthgnawed at it thoughtfullyand said no more  yes sir persisted mrs lecount  the first thing is  yes sir  the first thing is toto make some provision for you  he spoke the last words in a tone of plaintive interrogationas if all hope of being met by a magnanimous refusal had not deserted him even yet mrs lecount enlightened his mind on this point without a moments loss of time  thank you mr noel she said with the tone and manner of a woman who was not acknowledging a favor but receiving a right  he took another bite at the quill the perspiration began to appear on his face  the difficulty is he remarked to say how much  your lamented father sir rejoined mrs lecount met that difficulty if you remember at the time of his last illness  i dont remember said noel vanstone doggedly  you were on one side of his bed sir and i was on the other we were vainly trying to persuade him to make his will after telling us he would wait and make his will when he was well again he looked round at me and said some kind and feeling words which my memory will treasure to my dying day have you forgotten those words mr noel  yes said mr noel without hesitation  in my present situation sir retorted mrs lecount delicacy forbids me to improve your memory  she looked at her watch and relapsed into silence he clinched his hands and writhed from side to side of his chair in an agony of indecision mrs lecount passively refused to take the slightest notice of him  what should you say he began and suddenly stopped again  yes sir  what should you say toa thousand pounds  mrs lecount rose from her chair and looked him full in the face with the majestic indignation of an outraged woman  after the service i have rendered you today mr noel she said i have at least earned a claim on your respect if i have earned nothing more i wish you goodmorning  two thousand cried noel vanstone with the courage of despair  mrs lecount folded up her papers and hung her travelingbag over her arm in contemptuous silence  three thousand  mrs lecount moved with impenetrable dignity from the table to the door  four thousand  mrs lecount gathered her shawl round her with a shudder and opened the door  five thousand  he clasped his hands and wrung them at her in a frenzy of rage and suspense five thousand was the deathcry of his pecuniary suicide  mrs lecount softly shut the door again and came back a step  free of legacy duty sir she inquired  no  mrs lecount turned on her heel and opened the door again  yes  mrs lecount came back and resumed her place at the table as if nothing had happened  five thousand pounds free of legacy duty was the sum sir which your fathers grateful regard promised me in his will she said quietly if you choose to exert your memory as you have not chosen to exert it yet your memory will tell you that i speak the truth i accept your filial performance of your fathers promise mr noeland there i stop i scorn to take a mean advantage of my position toward you i scorn to grasp anything from your fears you are protected by my respect for myself and for the illustrious name i bear you are welcome to all that i have done and to all that i have suffered in your service the widow of professor lecompte sir takes what is justly hersand takes no more  as she spoke those words the traces of sickness seemed for the moment to disappear from her face her eyes shone with a steady inner light all the woman warmed and brightened in the radiance of her own triumphthe triumph trebly won of carrying her point of vindicating her integrity and of matching magdalens incorruptible selfdenial on magdalens own ground  when you are yourself again sir we will proceed let us wait a little first  she gave him time to compose himself and then after first looking at her draft dictated the second paragraph of the will in these terms   i give and bequeath to madame virginie lecompte widow of professor lecompt e late of zurich the sum of five thousand pounds free of legacy duty and in making this bequest i wi sh to place it on record that i am not only expressing my own sense of madame lecomptes attachment and fidelity in the capacity of my housekeeper but that i also believe myself to be executing the intentions of my deceased father who but for the circumstance of his dying intestate would have left madame lecompte in his will the same token of grateful regard for her services which i now leave her in mine   have you written the last words sir  yes  mrs lecount leaned across the table and offered noel vanstone her hand  thank you mr noel she said the five thousand pounds is the acknowledgment on your fathers side of what i have done for him the words in the will are the acknowledgment on yours  a faint smile flickered over his face for the first time it comforted him on reflection to think that matters might have been worse there was balm for his wounded spirit in paying the debt of gratitude by a sentence not negotiable at his bankers whatever his father might have done he had got lecount a bargain after all  a little more writing sir resumed mrs lecount and your painful but necessary duty will be performed the trifling matter of my legacy being settled we may come to the important question that is left the future direction of a large fortune is now waiting your word of command to whom is it to go  he began to writhe again in his chair even under the allpowerful fascination of his wife the parting with his money on paper had not been accomplished without a pang he had endured the pang he had resigned himself to the sacrifice and now here was the dreaded ordeal again awaiting him mercilessly for the second time  perhaps it may assist your decision sir if i repeat a question which i have put to you already observed mrs lecount in the will that you made under your wifes influence to whom did you leave the surplus money which remained at your own disposal  there was no harm in answering the question now he acknowledged that he had left the money to his cousin george  you could have done nothing better mr noel and you can do nothing better now said mrs lecount mr george and his two sisters are your only relations left one of those sisters is an incurable invalid with more than money enough already for all the wants which her affliction allows her to feel the other is the wife of a man even richer than yourself to leave the money to these sisters is to waste it to leave the money to their brother george is to give your cousin exactly the assistance which he will want when he one day inherits his uncles dilapidated house and his uncles impoverished estate a will which names the admiral your executor and mr george your heir is the right will for you to make it does honor to the claims of friendship and it does justice to the claims of blood  she spoke warmly for she spoke with a grateful remembrance of all that she herself owed to the hospitality of st crux noel vanstone took up another pen and began to strip the second quill of its feathers as he had stripped the first  yes he said reluctantly i suppose george must have iti suppose george has the principal claim on me he hesitated he looked at the door he looked at the window as if he longed to make his escape by one way or the other oh lecount he cried piteously its such a large fortune let me wait a little before i leave it to anybody  to his surprise mrs lecount at once complied with this characteristic request  i wish you to wait sir she replied i have something important to say before you add another line to your will a little while since i told you there was a second necessity connected with your present situation which had not been provided for yet but which must be provided for when the time came the time has come now you have a serious difficulty to meet and conquer before you can leave your fortune to your cousin george  what difficulty he asked  mrs lecount rose from her chair without answering stole to the door and suddenly threw it open no one was listening outside the passage was a solitude from one end to the other  i distrust all servants she said returning to her placeyour servants particularly sit closer mr noel what i have now to say to you must be heard by no living creature but ourselves    chapter iii  there was a pause of a few minutes while mrs lecount opened the second of the two papers which lay before her on the table and refreshed her memory by looking it rapidly through this done she once more addressed herself to noel vanstone carefully lowering her voice so as to render it inaudible to any one who might be listening in the passage outside  i must beg your permission sir she began to return to the subject of your wife i do so most unwillingly and i promise you that what i have now to say about her shall be said for your sake and for mine in the fewest words what do we know of this woman mr noeljudging her by her own confession when she came to us in the character of miss garth and by her own acts afterward at aldborough we know that if death had not snatched your father out of her reach she was ready with her plot to rob him of the comberaven money we know that when you inherited the money in your turn she was ready with her plot to rob you we know how she carried that plot through to the end and we know that nothing but your death is wanted at this moment to crown her rapacity and her deception with success we are sure of these things we are sure that she is young bold and cleverthat she has neither doubts scruples nor pityand that she possesses the personal qualities which men in general quite incomprehensibly to me are weak enough to admire these are not fancies mr noel but facts you know them as well as i do  he made a sign in the affirmative and mrs lecount went on  keep in your mind what i have said of the past sir and now look with me to the future i hope and trust you have a long life still before you but let us for the moment only suppose the case of your deathyour death leaving this will behind you which gives your fortune to your cousin george i am told there is an office in london in which copies of all wills must be kept any curious stranger who chooses to pay a shilling for the privilege may enter that office and may read any will in the place at his or her discretion do you see what i am coming to mr noel your disinherited widow pays her shilling and reads your will your disinherited widow sees that the comberaven money which has gone from your father to you goes next from you to mr george bartram what is the certain end of that discovery the end is that you leave to your cousin and your friend the legacy of this womans vengeance and this womans deceitvengeance made more resolute deceit made more devilish than ever by her exasperation at her own failure what is your cousin george he is a generous unsuspicious man incapable of deceit himself and fearing no deception in others leave him at the mercy of your wifes unscrupulous fascinations and your wifes unfathomable deceit and i see the end as certainly as i see you sitting there she will blind his eyes as she blinded yours and in spite of you in spite of me she will have the money  she stopped and left her last words time to gain their hold on his mind the circumstances had been stated so clearly the conclusion from them had been so plainly drawn that he seized her meaning without an effort and seized it at once  i see he said vindictively clinching his hands i understand lecount she shant have a farthing what shall i do shall i leave the money to the admiral he paused and considered a little no he resumed theres the same danger in leaving it to the admiral that there is in leaving it to george  there is no danger mr noel if you take my advice  what is your advice  follow your own idea sir take the pen in hand again and leave the money to admiral bartram  he mechanically dipped the pen in the ink and then hesitated  you shall know where i am leading you sir said mrs lecount before you sign your will in the meantime let us gain every inch of ground we can as we go on i want the will to be all written out before we advance a single step beyond it begin your third paragraph mr noel under the lines which leave me my legacy of five thousand pounds  she dictated the last momentous sentence of the will from the rough draft in her own possession in these words   the whole residue of my estate after payment of my burial expenses and my lawful debts i give and bequeath to rearadmiral arthur everard bartram my executor aforesaid to be by him applied to such uses as he may think fit  signed sealed and delivered this third day of november eighteen hundred and fortyseven by noel vanstone the withinnamed testator as and for his last will and testament in the presence of us   is that all asked noel vanstone in astonishment  that is enough sir to bequeath your fortune to the admiral and therefore that is all now let us go back to the case which we have supposed already your widow pays her shilling and sees this will there is the comberaven money left to admiral bartram with a declaration in plain words that it is his to use as he likes when she sees this what does she do she sets her trap for the admiral he is a bachelor and he is an old man who is to protect him against the arts of this desperate woman protect him yourself sir with a few more strokes of that pen which has done such wonders already you have left him this legacy in your willwhich your wife sees take the legacy away again in a letterwhich is a dead secret between the admiral and you put the will and the letter under one cover and place them in the admirals possession with your written directions to him to break the seal on the day of your death let the will say what it says now and let the letter which is your secret and his tell him the truth say that in leaving him your fortune you leave it with the request that he will take his legacy with one hand from you and give it with the other to his nephew george tell him that your trust in this matter rests solely on your confidence in his honor and on your belief in his affectionate remembrance of your father and yourself you have known the admiral since you were a boy he has his little whims and oddities but he is a gentleman from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot and he is utterly incapable of proving false to a trust in his honor reposed by his dead friend meet the difficulty boldly by such a stratagem as this and you save these two helpless men from your wifes snare one by means of the other here on one side is your will which gives the fortune to the admiral and sets her plotting accordingly and there on the other side is your letter which privately puts the money into the nephews hands  the malicious dexterity of this combination was exactly the dexterity which noel vanstone was most fit to appreciate he tried to express his approval and admiration in words mrs lecount held up her hand warningly and closed his lips  wait sir before you express your opinion she went on half the difficulty is all that we have conquered yet let us say the admiral has made the use of your legacy which you have privately requested him to make of it sooner or later however well the secret may be kept your wife will discover the truth what follows that discovery she lays siege to mr george all you have done is to leave him the money by a roundabout way there he is after an interval of time as much at her mercy as if you had openly mentioned him in your will what is the remedy for this the remedy is to mislead her if we can for the second timeto set up an obstacle between her and the money for the protection of your cousin george can you guess for yourself mr noel what is the most promising obstacle we can put in her way  he shook his head mrs lecount smiled and startled him into close attention by laying her hand on his arm  put a woman in her way sir she whispered in her wiliest tones we dont believe in that fascinating beauty of herswhatever you may do our lips dont burn to kiss those smooth cheeks our arms dont long to be round that supple waist we see through her smiles and her graces and her stays and her paddingshe cant fascinate us put a woman in her way mr noel not a woman in my helpless situation who is only a servant but a woman with the authority and the jealousy of a wife make it a condition in your letter to the admiral that if mr george is a bachelor at the time of your death he shall marry within a certain time afterward or he shall not have the legacy suppose he remains single in spite of your condition who is to have the money then put a woman in your wifes way sir once moreand leave the fortune in that case to the married sister of your cousin george  she paused noel vanstone again attempted to express his opinion and again mrs lecounts hand extinguished him in silence  if you approve mr noel she said i will take your approval for granted if you object i will meet your objection before it is out of your mouth you may say suppose this condition is sufficient to answer the purpose why hide it in a private letter to the admiral why not openly write it down with my cousins name in the will only for one reason sir only because the secret way is the sure way with such a woman as your wife the more secret you can keep your intentions the more time you force her to waste in finding them out for herself that time which she loses is time gained from her treachery by the admiraltime gained by mr george if he is still a bachelor for his undisturbed choice of a ladytime gained for her own security by the object of his choice who might otherwise be the first object of your wifes suspicion and your wifes hostility remember the bottle we have discovered upstairs and keep this desperate woman ignorant and therefore harmless as long as you can there is my advice mr noel in the fewest and plainest words what do you say sir am i almost as clever in my way as your friend mr bygrave can i too conspire a little when the object of my conspiracy is to assist your wishes and to protect your friends  permitted the use of his tongue at last noel vanstones admiration of mrs lecount expressed itself in terms precisely similar to those which he had used on a former occasion in paying his compliments to captain wragge what a head you have got were the grateful words which he had once spoken to mrs lecounts bitterest enemy what a head you have got were the grateful words which he now spoke again to mrs lecount herself so do extremes meet and such is sometimes the allembracing capacity of the approval of a fool  allow my head sir to deserve the compliment which you have paid to it said mrs lecount the letter to the admiral is not written yet your will there is a body without a soulan adam without an eveuntil the letter is completed and laid by its side a little more dictation on my part a little more writing on yours and our work is done pardon me the letter will be longer than the will we must have larger paper than the notepaper this time  the writingcase was searched and some letter paper was found in it of the size required mrs lecount resumed her dictation and noel vanstone resumed his pen   baliol cottage dumfries  november 3d 1847  private  dear admiral bartramwhen you open my will in which you are named my sole executor you will find that i have bequeathed the whole residue of my estateafter payment of one legacy of five thousand poundsto yourself it is the purpose of my letter to tell you privately what the object is for which i have left you the fortune which is now placed in your hands  i beg you to consider this large legacy as intended under certain conditions to be given by you to your nephew george if your nephew is married at the time of my death and if his wife is living i request you to put him at once in possession of your legacy accompanying it by the expression of my desire which i am sure he will consider a sacred and binding obligation on him that he will settle the money on his wifeand on his children if he has any if on the other hand he is unmarried at the time of my death or if he is a widowerin either of those cases i make it a condition of his receiving the legacy that he shall be married within the period of   mrs lecount laid down the draft letter from which she had been dictating thus far and informed noel vanstone by a sign that his pen might rest  we have come to the question of time sir she observed how long will you give your cousin to marry if he is single or a widower at the time of your death  shall i give him a year inquired noel vanstone  if we had nothing to consider but the interests of propriety said mrs lecount i should say a year too sirespecially if mr george should happen to be a widower but we have your wife to consider as well as the interests of propriety a year of delay between your death and your cousins marriage is a dangerously long time to leave the disposal of your fortune in suspense give a determined woman a year to plot and contrive in and there is no saying what she may not do  six months suggested noel vanstone  six months sir rejoined mrs lecount is the preferable time of the two a six months interval from the day of your death is enough for mr george you look discomposed sir what is the matter  i wish you wouldnt talk so much about my death he broke out petulantly i dont like it i hate the very sound of the word  mrs lecount smiled resignedly and referred to her draft  i see the word decease written here she remarked perhaps mr noel you would prefer it  yes he said i prefer decease it doesnt sound so dreadful as death  let us go on with the letter sir  she resumed her dictation as follows   in either of those cases i make it a condition of his receiving the legacy that he shall be married within the period of six calendar months from the day of my decease that the woman he marries shall not be a widow and that his marriage shall be a marriage by banns publicly celebrated in the parish church of ossorywhere he has been known from his childhood and where the family and circumstances of his future wife are likely to be the subject of public interest and inquiry   this said mrs lecount quietly looking up from the draft is to protect mr george sir in case the same trap is set for him which was successfully set for you she will not find her false character and her false name fit quite so easily next timeno not even with mr bygrave to help her another dip of ink mr noel let us write the next paragraph are you ready  yes  mrs lecount went on   if your nephew fails to comply with these conditionsthat is to say if being either a bachelor or a widower at the time of my decease he fails to marry in all respects as i have here instructed him to marry within six calendar months from that timeit is my desire that he shall not receive the legacy or any part of it i request you in the case here supposed to pass him over altogether and to give the fortune left you in my will to his married sister mrs girdlestone  having now put you in possession of my motives and intentions i come to the next question which it is necessary to consider if when you open this letter your nephew is an unmarried man it is clearly indispensable that he should know of the conditions here imposed on him as soon if possible as you know of them yourself are you under these circumstances freely to communicate to him what i have here written to you or are you to leave him under the impression that no such private expression of my wishes as this is in existence and are you to state all the conditions relating to his marriage as if they emanated entirely from yourself  if you will adopt this latter alternative you will add one more to the many obligations under which your friendship has placed me  i have serious reason to believe that the possession of my money and the discovery of any peculiar arrangements relating to the disposal of it will be objects after my decease of the fraud and conspiracy of an unscrupulous person i am therefore anxiousfor your sake in the first placethat no suspicion of the existence of this letter should be conveyed to the mind of the person to whom i allude and i am equally desirousfor mrs girdlestones sake in the second placethat this same person should be entirely ignorant that the legacy will pass into mrs girdlestones possession if your nephew is not married in the given time i know georges easy pliable disposition i dread the attempts that will be made to practice on it and i feel sure that the prudent course will be to abstain from trusting him with secrets the rash revelation of which might be followed by serious and even dangerous results  state the conditions therefore to your nephew as if they were your own let him think they have been suggested to your mind by the new responsibilities imposed on you as a man of property by your position in my will and by your consequent anxiety to provide for the perpetuation of the family name if these reasons are not sufficient to satisfy him there can be no objection to your referring him for any further explanations which he may desire to his weddingday  i have done my last wishes are now confided to you in implicit reliance on your honor and on your tender regard for the memory of your friend of the miserable circumstances which compel me to write as i have written here i say nothing you will hear of them if my life is spared from my own lipsfor you will be the first friend whom i shall consult in my difficulty and distress keep this letter strictly secret and strictly in your own possession until my requests are complied with let no human being but yourself know where it is on any pretense whatever  believe me dear admiral bartram affectionately yours  noel vanstone   have you signed sir asked mrs lecount let me look the letter over if you please before we seal it up  she read the letter carefully in noel vanstones close cramped handwriting it filled two pages of letterpaper and ended at the top of the third page instead of using an envelope mrs lecount folded it neatly and securely in the oldfashioned way she lit the taper in the inkstand and returned the letter to the writer  seal it mr noel she said with your own hand and your own seal she extinguished the taper and handed him the pen again address the letter sir she proceeded to admiral bartram st cruxinthemarsh essex now add these words and sign them above the address to be kept in your own possession and to be opened by yourself only on the day of my deathor decease if you prefer itnoel vanstone have you done let me look at it again quite right in every particular accept my congratulations sir if your wife has not plotted her last plot for the comberaven money it is not your fault mr noeland not mine  finding his attention released by the completion of the letter noel vanstone reverted at once to purely personal considerations there is my packingup to be thought of now he said i cant go away without my warm things  excuse me sir rejoined mrs lecount there is the will to be signed first and there must be two persons found to witness your signature she looked out of the front window and saw the carriage waiting at the door the coachman will do for one of the witnesses she said he is in respectable service at dumfries and he can be found if he happens to be wanted we must have one of your own servants i suppose for the other witness they are all de testable women but the cook is the least illlooking of the three send for the cook sir while i go out and call the coachman when we have got our witnesses here you have only to speak to them in these words i have a document here to sign and i wish you to write your names on it as witnesses of my signature nothing more mr noel say those few words in your usual mannerand when the signing is over i will see myself to your packingup and your warm things  she went to the front door and summoned the coachman to the parlor on her return she found the cook already in the room the cook looked mysteriously offended and stared without intermission at mrs lecount in a minute more the coachmanan elderly mancame in he was preceded by a relishing odor of whisky but his head was scotch and nothing but his odor betrayed him  i have a document here to sign said noel vanstone repeating his lesson and i wish you to write your names on it as witnesses of my signature  the coachman looked at the will the cook never removed her eyes from mrs lecount  yell no object sir said the coachman with the national caution showing itself in every wrinkle on his faceyell no object sir to tell me first what the doecument may be  mrs lecount interposed before noel vanstones indignation could express itself in words  you must tell the man sir that this is your will she said when he witnesses your signature he can see as much for himself if he looks at the top of the page  ay ay said the coachman looking at the top of the page immediately his last will and testament hech sirs theres a sair confronting of death in a doecument like yon a flesh is grass continued the coachman exhaling an additional puff of whisky and looking up devoutly at the ceiling tak those words in connection with that other screepture many are caad but few are chosen tak that again in connection with revlations chapter the first verses one to fefteen lay the whole to heart and whats your walth then dross sirs and your body screepture again clay for the potter and your life screepture once more the breeth o your nostrils  the cook listened as if the cook was at church but she never removed her eyes from mrs lecount  you had better sign sir this is apparently some custom prevalent in dumfries during the transaction of business said mrs lecount resignedly the man means well i dare say  she added those last words in a soothing tone for she saw that noel vanstones indignation was fast merging into alarm the coachmans outburst of exhortation seemed to have inspired him with fear as well as disgust  he dipped the pen in the ink and signed the will without uttering a word the coachman descending instantly from theology to business watched the signature with the most scrupulous attention and signed his own name as witness with an implied commentary on the proceeding in the form of another puff of whisky exhaled through the medium of a heavy sigh the cook looked away from mrs lecount with an effortsigned her name in a violent hurryand looked back again with a start as if she expected to see a loaded pistol produced in the interval in the housekeepers hands thank you said mrs lecount in her friendliest manner the cook shut up her lips aggressively and looked at her master you may go said her master the cook coughed contemptuously and went  we shant keep you long said mrs lecount dismissing the coachman in half an hour or less we shall be ready for the journey back  the coachmans austere countenance relaxed for the first time he smiled mysteriously and approached mrs lecount on tiptoe  yell no forget one thing my leddy he said with the most ingratiating politeness yell no forget the witnessing as weel as the driving when ye pay me for my days wark he laughed with guttural gravity and leaving his atmosphere behind him stalked out of the room  lecount said noel vanstone as soon as the coachman closed the door did i hear you tell that man we should be ready in half an hour  yes sir  are you blind  he asked the question with an angry stamp of his foot mrs lecount looked at him in astonishment  cant you see the brute is drunk he went on more and more irritably is my life nothing am i to be left at the mercy of a drunken coachman i wont trust that man to drive me for any consideration under heaven im surprised you could think of it lecount  the man has been drinking sir said mrs lecount it is easy to see and to smell that but he is evidently used to drinking if he is sober enough to walk quite straightwhich he certainly doesand to sign his name in an excellent handwritingwhich you may see for yourself on the willi venture to think he is sober enough to drive us to dumfries  nothing of the sort youre a foreigner lecount you dont understand these people they drink whisky from morning to night whisky is the strongest spirit thats made whisky is notorious for its effect on the brain i tell you i wont run the risk i never was driven and i never will be driven by anybody but a sober man  must i go back to dumfries by myself sir  and leave me here leave me alone in this house after what has happened how do i know my wife may not come back tonight how do i know her journey is not a blind to mislead me have you no feeling lecount can you leave me in my miserable situation he sank into a chair and burst out crying over his own idea before he had completed the expression of it in words too bad he said with his handkerchief over his facetoo bad  it was impossible not to pity him if ever mortal was pitiable he was the man he had broken down at last under the conflict of violent emotions which had been roused in him since the morning the effort to follow mrs lecount along the mazes of intricate combination through which she had steadily led the way had upheld him while that effort lasted the moment it was at an end he dropped the coachman had hastened a resultof which the coachman was far from being the cause  you surprise meyou distress me sir said mrs lecount i entreat you to compose yourself i will stay here if you wish it with pleasurei will stay here tonight for your sake you want rest and quiet after this dreadful day the coachman shall be instantly sent away mr noel i will give him a note to the landlord of the hotel and the carriage shall come back for us tomorrow morning with another man to drive it  the prospect which those words presented cheered him he wiped his eyes and kissed mrs lecounts hand yes he said faintly send the coachman awayand you stop here you good creature you excellent lecount send the drunken brute away and come back directly we will be comfortable by the fire lecountand have a nice little dinnerand try to make it like old times his weak voice faltered he returned to the fire side and melted into tears again under the pathetic influence of his own idea  mrs lecount left him for a minute to dismiss the coachman when she returned to the parlor she found him with his hand on the bell  what do you want sir she asked  i want to tell the servants to get your room ready he answered i wish to show you every attention lecount  you are all kindness mr noel but wait one moment it may be well to have these papers put out of the way before the servant comes in again if you will place the will and the sealed letter together in one envelopeand if you will direct it to the admirali will take care that the inclosure so addressed is safely placed in his own hands will you come to the table mr noel only for one minute more  no he was obstinate he refused to move from the fire he was sick and tired of writing he wished he had never been born and he loathed the sight of pen and ink all mrs lecounts patience and all mrs lecounts persuasion were required to induce him to write t he admirals address for the second time she only succeeded by bringing the blank envelope to him upon the papercase and putting it coaxingly on his lap he grumbled he even swore but he directed the envelope at last in these terms to admiral bartram st cruxinthemarsh favored by mrs lecount with that final act of compliance his docility came to an end he refused in the fiercest terms to seal the envelope there was no need to press this proceeding on him his seal lay ready on the table and it mattered nothing whether he used it or whether a person in his confidence used it for him mrs lecount sealed the envelope with its two important inclosures placed safely inside  she opened her travelingbag for the last time and pausing for a moment before she put the sealed packet away looked at it with a triumph too deep for words she smiled as she dropped it into the bag not the shadow of a suspicion that the will might contain superfluous phrases and expressions which no practical lawyer would have used not the vestige of a doubt whether the letter was quite as complete a document as a practical lawyer might have made it troubled her mind in blind relianceborn of her hatred for magdalen and her hunger for revengein blind reliance on her own abilities and on her friends law she trusted the future implicitly to the promise of the mornings work  as she locked her travelingbag noel vanstone rang the bell on this occasion the summons was answered by louisa  get the spare room ready said her master this lady will sleep here tonight and air my warm things this lady and i are going away tomorrow morning  the civil and submissive louisa received her orders in sullen silencedarted an angry look at her masters impenetrable guestand left the room the servants were evidently all attached to their mistresss interests and were all of one opinion on the subject of mrs lecount  thats done said noel vanstone with a sigh of infinite relief come and sit down lecount lets be comfortablelets gossip over the fire  mrs lecount accepted the invitation and drew an easychair to his side he took her hand with a confidential tenderness and held it in his while the talk went on a stranger looking in through the window would have taken them for mother and son and would have thought to himself what a happy home  the gossip led by noel vanstone consisted as usual of an endless string of questions and was devoted entirely to the subject of himself and his future prospects where would lecount take him to when they went away the next morning why to london why should he be left in london while lecount went on to st crux to give the admiral the letter and the will because his wife might follow him if he went to the admirals well there was something in that and because he ought to be safely concealed from her in some comfortable lodging near mr loscombe why near mr loscombe ah yes to be sureto know what the law would do to help him would the law set him free from the wretch who had deceived him how tiresome of lecount not to know would the law say he had gone and married himself a second time because he had been living with the wretch like husband and wife in scotland anything that publicly assumed to be a marriage was a marriage he had heard in scotland how excessively tiresome of lecount to sit there and say she knew nothing about it was he to stay long in london by himself with nobody but mr loscombe to speak to would lecount come back to him as soon as she had put those important papers in the admirals own hands would lecount consider herself still in his service the good lecount the excellent lecount and after all the lawbusiness was overwhat then why not leave this horrid england and go abroad again why not go to france to some cheap place near paris say versailles say st germain in a nice little french housecheap with a nice french bonne to cookwho wouldnt waste his substance in the greasepot with a nice little gardenwhere he could work himself and get health and save the expense of keeping a gardener it wasnt a bad idea and it seemed to promise well for the futuredidnt it lecount  so he ran onthe poor weak creature the abject miserable little man  as the darkness gathered at the close of the short november day he began to grow drowsyhis ceaseless questions came to an end at lasthe fell asleep the wind outside sang its mournful wintersong the tramp of passing footsteps the roll of passing wheels on the road ceased in dreary silence he slept on quietly the firelight rose and fell on his wizen little face and his nervous drooping hands mrs lecount had not pitied him yet she began to pity him now her point was gained her interest in his will was secured he had put his future life of his own accord under her fostering carethe fire was comfortable the circumstances were favorable to the growth of christian feeling poor wretch said mrs lecount looking at him with a grave compassionpoor wretch  the dinnerhour roused him he was cheerful at dinner he reverted to the idea of the cheap little house in france he smirked and simpered and talked french to mrs lecount while the housemaid and louisa waited turn and turn about under protest when dinner was over he returned to his comfortable chair before the fire and mrs lecount followed him he resumed the conversationwhich meant in his case repeating his questions but he was not so quick and ready with them as he had been earlier in the day they began to flagthey continued at longer and longer intervalsthey ceased altogether toward nine oclock he fell asleep again  it was not a quiet sleep this time he muttered and ground his teeth and rolled his head from side to side of the chair mrs lecount purposely made noise enough to rouse him he woke with a vacant eye and a flushed cheek he walked about the room restlessly with a new idea in his mindthe idea of writing a terrible letter a letter of eternal farewell to his wife how was it to be written in what language should he express his feelings the powers of shakespeare himself would be unequal to the emergency he had been the victim of an outrage entirely without parallel a wretch had crept into his bosom a viper had hidden herself at his fireside where could words be found to brand her with the infamy she deserved he stopped with a suffocating sense in him of his own impotent ragehe stopped and shook his fist tremulously in the empty air  mrs lecount interfered with an energy and a resolution inspired by serious alarm after the heavy strain that had been laid on his weakness already such an outbreak of passionate agitation as was now bursting from him might be the destruction of his rest that night and of his strength to travel the next day with infinite difficulty with endless promises to return to the subject and to advise him about it in the morning she prevailed on him at last to go upstairs and compose himself for the night she gave him her arm to assist him on the way upstairs his attention to her great relief became suddenly absorbed by a new fancy he remembered a certain warm and comfortable mixture of wine eggs sugar and spices which she had often been accustomed to make for him in former times and which he thought he should relish exceedingly before he went to bed mrs lecount helped him on with his dressinggownthen went downstairs again to make his warm drink for him at the parlor fire  she rang the bell and ordered the necessary ingredients for the mixture in noel vanstones name the servants with the small ingenious malice of their race brought up the materials one by one and kept her waiting for each of them as long as possible she had got the saucepan and the spoon and the tumbler and the nutmeggrater and the winebut not the egg the sugar or the spiceswhen she heard him above walking backward and forward noisily in his room exciting hi mself on the old subject again beyond all doubt  she went upstairs once more but he was too quick for herhe heard her outside the door and when she opened it she found him in his chair with his back cunningly turned toward her knowing him too well to attempt any remonstrance she merely announced the speedy arrival of the warm drink and turned to leave the room on her way out she noticed a table in a corner with an inkstand and a papercase on it and tried without attracting his attention to take the writing materials away he was too quick for her again he asked angrily if she doubted his promise she put the writing materials back on the table for fear of offending him and left the room  in half an hour more the mixture was ready she carried it up to him foaming and fragrant in a large tumbler he will sleep after this she thought to herself as she opened the door i have made it stronger than usual on purpose  he had changed his place he was sitting at the table in the cornerstill with his back to her writing this time his quick ears had not served him this time she caught him in the fact  oh mr noel mr noel she said reproachfully what is your promise worth  he made no answer he was sitting with his left elbow on the table and with his head resting on his left hand his right hand lay back on the paper with the pen lying loose in it your drink mr noel she said in a kinder tone feeling unwilling to offend him he took no notice of her she went to the table to rouse him was he deep in thought  he was dead  the end of the fifth scene     between the scenes  progress of the story through the post   i  from mrs noel vanstone to mr loscombe  park terrace st johns wood november 5th  dear siri came to london yesterday for the purpose of seeing a relative leaving mr vanstone at baliol cottage and proposing to return to him in the course of the week i reached london late last night and drove to these lodgings having written to secure accommodation beforehand  this mornings post has brought me a letter from my own maid whom i left at baliol cottage with instructions to write to me if anything extraordinary took place in my absence you will find the girls letter inclosed in this i have had some experience of her and i believe she is to be strictly depended on to tell the truth  i purposely abstain from troubling you by any useless allusions to myself when you have read my maids letter you will understand the shock which the news contained in it has caused me i can only repeat that i place implicit belief in her statement i am firmly persuaded that my husbands former housekeeper has found him out has practiced on his weakness in my absence and has prevailed on him to make another will from what i know of this woman i feel no doubt that she has used her influence over mr vanstone to deprive me if possible of all future interests in my husbands fortune  under such circumstances as these it is in the last degree importantfor more reasons than i need mention herethat i should see mr vanstone and come to an explanation with him at the earliest possible opportunity you will find that my maid thoughtfully kept her letter open until the last moment before posttimewithout however having any later news to give me than that mrs lecount was to sleep at the cottage last night and that she and mr vanstone were to leave together this morning but for that last piece of intelligence i should have been on my way back to scotland before now as it is i cannot decide for myself what i ought to do next my going back to dumfries after mr vanstone has left it seems like taking a journey for nothing and my staying in london appears to be almost equally useless  will you kindly advise me in this difficulty i will come to you at lincolns inn at any time this afternoon or tomorrow which you may appoint my next few hours are engaged as soon as this letter is dispatched i am going to kensington with the object of ascertaining whether certain doubts i feel about the means by which mrs lecount may have accomplished her discovery are well founded or not if you will let me have your answer by return of post i will not fail to get back to st johns wood in time to receive it believe me dear sir yours sincerely  magdalen vanstone   ii  from mr loscombe to mrs noel vanstone  lincolns inn november 5th  dear madamyour letter and its inclosure have caused me great concern and surprise pressure of business allows me no hope of being able to see you either today or tomorrow morning but if three oclock tomorrow afternoon will suit you at that hour you will find me at your service  i cannot pretend to offer a positive opinion until i know more of the particulars connected with this extraordinary business than i find communicated either in your letter or in your maids but with this reserve i venture to suggest that your remaining in london until tomorrow may possibly lead to other results besides your consultation at my chambers there is at least a chance that you or i may hear something further in this strange matter by the mornings post i remain dear madam faithfully yours  john loscombe   iii  from mrs noel vanstone to miss garth  november 5th two oclock  i have just returned from westmoreland houseafter purposely leaving it in secret and purposely avoiding you under your own roof you shall know why i came and why i went away it is due to my remembrance of old times not to treat you like a stranger although i can never again treat you like a friend  i set forth on the third from the north to london my only object in taking this long journey was to see norah i had been suffering for many weary weeks past such remorse as only miserable women like me can feel perhaps the suffering weakened me perhaps it roused some old forgotten tendernessgod knowsi cant explain it i can only tell you that i began to think of norah by day and to dream of norah by night till i was almost heartbroken i have no better reason than this to give for running all the risks which i ran and coming to london to see her i dont wish to claim more for myself than i deserve i dont wish to tell you i was the reformed and repenting creature whom you might have approved i had only one feeling in me that i know of i wanted to put my arms round norahs neck and cry my heart out on norahs bosom childish enough i dare say something might have come of it nothing might have come of itwho knows  i had no means of finding norah without your assistance however you might disapprove of what i had done i thought you would not refuse to help me to find my sister when i lay down last night in my strange bed i said to myself i will ask miss garth for my fathers sake and my mothers sake to tell me you dont know what a comfort i felt in that thought how should you what do good women like you know of miserable sinners like me all you know is that you pray for us at church  well i fell asleep happily that nightfor the first time since my marriage when the morning came i paid the penalty of daring to be happy only for one night when the morning came a letter came with it which told me that my bitterest enemy on earth you have meddled sufficiently with my affairs to know what enemy i mean had revenged herself on me in my absence in following the impulse which led me to my sister i had gone to my ruin  the mischief was beyond all present remedy when i received the news of it whatever had happened whatever might happen i made up my mind to persist in my resolution of seeing norah before i did anything else i suspected you of being concerned in the disaster which had overtaken mebecause i felt positively certain at aldborough that you and mrs lecount had written to each other but i never suspected norah if i lay on my deathbed at this moment i could say with a safe conscience i never suspected norah  so i went this morning to westmor eland house to ask you for my sisters address and to acknowledge plainly that i suspected you of being again in correspondence with mrs lecount  when i inquired for you at the door they told me you had gone out but that you were expected back before long they asked me if i would see your sister who was then in the schoolroom i desired that your sister should on no account be disturbed my business was not with her but with you i begged to be allowed to wait in a room by myself until you returned  they showed me into the double room on the groundfloor divided by curtainsas it was when i last remember it there was a fire in the outer division of the room but none in the inner and for that reason i suppose the curtains were drawn the servant was very civil and attentive to me i have learned to be thankful for civility and attention and i spoke to her as cheerfully as i could i said to her i shall see miss garth here as she comes up to the door and i can beckon her in through the long window the servant said i could do so if you came that way but that you let yourself in sometimes with your own key by the backgarden gate and if you did this she would take care to let you know of my visit i mention these trifles to show you that there was no premeditated deceit in my mind when i came to the house  i waited a weary time and you never came i dont know whether my impatience made me think so or whether the large fire burning made the room really as hot as i felt it to bei only know that after a while i passed through the curtains into the inner room to try the cooler atmosphere  i walked to the long window which leads into the back garden to look out and almost at the same time i heard the door openedthe door of the room i had just left and your voice and the voice of some other woman a stranger to me talking the stranger was one of the parlorboarders i dare say i gathered from the first words you exchanged together that you had met in the passageshe on her way downstairs and you on your way in from the back garden her next question and your next answer informed me that this person was a friend of my sisters who felt a strong interest in her and who knew that you had just returned from a visit to norah so far i only hesitated to show myself because i shrank in my painful situation from facing a stranger but when i heard my own name immediately afterward on your lips and on hers then i purposely came nearer to the curtain between us and purposely listened  a mean action you will say call it mean if you like what better can you expect from such a woman as i am  you were always famous for your memory there is no necessity for my repeating the words you spoke to your friend and the words your friend spoke to you hardly an hour since when you read these lines you will know as well as i know what those words told me i ask for no particulars i will take all your reasons and all your excuses for granted it is enough for me to know that you and mr pendril have been searching for me again and that norah is in the conspiracy this time to reclaim me in spite of myself it is enough for me to know that my letter to my sister has been turned into a trap to catch me and that mrs lecounts revenge has accomplished its object by means of information received from norahs lips  shall i tell you what i suffered when i heard these things no it would only be a waste of time to tell you whatever i suffer i deserve itdont i  i waited in that inner roomknowing my own violent temper and not trusting myself to see you after what i had heardi waited in that inner room trembling lest the servant should tell you of my visit before i could find an opportunity of leaving the house no such misfortune happened the servant no doubt heard the voices upstairs and supposed that we had met each other in the passage i dont know how long or how short a time it was before you left the room to go and take off your bonnetyou went and your friend went with you i raised the long window softly and stepped into the back garden the way by which you returned to the house was the way by which i left it no blame attaches to the servant as usual where i am concerned nobody is to blame but me  time enough has passed now to quiet my mind a little you know how strong i am you remember how i used to fight against all my illnesses when i was a child now i am a woman i fight against my miseries in the same way dont pity me miss garth dont pity me  i have no harsh feeling against norah the hope i had of seeing her is a hope taken from me the consolation i had in writing to her is a consolation denied me for the future i am cut to the heart but i have no angry feeling toward my sister she means well poor souli dare say she means well it would distress her if she knew what has happened dont tell her conceal my visit and burn my letter  a last word to yourself and i have done  if i rightly understand my present situation your spies are still searching for me to just as little purpose as they searched at york dismiss themyou are wasting your money to no purpose if you discovered me tomorrow what could you do my position has altered i am no longer the poor outcast girl the vagabond public performer whom you once hunted after i have done what i told you i would doi have made the general sense of propriety my accomplice this time do you know who i am i am a respectable married woman accountable for my actions to nobody under heaven but my husband i have got a place in the world and a name in the world at last even the law which is the friend of all you respectable people has recognized my existence and has become my friend too the archbishop of canterbury gave me his license to be married and the vicar of aldborough performed the service if i found your spies following me in the street and if i chose to claim protection from them the law would acknowledge my claim you forget what wonders my wickedness has done for me it has made nobodys child somebodys wife  if you will give these considerations their due weight if you will exert your excellent common sense i have no fear of being obliged to appeal to my newlyfound friend and protectorthe law you will feel by this time that you have meddled with me at last to some purpose i am estranged from norahi am discovered by my husbandi am defeated by mrs lecount you have driven me to the last extremity you have strengthened me to fight the battle of my life with the resolution which only a lost and friendless woman can feel badly as your schemes have prospered they have not proved totally useless after all  i have no more to say if you ever speak about me to norah tell her that a day may come when she will see me againthe day when we two sisters have recovered our natural rights the day when i put norahs fortune into norahs hand  those are my last words remember them the next time you feel tempted to meddle with me again  magdalen vanstone   iv  from mr loscombe to mrs noel vanstone  lincolns inn november 6th  dear madamthis mornings post has doubtless brought you the same shocking news which it has brought to me you must know by this time that a terrible affliction has befallen youthe affliction of your husbands sudden death  i am on the point of starting for the north to make all needful inquiries and to perform whatever duties i may with propriety undertake as solicitor to the deceased gentleman let me earnestly recommend you not to follow me to baliol cottage until i have had time to write to you first and to give you such advice as i cannot through ignorance of all the circumstances pretend to offer now you may rely on my writing after my arrival in scotland by the first post i remain dear madam faithfully yours  john loscombe   v  from mr pendril to miss garth  serle street november 6th  dear miss garthi return you mrs noel vanstones letter i can understand your mortification at the tone in which it is written and your distress at the manner in which this unhappy woman has interpreted the conversation that she overheard at your house i cannot honestly add that i lament what has happened my opinion has never altered since the comberaven time i believe mrs noel vanstone to be one of the most reckless desperate and perverted women living and any circumstances that estrange her from her sister are circumstances which i welcome for her sisters sake  there cannot be a moments doubt on the course you ought to follow in this matter even mrs noel vanstone herself acknowledges the propriety of sparing her sister additional and unnecessary distress by all means keep miss vanstone in ignorance of the visit to kensington and of the letter which has followed it it would be not only unwise but absolutely cruel to enlighten her if we had any remedy to apply or even any hope to offer we might feel some hesitation in keeping our secret but there is no remedy and no hope mrs noel vanstone is perfectly justified in the view she takes of her own position neither you nor i can assert the smallest right to control her  i have already taken the necessary measures for putting an end to our useless inquiries in a few days i will write to miss vanstone and will do my best to tranquilize her mind on the subject of her sister if i can find no sufficient excuse to satisfy her it will be better she should think we have discovered nothing than that she should know the truth believe me most truly yours  william pendril   vi  from mr loscombe to mrs noel vanstone  lincolns inn november 15th  dear madamin compliance with your request i now proceed to communicate to you in writing what but for the calamity which has so recently befallen you i should have preferred communicating by word of mouth be pleased to consider this letter as strictly confidential between yourself and me  i inclose as you desire a copy of the will executed by your late husband on the third of this month there can be no question of the genuineness of the original document i protested as a matter of form against admiral bartrams solicitor assuming a position of authority at baliol cottage but he took the position nevertheless acting as legal representative of the sole executor under the second will i am bound to say i should have done the same myself in his place  the serious question follows what can we do for the best in your interests the will executed under my professional superintendence on the thirtieth of september last is at present superseded and revoked by the second and later will executed on the third of november can we dispute this document  i doubt the possibility of disputing the new will on the face of it it is no doubt irregularly expressed but it is dated signed and witnessed as the law directs and the perfectly simple and straightforward provisions that it contains are in no respect that i can see technically open to attack  this being the case can we dispute the will on the ground that it has been executed when the testator was not in a fit state to dispose of his own property or when the testator was subjected to undue and improper influence  in the first of these cases the medical evidence would put an obstacle in our way we cannot assert that previous illness had weakened the testators mind it is clear that he died suddenly as the doctors had all along declared he would die of disease of the heart he was out walking in his garden as usual on the day of his death he ate a hearty dinner none of the persons in his service noticed any change in him he was a little more irritable with them than usual but that was all it is impossible to attack the state of his faculties there is no case to go into court with so far  can we declare that he acted under undue influence or in plainer terms under the influence of mrs lecount  there are serious difficulties again in the way of taking this course we cannot assert for example that mrs lecount has assumed a place in the will which she has no fair claim to occupy she has cunningly limited her own legacy not only to what is fairly due her but to what the late mr michael vanstone himself had the intention of leaving her if i were examined on the subject i should be compelled to acknowledge that i had heard him express this intention myself it is only the truth to say that i have heard him express it more than once there is no point of attack in mrs lecounts legacy and there is no point of attack in your late husbands choice of an executor he has made the wise choice and the natural choice of the oldest and trustiest friend he had in the world  one more consideration remainsthe most important which i have yet approached and therefore the consideration which i have reserved to the last on the thirtieth of september the testator executes a will leaving his widow sole executrix with a legacy of eighty thousand pounds on the third of november following he expressly revokes this will and leaves another in its stead in which his widow is never once mentioned and in which the whole residue of his estate after payment of one comparatively trifling legacy is left to a friend  it rests entirely with you to say whether any valid reason can or can not be produced to explain such an extraordinary proceeding as this if no reason can be assignedand i know of none myselfi think we have a point here which deserves our careful consideration for it may be a point which is open to attack pray understand that i am now appealing to you solely as a lawyer who is obliged to look all possible eventualities in the face i have no wish to intrude on your private affairs i have no wish to write a word which could be construed into any indirect reflection on yourself  if you tell me that so far as you know your husband capriciously struck you out of his will without assignable reason or motive for doing so and without other obvious explanation of his conduct than that he acted in this matter entirely under the influence of mrs lecount i will immediately take counsels opinion touching the propriety of disputing the will on this ground if on the other hand you tell me that there are reasons known to yourself though unknown to me for not taking the course i propose i will accept that intimation without troubling you unless you wish it to explain yourself further in this latter event i will write to you again for i shall then have something more to say which may greatly surprise you on the subject of the will  faithfully yours  john loscombe   vii  from mrs noel vanstone to mr loscombe  november 16th  dear siraccept my best thanks for the kindness and consideration with which you have treated me and let the anxieties under which i am now suffering plead my excuse if i reply to your letter without ceremony in the fewest possible words  i have my own reasons for not hesitating to answer your question in the negative it is impossible for us to go to law as you propose on the subject of the will  believe me dear sir yours gratefully  magdalen vanstone   viii  from mr loscombe to mrs noel vanstone  lincolns inn november 17th  dear madami beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter answering my proposal in the negative for reasons of your own under these circumstanceson which i offer no commenti beg to perform my promise of again communicating with you on the subject of your late husbands will  be so kind as to look at your copy of the document you will find that the clause which devises the whole residue of your husbands estate to admiral bartram ends in these terms to be by him applied to such uses as he may think fit  simple as they may seem to you these are very remarkable words in the first place no practical lawyer would have used them in drawing your husbands will in the second place they are utterly useless to serve any plain straightforward purpose the legacy is left unconditionally to the admiral and in the same breath he is told that he may do what he likes with it the phrase points clearly to one of two conclusions it has either dropped from the writers pen in pure ignorance or it has been carefully set where it appears to serve the purpose of a snare i am firmly persuaded that the latter explanation is the right one the words are expressly intended to mislead some personyourself in all probabilityand the cunning which has put them to that use is a cunning which as constantly happens when uninstructed persons meddle with law has overreached itself my thirty years experience reads those words in a sense exactly opposite to the sense which they are intended to convey i say that admiral bartram is not free to apply his legacy to such purposes as he may think fit i believe he is privately controlled by a supplementary document in the shape of a secret trust  i can easily explain to you what i mean by a secret trust it is usually contained in the form of a letter from a testator to his executors privately informing them of testamentary intentions on his part which he has not thought proper openly to acknowledge in his will i leave you a hundred pounds and i write a private letter enjoining you on taking the legacy not to devote it to your own purposes but to give it to some third person whose name i have my own reasons for not mentioning in my will that is a secret trust  if i am right in my own persuasion that such a document as i here describe is at this moment in admiral bartrams possessiona persuasion based in the first instance on the extraordinary words that i have quoted to you and in the second instance on purely legal considerations with which it is needless to incumber my letterif i am right in this opinion the discovery of the secret trust would be in all probability a most important discovery to your interests i will not trouble you with technical reasons or with references to my experience in these matters which only a professional man could understand i will merely say that i dont give up your cause as utterly lost until the conviction now impressed on my own mind is proved to be wrong  i can add no more while this important question still remains involved in doubt neither can i suggest any means of solving that doubt if the existence of the trust was proved and if the nature of the stipulations contained in it was made known to me i could then say positively what the legal chances were of your being able to set up a case on the strength of it and i could also tell you whether i should or should not feel justified in personally undertaking that case under a private arrangement with yourself  as things are i can make no arrangement and offer no advice i can only put you confidentially in possession of my private opinion leaving you entirely free to draw your own inferences from it and regretting that i cannot write more confidently and more definitely than i have written here all that i could conscientiously say on this very difficult and delicate subject i have said  believe me dear madam faithfully yours  john loscombe  psi omitted one consideration in my last letter which i may mention here in order to show you that no point in connection with the case has escaped me if it had been possible to show that mr vanstone was domiciled in scotland at the time of his death we might have asserted your interests by means of the scotch law which does not allow a husband the power of absolutely disinheriting his wife but it is impossible to assert that mr vanstone was legally domiciled in scotland he came there as a visitor only he occupied a furnished house for the season and he never expressed either by word or deed the slightest intention of settling permanently in the north   ix  from mrs noel vanstone to mr loscombe  dear siri have read your letter more than once with the deepest interest and attention and the oftener i read it the more firmly i believe that there is really such a letter as you mention in admiral bartrams hands  it is my interest that the discovery should be made and i at once acknowledge to you that i am determined to find the means of secretly and certainly making it my resolution rests on other motives than the motives which you might naturally suppose would influence me i only tell you this in case you feel inclined to remonstrate there is good reason for what i say when i assure you that remonstrance will be useless  i ask for no assistance in this matter i will trouble nobody for advice you shall not be involved in any rash proceedings on my part whatever danger there may be i will risk it whatever delays may happen i will bear them patiently i am lonely and friendless and surely troubled in mind but i am strong enough to win my way through worse trials than these my spirits will rise again and my time will come if that secret trust is in admiral bartrams possessionwhen you next see me you shall see me with it in my own hands yours gratefully  magdalen vanstone      the sixth scene  st johns wood    chapter i  it wanted little more than a fortnight to christmas but the weather showed no signs yet of the frost and snow conventionally associated with the coming season the atmosphere was unnaturally warm and the old year was dying feebly in sapping rain and enervating mist  toward the close of the december afternoon magdalen sat alone in the lodging which she had occupied since her arrival in london the fire burned sluggishly in the narrow little grate the view of the wet houses and soaking gardens opposite was darkening fast and the bell of the suburban muffinboy tinkled in the distance drearily sitting close over the fire with a little money lying loose in her lap magdalen absently shifted the coins to and fro on the smooth surface of her dress incessantly altering their positions toward each other as if they were pieces of a childs puzzle which she was trying to put together the dim firelight flaming up on her faintly from time to time showed changes which would have told their own tale sadly to friends of former days her dress had become loose through the wasting of her figure but she had not cared to alter it the old restlessness in her movements the old mobility in her expression appeared no more her face passively maintained its haggard composure its changeless unnatural calm mr pendril might have softened his hard sentence on her if he had seen her now and mrs lecount in the plenitude of her triumph might have pitied her fallen enemy at last  hardly four months had passed since the weddingday at aldborough and the penalty for that day was paid alreadypaid in unavailing remorse in hopeless isolation in irremediable defeat let this be said for her let the truth which has been told of the fault be told of the expiation as well let it be recorded of her that she enjoyed no secret triumph on the day of her success the horror of herself with which her own act had inspired her had risen to its climax when the design of her marriage was achieved she had never suffered in secret as she suffered when the comberaven money was left to her in her husbands will she had never felt the means taken to accomplish her end so unutterably degrading to herself as she felt them on the day when the end was reached out of that feeling had grown the remorse which had hurried her to seek pardon and consolation in her sisters love never since it had first entered her heart never since she had first felt it sacred to her at her fathers grave had the purpose to which she had vowed herself so nearly lost its hold on her as at this time never might norahs influence have achieved such good as on the day when that influence was lostthe day when the fatal words were overheard at miss garthsthe day when the fatal letter from scotland told of mrs lecounts revenge  the harm was done the chance was gone time and hope alike had both passed her by  faintly and more faintly the inner voices now pleaded with her to pause on the downward way the discovery which had poisoned her heart with its first distrust of her sister the tidings which had followed it of her husbands death the sting of mrs lecounts triumph felt through all had done their work the remorse which had embittered her married life was deadened now to a dull despair it was too late to make the atonement of confessiontoo late to lay bare to the miserable husband the deeper secrets that had once lurked in the heart of the miserable wife innocent of all thought of the hideous treachery which mrs lecount had imputed to hershe was guilty of knowing how his health was broken when she married him guilty of knowing when he left her the comberaven money that the accident of a moment harmless to other men might place his life in jeopardy and effect her release his death had told her thishad told her plainly what she had shrunk in his lifetime from openly acknowledging to herself from the dull torment of that reproach from the dreary wretchedness of doubting everybody even to norah herself from the bitter sense of her defeated schemes from the blank solitude of her friendless lifewhat refuge was left but one refuge now she turned to the relentless purpose which was hurrying her to her ruin and cried to it with the daring of her despairdrive me on  for days and days together she had bent her mind on the one object which occupied it since she had received the lawyers letter for days and days together she had toiled to meet the first necessity of her positionto find a means of discovering the secret trust there was no hope this time of assistance from captain wragge long practice had made the old militiaman an adept in the art of vanishing the plow of the moral agriculturist left no furrowsnot a trace of him was to be found mr loscombe was too cautious to commit himself to an active course of any kind he passively maintained his opinions and left the rest to his clienthe desired to know nothing until the trust was placed in his hands magdalens interests were now in magdalens own sole care risk or no risk what she did next she must do by herself  the prospect had not daunted her alone she had calculated the chances that might be tried alone she was now determined to make the attempt  the time has come she said to herself as she sat over the fire i must sound louisa first  she collected the scattered coins in her lap and placed them in a little heap on the table then rose and rang the bell the landlady answered it  is my servant downstairs inquired magdalen  yes maam she is having her tea  when she has done say i want her up here wait a moment you will find your money on the tablethe money i owe you for last week can you find it or would you like to have a candle  its rather dark maam  magdalen lit a candle what notice must i give you she asked as she put the candle on the table before i leave  a week is the usual notice maam i hope you have no objection to make to the house  none whatever i only ask the question because i may be obliged to leave these lodgings rather sooner than i anticipated is the money right  quite right maam here is your receipt  thank you dont forget to send louisa to me as soon as she has done her tea  the landlady withdrew as soon as she was alone again magdalen extinguished the candle and drew an empty chair close to her own chair on the hearth this done she resumed her former place and waited until louisa appeared there was doubt in her face as she sat looking mechanically into the fire a poor chance she thought to herself but poor as it is a chance that i must try  in ten minutes more louisas meek knock was softly audible outside she was surprised on entering the room to find no other light in it than the light of the fire  will you have the candles maam she inquired respectfully  we will have candles if you wish for them yourself replied magdalen not otherwise i have something to say to you when i have said it you shall decide whether we sit together in the dark or in the light  louisa waited near the door and listened to those strange words in silent astonishment  come here said magdalen pointing to the empty chair come here and sit down  louisa advanced and timidly removed the chair from its position at her mistresss side magdalen instantly drew it back again no she said come closercome close by me after a moments hesitation louisa obeyed  i ask you to sit near me pursued magdalen because i wish to speak to you on equal terms whatever distinctions there might once have been between us are now at an end i am a lonely woman thrown helpless on my own resources without rank or place in the world i may or may not keep you as my friend as mistress and maid the connection between us must come to an end  oh maam dont dont say that pleaded louisa faintly  magdalen sorrowfully and steadily went on  when you first came to me she resumed i thought i should not like you i have learned to like youi have learned to be grateful to you from first to last you have been faithful and good to me the least i can do in return is not to stand in the way of your future prospects  dont send me away maam said louisa imploringly if you can only help me with a little money now and then ill wait for my wagesi will indeed  magdalen took her hand and went on as sorrowfully and as steadily as before  my future life is all darkness all uncertainty she said the next step i may take may lead me to my prosperity or may lead me to my ruin can i ask you to share such a prospect as this if your future was as uncertain as mine isif you too were a friendless woman thrown on the worldmy conscience might be easy in letting you cast your lot with mine i might accept your attachment for i might feel i was not wronging you how can i feel this in your case you have a future to look to you are an excellent servant you can get another placea far better place than mine you can refer to me and if the character i give is not considered sufficient you can refer to the mistress you served before me  at the instant when that reference to the girls last employer escaped magdalens lips louisa snatched her hand away and started up affrightedly from her chair there was a moments silence both mistress and maid were equally taken by surprise  magdalen was the first to recover herself  is it getting too dark she asked significantly are you going to light the candles after all  louisa drew back into the dimmest corner of the room  you suspect me maam she answered out of the darkness in a breathless whisper who has told you how did you find out she stopped and burst into tears i deserve your suspicion she said struggling to compose herself i cant deny it to you you have treated me so kindly you have made me so fond of you forgive me mrs vanstonei am a wretch i have deceived you  come here and sit down by me again said magdalen comeor i will get up myself and bring you back  louisa slowly returned to her place dim as the firelight was she seemed to fear it she held her handkerchief over her face and shrank from her mistress as she seated herself again in the chair  you are wrong in thinking that any one has betrayed you to me said magdalen all that i know of you is what your own looks and ways have told me you have had some secret trouble weighing on your mind ever since you have been in my service i confess i have spoken with the wish to find out more of you and your past life than i have found out yetnot because i am curious but because i have my secret troubles too are you an unhappy woman like me if you are i will take you into my confidence if you have nothing to tell meif you choose to keep your secreti dont blame you i only say let us part i wont ask how you have deceived me i will only remember that you have been an honest and faithful and competent servant while i have employed you and i will say as much in your favor to any new mistress you like to send to me  she waited for the reply for a moment and only for a moment louisa hesitated the girls nature was weak but not depraved she was honestly attached to her mistress and she spoke with a courage which magdalen had not expected from her  if you send me away maam she said i wont take my character from you till i have told you the truth i wont return your kindness by deceiving you a second time did my master ever tell you how he engaged me  no i never asked him and he never told me  he engaged me maam with a written character  yes  the character was a false one  magdalen drew back in amazement the confession she heard was not the confession she had anticipated  did your mistress refuse to give you a character she asked why  louisa dropped on her knees and hid her face in her mistresss lap dont ask me she said im a miserable degraded creature im not fit to be in the same room with you magdalen bent over her and whispered a question in her ear louisa whispered back the one sad word of reply  has he deserted you asked magdalen after waiting a moment and thinking first  no  do you love him  dearly  the remembrance of her own loveless marriage stung magdalen to the quick  for gods sake dont kneel to me she cried passionately if there is a degraded woman in this room i am the womannot you  she raised the girl by main force from her knees and put her back in the chair they both waited a little in silence keeping her hand on louisas shoulder magdalen seated herself again and looked with unutterable bitterness of sorrow into the dying fire oh she thought what happy women there are in the world wives who love their husbands mothers who are not ashamed to own their children are you quieter she asked gently addressing louisa once more can you answer me if i ask you something else where is the child  the child is out at nurse  does the father help to support it  he does all he can maam  what is he is he in service is he in a trade  his father is a mastercarpenterhe works in his fathers yard  if he has got work why has he not married you  it is his fathers fault maamnot his his father has no pity on us he would be turned out of house and home if he married me  can he get no work elsewhere  its hard to get good work in london maam there are so many in londonthey take the bread out of each others mouths if we had only had the money to emigrate he would have married me long since  would he marry you if you had the money now  i am sure he would maam he could get plenty of work in australia and double and treble the wages he gets here he is trying hard and i am trying hard to save a little toward iti put by all i can spare from my child but it is so little if we live for years to come there seems no hope for us i know i have done wrong every wayi know i dont deserve to be happy but how could i let my child sufferi was obliged to go to service my mistress was hard on me and my health broke down in trying to live by my needle i would never have deceived anybody by a false character if there had been another chance for me i was alone and helpless maam and i can only ask you to forgive me  ask better women than i am said magdalen sadly i am only fit to feel for you and i do feel for you with all my heart in your place i should have gone into service with a false character too say no more of the pastyou dont know how you hurt me in speaking of it talk of the future i think i can help you and do you no harm i think you can help me and do me the greatest of all services in return wait and you shall hear what i mean suppose you were marriedhow much would it cost for you and your husband to emigrate  louisa mentioned the cost of a steerage passage to australia for a man and his wife she spoke in low hopeless tones moderate as the sum was it looked like unattainable wealth in her eyes  magdalen started in her chair and took the girls hand once more  louisa she said earnestly if i gave you the money what would you do for me in return  the proposal seemed to strike louisa speechless with astonishment she trembled violently and said nothing magdalen repeated her words  oh maam do you mean it said the girl do you really mean it  yes replied magdalen i really mean it what would you do for me in return  do repeated louisa oh what is there i would not do she tried to kiss her mistresss hand but magdalen would not permit it she resolutely almost roughly drew her hand away  i am laying you under no obligation she said we are serving each otherthat is all sit quiet and let me think  for the next ten minutes there was silence in the room at the end of that time magdalen took out her watch and held it close to the grate there was just firelight enough to show her the hour it was close on six oclock  are you composed enough to go downstairs and deliver a message she asked rising from her chair as she spoke to louisa again it is a very simple messageit is only to tell the boy that i want a cab as soon as he can get me one i must go out immediately you shall know why later in the evening i have much more to say to you but there is no time to say it now when i am gone bring your work up here and wait for my return i shall be back before bedtime  without another word of explanation she hurriedly lit a candle and withdrew into the bedroom to put on her bonnet and shawl    chapter ii  between nine and ten o clock the same evening louisa waiting anxiously heard the longexpected knock at the house door she ran downstairs at once and let her mistress in  magdalens face was flushed she showed far more agitation on returning to the house than she had shown on leaving it keep your place at the table she said to louisa impatiently but lay aside your work i want you to attend carefully to what i am going to say  louisa obeyed magdalen seated herself at the opposite side of the table and moved the candles so as to obtain a clear and uninterrupted view of her servants face  have you noticed a respectable elderly woman she began abruptly who has been here once or twice in the last fortnight to pay me a visit  yes maam i think i let her in the second time she came an elderly person named mrs attwood  that is the person i mean mrs attwood is mr loscombes housekeeper not the housekeeper at his private residence but the housekeeper at his offices in lincolns inn i promised to go and drink tea with her some evening this week and i have been tonight it is strange of me is it not to be on these familiar terms with a woman in mrs attwoods situation  louisa made no answer in words her face spoke for her she could hardly avoid thinking it strange  i had a motive for making friends with mrs attwood magdalen went on she is a widow with a large family of daughters her daughters are all in service one of them is an underhousemaid in the service of admiral bartram at st cruxinthemarsh i found that out from mrs attwoods master and as soon as i arrived at the discovery i privately determined to make mrs attwoods acquaintance stranger still is it not  louisa began to look a little uneasy her mistresss manner was at variance with her mistresss wordsit was plainly suggestive of something startling to come  what attraction mrs attwood finds in my society magdalen continued i cannot presume to say i can only tell you she has seen better days she is an educated person and she may like my society on that account at any rate she has readily met my advances toward her what attraction i find in this good woman on my side is soon told i have a great curiosityan unaccountable curiosity you will thinkabout the present course of household affairs at st cruxinthemarsh mrs attwoods daughter is a good girl and constantly writes to her mother her mother is proud of the letters and proud of the girl and is ready enough to talk about her daughter and her daughters place that is mrs attwoods attraction to me you understand so far  yeslouisa understood magdalen went on thanks to mrs attwood and mrs attwoods daughter she said i know some curious particulars already of the household at st crux servants tongues and servants lettersas i need not tell youare oftener occupied with their masters and mistresses than their masters and mistresses suppose the only mistress at st crux is the housekeeper but there is a masteradmiral bartram he appears to be a strange old man whose whims and fancies amuse his servants as well as his friends one of his fancies the only one we need trouble ourselves to notice is that he had men enough about him when he was living at sea and that now he is living on shore he will be waited on by womenservants alone the one man in the house is an old sailor who has been all his life with his masterhe is a kind of pensioner at st crux and has little or nothing to do with the housework the other servants indoors are all women and instead of a footman to wait on him at dinner the admiral has a parlormaid the parlormaid now at st crux is engaged to be married and as soon as her master can suit himself she is going away these discoveries i made some days since but when i saw mrs attwood tonight she had received another letter from her daughter in the interval and that letter has helped me to find out something more the housekeeper is at her wits end to find a new servant her master insists on youth and good lookshe leaves everything else to the housekeeperbut he will have that all the inquiries made in the neighborhood have failed to produce the sort of parlormaid whom the admiral wants if nothing can be done in the next fortnight or three weeks the housekeeper will advertise in the times and will come to london herself to see the applicants and to make strict personal inquiry into their characters  louisa looked at her mistress more attentively than ever the expression of perplexity left her face and a shade of disappointment appeared there in its stead bear in mind what i have said pursued magdalen and wait a minute more while i ask you some questions dont think you understand me yeti can assure you you dont understand me have you always lived in service as ladys maid  no maam  have you ever lived as parlormaid  only in one place maam and not for long there  i suppose you lived long enough to learn your duties  yes maam  what were your duties besides waiting at table  i had to show visitors in  yes and what else  i had the plate and the glass to look after and the tablelinen was all under my care i had to answer all the bells except in the bedrooms there were other little odds and ends sometimes to do  but your regular duties were the duties you have just mentioned  yes maam  how long ago is it since you lived in service as a parlormaid  a little better than two years maam  i suppose you have not forgotten how to wait at table and clean plate and the rest of it in that time  at this question louisas attention which had been wandering more and more during the progress of magdalens inquiries wandered away altogether her gathering anxieties got the better of her discretion and even of her timidity instead of answering her mistress she suddenly and confusedly ventured on a question of her own  i beg your pardon maam she said did you mean me to offer for the parlormaids place at st crux  you replied magdalen certainly not have you forgotten what i said to you in this room before i went out i mean you to be married and go to australia with your husband and your child you have not waited as i told you to hear me explain myself you have drawn your own conclusions and you have drawn them wrong i asked a question just now which you have not answeredi asked if you had forgotten your parlormaids duties  oh no maam louisa had replied rather unwillingly thus far she answered readily and confidently now  could you teach the duties to another servant asked magdalen  yes maameasily if she was quick and attentive  could you teach the duties to me  louisa started and changed color you maam she exclaimed half in incredulity half in alarm  yes said magdalen could you qualify me to take the parlormaids place at st crux  plain as those words were the bewilderment which they produced in louisas mind seemed to render her incapable of comprehending her mistresss proposal you maam she repeated vacantly  i shall perhaps help you to understand this extraordinary project of mine said magdalen if i tell you plainly what the object of it is do you remember what i said to you about mr vanstones will when you came here from scotland to join me  yes maam you told me you had been left out of the will altogether im sure my fellowservant would never have been one of the witnesses if she had known  never mind that now i dont blame your fellowservanti blame nobody but mrs lecount let me go on with what i was saying it is not at all certain that mrs lecount can do me the mischief which mrs lecount intended there is a chance that my lawyer mr loscombe may be able to gain me what is fairly my due in spite of the will the chance turns on my discovering a letter which mr loscombe believes and which i believe to be kept privately in admiral bartrams possession i have not the least hope of getting at that letter if i make the attempt in my own person mrs lecount has poisoned the admirals mind against me and mr vanstone has given him a secret to keep from me if i wrote to him he would not answer my letter if i went to his house the door would be closed in my face i must find my way into st crux as a strangeri must be in a position to look about the house unsuspectedi must be there with plenty of time on my hands all the circumstances are in my favor if i am received into the house as a servant and as a servant i mean to go  but you are a lady maam objected louisa in the greatest perplexity the servants at st crux would find you out  i am not at all afraid of their finding me out said magdalen i know how to disguise myself in other peoples characters more cleverly than you suppose leave me to face the chances of discoverythat is my risk let us talk of nothing now but what concerns you dont decide yet whether you will or will not give me the help i want wait and hear first what the help is you are quick and clever at your needle can you make me the sort of gown which it is proper for a servant to wearand can you alter one of my best silk dresses so as to make it fit yourself in a weeks time  i think i could get them done in a week maam but why am i to wear  wait a little and you will see i shall give the landlady her weeks notice tomorrow in the interval while you are making the dresses i can be learning the parlormaids duties when the houseservant here has brought up the dinner and when you and i are alone in the roominstead of your waiting on me as usual i will wait on you i am quite serious dont interrupt me whatever i can learn besides without hindering you i will practice carefully at every opportunity when the week is over and the dresses are done we will leave this place and go into other lodgingsyou as the mistress and i as the maid  i should be found out maam interposed louisa trembling at the prospect before her i am not a lady  and i am said magdalen bitterly shall i tell you what a lady is a lady is a woman who wears a silk gown and has a sense of her own importance i shall put the gown on your back and the sense in your head you speak good english you are naturally quiet and selfrestrained if you can only conquer your timidity i have not the least fear of you there will be time enough in the new lodging for you to practice your character and for me to practice mine there will be time enough to make some more dressesanother gown for me and your weddingdress which i mean to give you for yourself i shall have the newspaper sent every day when the advertisement appears i shall answer itin any name i can take on the spur of the moment in your name if you like to lend it to me and when the housekeeper asks me for my character i shall refer her to you she will see you in the position of mistress and me in the position of maidno suspicion can possibly enter her mind unless you put it there if you only have the courage to follow my instructions and to say what i shall tell you to say the interview will be over in ten minutes  you frighten me maam said louisa still trembling you take my breath away with surprise courage where shall i find courage  where i keep it for you said magdalenin the passagemoney to australia look at the new prospect which gives you a husband and restores you to your childand you will find your courage there  louisas sad face brightened louisas faint heart beat quick a spark of her mistresss spirit flew up into her eyes as she thought of the golden future  if you accept my proposal pursued magdalen you can be asked in church at once if you like i promise you the money on the day when the advertisement appears in the newspaper the risk of the housekeepers rejecting me is my risknot yours my good looks are sadly gone off i know but i think i can still hold my place against the other servantsi think i can still look the parlormaid whom admiral bartram wants there is nothing for you to fear in this matter i should not have mentioned it if there had been the only danger is the danger of my being discovered at st crux and that falls entirely on me by the time i am in the admirals house you will be married and the ship will be taking you to your new life  louisas face now brightening with hope now clouding again with fear showed plain signs of the struggle which it cost her to decide she tried to gain time she attempted confusedly to speak a few words of gratitude but her mistress silenced her  you owe me no thanks said magdalen i tell you again we are only helping each other i have very little money but it is enough for your purpose and i give it you freely i have led a wretched life i have made others wretched about me i cant even make you happy except by tempting you to a new deceit there there its not your fault worse women than you are will help me if you refuse decide as you like but dont be afraid of taking the money if i succeed i shall not want it if i fail  she stopped rose abruptly from her chair and hid her face from louisa by walking away to the fireplace  if i fail she resumed warming her foot carelessly at the fender all the money in the world will be of no use to me never mind whynever mind methink of yourself i wont take advantage of the confession you have made to me i wont influence you against your will do as you yourself think best but remember one thingmy mind is made up nothing you can say or do will change it  her sudden removal from the table the altered tones of her voice as she spoke the last words appeared to renew louisas hesitation she clasped her hands together in her lap and wrung them hard this has come on me very suddenly maam said the girl i am sorely tempted to say yes and yet i am almost afraid  take the night to consider it interposed magdalen keeping her face persistently turned toward the fire and tell me what you have decided to do when you come into my room tomorrow morning i shall want no help tonighti can undress myself you are not so strong as i am you are tired i dare say dont sit up on my account goodnight louisa and pleasant dreams  her voice sank lower and lower as she spoke those kind words she sighed heavily and leaning her arm on the mantelpiece laid her head on it with a reckless weariness miserable to see louisa had not left the room as she supposedlouisa came softly to her side and kissed her hand magdalen started but she made no attempt this time to draw her hand away the sense of her own horrible isolation subdued her at the touch of the servants lips her proud heart melted her eyes filled with burning tears dont distress me she said faintly the time for kindness has gone by it only overpowers me now goodnight  when the morning came the affirmative answer which magdalen had anticipated was the answer given  on that day the landlady received her weeks notice to quit and louisas needle flew fast through the stitches of the parlormaids dress  the end of the sixth scene     between the scenes  progress of the story through the post   i  from miss garth to mr pendril  westmoreland house january 3d 1848  dear mr pendrili write as you kindly requested to report how norah is going on and to tell you what changes i see for the better in the state of her mind on the subject of her sister  i cannot say that she is becoming resigned to magdalens continued silencei know her faithful nature too well to say it i can only tell you that she is beginning to find relief from the heavy pressure of sorrow and suspense in new thoughts and new hopes i doubt if she has yet realized this in her own mind but i see the result although she is not conscious of it herself i see her heart opening to the consolation of another interest and another love she has not said a word to me on the subject nor have i said a word to her but as certainly as i know that mr george bartrams visits have lately grown more and more frequent to the family at portland placeso certainly i can assure you that norah is finding a relief under her suspense which is not of my bringing and a hope in the future which i have not taught her to feel  it is needless for me to say that i tell you this in the strictest confidence god knows whether the happy prospect which seems to me to be just dawning will grow brighter or not as time goes on the oftener i see mr george bartramand he has called on me more than oncethe stronger my liking for him grows to my poor judgment he seems to be a gentleman in the highest and truest sense of the word if i could live to see norah his wife i should almost feel that i had lived long enough but who can discern the future we have suffered so much that i am afraid to hope  have you heard anything of magdalen i dont know why or how it is but since i have known of her husbands death my old tenderness for her seems to cling to me more obstinately than ever always yours truly  harriet garth   ii  from mr pendril to miss garth  serle street january 4th 1848  dear miss garthof mrs noel vanstone herself i have heard nothing but i have learned since i saw you that the report of the position in which she is left by the death of her husband may be depended upon as the truth no legacy of any kind is bequeathed to her her name is not once mentioned in her husbands will  knowing what we know it is not to be concealed that this circumstance threatens us with more embarrassment and perhaps with more distress mrs noel vanstone is not the woman to submit without a desperate resistance to the total overthrow of all her schemes and all her hopes the mere fact that nothing whatever has been heard of her since her husbands death is suggestive to my mind of serious mischief to come in her situation and with her temper the quieter she is now the more inveterately i for one distrust her in the future it is impossible to say to what violent measures her present extremity may not drive her it is impossible to feel sure that she may not be the cause of some public scandal this time which may affect her innocent sister as well as herself  i know you will not misinterpret the motive which has led me to write these lines i know you will not think that i am inconsiderate enough to cause you unnecessary alarm my sincere anxiety to see that happy prospect realized to which your letter alludes has caused me to write far less reservedly than i might otherwise have written i strongly urge you to use your influence on every occasion when you can fairly exert it to strengthen that growing attachment and to place it beyond the reach of any coming disasters while you have the opportunity of doing so when i tell you that the fortune of which mrs noel vanstone has been deprived is entirely bequeathed to admiral bartram and when i add that mr george bartram is generally understood to be his uncles heiryou will i think acknowledge that i am not warning you without a cause yours most truly  william pendril   iii  from admiral bartram to mrs drake housekeeper at st crux  st crux january 10th 1848  mrs drakei have received your letter from london stating that you have found me a new parlormaid at last and that the girl is ready to return with you to st crux when your other errands in town allow you to come back  this arrangement must be altered immediately for a reason which i am heartily sorry to have to write  the illness of my niece mrs girdlestonewhich appeared to be so slight as to alarm none of us doctors includedhas ended fatally i received this morning the shocking news of her death her husband is said to be quite frantic with grief mr george has already gone to his brotherinlaws to superintend the last melancholy duties and i must follow him before the funeral takes place we propose to take mr girdlestone away afterward and to try the effect on him of change of place and new scenes under these sad circumstances i may be absent from st crux a month or six weeks at least the house will be shut up and the new servant will not be wanted until my return  you will therefore tell the girl on receiving this letter that a death in the family has caused a temporary change in our arrangements if she is willing to wait you may safely engage her to come here in six weeks time i shall be back then if mr george is not if she refuses pay her what compensation is right and so have done with her yours  arthur bartram   iv  from mrs drake to admiral bartram  january 11th  honored siri hope to get my errands done and to return to st crux tomorrow but write to save you anxiety in case of delay  the young woman whom i have engaged louisa by name is willing to wait your time and her present mistress taking an interest in her welfare will provide for her during the interval she understands that she is to enter on her new service in six weeks from the present datenamely on the twentyfifth of february next  begging you will accept my respectful sympathy under the sad bereavement which has befallen the family  i remain honored sir your humble servant  sophia drake      the seventh scene  st cruxinthemarsh    chapter i  this is where you are to sleep put yourself tidy and then come down again to my room the admiral has returned and you will have to begin by waiting on him at dinner today  with those words mrs drake the housekeeper closed the door and the new parlormaid was left alone in her bedchamber at st crux  that day was the eventful twentyfifth of february in barely four months from the time when mrs lecount had placed her masters private instructions in his executors hands the one combination of circumstances against which it had been her first and foremost object to provide was exactly the combination which had now taken place mr noel vanstones widow and admiral bartrams secret trust were together in the same house  thus far events had declared themselves without an exception in magdalens favor thus far the path which had led her to st crux had been a path without an obstacle louisa whose name she had now taken had sailed three days since for australia with her husband and her child she was the only living creature whom magdalen had trusted with her secret and she was by this time out of sight of the english land the girl had been careful reliable and faithfully devoted to her mistresss interests to the last she had passed the ordeal of her interview with the housekeeper and had forgotten none of the instructions by which she had been prepared to meet it she had herself proposed to turn the six weeks delay caused by the death in the admirals family to good account by continuing the allimportant practice of those domestic lessons on the perfect acquirement of which her mistresss daring stratagem depended for its success thanks to the time thus gained when louisas marriage was over and the day of parting had come magdalen had learned and mastered in the nicest detail everything that her former servant could teach her on the day when she passed the doors of st crux she entered on her desperate venture strong in the ready presence of mind under emergencies which her later life had taught her stronger still in the trained capacity that she possessed for the assumption of a character not her own strongest of all in her two months daily familiarity with the practical duties of the position which she had undertaken to fill   as soon as mrs drakes departure had left her alone she unpacked her box and dressed herself for the evening  she put on a lavendercolored stuffgownhalfmourning for mrs girdlestone ordered for all the servants under the admirals instructionsa white muslin apron and a neat white cap and collar with ribbons to match the gown in this servants costumein the plain gown fastening high round her neck in the neat little white cap at the back of her headin this simple dress to the eyes of all men not linendrapers at once the most modest and the most alluring that a woman can wear the sad changes which mental suffering had wrought in her beauty almost disappeared from view in the evening costume of a lady with her bosom uncovered with her figure armed rather than dressed in unpliable silk the admiral might have passed her by without notice in his own drawingroom in the evening costume of a servant no admirer of beauty could have looked at her once and not have turned again to look at her for the second time  descending the stairs on her way to the housekeepers room she passed by the entrances to two long stone corridors with rows of doors opening on them one corridor situated on the second and one on the first floor of the house many rooms she thought as she looked at the doors weary work searching here for what i have come to find  on reaching the groundfloor she was met by a weatherbeaten old man who stopped and stared at her with an appearance of great interest he was the same old man whom captain wragge had seen in the backyard at st crux at work on the model of a ship all round the neighborhood he was known far and wide as the admirals coxswain his name was mazey sixty years had written their story of hard work at sea and hard drinking on shore on the veterans grim and wrinkled face sixty years had proved his fidelity and had brought his battered old carcass at the end of the voyage into port in his masters house  seeing no one else of whom she could inquire magdalen requested the old man to show her the way that led to the housekeepers room  ill show you my dear said old mazey speaking in the high and hollow voice peculiar to the deaf youre the new maideh and a finegrown girl too his honor the admiral likes a parlormaid with a clean run fore and aft youll do my dearyoull do  you must not mind what mr mazey says to you remarked t he housekeeper opening her door as the old sailor expressed his approval of magdalen in these terms he is privileged to t alk as he pleases and he is very tiresome and slovenly in his habits but he means no harm  with that apology for the veteran mrs drake led magdalen first to the pantry and next to the linenroom installing her with all due formality in her own domestic dominions this ceremony completed the new parlormaid was taken upstairs and was shown the diningroom which opened out of the corridor on the first floor here she was directed to lay the cloth and to prepare the table for one person onlymr george bartram not having returned with his uncle to st crux mrs drakes sharp eyes watched magdalen attentively as she performed this introductory duty and mrs drakes private convictions when the table was spread forced her to acknowledge so far that the new servant thoroughly understood her work  an hour later the souptureen was placed on the table and magdalen stood alone behind the admirals empty chair waiting her masters first inspection of her when he entered the diningroom  a large bell rang in the lower regionsquick shambling footsteps pattered on the stone corridor outsidethe door opened suddenlyand a tall lean yellow old man sharp as to his eyes shrewd as to his lips fussily restless as to all his movements entered the room with two huge labrador dogs at his heels and took his seat in a violent hurry the dogs followed him and placed themselves with the utmost gravity and composure one on each side of his chair this was admiral bartram and these were the companions of his solitary meal  ay ay ay heres the new parlormaid to be sure he began looking sharply but not at all unkindly at magdalen whats your name my good girl louisa is it i shall call you lucy if you dont mind take off the cover my dearim a minute or two late today dont be unpunctual tomorrow on that

black nose is brutus and the dog with the white nose is cassius did you ever hear who brutus and cassius were ancient romans thats rightgood girl mind your book and your needle and well get you a good husband one of these days take away the soup my dear take away the soup  this was the man whose secret it was now the one interest of magdalens life to surprise this was the man whose name had supplanted hers in noel vanstones will  the fish and the roast meat followed and the admirals talk rambled onnow in soliloquy now addressed to the parlormaid and now directed to the dogsas familiarly and as discontentedly as ever magdalen observed with some surprise that the companions of the admirals dinner had thus far received no scraps from their masters plate the two magnificent brutes sat squatted on their haunches with their great heads over the table watching the progress of the meal with the profoundest attention but apparently expecting no share in it the roast meat was removed the admirals plate was changed and magdalen took the silver covers off the two madedishes on either side of the table as she handed the first of the savory dishes to her master the dogs suddenly exhibited a breathless personal interest in the proceedings brutus gluttonously watered at the mouth and the tongue of cassius protruding in unutterable expectation smoked again between his enormous jaws  the admiral helped himself liberally from the dish sent magdalen to the sidetable to get him some bread and when he thought her eye was off him furtively tumbled the whole contents of his plate into brutuss mouth cassius whined faintly as his fortunate comrade swallowed the savory mess at a gulp hush you fool whispered the admiral your turn next  magdalen presented the second dish once more the old gentleman helped himself largelyonce more he sent her away to the sidetableonce more he tumbled the entire contents of the plate down the dogs throat selecting cassius this time as became a considerate master and an impartial man when the next course followedconsisting of a plain pudding and an unwholesome creammagdalens suspicion of the function of the dogs at the dinnertable was confirmed while the master took the simple pudding the dogs swallowed the elaborate cream the admiral was plainly afraid of offending his cook on the one hand and of offending his digestion on the otherand brutus and cassius were the two trained accomplices who regularly helped him every day off the horns of his dilemma very good very good said the old gentleman with the most transparent duplicity tell the cook my dear a capital cream  having placed the wine and dessert on the table magdalen was about to withdraw before she could leave the room her master called her back  stop stop said the admiral you dont know the ways of the house yet lucy put another wineglass here at my right handthe largest you can find my dear ive got a third dog who comes in at desserta drunken old seadog who has followed my fortunes afloat and ashore for fifty years and more yes yes thats the sort of glass we want youre a good girlyoure a neat handy girl steady my dear theres nothing to be frightened at  a sudden thump on the outside of the door followed by one mighty bark from each of the dogs had made magdalen start come in shouted the admiral the door opened the tails of brutus and cassius cheerfully thumped the floor and old mazey marched straight up to the righthand side of his masters chair the veteran stood there with his legs wide apart and his balance carefully adjusted as if the diningroom had been a cabin and the house a ship pitching in a seaway  the admiral filled the large glass with port filled his own glass with claret and raised it to his lips  god bless the queen mazey said the admiral  god bless the queen your honor said old mazey swallowing his port as the dogs swallowed the madedishes at a gulp  hows the wind mazey  west and by noathe your honor  any report tonight mazey  no report your honor  goodevening mazey  goodevening your honor  the afterdinner ceremony thus completed old mazey made his bow and walked out of the room again brutus and cassius stretched themselves on the rug to digest mushrooms and made gravies in the lubricating heat of the fire for what we have received the lord make us truly thankful said the admiral go downstairs my good girl and get your supper a light meal lucy if you take my advicea light meal or you will have the nightmare early to bed my dear and early to rise makes a parlormaid healthy and wealthy and wise thats the wisdom of your ancestorsyou mustnt laugh at it goodnight in those words magdalen was dismissed and so her first days experience of admiral bartram came to an end   after breakfast the next morning the admirals directions to the new parlormaid included among them one particular order which in magdalens situation it was especially her interest to receive in the old gentlemans absence from home that day on local business which took him to ossory she was directed to make herself acquainted with the whole inhabited quarter of the house and to learn the positions of the various rooms so as to know where the bells called her when the bells rang mrs drake was charged with the duty of superintending the voyage of domestic discovery unless she happened to be otherwise engagedin which case any one of the inferior servants would be equally competent to act as magdalens guide  at noon the admiral left for ossory and magdalen presented herself in mrs drakes room to be shown over the house mrs drake happened to be otherwise engaged and referred her to the head housemaid the head housemaid happened on that particular morning to be in the same condition as mrs drake and referred her to the underhousemaids the underhousemaids declared they were all behindhand and had not a minute to sparethey suggested not too civilly that old mazey had nothing on earth to do and that he knew the house as well or better than he knew his a b c magdalen took the hint with a secret indignation and contempt which it cost her a hard struggle to conceal she had suspected on the previous night and she was certain now that the womenservants all incomprehensibly resented her presence among them with the same sullen unanimity of distrust mrs drake as she had seen for herself was really engaged that morning over her accounts but of all the servants under her who had made their excuses not one had even affected to be more occupied than usual their looks said plainly we dont like you and we wont show you over the house  she found her way to old mazey not by the scanty directions given her but by the sound of the veterans cracked and quavering voice singing in some distant seclusion a verse of the immortal seasongtom bowling just as she stopped among the rambling stone passages on the basement story of the house uncertain which way to turn next she heard the tuneless old voice in the distance singing these lines       his form was of the manliest beauuuuty      his heart was kiiind and soft      faithful below tom did his duty      but now hes gone aloooooft      but now hes goooone aloft  magdalen followed in the direction of the quavering voice and found herself in a little room looking out on the back yard there sat old mazey with his spectacles low on his nose and his knotty old hands blundering over the rigging of his model ship there were brutus and cassius digesting before the fire again and snoring as if they thoroughly enjoyed it there was lord nelson on one wall in flaming watercolors and there on the other was a portrait of admiral bartrams last flagship in full sail on a sea of slate with a salmoncolored sky to complete the illusion  what they wont show you over the housewont they said old mazey i will then that head housemaids a sour one my dearif ever there was a sour one yet youre too young and goodlooking to please emthats what you are he rose took off his spectacles and feebly mended the fire shes as straight as a poplar said old mazey considering magdalens figure in drowsy soliloquy i say shes as straight as a poplar and his honor the admiral says so too come along my dear he proceeded addressing himself to magdalen again ill teach you your pints of the compass first when you know your pints blow high blow low youll find it plain sailing all over the house  he led the way to the doorstopped and suddenly bethinking himself of his miniature ship went back to put his model away in an empty cupboardled the way to the door againstopped once moreremembered that some of the rooms were chillyand pottered about swearing and grumbling and looking for his hat magdalen sat down patiently to wait for him she gratefully contrasted his treatment of her with the treatment she had received from the women resist it as firmly despise it as proudly as we may all studied unkindnessno matter how contemptible it may behas a stinging power in it which reaches to the quick magdalen only knew how she had felt the small malice of the female servants by the effect which the rough kindness of the old sailor produced on her afterward the dumb welcome of the dogs when the movements in the room had roused them from their sleep touched her more acutely still brutus pushed his mighty muzzle companionably into her hand and cassius laid his friendly forepaw on her lap her heart yearned over the two creatures as she patted and caressed them it seemed only yesterday since she and the dogs at comberaven had roamed the garden together and had idled away the summer mornings luxuriously on the shady lawn  old mazey found his hat at last and they started on their exploring expedition with the dogs after them  leaving the basement story of the house which was entirely devoted to the servants offices they ascended to the first floor and entered the long corridor with which magdalens last nights experience had already made her acquainted put your back agin this wall said old mazey pointing to the long wallpierced at irregular intervals with windows looking out over a courtyard and fishpondwhich formed the righthand side of the corridor as magdalen now stood put your back here said the veteran and look straight afore you what do you seethe opposite wall of the passage said magdalenay ay what elsethe doors leading into the roomswhat elsei see nothing else old mazey chuckled winked and shook his knotty forefinger at magdalen impressively you see one of the pints of the compass my dear when youve got your back agin this wall and when you look straight afore you you look noathe if you ever get lost hereaway put your back agin the wall look out straight afore you and say to yourself i look noathe you do that like a good girl and you wont lose your bearings  after administering this preliminary dose of instruction old mazey opened the first of the doors on the lefthand side of the passage it led into the diningroom with which magdalen was already familiar the second room was fitted up as a library and the third as a morningroom the fourth and fifth doorsboth belonging to dismantled and uninhabited rooms and both lockedbrought them to the end of the north wing of the house and to the opening of a second and shorter passage placed at a right angle to the first here old mazey who had divided his time pretty equally during the investigation of the rooms in talking of his honor the admiral and whistling to the dogs returned with all possible expedition to the points of the compass and gravely directed magdalen to repeat the ceremony of putting her back against the wall she attempted to shorten the proceedings by declaring quite correctly that in her present position she knew she was looking east dont you talk about the east my dear said old mazey proceeding unmoved with his own system of instruction till you know the east first put your back agin this wall and look straight afore you what do you see the remainder of the catechism proceeded as before when the end was reached magdalens instructor was satisfied he chuckled and winked at her once more now you may talk about the east my dear said the veteran for now you know it  the east passage after leading them on for a few yards only terminated in a vestibule with a high door in it which faced them as they advanced the door admitted them to a large and lofty drawingroom decorated like all the other apartments with valuable oldfashioned furniture leading the way across this room magdalens conductor pushed back a heavy slidingdoor opposite the door of entrance put your apron over your head said old mazey we are coming to the banquetinghall now the floors mortal cold and the damp sticks to the place like cockroaches to a collier his honor the admiral calls it the arctic passage ive got my name for it tooi call it freezeyourbones  magdalen passed through the doorway and found herself in the ancient banquetinghall of st crux  on her left hand she saw a row of lofty windows set deep in embrasures and extending over a frontage of more than a hundred fee t in length on her right hand ranged in one long row from end to end of the opposite wall hung a dismal collection of black begrimed old pictures rotting from their frames and representing battlescenes by sea and land below the pictures midway down the length of the wall yawned a huge cavern of a fireplace surmounted by a towering mantelpiece of black marble the one object of furniture if furniture it might be called visible far or near in the vast emptiness of the place was a gaunt ancient tripod of curiously chased metal standing lonely in the middle of the hall and supporting a wide circular pan filled deep with ashes from an extinct charcoal fire the high ceiling once finely carved and gilt was foul with dirt and cobwebs the naked walls at either end of the room were stained with damp and the cold of the marble floor struck through the narrow strip of matting laid down parallel with the windows as a footpath for passengers across the wilderness of the room no better name for it could have been devised than the name which old mazey had found freezeyourbones accurately described in three words the banquetinghall at st crux  do you never light a fire in this dismal place asked magdalen  it all depends on which side of freezeyourbones his honor the admiral lives said old mazey his honor likes to shift his quarters sometimes to one side of the house sometimes to the other if he lives noathe of freezeyourboneswhich is where youve just come fromwe dont waste our coals here if he lives south of freezeyourboneswhich is where we are going to nextwe light the fire in the grate and the charcoal in the pan every night when we do that the damp gets the better of us every morning we turn to again and get the better of the damp  with this remarkable explanation old mazey led the way to the lower end of the hall opened more doors and showed magdalen through another suite of rooms four in number all of moderate size and all furnished in much the same manner as the rooms in the northern wing she looked out of the windows and saw the neglected gardens of st crux overgrown with brambles and weeds here and there at no great distance in the grounds the smoothly curving line of one of the tidal streams peculiar to the locality wound its way gleaming in the sunlight through gaps in the brambles and trees the more distant view ranged over the flat eastward country beyond speckled with its scattered little villages crossed and recrossed by its network of backwaters and terminated abruptly by the long straight line of seawall which protects the defenseless coast of essex from invasion by the sea  have we more rooms still to see asked magdalen turning from the view of the garden and looking about her for another door  no more my dearweve run aground here and we may as well wear round and put back again said old mazey theres another side of the housedue south of you as you stand nowwhich is all tumbling about our ears you must go out into the garden if you want to see it its built off from us by a brick bulkhead tother side of this wall here the monks lived due south of us my dear hundreds of years afore his honor the admiral was born or thought of and a fine time of it they had as ive heard they sang in the church all the morning and drank grog in the orchard all the afternoon they slept off their grog on the best of featherbeds and they fattened on the neighborhood all the year round lucky beggars lucky beggars  apostrophizing the monks in these terms and evidently regretting that he had not lived himself in those good old times the veteran led the way back through the rooms on the return passage across freezeyourbones magdalen preceded him shes as straight as a poplar mumbled old mazey to himself hobbling along after his youthful companion and wagging his venerable head in cordial approval i never was particular what nation they belonged to but i always did like em straight and fine grown and i always shall like em straight and fine grown to my dying day  are there more rooms to see upstairs on the second floor asked magdalen when they had returned to the point from which they had started  the naturally clear distinct tones of her voice had hitherto reached the old sailors imperfect sense of hearing easily enough rather to her surprise he became stone deaf on a sudden to her last question  are you sure of your pints of the compass he inquired if youre not sure put your back agin the wall and well go all over em again my dear beginning with the noathe  magdalen assured him that she felt quite familiar by this time with all the points the noathe included and then repeated her question in louder tones the veteran obstinately matched her by becoming deafer than ever  yes my dear he said youre right it is chilly in these passages and unless i go back to my fire my firell go outwont it if you dont feel sure of your pints of the compass come in to me and ill put you right again he winked benevolently whistled to the dogs and hobbled off magdalen heard him chuckle over his own success in balking her curiosity on the subject of the second floor i know how to deal with em said old mazey to himself in high triumph tall and short native and foreign sweethearts and wivesi know how to deal with em  left by herself magdalen exemplified the excellence of the old sailors method of treatment in her particular case by ascending the stairs immediately to make her own observations on the second floor the stone passage here was exactly similar except that more doors opened out of it to the passage on the first floor she opened the two nearest doors one after another at a venture and discovered that both rooms were bedchambers the fear of being discovered by one of the womanservants in a part of the house with which she had no concern warned her not to push her investigations on the bedroom floor too far at starting she hurriedly walked down the passage to see where it ended discovered that it came to its termination in a lumberroom answering to the position of the vestibule downstairs and retraced her steps immediately  on her way back she noticed an object which had previously escaped her attention it was a low trucklebed placed parallel with the wall and close to one of the doors on the bedroom side in spite of its strange and comfortless situation the bed was apparently occupied at night by a sleeper the sheets were on it and the end of a thick red fishermans cap peeped out from under the pillow she ventured on opening the door near which the bed was placed and found herself as she conjectured from certain signs and tokens in the admirals sleeping chamber a moments observation of the room was all she dared risk and softly closing the door again she returned to the kitchen regions  the trucklebed and the strange position in which it was placed dwelt on her mind all through the afternoon who could possibly sleep in it the remembrance of the red fishermans cap and the knowledge she had already gained of mazeys doglike fidelity to his master helped her to guess that the old sailor might be the occupant of the trucklebed but why with bedrooms enough and to spare should he occupy that cold and comfortless situation at night why should he sleep on guard outside his masters door was there some nocturnal danger in the house of which the admiral was afraid the question seemed absurd and yet the position of the bed forced it irresistibly on her mind  stimulated by her own ungovernable curiosity on this subject magdalen ventured to question the housekeeper she acknowledged having walked from end to end of the passage on the second floor to see if it was as long as the passage on the first and she mentioned having noticed with astonishment the position of the trucklebed mrs drake answered her implied inquiry shortly and sharply i dont blame a young girl like you said the old lady for being a little curious when she first comes into such a strange house as this but remember for the future that yo ur business does not lie on the bedroom story mr mazey sleeps on that bed you noticed it is his habit at night to sleep outside his masters door with that meager explanation mrs drakes lips closed and opened no more  later in the day magdalen found an opportunity of applying to old mazey himself she discovered the veteran in high good humor smoking his pipe and warming a tin mug of ale at his own snug fire  mr mazey she asked boldly why do you put your bed in that cold passage  what you have been upstairs you young jade have you said old mazey looking up from his mug with a leer  magdalen smiled and nodded come come tell me she said coaxingly why do you sleep outside the admirals door  why do you part your hair in the middle my dear asked old mazey with another leer  i suppose because i am accustomed to do it answered magdalen  ay ay said the veteran thats why is it well my dear the reason why you part your hair in the middle is the reason why i sleep outside the admirals door i know how to deal with em chuckled old mazey lapsing into soliloquy and stirring up his ale in high triumph tall and short native and foreign sweethearts and wivesi know how to deal with em  magdalens third and last attempt at solving the mystery of the trucklebed was made while she was waiting on the admiral at dinner the old gentlemans questions gave her an opportunity of referring to the subject without any appearance of presumption or disrespect but he proved to be quite as impenetrable in his way as old mazey and mrs drake had been in theirs it doesnt concern you my dear said the admiral bluntly dont be curious look in your old testament when you go downstairs and see what happened in the garden of eden through curiosity be a good girl and dont imitate your mother eve  late at night as magdalen passed the end of the secondfloor passage proceeding alone on her way up to her own room she stopped and listened a screen was placed at the entrance of the corridor so as to hide it from the view of persons passing on the stairs the snoring she heard on the other side of the screen encouraged her to slip round it and to advance a few steps shading the light of her candle with her hand she ventured close to the admirals door and saw to her surprise that the bed had been moved since she had seen it in the daytime so as to stand exactly across the door and to bar the way entirely to any one who might attempt to enter the admirals room after this discovery old mazey himself snoring lustily with the red fishermans cap pulled down to his eyebrows and the blankets drawn up to his nose became an object of secondary importance only by comparison with his bed that the veteran did actually sleep on guard before his masters door and that he and the admiral and the housekeeper were in the secret of this unaccountable proceeding was now beyond all doubt  a strange end thought magdalen pondering over her discovery as she stole upstairs to her own sleepingrooma strange end to a strange day    chapter ii  the first week passed the second week passed and magdalen was to all appearance no nearer to the discovery of the secret trust than on the day when she first entered on her service at st crux  but the fortnight uneventful as it was had not been a fortnight lost experience had already satisfied her on one important pointexperience had shown that she could set the rooted distrust of the other servants safely at defiance time had accustomed the women to her presence in the house without shaking the vague conviction which possessed them all alike that the newcomer was not one of themselves all that magdalen could do in her own defense was to keep the instinctive female suspicion of her confined within those purely negative limits which it had occupied from the first and this she accomplished  day after day the women watched her with the untiring vigilance of malice and distrust and day after day not the vestige of a discovery rewarded them for their pains silently intelligently and industriouslywith an everpresent remembrance of herself and her placethe new parlormaid did her work her only intervals of rest and relaxation were the intervals passed occasionally in the day with old mazey and the dogs and the precious interval of the night during which she was secure from observation in the solitude of her room thanks to the superfluity of bedchambers at st crux each one of the servants had the choice if she pleased of sleeping in a room of her own alone in the night magdalen might dare to be herself againmight dream of the past and wake from the dream encountering no curious eyes to notice that she was in tearsmight ponder over the future and be roused by no whisperings in corners which tainted her with the suspicion of having something on her mind  satisfied thus far of the perfect security of her position in the house she profited next by a second chance in her favor whichbefore the fortnight was at an endrelieved her mind of all doubt on the formidable subject of mrs lecount  partly from the accidental gossip of the women at the table in the servants hall partly from a marked paragraph in a swiss newspaper which she had found one morning lying open on the admirals easychairshe gained the welcome assurance that no danger was to be dreaded this time from the housekeepers presence on the scene mrs lecount had as it appeared passed a week or more at st crux after the date of her masters death and had then left england to live on the interest of her legacy in honorable and prosperous retirement in her native place the paragraph in the swiss newspaper described the fulfillment of this laudable project mrs lecount had not only established herself at zurich but wisely mindful of the uncertainty of life had also settled the charitable uses to which her fortune was to be applied after her death one half of it was to go to the founding of a lecompte scholarship for poor students in the university of geneva the other half was to be employed by the municipal authorities of zurich in the maintenance and education of a certain number of orphan girls natives of the city who were to be trained for domestic service in later life the swiss journalist adverted to these philanthropic bequests in terms of extravagant eulogy zurich was congratulated on the possession of a paragon of public virtue and william tell in the character of benefactor to switzerland was compared disadvantageously with mrs lecount   the third week began and magdalen was now at liberty to take her first step forward on the way to the discovery of the secret trust  she ascertained from old mazey that it was his masters custom during the winter and spring months to occupy the rooms in the north wing and during the summer and autumn to cross the arctic passage of freezeyourbones and live in the eastward apartments which looked out on the garden while the banquetinghall remainedowing to the admirals inadequate pecuniary resourcesin its damp and dismantled state and while the interior of st crux was thus comfortlessly divided into two separate residences no more convenient arrangement than this could well have been devised now and then as magdalen understood from her informant there were days both in winter and summer when the admiral became anxious about the condition of the rooms which he was not occupying at the time and when he insisted on investigating the state of the furniture the pictures and the books with his own eyes on these occasions in summer as in winter a blazing fire was kindled for some days previously in the large grate and the charcoal was lighted in the tripodpan to keep the banquetinghall as warm as circumstances would admit as soon as the old gentlemans anxieties were set at rest the rooms were shut up again and freezeyourbones was once more abandoned for weeks and weeks together to damp desolation and decay the last of these temporary migrations had taken place only a few days since the admiral had satisfied himself that the rooms in the east wing were none the worse for the absence of their master and he might now be safely reckoned on as settled in the north wing for weeks and perhaps if the season was cold for months to come  trifling as they might be in themselves these particulars were of serious importance to magdalen for they helped her to fix the limits of the field of search assuming that the admiral was likely to keep all his important documents within easy reach of his own hand she might now feel certain that the secret trust was secured in one or other of the rooms in the north wing  in which room that question was not easy to answer  of the four inhabitable rooms which were all at the admirals disposal during the daythat is to say of the diningroom the library the morningroom and the drawingroom opening out of the vestibulethe library appeared to be the apartment in which if he had a preference he passed the greater part of his time there was a table in this room with drawers that locked there was a magnificent italian cabinet with doors that locked there were five cupboards under the bookcases every one of which locked there were receptacles similarly secured in the other rooms and in all or any of these papers might be kept  she had answered the bell and had seen him locking and unlocking now in one room now in another but oftenest in the library she had noticed occasionally that his expression was fretful and impatient when he looked round at her from an open cabinet or cupboard and gave his orders and she inferred that something in connection with his papers and possessionsit might or might not be the secret trustirritated and annoyed him from time to time she had heard him more than once lock something up in one of the rooms come out and go into another room wait there a few minutes then return to the first room with his keys in his hand and sharply turn the locks and turn them again this fidgety anxiety about his keys and his cupboards might be the result of the inbred restlessness of his disposition aggravated in a naturally active man by the aimless indolence of a life in retirementa life drifting backward and forward among trifles with no regular employment to steady it at any given hour of the day on the other hand it was just as probable that these comings and goings these lockings and unlockings might be attributable to the existence of some private responsibility which had unexpectedly intruded itself into the old mans easy existence and which tormented him with a sense of oppression new to the experience of his later years either one of these interpretations might explain his conduct as reasonably and as probably as the other which was the right interpretation of the two it was in magdalens position impossible to say  the one certain discovery at which she arrived was made in her first days observation of him the admiral was a rigidly careful man with his keys  all the smaller keys he kept on a ring in the breastpocket of his coat the larger he locked up together generally but not always in one of the drawers of the library table sometimes he left them secured in this way at night sometimes he took them up to the bedroom with him in a little basket he had no regular times for leaving them or for taking them away with him he had no discoverable reason for now securing them in the librarytable drawer and now again locking them up in some other place the inveterate willfulness and caprice of his proceedings in these particulars defied every effort to reduce them to a system and baffled all attempts at calculating on them beforehand  the hope of gaining positive information to act on by laying artful snares for him which he might fall into in his talk proved from the outset to be utterly futile  in magdalens situation all experiments of this sort would have been in the last degree difficult and dangerous with any man with the admiral they were simply impossible his tendency to veer about from one subject to another his habit of keeping his tongue perpetually going so long as there was anybody no matter whom within reach of the sound of his voice his comical want of all dignity and reserve with his servants promised in appearance much and performed in reality nothing no matter how diffidently or how respectfully magdalen might presume on her masters example and on her masters evident liking for her the old man instantly discovered the advance she was making from her proper position and instantly put her back in it again with a quaint good humor which inflicted no pain but with a blunt straightforwardness of purpose which permitted no escape contradictory as it may sound admiral bartram was too familiar to be approached he kept the distance between himself and his servant more effectually than if he had been the proudest man in england the systematic reserve of a superior toward an inferior may be occasionally overcomethe systematic familiarity never  slowly the time dragged on the fourth week came and magdalen had made no new discoveries the prospect was depressing in the last degree even in the apparently hopeless event of her devising a means of getting at the admirals keys she could not count on retaining possession of them unsuspected more than a few hourshours which might be utterly wasted through her not knowing in what direction to begin the search the trust might be locked up in any one of some twenty receptacles for papers situated in four different rooms and which room was the likeliest to look in which receptacle was the most promising to begin with which position among other heaps of papers the one paper needful might be expected to occupy was more than she could say hemmed in by immeasurable uncertainties on every side condemned as it were to wander blindfold on the very brink of success she waited for the chance that never came for the event that never happened with a patience which was sinking already into the patience of despair  night after night she looked back over the vanished days and not an event rose on her memory to distinguish them one from the other the only interruptions to the weary uniformity of the life at st crux were caused by the characteristic delinquencies of old mazey and the dogs  at certain intervals the original wildness broke out in the natures of brutus and cassius the modest comforts of home the savory charms of made dishes the decorous joy of digestions accomplished on hearthrugs lost all their attractions and the dogs ungratefully left the house to seek dissipation and adventure in the outer world on these occasions the established afterdinner formula of question and answer between old mazey and his master varied a little in one particular god bless the queen mazey and hows the wind mazey were followed by a new inquiry where are the dogs mazey out on the loose your honor and be damned to em was the veterans unvarying answer the admiral always sighed and shook his head gravely at the news as if brutus and cassius had been sons of his own who treated him with a want of proper filial respect in two or three days time the dogs always returned lean dirty and heartily ashamed of themselves for the whole of the next day they were invariably tied up in disgrace on the day after they were scrubbed clean and were formally readmitted to the diningroom there civilization acting through the subtle medium of the saucepan recovered its hold on them and the admirals two prodigal sons when they saw the covers removed watered at the mouth as copiously as ever  old mazey in his way proved to be just as disreputably inclined on certain occasions as the dogs at intervals the original wildness in his nature broke out he too lost all relish for the comforts of home and ungratefully left the house he usually disappeared in the afternoon and returned at night as drunk as liquor could make him he was by many degrees too seasoned a vessel to meet with any disasters on these occasions his wicked old legs might take roundabout methods of progression but they never failed him his wicked old eyes might see double but they always showed him the way home try as hard as they might the servants could never succeed in persuading him that he was drunk he always scorned the imputation he even declined to admit the idea privately into his mind until he had first tested his condition by an infallible criterion of his own  it was his habit in these cases of bacchanalian emergency to stagger obstinately into his room on the groundfloor to take the modelship out of the cupboard and to try if he could proceed with the nevertobecompleted employment of setting up the rigging when he had smashed the tiny spars and snapped asunder the delicate ropesthen and not till then the veteran admitted facts as they were on the authority of practical evidence ay ay he used to say confidentially to himself the women are right drunk again mazeydrunk again having reached this discovery it was his habit to wait cunningly in the lower regions until the admiral was safe in his room and then to ascend in discreet list slippers to his post too wary to attempt getting into the trucklebed which would have been only inviting the catastrophe of a fall against his masters door he always walked himself sober up and down the passage more than once magdalen had peeped round the screen and had seen the old sailor unsteadily keeping his watch and fancying himself once more at his duty on board ship this is an uncommonly lively vessel in a seaway he used to mutter under his breath when his legs took him down the passage in zigzag directions or left him for the moment studying the pints of the compass on his own system with his back against the wall a nasty night mind you he would maunder on taking another turn as dark as your pocket and the wind heading us again from the old quarter on the next day old mazey like the dogs was kept downstairs in disgrace on the day after like the dogs again he was reinstated in his privileges and another change was introduced in the afterdinner formula on entering the room the old sailor stopped short and made his excuses in this brief yet comprehensive form of words with his back against the door please your honor im ashamed of myself so the apology began and ended this mustnt happen again mazey the admiral used to answer it shant happen again your honor very good come here and drink your glass of wine god bless the queen mazey the veteran tossed off his port and the dialogue ended as usual  so the days passed with no incidents more important than these to relieve their monotony until the end of the fourth week was at hand  on the last day an event happened on the last day the long deferred promise of the future unexpectedly began to dawn while magdalen was spreading the cloth in the diningroom as usual mrs drake looked in and instructed her on this occasion for the first time to lay the table for two persons the admiral had received a letter from his nephew early that evening mr george bartram was expected to return to st crux    chapter iii  after placing the second cover magdalen awaited the ringing of the dinnerbell with an interest and impatience which she found it no easy task to conceal the return of mr bartram would in all probability produce a change in the life of the house and from change of any kind no matter how trifling something might be hoped the nephew might be accessible to influences which had failed to reach the uncle in any case the two would talk of their affairs over their dinner and through that talkproceeding day after day in her presencethe way to discovery now absolutely invisible might sooner or later show itself  at last the bell rang the door opened and the two gentlemen entered the room together  magdalen was struck as her sister had been struck by george bartrams resemblance to her fatherjudging by the portrait at comberaven which presented the likeness of andrew vanstone in his younger days the light hair and florid complexion the bright blue eyes and hardy upright figure familiar to her in the picture were all recalled to her memory as the nephew followed the uncle across the room and took his place at table she was not prepared for this sudden revival of the lost associations of home her attention wandered as she tried to conceal its effect on her and she made a blunder in waiting at table for the first time since she had entered the house  a quaint reprimand from the admiral half in jest half in earnest gave her time to recover herself she ventured another look at george bartram the impression which he produced on her this time roused her curiosity immediately his face and manner plainly expressed anxiety and preoccupation of mind he looked oftener at his plate than at his uncle and at magdalen herself except one passing inspection of the new parlormaid when the admiral spoke to her he never looked at all some uncertainty was evidently troubling his thoughts some oppression was weighing on his natural freedom of manner what uncertainty what oppression would any personal revelations come out little by little in the course of conversation at the dinnertable  no one set of dishes followed another set of dishes and nothing in the shape of a personal revelation took place the conversation halted on irregularly between public affairs on one side and trifling private topics on the other politics home and foreign took their turn with the small household history of st crux the leaders of the revolution which expelled louis philippe from the throne of france marched side by side in the dinnertable review with old mazey and the dogs the dessert was put on the table the old sailor came in drank his loyal toast paid his respects to master george and went out again magdalen followed him on her way back to the servants offices having heard nothing in the conversation of the slightest importance to the furtherance of her own design from the first word of it to the last she struggled hard not to lose heart and hope on the first day they could hardly talk again tomorrow they could hardly talk again the next day of the french revolution and the dogs time might do wonders yet and time was all her own   left together over their wine the uncle and nephew drew their easychairs on either side of the fire and in magdalens absence began the very conversation which it was magdalens interest to hear  claret george said the admiral pushing the bottle across the table you look out of spirits  i am a little anxious sir replied george leaving his glass empty and looking straight into the fire  i am glad to hear it rejoined the admiral i am more than a little anxious myself i can tell you here we are at the last days of marchand nothing done your time comes to an end on the third of may and there you sit as if you had years still before you to turn round in  george smiled and resignedly helped himself to some wine  am i really to understand sir he asked that you are serious in what you said to me last november are you actually resolved to bind me to that incomprehensible condition  i dont call it incomprehensible said the admiral irritably  dont you sir i am to inherit your estate unconditionallyas you have generously settled it from the first but i am not to touch a farthing of the fortune poor noel left you unless i am married within a certain time the house and lands are to be mine thanks to your kindness under any circumstances but the money with which i might improve them both is to be arbitrarily taken away from me if i am not a married man on the third of may i am sadly wanting in intelligence i dare say but a more incomprehensible proceeding i never heard of  no snapping and snarling george say your say o ut we dont understand sneering in her majestys navy  i mean no offense sir but i think its a little hard to astonish me by a change of proceeding on your part entirely foreign to my experience of your characterand then when i naturally ask for an explanation to turn round coolly and leave me in the dark if you and noel came to some private arrangement together before he made his will why not tell me why set up a mystery between us where no mystery need be  i wont have it george cried the admiral angrily drumming on the table with the nutcrackers you are trying to draw me like a badger but i wont be drawn ill make any conditions i please and ill be accountable to nobody for them unless i like its quite bad enough to have worries and responsibilities laid on my unlucky shoulders that i never bargained fornever mind what worries theyre not yours theyre minewithout being questioned and crossquestioned as if i was a witness in a box heres a pretty fellow continued the admiral apostrophizing his nephew in redhot irritation and addressing himself to the dogs on the hearthrug for want of a better audience heres a pretty fellow he is asked to help himself to two uncommonly comfortable things in their waya fortune and a wife he is allowed six months to get the wife in we should have got her in the navy bag and baggage in six days he has a round dozen of nice girls to my certain knowledge in one part of the country and another all at his disposal to choose from and what does he do he sits month after month with his lazy legs crossed before him he leaves the girls to pine on the stem and he bothers his uncle to know the reason why i pity the poor unfortunate women men were made of flesh and blood and plenty of it too in my time theyre made of machinery now  i can only repeat sir i am sorry to have offended you said george  pooh pooh you neednt look at me in that languishing way if you are retorted the admiral stick to your wine and ill forgive you your good health george im glad to see you again at st crux look at that plateful of spongecakes the cook has sent them up in honor of your return we cant hurt her feelings and we cant spoil our wine herethe admiral tossed four spongecakes in quick succession down the accommodating throats of the dogs i am sorry george the old gentleman gravely proceeded i am really sorry you havent got your eye on one of those nice girls you dont know what a loss youre inflicting on yourself you dont know what trouble and mortification youre causing me by this shillyshally conduct of yours  if you would only allow me to explain myself sir you would view my conduct in a totally different light i am ready to marry tomorrow if the lady will have me  the devil you are so you have got a lady in your eye after all why in heavens name couldnt you tell me so before never mind ill forgive you everything now i know you have laid your hand on a wife fill your glass again heres her health in a bumper bytheby who is she  ill tell you directly admiral when we began this conversation i mentioned that i was a little anxious  shes not one of my round dozen of nice girlsaha master george i see that in your face already why are you anxious  i am afraid you will disapprove of my choice sir  dont beat about the bush how the deuce can i say whether i disapprove or not if you wont tell me who she is  she is the eldest daughter of andrew vanstone of comberaven  who  miss vanstone sir  the admiral put down his glass of wine untasted  youre right george he said i do disapprove of your choice strongly disapprove of it  is it the misfortune of her birth sir that you object to  god forbid the misfortune of her birth is not her fault poor thing you know as well as i do george what i object to  you object to her sister  certainly the most liberal man alive might object to her sister i think  its hard sir to make miss vanstone suffer for her sisters faults  faults do you call them you have a mighty convenient memory george when your own interests are concerned  call them crimes if you like siri say again its hard on miss vanstone miss vanstones life is pure of all reproach from first to last she has borne her hard lot with such patience and sweetness and courage as not one woman in a thousand would have shown in her place ask miss garth who has known her from childhood ask mrs tyrrel who blesses the day when she came into the house  ask a fiddlesticks end i beg your pardon george but you are enough to try the patience of a saint my good fellow i dont deny miss vanstones virtues ill admit if you like shes the best woman that ever put on a petticoat that is not the question  excuse me admiralit is the question if she is to be my wife  hear me out george look at it from my point of view as well as your own what did your cousin noel do your cousin noel fell a victim poor fellow to one of the vilest conspiracies i ever heard of and the prime mover of that conspiracy was miss vanstones damnable sister she deceived him in the most infamous manner and as soon as she was down for a handsome legacy in his will she had the poison ready to take his life this is the truth we know it from mrs lecount who found the bottle locked up in her own room if you marry miss vanstone you make this wretch your sisterinlaw she becomes a member of our family all the disgrace of what she has done all the disgrace of what she may doand the devil who possesses her only knows what lengths she may go to nextbecomes our disgrace good heavens george consider what a position that is consider what pitch you touch if you make this woman your sisterinlaw  you have put your side of the question admiral said george resolutely now let me put mine a certain impression is produced on me by a young lady whom i meet with under very interesting circumstances i dont act headlong on that impression as i might have done if i had been some years younger i wait and put it to the trial every time i see this young lady the impression strengthens her beauty grows on me her character grows on me when i am away from her i am restless and dissatisfied when i am with her i am the happiest man alive all i hear of her conduct from those who know her best more than confirms the high opinion i have formed of her the one drawback i can discover is caused by a misfortune for which she is not responsiblethe misfortune of having a sister who is utterly unworthy of her does this discoveryan unpleasant discovery i grant youdestroy all those good qualities in miss vanstone for which i love and admire her nothing of the sortit only makes her good qualities all the more precious to me by contrast if i am to have a drawback to contend withand who expects anything else in this worldi would infinitely rather have the drawback attached to my wifes sister than to my wife my wifes sister is not essential to my happiness but my wife is in my opinion sir mrs noel vanstone has done mischief enough already i dont see the necessity of letting her do more mischief by depriving me of a good wife right or wrong that is my point of view i dont wish to trouble you with any questions of sentiment all i wish to say is that i am old enough by this time to know my own mind and that my mind is made up if my marriage is essential to the execution of your intentions on my behalf there is only one woman in the world whom i can marry and that woman is miss vanstone  there was no resisting this plain declaration admiral bartram rose from his chair without making any reply and walked perturbedly up and down the room  the situation was emphatically a serious one mrs girdlestones death had already produced the failure of one of the two objects contemplated by the secret trust if the third of may arrived and found george a single man the second and last of the objects would then have failed in its turn in little more than a fortnight at the very latest the banns must be published in ossory church or the time would fail for compliance with one of the stipulations insisted on in the trust obstinate as the admiral was by nature strongly as he felt the objections which attached to his nephews contemplated alliance he recoiled in spite of himself as he paced the room and saw the facts on either side immovably staring him in the face  are you engaged to miss vanstone he asked suddenly  no sir replied george i thought it due to your uniform kindness to me to speak to you on the subject first  much obliged im sure and you have put off speaking to me to the last moment just as you put off everything else do you think miss vanstone will say yes when you ask her  george hesitated  the devil take your modesty shouted the admiral this is not a time for modesty this is a time for speaking out will she or wont she  i think she will sir  the admiral laughed sardonically and took another turn in the room he suddenly stopped put his hands in his pockets and stood still in a corner deep in thought after an interval of a few minutes his face cleared a little it brightened with the dawning of a new idea he walked round briskly to georges side of the fire and laid his hand kindly on his nephews shoulder  youre wrong george he said but it is too late now to set you right on the sixteenth of next month the banns must be put up in ossory church or you will lose the money have you told miss vanstone the position you stand in or have you put that off to the eleventh hour like everything else  the position is so extraordinary sir and it might lead to so much misapprehension of my motives that i have felt unwilling to allude to it i hardly know how i can tell her of it at all  try the experiment of telling her friends let them know its a question of money and they will overcome her scruples if you cant but that is not what i had to say to you how long do you propose stopping here this time  i thought of staying a few days and then  and then of going back to london and making your offer i suppose will a week give you time enough to pick your opportunity with miss vanstonea week out of the fortnight or so that you have to spare  i will stay here a week admiral with pleasure if you wish it  i dont wish it i want you to pack up your traps and be off tomorrow  george looked at his uncle in silent astonishment  you found some letters waiting for you when you got here proceeded the admiral was one of those letters from my old friend sir franklin brock  yes sir  was it an invitation to you to go and stay at the grange  yes sir  to go at once  at once if i could manage it  very good i want you to manage it i want you to start for the grange tomorrow  george looked back at the fire and sighed impatiently  i understand you now admiral he said you are entirely mistaken in me my attachment to miss vanstone is not to be shaken in that manner  admiral bartram took his quarterdeck walk again up and down the room  one good turn deserves another george said the old gentleman if i am willing to make concessions on my side the least you can do is to meet me halfway and make concessions on yours  i dont deny it sir  very well now listen to my proposal give me a fair hearing georgea fair hearing is every mans privilege i will be perfectly just to begin with i wont attempt to deny that you honestly believe miss vanstone is the only woman in the world who can make you happy i dont question that what i do question is whether you really know your own mind in this matter quite so well as you think you know it yourself you cant deny george that you have been in love with a good many women in your time among the rest of them you have been in love with miss brock no longer ago than this time last year there was a sneaking kindness between you and that young lady to say the least of it and quite right too miss brock is one of that round dozen of darlings i mentioned over our first glass of wine  you are confusing an idle flirtation sir with a serious attachment said george you are altogether mistakenyou are indeed  likely enough i dont pretend to be infalliblei leave that to my juniors but i happen to have known you george since you were the height of my old telescope and i want to have this serious attachment of yours put to the test if you can satisfy me that your whole heart and soul are as strongly set on miss vanstone as you suppose them to be i must knock under to necessity and keep my objections to myself but i must be satisfied first go to the grange tomorrow and stay there a week in miss brocks society give that charming girl a fair chance of lighting up the old flame again if she can and then come back to st crux and let me hear the result if you tell me as an honest man that your attachment to miss vanstone still remains unshaken you will have heard the last of my objections from that moment whatever misgivings i may feel in my own mind i will say nothing and do nothing adverse to your wishes there is my proposal i dare say it looks like an old mans folly in your eyes but the old man wont trouble you much longer george and it may be a pleasant reflection when you have got sons of your own to remember that you humored him in his last days  he came back to the fireplace as he said those words and laid his hand once more on his nephews shoulder george took the hand and pressed it affectionately in the tenderest and best sense of the word his uncle had been a father to him  i will do what you ask me sir he replied if you seriously wish it but it is only right to tell you that the experiment will be perfectly useless however if you prefer my passing a week at the grange to my passing it here to the grange i will go  thank you george said the admiral bluntly i expected as much from you and you have not disappointed meif miss brock doesnt get us out of this mess thought the wily old gentleman as he resumed his place at the table my nephews weathercock of a head has turned steady with a vengeancewell consider the question settled for tonight george he continued aloud and call another subject these family anxieties dont improve the flavor of my old claret the bottle stands with you what are they doing at the theaters in london we always patronized the theaters in my time in the navy we used to like a good tragedy to begin with and a hornpipe to cheer us up at the end of the entertainment  for the rest of the evening the talk flowed in the ordinary channels admiral bartram only returned to the forbidden subject when he and his nephew parted for the night  you wont forget tomorrow george  certainly not sir ill take the dogcart and drive myself over after breakfast   before noon the next day mr george bartram had left the house and the last chance in magdalens favor had left it with him    chapter iv  when the servants dinnerbell at st crux rang as usual on the day of george bartrams departure it was remarked that the new parlormaids place at table remained empty one of the inferior servants was sent to her room to make inquiries and returned with the information that louisa felt a little faint and begged that her attendance at table might be excused for that day upon this the superior authority of the housekeeper was invoked and mrs drake went upstairs immediately to ascertain the truth for herself her first look of inquiry satisfied her that the parlormaids indisposition whatever the cause of it might be was certainly not assumed to serve any idle or sullen purpose of her own she respectfully declined taking any of the remedies which the housekeeper offered and merely requested permission to try the efficacy of a walk in the fresh air  i have been accustomed to more exercise maam than i take here she said might i go into the garden and try what the air will do for me  certainly can you walk by yourself or shall i send some one with you  i will go by myself if you please maam  very well put on your bonnet and shawl and when you get out keep in the east garden the admiral sometimes walks in the north garden and he might feel surprised at seeing you there come to my room when you have had air and exercise enough and let me see how you are  in a few minutes more magdalen was out in the east garden the sky was clear and sunny but the cold shadow of the house rested on the garden walk and chilled the midday air she walked toward the ruins of the old monastery situated on the south side of the more modern range of buildings here there were lonely open spaces to breathe in freely here the pale march sunshine stole through the gaps of desolation and decay and met her invitingly with the genial promise of spring  she ascended three or four riven stone steps and seated herself on some ruined fragments beyond them full in the sunshine the place she had chosen had once been the entrance to the church in centuries long gone by the stream of human sin and human suffering had flowed day after day to the confessional over the place where she now sat of all the miserable women who had trodden those old stones in the bygone time no more miserable creature had touched them than the woman whose feet rested on them now  her hands trembled as she placed them on either side of her to support herself on the stone seat she laid them on her lap they trembled there she held them out and looked at them wonderingly they trembled as she looked like an old woman she said faintly and let them drop again at her side  for the first time that morning the cruel discovery had forced itself on her mindthe discovery that her strength was failing her at the time when she had most confidently trusted to it at the time when she wanted it most she had felt the surprise of mr bartrams unexpected departure as if it had been the shock of the severest calamity that could have befallen her that one check to her hopesa check which at other times would only have roused the resisting power in her to new effortshad struck her with as suffocating a terror had prostrated her with as allmastering a despair as if she had been overwhelmed by the crowning disaster of expulsion from st crux but one warning could be read in such a change as this into the space of little more than a year she had crowded the wearing and wasting emotions of a life the bountiful gifts of health and strength so prodigally heaped on her by nature so long abused with impunity were failing her at last  she looked up at the far faint blue of the sky she heard the joyous singing of birds among the ivy that clothed the ruins oh the cold distance of the heavens oh the pitiless happiness of the birds oh the lonely horror of sitting there and feeling old and weak and worn in the heyday of her youth she rose with a last effort of resolution and tried to keep back the hysterical passion swelling at her heart by moving and looking about her rapidly and more rapidly she walked to and fro in the sunshine the exercise helped her through the very fatigue that she felt from it she forced the rising tears desperately back to their sources she fought with the clinging pain and wrenched it from its hold little by little her mind began to clear again the despairing fear of herself grew less vividly present to her thoughts there were reserves of youth and strength in her still to be wasted there was a spirit sorely wounded but not yet subdued  she gradually extended the limits of her walk she gradually recovered the exercise of her observation  at the western extremity the remains of the monastery were in a less ruinous condition than at the eastern in certain places where the stout old walls still stood repairs had been made at some former time roofs of red tile had been laid roughly over four of the ancient cells wooden doors had been added and the old monastic chambers had been used as sheds to hold the multifarious lumber of st crux no padlocks guarded any of the doors magdalen had only to push them to let the daylight in on the litter inside she resolved to investigate the sheds one after the othernot from curiosity not with the idea of making discoveries of any sort her only object was to fill up the vacant time and to keep the thoughts that unnerved her from returning to her mind  the first shed she opened contained the gardeners utensils large and small the second was littered with fragments of broken furniture empty pictureframes of wormeaten wood shattered vases boxes without covers and books torn from their bindings as magdalen turned to leave the shed after one careless glance round her at the lumber that it contained her foot struck something on the ground which tinkled against a fragment of china lying near it she stooped and discovered that the tinkling substance was a rusty key  she picked up the key and looked at it she walked out into the air and considered a little more old forgotten keys were probably lying about among the lumber in the sheds what if she collected all she could find and tried them one after another in the locks of the cabinets and cupboards now closed against her was there chance enough that any one of them might fit to justify her in venturing on the experiment if the locks at st crux were as oldfashioned as the furnitureif there were no protective niceties of modern invention to contend againstthere was chance enough beyond all question who could say whether the very key in her hand might not be the lost duplicate of one of the keys on the admirals bunch in the dearth of all other means of finding the way to her end the risk was worth running a flash of the old spirit sparkled in her weary eyes as she turned and reentered the shed  half an hour more brought her to the limits of the time which she could venture to allow herself in the open air in that interval she had searched the sheds from first to last and had found five more keys five more chances she thought to herself as she hid the keys and hastily returned to the house  after first reporting herself in the housekeepers room she went upstairs to remove her bonnet and shawl taking that opportunity to hide the keys in her bedchamber until night came they were crusted thick with rust and dirt but she dared not attempt to clean them until bedtime secluded her from the prying eyes of the servants in the solitude of her room  when the dinner hour brought her as usual into personal contact with the admiral she was at once struck by a change in him for the first time in her experience the old gentleman was silent and depressed he ate less than usual and he hardly said five words to her from the beginning of the meal to the end some unwelcome subject of reflection had evidently fixed itself on his mind and remained there persistently in spite of his efforts to shake it off at intervals through the evening she wondered with an evergrowing perplexity what the subject could be  at last the lagging hours reached their end and bedtime came before she slept that night magdalen had cleaned the keys from all impurities and had oiled the wards to help them smoothly into the locks the last difficulty that remained was the difficulty of choosing the time when the experiment might be tried with the least risk of interruption and discovery after carefully considering the question overnight magdalen could only resolve to wait and be guided by the events of the next day  the morning came and for the first time at st crux events justified the trust she had placed in them the morning came and the one remaining difficulty that perplexed her was unexpectedly smoothed away by no less a person than the admiral himself to the surprise of every one in the house he announced at breakfast that he had arranged to start for london in an hour that he should pass the night in town and that he might be expected to return to st crux in time for dinner on the next day he volunteered no further explanations to the housekeeper or to any one else but it was easy to see that his errand to london was of no ordinary importance in his own estimation he swallowed his breakfast in a violent hurry and he was impatiently ready for the carriage before it came to the door  experience had taught magdalen to be cautious she waited a little after admiral bartrams departure before she ventured on trying her experiment with the keys it was well she did so mrs drake took advantage of the admirals absence to review the condition of the apartments on the first floor the results of the investigation by no means satisfied her brooms and dusters were set to work and the housemaids were in and out of the rooms perpetually as long as the daylight lasted  the evening passed and still the safe opportunity for which magdalen was on the watch never presented itself bedtime came again and found her placed between the two alternatives of trusting to the doubtful chances of the next morning or of trying the keys boldly in the dead of night in former times she would have made her choice without hesitation she hesitated now but the wreck of her old courage still sustained her and she determined to make the venture at night  they kept early hours at st crux if she waited in her room until halfpast eleven she would wait long enough at that time she stole out on to the staircase with the keys in her pocket and the candle in her hand  on passing the entrance to the corridor on the bedroom floor she stopped and listened no sound of snoring no shuffling of infirm footsteps was to be heard on the other side of the screen she looked round it distrustfully the stone passage was a solitude and the trucklebed was empty her own eyes had shown her old mazey on his way to the upper regions more than an hour since with a candle in his hand had he taken advantage of his masters absence to enjoy the unaccustomed luxury of sleeping in a room as the thought occurred to her a sound from the further end of the corridor just caught her ear she softly advanced toward it and heard through the door of the last and remotest of the spare bedchambers the veterans lusty snoring in the room inside the discovery was startling in more senses than one it deepened the impenetrable mystery of the trucklebed for it showed plainly that old mazey had no barbarous preference of his own for passing his nights in the corridor he occupied that strange and comfortless sleepingplace purely and entirely on his masters account  it was no time for dwelling on the reflections which this conclusion might suggest magdalen retraced her steps along the passage and descended to the first floor passing the doors nearest to her she tried the library first on the staircase and in the corridors she had felt her heart throbbing fast with an unutterable fear but a sense of security returned to her when she found herself within the four walls of the room and when she had closed the door on the ghostly quiet outside  the first lock she tried was the lock of the tabledrawer none of the keys fitted it her next experiment was made on the cabinet would the second attempt fail like the first  no one of the keys fitted one of the keys with a little patient management turned the lock she looked in eagerly there were open shelves above and one long drawer under them the shelves were devoted to specimens of curious minerals neatly labeled and arranged the drawer was divided into compartments two of the compartments contained papers in the first she discovered nothing but a collection of receipted bills in the second she found a heap of business documents but the writing yellow with age was enough of itself to warn her that the trust was not there she shut the doors of the cabinet and after locking them again with some little difficulty proceeded to try the keys in the bookcase cupboards next before she continued her investigations in the other rooms  the bookcase cupboards were unassailable the drawers and cupboards in all the other rooms were unassailable one after another she tried them patiently in regular succession it was useless the chance which the cabinet in the library had offered in her favor was the first chance and the last  she went back to her room seeing nothing but her own gliding shadow hearing nothing but her own stealthy footfall in the midnight stillness of the house after mechanically putting the keys away in their former hidingplace she looked toward her bed and turned away from it shuddering the warning remembrance of what she had suffered that morning in the garden was vividly present to her mind another chance tried she thought to herself and another chance lost i shall break down again if i think of it and i shall think of it if i lie awake in the dark she had brought a workbox with her to st crux as one of the many little things which in her character of a servant it was desirable to possess and she now opened the box and applied herself resolutely to work her want of dexterity with her needle assisted the object she had in view it obliged her to pay the closest attention to her employment it forced her thoughts away from the two subjects of all others which she now dreaded mostherself and the future  the next day as he had arranged the admiral returned his visit to london had not improved his spirits the shadow of some unconquerable doubt still clouded his face his restless tongue was strangely quiet while magdalen waited on him at his solitary meal that night the snoring resounded once more on the inner side of the screen and old mazey was back again in the comfortless trucklebed  three more days passedapril came on the second of the month returning as unexpectedly as he had departed a week beforemr george bartram reappeared at st crux  he came back early in the afternoon and had an interview with his uncle in the library the interview over he left the house again and was driven to the railway by the groom in time to catch the last train to london that night the groom noticed on the road that mr george seemed to be rather pleased than otherwise at leaving st crux he also remarked on his return that the admiral swore at him for overdriving the horsesan indication of illtemper on the part of his master which he described as being entirely without precedent in all his former experience magdalen in her department of service had suffered in like manner under the old mans irritable humor he had been dissatisfied with everything she did in the diningroom and he had found fault with all the dishes one after another from the muttonbroth to the toasted cheese  the next two days passed as usual on the third day an event happened in appearance it was nothing more important than a ring at the drawingroom bell in reality it was the forerunner of approaching catastrophethe formidable herald of the end  it was magdalens business to answer the bell on reaching the drawingroom door she knocked as usual there was no reply after again knocking and again receiving no answer she ventured into the room and was instantly met by a current of cold air flowing full on her face the heavy sliding door in the opposite wall was pushed back and the arctic atmosphere of freezeyourbones was pouring unhindered into the empty room  she waited near the door doubtful what to do next it was certainly the drawingroom bell that had rung and no other she waited looking through the open doorway opposite down the wilderness of the dismantled hall  a little consideration satisfied her that it would be best to go downstairs again and wait there for a second summons fro m the bell on turning to leave the room she happened to look back once more and exactly at that moment she saw the door open at the opposite extremity of the banquetinghallthe door leading into the first of the apartments in the east wing a tall man came out wearing his great coat and his hat and rapidly approached the drawingroom his gait betrayed him while he was still too far off for his features to be seen before he was quite halfway across the hall magdalen had recognizedthe admiral  he looked not irritated only but surprised as well at finding his parlormaid waiting for him in the drawingroom and inquired sharply and suspiciously what she wanted there magdalen replied that she had come there to answer the bell his face cleared a little when he heard the explanation yes yes to be sure he said i did ring and then i forgot it he pulled the sliding door back into its place as he spoke coals he resumed impatiently pointing to the empty scuttle i rang for coals  magdalen went back to the kitchen regions after communicating the admirals order to the servant whose special duty it was to attend to the fires she returned to the pantry and gently closing the door sat down alone to think  it had been her impression in the drawingroomand it was her impression stillthat she had accidentally surprised admiral bartram on a visit to the east rooms which for some urgent reason of his own he wished to keep a secret haunted day and night by the one dominant idea that now possessed her she leaped all logical difficulties at a bound and at once associated the suspicion of a secret proceeding on the admirals part with the kindred suspicion which pointed to him as the depositary of the secret trust up to this time it had been her settled belief that he kept all his important documents in one or other of the suite of rooms which he happened to be occupying for the time being whyshe now asked herself with a sudden distrust of the conclusion which had hitherto satisfied her mindwhy might he not lock some of them up in the other rooms as well the remembrance of the keys still concealed in their hidingplace in her room sharpened her sense of the reasonableness of this new view with one unimportant exception those keys had all failed when she tried them in the rooms on the north side of the house might they not succeed with the cabinets and cupboards in the east rooms on which she had never tried them or thought of trying them yet if there was a chance however small of turning them to better account than she had turned them thus far it was a chance to be tried if there was a possibility however remote that the trust might be hidden in any one of the locked repositories in the east wing it was a possibility to be put to the test when her own experience answered the question at the time when no prying eyes were open and no accidents were to be fearedwhen the house was quietin the dead of night  she knew enough of her changed self to dread the enervating influence of delay she determined to run the risk headlong that night  more blunders escaped her when dinnertime came the admirals criticisms on her waiting at table were sharper than ever his hardest words inflicted no pain on her she scarcely heard himher mind was dull to every sense but the sense of the coming trial the evening which had passed slowly to her on the night of her first experiment with the keys passed quickly now when bedtime came bedtime took her by surprise  she waited longer on this occasion than she had waited before the admiral was at home he might alter his mind and go downstairs again after he had gone up to his room he might have forgotten something in the library and might return to fetch it midnight struck from the clock in the servants hall before she ventured out of her room with the keys again in her pocket with the candle again in her hand  at the first of the stairs on which she set her foot to descend an allmastering hesitation an unintelligible shrinking from some peril unknown seized her on a sudden she waited and reasoned with herself she had recoiled from no sacrifices she had yielded to no fears in carrying out the stratagem by which she had gained admission to st crux and now when the long array of difficulties at the outset had been patiently conquered now when by sheer force of resolution the startingpoint was gained she hesitated to advance i shrank from nothing to get here she said to herself what madness possesses me that i shrink now  every pulse in her quickened at the thought with an animating shame that nerved her to go on she descended the stairs from the third floor to the second from the second to the first without trusting herself to pause again within easy reach of her own room in another minute she had reached the end of the corridor had crossed the vestibule and had entered the drawingroom it was only when her grasp was on the heavy brass handle of the sliding doorit was only at the moment before she pushed the door backthat she waited to take breath the banquetinghall was close on the other side of the wooden partition against which she stood her excited imagination felt the deathlike chill of it flowing over her already  she pushed back the sliding door a few inchesand stopped in momentary alarm when the admiral had closed it in her presence that day she had heard no noise when old mazey had opened it to show her the rooms in the east wing she had heard no noise now in the night silence she noticed for the first time that the door made a sounda dull rushing sound like the wind  she roused herself and pushed it further backpushed it halfway into the hollow chamber in the wall constructed to receive it she advanced boldly into the gap and met the night view of the banquetinghall face to face  the moon was rounding the southern side of the house her paling beams streamed through the nearer windows and lay in long strips of slanting light on the marble pavement of the hall the black shadows of the pediments between each window alternating with the strips of light heightened the wan glare of the moonshine on the floor toward its lower end the hall melted mysteriously into darkness the ceiling was lost to view the yawning fireplace the overhanging mantelpiece the long row of battle pictures above were all swallowed up in night but one visible object was discernible besides the gleaming windows and the moonstriped floor midway in the last and furthest of the strips of light the tripod rose erect on its gaunt black legs like a monster called to life by the moona monster rising through the light and melting invisibly into the upper shadows of the hall far and near all sound lay dead drowned in the stagnant cold the soothing hush of night was awful here the deep abysses of darkness hid abysses of silence more immeasurable still  she stood motionless in the doorway with straining eyes with straining ears she looked for some moving thing she listened for some rising sound and looked and listened in vain a quick ceaseless shivering ran through her from head to foot the shivering of fear or the shivering of cold the bare doubt roused her resolute will now she thought advancing a step through the doorway or never ill count the strips of moonlight three times over and cross the hall  one two three four five one two three four five one two three four five  as the final number passed her lips at the third time of counting she crossed the hall looking for nothing listening for nothing one hand holding the candle the other mechanically grasping the folds of her dress she sped ghostlike down the length of the ghostly place she reached the door of the first of the eastern rooms opened it and ran in the sudden relief of attaining a refuge the sudden entrance into a new atmosphere overpowered her for the moment she had just time to put the candle safely on a table before she dropped giddy and breathless into the nearest chair  little by little she felt the rest quieting her in a few minutes she became conscious of the triumph of having won her way to the east rooms in a few minutes she was strong enough to rise from the chair to take the keys from her pocket and to look round her  the first objects of furniture in the room which attracted her attention were an old bureau of carved oak and a heavy buhl table with a cabinet attached she tried the bureau first it looked the likeliest receptacle for papers of the two three of the keys proved to be of a size to enter the lock but none of them would turn it the bureau was unassailable she left it and paused to trim the wick of the candle before she tried the buhl cabinet next  at the moment when she raised her hand to the candle she heard the stillness of the banquetinghall shudder with the terror of a sounda sound faint and momentary like the distant rushing of the wind  the sliding door in the drawingroom had moved  which way had it moved had an unknown hand pushed it back in its socket further than she had pushed it or pulled it to again and closed it the horror of being shut out all night by some undiscoverable agency from the life of the house was stronger in her than the horror of looking across the banquetinghall she made desperately for the door of the room  it had fallen to silently after her when she had come in but it was not closed she pulled it open and looked  the sight that met her eyes rooted her panicstricken to the spot  close to the first of the row of windows counting from the drawingroom and full in the gleam of it she saw a solitary figure it stood motionless rising out of the furthest strip of moonlight on the floor as she looked it suddenly disappeared in another instant she saw it again in the second strip of moonlightlost it againsaw it in the third striplost it once moreand saw it in the fourth moment by moment it advanced now mysteriously lost in the shadow now suddenly visible again in the light until it reached the fifth and nearest strip of moonlight there it paused and strayed aside slowly to the middle of the hall it stopped at the tripod and stood shivering audibly in the silence with its hands raised over the dead ashes in the action of warming them at a fire it turned back again moving down the path of the moonlight stopped at the fifth window turned once more and came on softly through the shadow straight to the place where magdalen stood  her voice was dumb her will was helpless every sense in her but the seeing sense was paralyzed the seeing senseheld fast in the fetters of its own terrorlooked unchangeably straightforward as it had looked from the first there she stood in the doorway full in the path of the figure advancing on her through the shadow nearer and nearer step by step  it came close  the bonds of horror that held her burst asunder when it was within armslength she started back the light of the candle on the table fell full on its face and showed heradmiral bartram  a long gray dressinggown was wrapped round him his head was uncovered his feet were bare in his left hand he carried his little basket of keys he passed magdalen slowly his lips whispering without intermission his open eyes staring straight before him with the glassy stare of death his eyes revealed to her the terrifying truth he was walking in his sleep  the terror of seeing him as she saw him now was not the terror she had felt when her eyes first lighted on himan apparition in the moonlight a specter in the ghostly hall this time she could struggle against the shock she could feel the depth of her own fear  he passed her and stopped in the middle of the room magdalen ventured near enough to him to be within reach of his voice as he muttered to himself she ventured nearer still and heard the name of her dead husband fall distinctly from the sleepwalkers lips  noel he said in the low monotonous tones of a dreamer talking in his sleep my good fellow noel take it back again it worries me day and night i dont know where its safe i dont know where to put it take it back noeltake it back  as those words escaped him he walked to the buhl cabinet he sat down in the chair placed before it and searched in the basket among his keys magdalen softly followed him and stood behind his chair waiting with the candle in her hand he found the key and unlocked the cabinet without an instants hesitation he drew out a drawer the second of a row the one thing in the drawer was a folded letter he removed it and put it down before him on the table take it back noel he repeated mechanically take it back  magdalen looked over his shoulder and read these lines traced in her husbands handwriting at the top of the letter to be kept in your own possession and to be opened by yourself only on the day of my decease noel vanstone she saw the words plainly with the admirals name and the admirals address written under them  the trust within reach of her hand the trust traced to its hidingplace at last  she took one step forward to steal round his chair and to snatch the letter from the table at the instant when she moved he took it up once more locked the cabinet and rising turned and faced her  in the impulse of the moment she stretched out her hand toward the hand in which he held the letter the yellow candlelight fell full on him the awful deathinlife of his facethe mystery of the sleeping body moving in unconscious obedience to the dreaming minddaunted her her hand trembled and dropped again at her side  he put the key of the cabinet back in the basket and crossed the room to the bureau with the basket in one hand and the letter in the other magdalen set the candle on the table again and watched him as he had opened the cabinet so he now opened the bureau once more magdalen stretched out her hand and once more she recoiled before the mystery and the terror of his sleep he put the letter in a drawer at the back of the bureau and closed the heavy oaken lid again yes he said safer there as you say noelsafer there so he spoke so time after time the words that betrayed him revealed the dead man living and speaking again in the dream  had he locked the bureau magdalen had not heard the lock turn as he slowly moved away walking back once more toward the middle of the room she tried the lid it was locked that discovery made she looked to see what he was doing next he was leaving the room again with the basket of keys in his hand when her first glance overtook him he was crossing the threshold of the door  some inscrutable fascination possessed her some mysterious attraction drew her after him in spite of herself she took up the candle and followed him mechanically as if she too were walking in her sleep one behind the other in slow and noiseless progress they crossed the banquetinghall one behind the other they passed through the drawingroom and along the corridor and up the stairs she followed him to his own door he went in and shut it behind him softly she stopped and looked toward the trucklebed it was pushed aside at the foot some little distance away from the bedroom door who had moved it she held the candle close and looked toward the pillow with a sudden curiosity and a sudden doubt  the trucklebed was empty  the discovery startled her for the moment and for the moment only plain as the inferences were to be drawn from it she never drew them her mind slowly recovering the exercise of its faculties was still under the influence of the earlier and the deeper impressions produced on it her mind followed the admiral into his room as her body had followed him across the banquetinghall  had he lain down again in his bed was he still asleep she listened at the door not a sound was audible in the room she tried the door and finding it not locked softly opened it a few inches and listened again the rise and fall of his low regular breathing instantly caught her ear he was still asleep  she went into the room and shading th e candlelight with her hand approached the bedside to look at him the dream was past the old mans sleep was deep and peaceful his lips were still his quiet hand was laid over the coverlet in motionless repose he lay with his face turned toward the righthand side of the bed a little table stood there within reach of his hand four objects were placed on it his candle his matches his customary night drink of lemonade and his basket of keys  the idea of possessing herself of his keys that night if an opportunity offered when the basket was not in his hand had first crossed her mind when she saw him go into his room she had lost it again for the moment in the surprise of discovering the empty trucklebed she now recovered it the instant the table attracted her attention it was useless to waste time in trying to choose the one key wanted from the restthe one key was not well enough known to her to be readily identified she took all the keys from the table in the basket as they lay and noiselessly closed the door behind her on leaving the room  the trucklebed as she passed it obtruded itself again on her attention and forced her to think of it after a moments consideration she moved the foot of the bed back to its customary position across the door whether he was in the house or out of it the veteran might return to his deserted post at any moment if he saw the bed moved from its usual place he might suspect something wrong he might rouse his master and the loss of the keys might be discovered  nothing happened as she descended the stairs nothing happened as she passed along the corridor the house was as silent and as solitary as ever she crossed the banquetinghall this time without hesitation the events of the night had hardened her mind against all imaginary terrors now i have got it she whispered to herself in an irrepressible outburst of exaltation as she entered the first of the east rooms and put her candle on the top of the old bureau  even yet there was a trial in store for her patience some minutes elapsedminutes that seemed hoursbefore she found the right key and raised the lid of the bureau at last she drew out the inner drawer at last she had the letter in her hand  it had been sealed but the seal was broken she opened it on the spot to make sure that she had actually possessed herself of the trust before leaving the room the end of the letter was the first part of it she turned to it came to its conclusion high on the third page and it was signed by noel vanstone below the name these lines were added in the admirals handwriting   this letter was received by me at the same time with the will of my friend noel vanstone in the event of my death without leaving any other directions respecting it i beg my nephew and my executors to understand that i consider the requests made in this document as absolutely binding on me  arthur everard bartram   she left those lines unread she just noticed that they were not in noel vanstones handwriting and passing over them instantly as immaterial to the object in view turned the leaves of the letter and transferred her attention to the opening sentences on the first page she read these words   dear admiral bartramwhen you open my will in which you are named my sole executor you will find that i have bequeathed the whole residue of my estateafter payment of one legacy of five thousand poundsto yourself it is the purpose of my letter to tell you privately what the object is for which i have left you the fortune which is now placed in your hands  i beg you to consider this large legacy as intended   she had proceeded thus far with breathless curiosity and interest when her attention suddenly failed her somethingshe was too deeply absorbed to know whathad got between her and the letter was it a sound in the banquetinghall again she looked over her shoulder at the door behind her and listened nothing was to be heard nothing was to be seen she returned to the letter  the writing was cramped and close in her impatient curiosity to read more she failed to find the lost place again her eyes attracted by a blot lighted on a sentence lower in the page than the sentence at which she had left off the first three words she saw riveted her attention anewthey were the first words she had met with in the letter which directly referred to george bartram in the sudden excitement of that discovery she read the rest of the sentence eagerly before she made any second attempt to return to the lost place   if your nephew fails to comply with these conditionsthat is to say if being either a bachelor or a widower at the time of my decease he fails to marry in all respects as i have here instructed him to marry within six calendar months from that timeit is my desire that he shall not receive   she had read to that point to that last word and no further when a hand passed suddenly from behind her between the letter and her eye and gripped her fast by the wrist in an instant  she turned with a shriek of terror and found herself face to face with old mazey  the veterans eyes were bloodshot his hand was heavy his list slippers were twisted crookedly on his feet and his body swayed to and fro on his widely parted legs if he had tested his condition that night by the unfailing criterion of the model ship he must have inevitably pronounced sentence on himself in the usual form drunk again mazey drunk again  you young jezebel said the old sailor with a leer on one side of his face and a frown on the other the next time you take to nightwalking in the neighborhood of freezeyourbones use those sharp eyes of yours first and make sure theres nobody else night walking in the garden outside drop it jezebel drop it  keeping fast hold of magdalens arm with one hand he took the letter from her with the other put it back into the open drawer and locked the bureau she never struggled with him she never spoke her energy was gone her powers of resistance were crushed the terrors of that horrible night following one close on the other in reiterated shocks had struck her down at last she yielded as submissively she trembled as helplessly as the weakest woman living  old mazey dropped her arm and pointed with drunken solemnity to a chair in an inner corner of the room she sat down still without uttering a word the veteran breathing very hard over it steadied himself on both elbows against the slanting top of the bureau and from that commanding position addressed magdalen once more  come and be locked up said old mazey wagging his venerable head with judicial severity therell be a court of inquiry tomorrow morning and im witnessworse luckim witness you young jade youve committed burglarythats what youve done his honor the admirals keys stolen his honor the admirals desk ransacked and his honor the admirals private letters broke open burglary burglary come and be locked up he slowly recovered an upright position with the assistance of his hands backed by the solid resisting power of the bureau and lapsed into lachrymose soliloquy whod have thought it said old mazey paternally watering at the eyes take the outside of her and shes as straight as a poplar take the inside of her and shes as crooked as sin such a finegrown girl too what a pity what a pity  dont hurt me said magdalen faintly as old mazey staggered up to the chair and took her by the wrist again im frightened mr mazeyim dreadfully frightened  hurt you repeated the veteran im a deal too fond of youand more shame for me at my ageto hurt you if i let go of your wrist will you walk straight before me where i can see you all the way will you be a good girl and walk straight up to your own door  magdalen gave the promise required of hergave it with an eager longing to reach the refuge of her room she rose and tried to take the candle from the bureau but old mazeys cunning hand was too quick for her let the candle be said the veteran winking in momentary forgetfulness of his responsible position youre a trifle quicker on your legs than i am my dear and you might leave me in the lurch if i dont carry the light  they returned to the inhabited side of the house staggering after magdalen with the basket of keys in one hand and the candle in the other old mazey sorrowfully compared her figure with the straightness of the poplar and her disposition with the crookedness of sin all the way across freezeyourbones and all the way upstairs to her own door arrived at that destination he peremptorily refused to give her the candle until he had first seen her safely inside the room the conditions being complied with he resigned the light with one hand and made a dash with the other at the key drew it from the inside of the lock and instantly closed the door magdalen heard him outside chuckling over his own dexterity and fitting the key into the lock again with infinite difficulty at last he secured the door with a deep grunt of relief there she is safe magdalen heard him say in regretful soliloquy as fine a girl as ever i sat eyes on what a pity what a pity  the last sounds of his voice died out in the distance and she was left alone in her room   holding fast by the banister old mazey made his way down to the corridor on the second floor in which a night light was always burning he advanced to the trucklebed and steadying himself against the opposite wall looked at it attentively prolonged contemplation of his own restingplace for the night apparently failed to satisfy him he shook his head ominously and taking from the sidepocket of his greatcoat a pair of old patched slippers surveyed them with an aspect of illimitable doubt im all abroad tonight he mumbled to himself troubled in my mindthats what it istroubled in my mind  the old patched slippers and the veterans existing perplexities happened to be intimately associated one with the other in the relation of cause and effect the slippers belonged to the admiral who had taken one of his unreasonable fancies to this particular pair and who still persisted in wearing them long after they were unfit for his service early that afternoon old mazey had taken the slippers to the village cobbler to get them repaired on the spot before his master called for them the next morning he sat superintending the progress and completion of the work until evening came when he and the cobbler betook themselves to the village inn to drink each others healths at parting they had prolonged this social ceremony till far into the night and they had parted as a necessary consequence in a finished and perfect state of intoxication on either side  if the drinkingbout had led to no other result than those night wanderings in the grounds of st crux which had shown old mazey the light in the east windows his memory would unquestionably have presented it to him the next morning in the aspect of one of the praiseworthy achievements of his life but another consequence had sprung from it which the old sailor now saw dimly through the interposing bewilderment left in his brain by the drink he had committed a breach of discipline and a breach of trust in plainer words he had deserted his post  the one safeguard against admiral bartrams constitutional tendency to somnambulism was the watch and ward which his faithful old servant kept outside his door no entreaties had ever prevailed on him to submit to the usual precaution taken in such cases he peremptorily declined to be locked into his room he even ignored his own liability whenever a dream disturbed him to walk in his sleep over and over again old mazey had been roused by the admirals attempts to push past the trucklebed or to step over it in his sleep and over and over again when the veteran had reported the fact the next morning his master had declined to believe him as the old sailor now stood staring in vacant inquiry at the bedchamber door these incidents of the past rose confusedly on his memory and forced on him the serious question whether the admiral had left his room during the earlier hours of the night if by any mischance the sleepwalking fit had seized him the slippers in old mazeys hand pointed straight to the conclusion that followedhis master must have passed barefoot in the cold night over the stone stairs and passages of st crux lord send hes been quiet muttered old mazey daunted bold as he was and drunk as he was by the bare contemplation of that prospect if his honors been walking tonight it will be the death of him  he roused himself for the moment by main forcestrong in his doglike fidelity to the admiral though strong in nothing elseand fought off the stupor of the drink he looked at the bed with steadier eyes and a clearer mind magdalens precaution in returning it to its customary position presented it to him necessarily in the aspect of a bed which had never been moved from its place he next examined the counterpane carefully not the faintest vestige appeared of the indentation which must have been left by footsteps passing over it there was the plain evidence before himthe evidence recognizable at last by his own bewildered eyesthat the admiral had never moved from his room  ill take the pledge tomorrow mumbled old mazey in an outburst of grateful relief the next moment the fumes of the liquor floated back insidiously over his brain and the veteran returning to his customary remedy paced the passage in zigzag as usual and kept watch on the deck of an imaginary ship   soon after sunrise magdalen suddenly heard the grating of the key from outside in the lock of the door the door opened and old mazey reappeared on the threshold the first fever of his intoxication had cooled with time into a mild penitential glow he breathed harder than ever in a succession of low growls and wagged his venerable head at his own delinquencies without intermission  how are you now you young landshark in petticoats inquired the old sailor has your conscience been quiet enough to let you go to sleep  i have not slept said magdalen drawing back from him in doubt of what he might do next i have no remembrance of what happened after you locked the doori think i must have fainted dont frighten me again mr mazey i feel miserably weak and ill what do you want  i want to say something serious replied old mazey with impenetrable solemnity its been on my mind to come here and make a clean breast of it for the last hour or more mark my words young woman im going to disgrace myself  magdalen drew further and further back and looked at him in rising alarm  i know my duty to his honor the admiral proceeded old mazey waving his hand drearily in the direction of his masters door but try as hard as i may i cant find it in my heart you young jade to be witness against you i liked the make of you especially about the waist when you first came into the house and i cant help liking the make of you stillthough you have committed burglary and though you are as crooked as sin ive cast the eyes of indulgence on finegrown girls all my life and its too late in the day to cast the eyes of severity on em now im seventyseven or seventyeight i dont rightly know which im a battered old hulk with my seams opening and my pumps choked and the waters of death powering in on me as fast as they can im as miserable a sinner as youll meet with anywhere in these partsthomas nagle the cobbler only excepted and hes worse than i am for hes the younger of the two and he ought to know better but the long and short or it is i shall go down to my grave with an eye of indulgence for a finegrown girl more shame for me you young jezebelmore shame for me  the veterans unmanageable eyes began to leer again in spite of him as he concluded his harangue in these terms the last reserves of austerity left in his face entrenched themselves dismally round the corners of his mouth magdalen approached him again and tried to speak he solemnly motioned her back with another dreary wave of his hand  no carneying said old mazey im bad enough already without that its my duty to make my report to his honor the admiral and i will make it but if you like to give the house the slip before the burglarys reported and the court of inquiry begins ill disgrace myself by letting you go its market morning at ossory and dawkes will be driving the light cart over in a quarter of an hours time dawkes will take you if i ask him i know my dutymy duty is to turn the key on you and see dawkes damned first but i cant find it in my heart to be hard on a fine girl like you its bred in the bone and it wunt come out of the flesh more shame for me i tell you againmore shame for me  the proposal thus strangely and suddenly presented to her took magdalen completely by surprise she had been far too seriously shaken by the events of the night to be capable of deciding on any subject at a moments notice you are very good to me mr mazey she said may i have a minute by myself to think  yes you may replied the veteran facing about forthwith and leaving the room theyre all alike proceeded old mazey with his head still running on the sex whatever you offer em they always want something more tall and short native and foreign sweethearts and wives theyre all alike  left by herself magdalen reached her decision with far less difficulty than she had anticipated  if she remained in the house there were only two courses before herto charge old mazey with speaking under the influence of a drunken delusion or to submit to circumstances though she owed to the old sailor her defeat in the very hour of success his consideration for her at that moment forbade the idea of defending herself at his expenseeven supposing what was in the last degree improbable that the defense would be credited in the second of the two cases the case of submission to circumstances but one result could be expectedinstant dismissal and perhaps discovery as well what object was to be gained by braving that degradationby leaving the house publicly disgraced in the eyes of the servants who had hated and distrusted her from the first the accident which had literally snatched the trust from her possession when she had it in her hand was irreparable the one apparent compensation under the disasterin other words the discovery that the trust actually existed and that george bartrams marriage within a given time was one of the objects contained in itwas a compensation which could only be estimated at its true value by placing it under the light of mr loscombes experience every motive of which she was conscious was a motive which urged her to leave the house secretly while the chance was at her disposal she looked out into the passage and called softly to old mazey to come back  i accept your offer thankfully mr mazey she said you dont know what hard measure you dealt out to me when you took that letter from my hand but you did your duty and i can be grateful to you for sparing me this morning hard as you were upon me last night i am not such a bad girl as you think mei am not indeed  old mazey dismissed the subject with another dreary wave of his hand  let it be said the veteran let it be it makes no difference my girl to such an old rascal as i am if you were fifty times worse than you are i should let you go all the same put on your bonnet and shawl and come along im a disgrace to myself and a warning to othersthats what i am no luggage mind leave all your rattletraps behind you to be overhauled if necessary at his honor the admirals discretion i can be hard enough on your boxes you young jezebel if i cant be hard on you  with these words old mazey led the way out of the room the less i see of her the betterespecially about the waist he said to himself as he hobbled downstairs with the help of the banisters  the cart was standing in the back yard when they reached the lower regions of the house and dawkes otherwise the farmbailiffs man was fastening the last buckle of the horses harness the hoarfrost of the morning was still white in the shade the sparkling points of it glistened brightly on the shaggy coats of brutus and cassius as they idled about the yard waiting with steaming mouths and slowly wagging tails to see the cart drive off old mazey went out alone and used his influence with dawkes who staring in stolid amazement put a leather cushion on the cartseat for his fellowtraveler shivering in the sharp morning air magdalen waited while the preliminaries of departure were in progress conscious of nothing but a giddy bewilderment of thought and a helpless suspension of feeling the events of the night confused themselves hideously with the trivial circumstances passing before her eyes in the courtyard she started with the sudden terror of the night when old mazey reappeared to summon her out to the cart she trembled with the helpless confusion of the night when the veteran cast the eyes of indulgence on her for the last time and gave her a kiss on the cheek at parting the next minute she felt him help her into the cart and pat her on the back the next she heard him tell her in a confidential whisper that sitting or standing she was as straight as a poplar either way then there was a pause in which nothing was said and nothing done and then the driver took the reins in hand and mounted to his place  she roused herself at the parting moment and looked back the last sight she saw at st crux was old mazey wagging his head in the courtyard with his fellowprofligates the dogs keeping time to him with their tails the last words she heard were the words in which the veteran paid his farewell tribute to her charms  burglary or no burglary said old mazey shes a finegrown girl if ever there was a fine one yet what a pity what a pity  the end of the seventh scene     between the scenes  progress of the story through the post   i

it in london the grass shall not grow under my feet i promise you for once in my life i will take time as fiercely by the forelock as if i was the most impetuous man in england and rely on it the moment i know the result you shall know the result too affectionately yours  george bartram   ii  from george bartram to miss garth  paris april 13th  dear miss garthi have just written with a heavy heart to my uncle and i think i owe it to your kind interest in me not to omit writing next to you  you will feel for my disappointment i am sure when i tell you in the fewest and plainest words that miss vanstone has refused me  my vanity may have grievously misled me but i confess i expected a very different result my vanity may be misleading me still for i must acknowledge to you privately that i think miss vanstone was sorry to refuse me the reason she gave for her decisionno doubt a sufficient reason in her estimationdid not at the time and does not now seem sufficient to me sh e spoke in the sweetest and kindest manner but she firmly declared that her family misfortunes left her no honorable alternativebut to think of my own interests as i had not thought of them myselfand gratefully to decline accepting my offer  she was so painfully agitated that i could not venture to plead my own cause as i might otherwise have pleaded it at the first attempt i made to touch the personal question she entreated me to spare her and abruptly left the room i am still ignorant whether i am to interpret the family misfortunes which have set up this barrier between us as meaning the misfortune for which her parents alone are to blame or the misfortune of her having such a woman as mrs noel vanstone for her sister in whichever of these circumstances the obstacle lies it is no obstacle in my estimation can nothing remove it is there no hope forgive me for asking these questions i cannot bear up against my bitter disappointment neither she nor you nor any one but myself can know how i love her  ever most truly yours  george bartram  p si shall leave for england in a day or two passing through london on my way to st crux there are family reasons connected with the hateful subject of money which make me look forward with anything but pleasure to my next interview with my uncle if you address your letter to longs hotel it will be sure to reach me   iii  from miss garth to george bartram  westmoreland house april 16th  dear mr bartramyou only did me justice in supposing that your letter would distress me if you had supposed that it would make me excessively angry as well you would not have been far wrong i have no patience with the pride and perversity of the young women of the present day  i have heard from norah it is a long letter stating the particulars in full detail i am now going to put all the confidence in your honor and your discretion which i really feel for your sake and for norahs i am going to let you know what the scruple really is which has misled her into the pride and folly of refusing you i am old enough to speak out and i can tell you if she had only been wise enough to let her own wishes guide her she would have said yesand gladly too  the original cause of all the mischief is no less a person than your worthy uncleadmiral bartram  it seems that the admiral took it into his head i suppose during your absence to go to london by himself and to satisfy some curiosity of his own about norah by calling in portland place under pretense of renewing his old friendship with the tyrrels he came at luncheontime and saw norah and from all i can hear was apparently better pleased with her than he expected or wished to be when he came into the house  so far this is mere guesswork but it is unluckily certain that he and mrs tyrrel had some talk together alone when luncheon was over your name was not mentioned but when their conversation fell on norah you were in both their minds of course the admiral doing her full justice personally declared himself smitten with pity for her hard lot in life the scandalous conduct of her sister must always stand he feared in the way of her future advantage who could marry her without first making it a condition that she and her sister were to be absolute strangers to each other and even then the objection would remainthe serious objection to the husbands familyof being connected by marriage with such a woman as mrs noel vanstone it was very sad it was not the poor girls fault but it was none the less true that her sister was her rock ahead in life so he ran on with no real illfeeling toward norah but with an obstinate belief in his own prejudices which bore the aspect of illfeeling and which people with more temper than judgment would be but too readily disposed to resent accordingly  unfortunately mrs tyrrel is one of those people she is an excellent warmhearted woman with a quick temper and very little judgment strongly attached to norah and heartily interested in norahs welfare from all i can learn she first resented the expression of the admirals opinion in his presence as worldly and selfish in the last degree and then interpreted it behind his back as a hint to discourage his nephews visits which was a downright insult offered to a lady in her own house this was foolish enough so far but worse folly was to come  as soon as your uncle was gone mrs tyrrel most unwisely and improperly sent for norah and repeating the conversation that had taken place warned her of the reception she might expect from the man who stood toward you in the position of a father if she accepted an offer of marriage on your part when i tell you that norahs faithful attachment to her sister still remains unshaken and that there lies hidden under her noble submission to the unhappy circumstances of her life a proud susceptibility to slights of all kinds which is deeply seated in her natureyou will understand the true motive of the refusal which has so naturally and so justly disappointed you they are all three equally to blame in this matter your uncle was wrong to state his objections so roundly and inconsiderately as he did mrs tyrrel was wrong to let her temper get the better of her and to suppose herself insulted where no insult was intended and norah was wrong to place a scruple of pride and a hopeless belief in her sister which no strangers can be expected to share above the higher claims of an attachment which might have secured the happiness and the prosperity of her future life  but the mischief has been done the next question is can the harm be remedied  i hope and believe it can my advice is this dont take no for an answer give her time enough to reflect on what she has done and to regret it as i believe she will regret it in secret trust to my influence over her to plead your cause for you at every opportunity i can find wait patiently for the right moment and ask her again men being accustomed to act on reflection themselves are a great deal too apt to believe that women act on reflection too women do nothing of the sort they act on impulse and in nine cases out of ten they are heartily sorry for it afterward  in the meanwhile you must help your own interests by inducing your uncle to alter his opinion or at least to make the concession of keeping his opinion to himself mrs tyrrel has rushed to the conclusion that the harm he has done he did intentionallywhich is as much as to say in so many words that he had a prophetic conviction when he came into the house of what she would do when he left it my explanation of the matter is a much simpler one i believe that the knowledge of your attachment naturally aroused his curiosity to see the object of it and that mrs tyrrels injudicious praises of norah irritated his objections into openly declaring themselves anyway your course lies equally plain before you use your influence over your uncle to persuade him into setting matters right again trust my settled resolution to see norah your wife before six months more are over our heads and believe me your friend and wellwisher  harriet garth   iv  from mrs drake to george bartram  st crux april 17th  siri direct these lines to the hotel you usually stay at in london hoping that you may return soon enough from foreign parts to receive my letter without delay  i am sorry to say that some unpleasant events have taken place at st crux since you left it and that my honored master the admiral is far from enjoying his usual good health on both these accounts i venture to write to you on my own responsibility for i think your presence is needed in the house  early in the month a most regrettable circumstance took place our new parlormaid was discovered by mr mazey at a late hour of the night with her master s basket of keys in her possession prying into the private documents kept in the east library the girl removed herself from the house the next morning before we were any of us astir and she has not been heard of since this event has annoyed and alarmed my master very seriously and to make matters worse on the day when the girls treacherous conduct was discovered the admiral was seized with the first symptoms of a severe inflammatory cold he was not himself aware nor was any one else how he had caught the chill the doctor was sent for and kept the inflammation down until the day before yesterday when it broke out again under circumstances which i am sure you will be sorry to hear as i am truly sorry to write of them  on the date i have just mentionedi mean the fifteenth of the monthmy master himself informed me that he had been dreadfully disappointed by a letter received from you which had come in the morning from foreign parts and had brought him bad news he did not tell me what the news wasbut i have never in all the years i have passed in the admirals service seen him so distressingly upset and so unlike himself as he was on that day at night his uneasiness seemed to increase he was in such a state of irritation that he could not bear the sound of mr mazeys hard breathing outside his door and he laid his positive orders on the old man to go into one of the bedrooms for that night mr mazey to his own great regret was of course obliged to obey  our only means of preventing the admiral from leaving his room in his sleep if the fit unfortunately took him being now removed mr mazey and i agreed to keep watch by turns through the night sitting with the door ajar in one of the empty rooms near our masters bedchamber we could think of nothing better to do than this knowing he would not allow us to lock him in and not having the door key in our possession even if we could have ventured to secure him in his room without his permission i kept watch for the first two hours and then mr mazey took my place after having been some little time in my own room it occurred to me that the old man was hard of hearing and that if his eyes grew at all heavy in the night his ears were not to be trusted to warn him if anything happened i slipped on my clothes again and went back to mr mazey he was neither asleep nor awakehe was between the two my mind misgave me and i went on to the admirals room the door was open and the bed was empty  mr mazey and i went downstairs instantly we looked in all the north rooms one after another and found no traces of him i thought of the drawingroom next and being the more active of the two went first to examine it the moment i turned the sharp corner of the passage i saw my master coming toward me through the open drawingroom door asleep and dreaming with his keys in his hands the sliding door behind him was open also and the fear came to me then and has remained with me ever since that his dream had led him through the banquetinghall into the east rooms we abstained from waking him and followed his steps until he returned of his own accord to his bedchamber the next morning i grieve to say all the bad symptoms came back and none of the remedies employed have succeeded in getting the better of them yet by the doctors advice we refrained from telling the admiral what had happened he is still under the impression that he passed the night as usual in his own room  i have been careful to enter into all the particulars of this unfortunate accident because neither mr mazey nor myself desire to screen ourselves from blame if blame we have deserved we both acted for the best and we both beg and pray you will consider our responsible situation and come as soon as possible to st crux our honored master is very hard to manage and the doctor thinks as we do that your presence is wanted in the house  i remain sir with mr mazeys respects and my own your humble servant  sophia drake   v  from george bartram to miss garth  st crux april 22d  dear miss garthpray excuse my not thanking you sooner for your kind and consoling letter we are in sad trouble at st crux any little irritation i might have felt at my poor uncles unlucky interference in portland place is all forgotten in the misfortune of his serious illness he is suffering from internal inflammation produced by cold and symptoms have shown themselves which are dangerous at his age a physician from london is now in the house you shall hear more in a few days meantime believe me with sincere gratitude  yours most truly  george bartram   vi  from mr loscombe to mrs noel vanstone  lincolns inn fields may 6th  dear madami have unexpectedly received some information which is of the most vital importance to your interests the news of admiral bartrams death has reached me this morning he expired at his own house on the fourth of the present month  this event at once disposes of the considerations which i had previously endeavored to impress on you in relation to your discovery at st crux the wisest course we can now follow is to open communications at once with the executors of the deceased gentleman addressing them through the medium of the admirals legal adviser in the first instance  i have dispatched a letter this day to the solicitor in question it simply warns him that we have lately become aware of the existence of a private document controlling the deceased gentleman in his use of the legacy devised to him by mr noel vanstones will my letter assumes that the document will be easily found among the admirals papers and it mentions that i am the solicitor appointed by mrs noel vanstone to receive communications on her behalf my object in taking this step is to cause a search to be instituted for the trustin the very probable event of the executors not having met with it yetbefore the usual measures are adopted for the administration of the admirals estate we will threaten legal proceedings if we find that the object does not succeed but i anticipate no such necessity admiral bartrams executors must be men of high standing and position and they will do justice to you and to themselves in this matter by looking for the trust  under these circumstances you will naturally ask what are our prospects when the document is found our prospects have a bright side and a dark side let us take the bright side to begin with  what do we actually know  we know first that the trust does really exist secondly that there is a provision in it relating to the marriage of mr george bartram in a given time thirdly that the time six months from the date of your husbands death expired on the third of this month fourthly that mr george bartram as i have found out by inquiry in the absence of any positive information on the subject possessed by yourself is at the present moment a single man the conclusion naturally follows that the object contemplated by the trust in this case is an object that has failed  if no other provisions have been inserted in the documentor if being inserted those other provisions should be discovered to have failed alsoi believe it to be impossible especially if evidence can be found that the admiral himself considered the trust binding on him for the executors to deal with your husbands fortune as legally forming part of admiral bartrams estate the legacy is expressly declared to have been left to him on the understanding that he applies it to certain stated objectsand those objects have failed what is to be done with the money it was not left to the admiral himself on the testators own showing and the purposes for which it was left have not been and cannot be carried out i believe if the case here supposed really happens that the money must revert to the testators estate in that event the law dealing with it as a matter of necessity divides it into two equal portions one half goes to mr noel vans tones childless widow and the other half is divided among mr noel vanstones next of kin  you will no doubt discover the obvious objection to the case in our favor as i have here put it you will see that it depends for its practical realization not on one contingency but on a series of contingencies which must all happen exactly as we wish them to happen i admit the force of the objection but i can tell you at the same time that these said contingencies are by no means so improbable as they may look on the face of them  we have every reason to believe that the trust like the will was not drawn by a lawyer that is one circumstance in our favor that is enough of itself to cast a doubt on the soundness of all or any of the remaining provisions which we may not be acquainted with another chance which we may count on is to be found as i think in that strange handwriting placed under the signature on the third page of the letter which you saw but which you unhappily omitted to read all the probabilities point to those lines as written by admiral bartram and the position which they occupy is certainly consistent with the theory that they touch the important subject of his own sense of obligation under the trust  i wish to raise no false hopes in your mind i only desire to satisfy you that we have a case worth trying  as for the dark side of the prospect i need not enlarge on it after what i have already written you will understand that the existence of a sound provision unknown to us in the trust which has been properly carried out by the admiralor which can be properly carried out by his representativeswould be necessarily fatal to our hopes the legacy would be in this case devoted to the purpose or purposes contemplated by your husbandand from that moment you would have no claim  i have only to add that as soon as i hear from the late admirals man of business you shall know the result  believe me dear madam faithfully yours  john loscombe   vii  from george bartram to miss garth  st crux may 15th  dear miss garthi trouble you with another letter partly to thank you for your kind expression of sympathy with me under the loss that i have sustained and partly to tell you of an extraordinary application made to my uncles executors in which you and miss vanstone may both feel interested as mrs noel vanstone is directly concerned in it  knowing my own ignorance of legal technicalities i inclose a copy of the application instead of trying to describe it you will notice as suspicious that no explanation is given of the manner in which the alleged discovery of one of my uncles secrets was made by persons who are total strangers to him  on being made acquainted with the circumstances the executors at once applied to me i could give them no positive informationfor my uncle never consulted me on matters of business but i felt in honor bound to tell them that during the last six months of his life the admiral had occasionally let fall expressions of impatience in my hearing which led to the conclusion that he was annoyed by a private responsibility of some kind i also mentioned that he had imposed a very strange condition on mea condition which in spite of his own assurances to the contrary i was persuaded could not have emanated from himselfof marrying within a given time which time has now expired or of not receiving from him a certain sum of money which i believed to be the same in amount as the sum bequeathed to him in my cousins will the executors agreed with me that these circumstances gave a color of probability to an otherwise incredible story and they decided that a search should be instituted for the secret trust nothing in the slightest degree resembling this same trust having been discovered up to that time among the admirals papers  the search no trifle in such a house as this has now been in full progress for a week it is superintended by both the executors and by my uncles lawyer who is personally as well as professionally known to mr loscombe mrs noel vanstones solicitor and who has been included in the proceedings at the express request of mr loscombe himself up to this time nothing whatever has been found thousands and thousands of letters have been examined and not one of them bears the remotest resemblance to the letter we are looking for  another week will bring the search to an end it is only at my express request that it will be persevered with so long but as the admirals generosity has made me sole heir to everything he possessed i feel bound to do the fullest justice to the interests of others however hostile to myself those interests may be  with this view i have not hesitated to reveal to the lawyer a constitutional peculiarity of my poor uncles which was always kept a secret among us at his own requesti mean his tendency to somnambulism i mentioned that he had been discovered by the housekeeper and his old servant walking in his sleep about three weeks before his death and that the part of the house in which he had been seen and the basket of keys which he was carrying in his hand suggested the inference that he had come from one of the rooms in the east wing and that he might have opened some of the pieces of furniture in one of them i surprised the lawyer who seemed to be quite ignorant of the extraordinary actions constantly performed by somnambulists by informing him that my uncle could find his way about the house lock and unlock doors and remove objects of all kinds from one place to another as easily in his sleep as in his waking hours and i declared that while i felt the faintest doubt in my own mind whether he might not have been dreaming of the trust on the night in question and putting the dream in action in his sleep i should not feel satisfied unless the rooms in the east wing were searched again  it is only right to add that there is not the least foundation in fact for this idea of mine during the latter part of his fatal illness my poor uncle was quite incapable of speaking on any subject whatever from the time of my arrival at st crux in the middle of last month to the time of his death not a word dropped from him which referred in the remotest way to the secret trust  here then for the present the matter rests if you think it right to communicate the contents of this letter to miss vanstone pray tell her that it will not be my fault if her sisters assertion however preposterous it may seem to my uncles executors is not fairly put to the proof  believe me dear miss garth always truly yours  george bartram  p sas soon as all business matters are settled i am going abroad for some months to try the relief of change of scene the house will be shut up and left under the charge of mrs drake i have not forgotten your once telling me that you should like to see st crux if you ever found yourself in this neighborhood if you are at all likely to be in essex during the time when i am abroad i have provided against the chance of your being disappointed by leaving instructions with mrs drake to give you and any friends of yours the freest admission to the house and grounds   viii  from mr loscombe to mrs noel vanstone  lincolns inn fields may 24th  dear madamafter a whole fortnights searchconducted i am bound to admit with the most conscientious and unrelaxing careno such document as the secret trust has been found among the papers left at st crux by the late admiral bartram  under these circumstances the executors have decided on acting under the only recognizable authority which they have to guide themthe admirals own will this document executed some years since bequeaths the whole of his estate both real and personal that is to say all the lands he possesses and all the money he possesses at the time of his death to his nephew the will is plain and the result is inevitable your husbands fortune is lost to you from this moment mr georg e bartram legally inherits it as he legally inherits the house and estate of st crux  i make no comment upon this extraordinary close to the proceedings the trust may have been destroyed or the trust may be hidden in some place of concealment inaccessible to discovery either way it is in my opinion impossible to found any valid legal declaration on a knowledge of the document so fragmentary and so incomplete as the knowledge which you possess if other lawyers differ from me on this point by all means consult them i have devoted money enough and time enough to the unfortunate attempt to assert your interests and my connection with the matter must from this moment be considered at an end  your obedient servant  john loscombe   ix  from mrs ruddock lodginghouse keeper to mr loscombe  park terrace st johns wood june 2d  sirhaving by mrs noel vanstones directions taken letters for her to the post addressed to youand knowing no one else to apply toi beg to inquire whether you are acquainted with any of her friends for i think it right that they should be stirred up to take some steps about her  mrs vanstone first came to me in november last when she and her maid occupied my apartments on that occasion and again on this she has given me no cause to complain of her she has behaved like a lady and paid me my due i am writing as a mother of a family under a sense of responsibilityi am not writing with an interested motive  after proper warning given mrs vanstone who is now quite alone leaves me tomorrow she has not concealed from me that her circumstances are fallen very low and that she cannot afford to remain in my house this is all she has told mei know nothing of where she is going or what she means to do next but i have every reason to believe she desires to destroy all traces by which she might be found after leaving this placefor i discovered her in tears yesterday burning letters which were doubtless letters from her friends in looks and conduct she has altered most shockingly in the last week i believe there is some dreadful trouble on her mind and i am afraid from what i see of her that she is on the eve of a serious illness it is very sad to see such a young woman so utterly deserted and friendless as she is now  excuse my troubling you with this letter it is on my conscience to write it if you know any of her relations please warn them that time is not to be wasted if they lose tomorrow they may lose the last chance of finding her  your humble servant  catherine ruddock   x  from mr loscombe to mrs ruddock  lincolns inn fields june 2d  madammy only connection with mrs noel vanstone was a professional one and that connection is now at an end i am not acquainted with any of her friends and i cannot undertake to interfere personally either with her present or future proceedings  regretting my inability to afford you any assistance i remain your obedient servant  john loscombe      the last scene  aarons buildings    chapter i  on the seventh of june the owners of the merchantman deliverance received news that the ship had touched at plymouth to land passengers and had then continued her homeward voyage to the port of london five days later the vessel was in the river and was towed into the east india docks  having transacted the business on shore for which he was personally responsible captain kirke made the necessary arrangements by letter for visiting his brotherinlaws parsonage in suffolk on the seventeenth of the month as usual in such cases he received a list of commissions to execute for his sister on the day before he left london one of these commissions took him into the neighborhood of camden town he drove to his destination from the docks and then dismissing the vehicle set forth to walk back southward toward the new road  he was not well acquainted with the district and his attention wandered further and further away from the scene around him as he went on his thoughts roused by the prospect of seeing his sister again had led his memory back to the night when he had parted from her leaving the house on foot the spell so strangely laid on him in that past time had kept its hold through all afterevents the face that had haunted him on the lonely road had haunted him again on the lonely sea the woman who had followed him as in a dream to his sisters door had followed himthought of his thought and spirit of his spiritto the deck of his ship through storm and calm on the voyage out through storm and calm on the voyage home she had been with him in the ceaseless turmoil of the london streets she was with him now he knew what the first question on his lips would be when he had seen his sister and her boys i shall try to talk of something else he thought but when lizzie and i am alone it will come out in spite of me  the necessity of waiting to let a string of carts pass at a turning before he crossed awakened him to present things he looked about in a momentary confusion the street was strange to him he had lost his way  the first foot passenger of whom he inquired appeared to have no time to waste in giving information hurriedly directing him to cross to the other side of the road to turn down the first street he came to on his right hand and then to ask again the stranger unceremoniously hastened on without waiting to be thanked  kirke followed his directions and took the turning on his right the street was short and narrow and the houses on either side were of the poorer order he looked up as he passed the corner to see what the name of the place might be it was called aarons buildings  low down on the side of the buildings along which he was walking a little crowd of idlers was assembled round two cabs both drawn up before the door of the same house kirke advanced to the crowd to ask his way of any civil stranger among them who might not be in a hurry this time on approaching the cabs he found a woman disputing with the drivers and heard enough to inform him that two vehicles had been sent for by mistake where only one was wanted  the house door was open and when he turned that way next he looked easily into the passage over the heads of the people in front of him  the sight that met his eyes should have been shielded in pity from the observation of the street he saw a slatternly girl with a frightened face standing by an old chair placed in the middle of the passage and holding a woman on the chair too weak and helpless to support herselfa woman apparently in the last stage of illness who was about to be removed when the dispute outside was ended in one of the cabs her head was drooping when he first saw her and an old shawl which covered it had fallen forward so as to hide the upper part of her face  before he could look away again the girl in charge of her raised her head and restored the shawl to its place the action disclosed her face to view for an instant only before her head drooped once more on her bosom in that instant he saw the woman whose beauty was the haunting remembrance of his lifewhose image had been vivid in his mind not five minutes since  the shock of the double recognitionthe recognition at the same moment of the face and of the dreadful change in itstruck him speechless and helpless the steady presence of mind in all emergencies which had become a habit of his life failed him for the first time the povertystricken street the squalid mob round the door swam before his eyes he staggered back and caught at the iron railings of the house behind him  where are they taking her to he heard a woman ask close at his side  to the hospital if they will have her was the reply and to the workhouse if they wont  that horrible answer roused him he pushed his way through the crowd and entered the house  the misunderstanding on the pavement had been set right and one of the cabs had driven off  as he crossed the threshold of the door he confronted the people of the house at the moment when they were moving her the cabman who had remained was on one side of the chair and the woman who had been disputing with the two drivers was on the other they were just lifting her when kirkes tall figure darkened the door  what are you doing with that lady he asked  the cabman looked up with the insolence of his reply visible in his eyes before his lips could utter it but the woman quicker than he saw the suppressed agitation in kirkes face and dropped her hold of the chair in an instant  do you know her sir asked the woman eagerly are you one of her friends  yes said kirke without hesitation  its not my fault sir pleaded the woman shirking under the look he fixed on her i would have waited patiently till her friends found heri would indeed  kirke made no reply he turned and spoke to the cabman  go out he said and close the door after you ill send you down your money directly what room in the house did you take her from when you brought her here he resumed addressing himself to the woman again  the first floor back sir  show me the way to it  he stooped and lifted magdalen in his arms her head rested gently on the sailors breast her eyes looked up wonderingly into the sailors face she smiled and whispered to him vacantly her mind had wandered back to old days at home and her few broken words showed that she fancied herself a child again in her fathers arms poor papa she said softly why do you look so sorry poor papa  the woman led the way into the back room on the first floor it was very small it was miserably furnished but the little bed was clean and the few things in the room were neatly kept kirke laid her tenderly on the bed she caught one of his hands in her burning fingers dont distress mamma about me she said send for norah kirke tried gently to release his hand but she only clasped it the more eagerly he sat down by the bedside to wait until it pleased her to release him the woman stood looking at them and crying in a corner of the room kirke observed her attentively speak he said after an interval in low quiet tones speak in her presence and tell me the truth  with many words with many tears the woman spoke  she had let her first floor to the lady a fortnight since the lady had paid a weeks rent and had given the name of gray she had been out from morning till night for the first three days and had come home again on every occasion with a wretchedly weary disappointed look the woman of the house had suspected that she was in hiding from her friends under a false name and that she had been vainly trying to raise money or to get some employment on the three days when she was out for so long and when she looked so disappointed on coming home however that might be on the fourth day she had fallen ill with shivering fits and hot fits turn and turn about on the fifth day she was worse and on the sixth she was too sleepy at one time and too lightheaded at another to be spoken to the chemist who did the doctoring in those parts had come and looked at her and had said he thought it was a bad fever he had left a saline draught which the woman of the house had paid for out of her own pocket and had administered without effect she had ventured on searching the only box which the lady had brought with her and had found nothing in it but a few necessary articles of linenno dresses no ornaments not so much as the fragment of a letter which might help in discovering her friends between the risk of keeping her under these circumstances and the barbarity of turning a sick woman into the street the landlady herself had not hesitated she would willingly have kept her tenant on the chance of the ladys recovery and on the chance of her friends turning up but not half an hour since her husbandwho never came near the house except to take her moneyhad come to rob her of her little earnings as usual she had been obliged to tell him that no rent was in hand for the first floor and that none was likely to be in hand until the lady recovered or her friends found her on hearing this he had mercilessly insistedwell or illthat the lady should go there was the hospital to take her to and if the hospital shut its doors there was the workhouse to try next if she was not out of the place in an hours time he threatened to come back and take her out himself his wife knew but too well that he was brute enough to be as good as his word and no other choice had been left her but to do as she had done for the sake of the lady herself  the woman told her shocking story with every appearance of being honestly ashamed of it toward the end kirke felt the clasp of the burning fingers slackening round his hand he looked back at the bed again her weary eyes were closing and with her face still turned toward the sailor she was sinking into sleep  is there any one in the front room said kirke in a whisper come in there i have something to say to you  the woman followed him through the door of communication between the rooms  how much does she owe you he asked  the landlady mentioned the sum kirke put it down before her on the table  where is your husband was his next question  waiting at the publichouse sir till the hour is up  you can take him the money or not as you think right said kirke quietly i have only one thing to tell you as far as your husband is concerned if you want to see every bone in his skin broken let him come to the house while i am in it stop i have something more to say do you know of any doctor in the neighborhood who can be depended on  not in our neighborhood sir but i know of one within half an hours walk of us  take the cab at the door and if you find him at home bring him back in it say i am waiting here for his opinion on a very serious case he shall be well paid and you shall be well paid make haste  the woman left the room  kirke sat down alone to wait for her return he hid his face in his hands and tried to realize the strange and touching situation in which the accident of a moment had placed him  hidden in the squalid byways of london under a false name cast friendless and helpless on the mercy of strangers by illness which had struck her prostrate mind and body alikeso he met her again the woman who had opened a new world of beauty to his mind the woman who had called love to life in him by a look what horrible misfortune had struck her so cruelly and struck her so low what mysterious destiny had guided him to the last refuge of her poverty and despair in the hour of her sorest need if it is ordered that i am to see her again i shall see her those words came back to him nowthe memorable words that he had spoken to his sister at parting with that thought in his heart he had gone where his duty called him months and months had passed thousands and thousands of miles protracting their desolate length on the unresting waters had rolled between them and through the lapse of time and over the waste of oceansday after day and night after night as the winds of heaven blew and the good ship toiled on before themhe had advanced nearer and nearer to the end that was waiting for him he had journeyed blindfold to the meeting on the threshold of that miserable door what has brought me here he said to himself in a whisper the mercy of chance no the mercy of god  he waited unregardful of the place unconscious of the time until the sound of footsteps on the stairs came suddenly between him and his thoughts the door opened and the doctor was shown into the room  dr merrick said the landlady placing a chair for him  mr merrick said the visitor smiling quietly as he took the chair i am not a physiciani am a surgeon in general practice  physician or surgeon there was something in his face and manner which told kirke at a glance that he was a man to be relied on  after a few preliminary words on either side mr merrick sent the landlady into the bedroom to see if his patient was awake or asleep the woman returned and said she was betwixt the two light in the head again and burning hot the doctor went at once into the bedroom telling the landlady to follow him and to close the door behind her  a weary time passed before he came back into the front room when he reappeared his face spoke for him before any question could be asked  is it a serious illness said kirke his voice sinking low his eyes anxiously fixed on the doctors face  it is a dangerous illness said mr merrick with an emphasis on the word  he drew his chair nearer to kirke and looked at him attentively  may i ask you some questions which are not strictly medical he inquired  kirke bowed  can you tell me what her life has been before she came into this house and before she fell ill  i have no means of knowing i have just returned to england after a long absence  did you know of her coming here  i only discovered it by accident  has she no female relations no mother no sister no one to take care of her but yourself  no oneunless i can succeed in tracing her relations no one but myself  mr merrick was silent he looked at kirke more attentively than ever strange thought the doctor he is here in sole charge of herand is this all he knows  kirke saw the doubt in his face and addressed himself straight to that doubt before another word passed between them  i see my position here surprises you he said simply will you consider it the position of a relationthe position of her brother or her fatheruntil her friends can be found his voice faltered and he laid his hand earnestly on the doctors arm i have taken this trust on myself he said and as god shall judge me i will not be unworthy of it  the poor weary head lay on his breast again the poor fevered fingers clasped his hand once more as he spoke those words  i believe you said the doctor warmly i believe you are an honest manpardon me if i have seemed to intrude myself on your confidence i respect your reservefrom this moment it is sacred to me in justice to both of us let me say that the questions i have asked were not prompted by mere curiosity no common cause will account for the illness which has laid my patient on that bed she has suffered some longcontinued mental trial some wearing and terrible suspenseand she has broken down under it it might have helped me if i could have known what the nature of the trial was and how long or how short a time elapsed before she sank under it in that hope i spoke  when you told me she was dangerously ill said kirke did you mean danger to her reason or to her life  to both replied mr merrick her whole nervous system has given way all the ordinary functions of her brain are in a state of collapse i can give you no plainer explanation than that of the nature of the malady the fever which frightens the people of the house is merely the effect the cause is what i have told you she may lie on that bed for weeks to come passing alternately without a gleam of consciousness from a state of delirium to a state of repose you must not be alarmed if you find her sleep lasting far beyond the natural time that sleep is a better remedy than any i can give and nothing must disturb it all our art can accomplish is to watch her to help her with stimulants from time to time and to wait for what nature will do  must she remain here is there no hope of our being able to remove her to a better place  no hope whatever for the present she has already been disturbed as i understand and she is seriously the worse for it even if she gets better even if she comes to herself again it would still be a dangerous experiment to move her too soonthe least excitement or alarm would be fatal to her you must make the best of this place as it is the landlady has my directions and i will send a good nurse to help her there is nothing more to be done so far as her life can be said to be in any human hands it is as much in your hands now as in mine everything depends on the care that is taken of her under your direction in this house with those farewell words he rose and quitted the room  left by himself kirke walked to the door of communication and knocking at it softly told the landlady he wished to speak with her  he was far more composed far more like his own resolute self after his interview with the doctor than he had been before it a man living in the artificial social atmosphere which this man had never breathed would have felt painfully the worldly side of the situationits novelty and strangeness the serious present difficulty in which it placed him the numberless misinterpretations in the future to which it might lead kirke never gave the situation a thought he saw nothing but the duty it claimed from hima duty which the doctors farewell words had put plainly before his mind everything depended on the care taken of her under his direction in that house there was his responsibility and he unconsciously acted under it exactly as he would have acted in a case of emergency with women and children on board his own ship he questioned the landlady in short sharp sentences the only change in him was in the lowered tone of his voice and in the anxious looks which he cast from time to time at the room where she lay  do you understand what the doctor has told you  yes sir  the house must be kept quiet who lives in the house  only me and my daughter sir we live in the parlors times have gone badly with us since lady day both the rooms above this are to let  i will take them both and the two rooms down here as well do you know of any active trustworthy man who can run on errands for me  yes sir shall i go  no let your daughter go you must not leave the house until the nurse comes dont send the messenger up here men of that sort tread heavily ill go down and speak to him at the door  he went down when the messenger came and sent him first to purchase pen ink and paper the mans next errand dispatched him to make inquiries for a person who could provide for deadening the sound of passing wheels in the street by laying down tan before the house in the usual way this object accomplished the messenger received two letters to post the first was addressed to kirkes brotherinlaw it told him in few and plain words what had happened and left him to break the news to his wife as he thought best the second letter was directed to the landlord of the aldborough hotel magdalens assumed name at north shingles was the only name by which kirke knew her and the one chance of tracing her relatives that he could discern was the chance of discovering her reputed uncle and aunt by means of inquiries starting from aldborough  toward the close of the afternoon a decent middleaged woman came to the house with a letter from mr merrick she was well known to the doctor as a trustworthy and careful person who had nursed his own wife and she would be assisted from time to time by a lady who was a member of a religious sisterhood in the district and whose compassionate interest had been warmly aroused in the case toward eight oclock that evening the doctor himself would call and see that his patient wanted for nothing  the arrival of the nurse and the relief of knowing that she was to be trusted left kirke free to think of himself his luggage was ready packed for his contemplated journey to suffolk the next day it was merely necessary to transport it from the hotel to the house in aarons buildings  he stopped once only on his way to the hotel to look at a toyshop in one of the great thoroughfares the miniature ships in the window reminded him of his nephew my little namesake will be sadly disappointed at not seeing me tomorrow he thought i must make it up to the boy by sending him something from his uncle he went into the shop and bought one of the ships it was secured in a box and packed and directed in his presence he put a ca rd on the deck of the miniature vessel before the cover of the box was nailed on bearing this inscription a ship for the little sailor with the big sailors lovechildren like to be written to maam he said apologetically to the woman behind the counter send the box as soon as you cani am anxious the boy should get it tomorrow  toward the dusk of the evening he returned with his luggage to aarons buildings he took off his boots in the passage and carried his trunk upstairs himself stopping as he passed the first floor to make his inquiries mr merrick was present to answer them  she was awake and wandering said the doctor a few minutes since but we have succeeded in composing her and she is sleeping now  have no words escaped her sir which might help us to find her friends  mr merrick shook his head  weeks and weeks may pass yet he said and that poor girls story may still be a sealed secret to all of us we can only wait  so the day endedthe first of many days that were to come    chapter ii  the warm sunlight of july shining softly through a green blind an open window with fresh flowers set on the sill a strange bed in a strange room a giant figure of the female sex like a dream of mrs wragge towering aloft on one side of the bed and trying to clap its hands another woman quickly stopping the hands before they could make any noise a mild expostulating voice like a dream of mrs wragge again breaking the silence in these words she knows me maam she knows me if i mustnt be happy it will be the death of mesuch were the first sights such were the first sounds to which after six weeks of oblivion magdalen suddenly and strangely awoke  after a little the sights grew dim again and the sounds sank into silence sleep the merciful took her once more and hushed her back to repose  another dayand the sights were clearer the sounds were louder anotherand she heard a mans voice through the door asking for news from the sickroom the voice was strange to her it was always cautiously lowered to the same quiet tone it inquired after her in the morning when she wokeat noon when she took her refreshmentin the evening before she dropped asleep again who is so anxious about me that was the first thought her mind was strong enough to formwho is so anxious about me  more daysand she could speak to the nurse at her bedside she could answer the questions of an elderly man who knew far more about her than she knew about herself and who told her he was mr merrick the doctor she could sit up in bed supported by pillows wondering what had happened to her and where she was she could feel a growing curiosity about that quiet voice which still asked after her morning noon and night on the other side of the door  another days delayand mr merrick asked her if she was strong enough to see an old friend a meek voice behind him articulating high in the air said its only me the voice was followed by the prodigious bodily apparition of mrs wragge with her cap all awry and one of her shoes in the next room oh look at her look at her cried mrs wragge in an ecstasy dropping on her knees at magdalens bedside with a thump that shook the house bless her heart shes well enough to laugh at me already cheer boys cheer i beg your pardon doctor my conduct isnt ladylike i know its my head sir it isnt me i must give vent somehow or my head will burst no coherent sentence in answer to any sort of question put to her could be extracted that morning from mrs wragge she rose from one climax of verbal confusion to anotherand finished her visit under the bed groping inscrutably for the second shoe  the morrow cameand mr merrick promised that she should see another old friend on the next day in the evening when the inquiring voice asked after her as usual and when the door was opened a few inches to give the reply she answered faintly for herself i am better thank you there was a moment of silenceand then just as the door was shut again the voice sank to a whisper and said fervently thank god who was he she had asked them all and no one would tell her who was he  the next day came and she heard her door opened softly brisk footsteps tripped into the room a lithe little figure advanced to the bedside was it a dream again no there he was in his own evergreen reality with the copious flow of language pouring smoothly from his lips with the lambent dash of humor twinkling in his partycolored eyesthere he was more audacious more persuasive more respectable than ever in a suit of glossy black with a speckless white cravat and a rampant shirt frillthe unblushing the invincible unchangeable wragge  not a word my dear girl said the captain seating himself comfortably at the bedside in his old confidential way i am to do all the talking and i think you will own a more competent man for the purpose could not possibly have been found i am really delightedhonestly delighted if i may use such an apparently inappropriate wordto see you again and to see you getting well i have often thought of you i have often missed you i have often said to myselfnever mind what clear the stage and drop the curtain on the past dum vivimus vivamus pardon the pedantry of a latin quotation my dear and tell me how i look am i or am i not the picture of a prosperous man  magdalen attempted to answer him the captains deluge of words flowed over her again in a moment  dont exert yourself he said ill put all your questions for you what have i been about why do i look so remarkably well off and how in the world did i find my way to this house my dear girl i have been occupied since we last saw each other in slightly modifying my old professional habits i have shifted from moral agriculture to medical agriculture formerly i preyed on the public sympathy now i prey on the public stomach stomach and sympathy sympathy and stomachlook them both fairly in the face when you reach the wrong side of fifty and you will agree with me that they come to much the same thing however that may be here i amincredible as it may appeara man with an income at last the founders of my fortune are three in number their names are aloes scammony and gamboge in plainer words i am now livingon a pill i made a little money if you remember by my friendly connection with you i made a little more by the happy decease requiescat in pace of that female relative of mrs wragges from whom as i told you my wife had expectations very good what do you think i did i invested the whole of my capital at one fell swoop in advertisements and purchased my drugs and my pillboxes on credit the result is now before you here i am a grand financial fact here i am with my clothes positively paid for with a balance at my bankers with my servant in livery and my gig at the door solvent flourishing popularand all on a pill  magdalen smiled the captains face assumed an expression of mock gravity he looked as if there was a serious side to the question and as if he meant to put it next  its no laughing matter to the public my dear he said they cant get rid of me and my pill they must take us there is not a single form of appeal in the whole range of human advertisement which i am not making to the unfortunate public at this moment hire the last new novel there i am inside the boards of the book send for the last new songthe instant you open the leaves i drop out of it take a cabi fly in at the window in red buy a box of toothpowder at the chemistsi wrap it up for you in blue show

ledgers over the door are my name portrait and autograph expanded to colossal proportions and surrounded in flowing letters by the motto of the establishment down with the doctors even mrs wragge contributes her quota to this prodigious enterprise she is the celebrated woman whom i have cured of indescribable agonies from every complaint under the sun her portrait is engraved on all the wrappers with the following inscription beneath it before she took the pill you might have blown this patient away with a feather look at her now last not least my dear girl the pill is the cause of my finding my way to this house my department in the prodigious enterprise already mentioned is to scour the united kingdom in a gig establishing agencies everywhere while founding one of those agencies i heard of a certain friend of mine who had lately landed in england after a long seavoyage i got his address in londonhe was a lodger in this house i called on him forthwith and was stunned by the news of your illness such in brief is the history of my existing connection with british medicine and so it happens that you see me at the present moment sitting in the present chair now as ever yours truly horatio wragge in these terms the captain brought his personal statement to a close he looked more and more attentively at magdalen the nearer he got to the conclusion was there some latent importance attaching to his last words which did not appear on the face of them there was his visit to the sickroom had a serious object and that object he had now approached   in describing the circumstances under which he had become acquainted with magdalens present position captain wragge had skirted with his customary dexterity round the remote boundaries of truth emboldened by the absence of any public scandal in connection with noel vanstones marriage or with the event of his death as announced in the newspaper obituary the captain roaming the eastern circuit had ventured back to aldborough a fortnight since to establish an agency there for the sale of his wonderful pill no one had recognized him but the landlady of the hotel who at once insisted on his entering the house and reading kirkes letter to her husband the same night captain wragge was in london and was closeted with the sailor in the secondfloor room at aarons buildings  the serious nature of the situation the indisputable certainty that kirke must fail in tracing magdalens friends unless he first knew who she really was had decided the captain on disclosing part at least of the truth declining to enter into any particularsfor family reasons which magdalen might explain on her recovery if she pleasedhe astounded kirke by telling him that the friendless woman whom he had rescued and whom he had only known up to that moment as miss bygravewas no other than the youngest daughter of andrew vanstone the disclosure on kirkes side of his fathers connection with the young officer in canada had followed naturally on the revelation of magdalens real name captain wragge had expressed his surprise but had made no further remark at the time a fortnight later however when the patients recovery forced the serious difficulty on the doctor of meeting the questions which magdalen was sure to ask the captains ingenuity had come as usual to the rescue  you cant tell her the truth he said without awakening painful recollections of her stay at aldborough into which i am not at liberty to enter dont acknowledge just yet that mr kirke only knew her as miss bygrave of north shingles when he found her in this house tell her boldly that he knew who she was and that he felt what she must feel that he had a hereditary right to help and protect her as his fathers son i am as i have already told you continued the captain sticking fast to his old assertion a distant relative of the comberaven family and if there is nobody else at hand to help you through this difficulty my services are freely at your disposal  no one else was at hand and the emergency was a serious one strangers undertaking the responsibility might ignorantly jar on past recollections which it would perhaps be the death of her to revive too soon near relatives might by their premature appearance at the bedside produce the same deplorable result the alternative lay between irritating and alarming her by leaving her inquiries unanswered or trusting captain wragge in the doctors opinion the second risk was the least serious risk of the twoand the captain was now seated at magdalens bedside in discharge of the trust confided to him  would she ask the question which it had been the private object of all captain wragges preliminary talk lightly and pleasantly to provoke yes as soon as his silence gave her the opportunity she asked it who was that friend of his living in the house  you ought by rights to know him as well as i do said the captain he is the son of one of your fathers old military friends when your father was quartered with his regiment in canada your cheeks mustnt flush up if they do i shall go away  she was astonished but not agitated captain wragge had begun by interesting her in the remote past which she only knew by hearsay before he ventured on the delicate ground of her own experience  in a moment more she advanced to her next question what was his name  kirke proceeded the captain did you never hear of his father major kirke commanding officer of the regiment in canada did you never hear that the major helped your father through a great difficulty like the best of good fellows and good friends  yes she faintly fancied she had heard something about her father and an officer who had once been very good to him when he was a young man but she could not look back so long was mr kirke poor even captain wragges penetration was puzzled by that question he gave the true answer at hazard no he said not poor  her next inquiry showed what she had been thinking of if mr kirke was not poor why did he come to live in that house  she has caught me thought the captain there is only one way out of iti must administer another dose of truth mr kirke discovered you here by chance he proceeded aloud very ill and not nicely attended to somebody was wanted to take care of you while you were not able to take care of yourself why not mr kirke he was the son of your fathers old friendwhich is the next thing to being your old friend who had a better claim to send for the right doctor and get the right nurse when i was not here to cure you with my wonderful pill gently gently you mustnt take hold of my superfine black coatsleeve in that unceremonious manner  he put her hand back on the bed but she was not to be checked in that way she persisted in asking another questionhow came mr kirke to know her she had never seen him she had never heard of him in her life  very likely said captain wragge but your never having seen him is no reason why he should not have seen you  when did he see me  the captain corked up his doses of truth on the spot without a moments hesitation some time ago my dear i cant exactly say when  only once  captain wragge suddenly saw his way to the administration of another dose yes he said only once  she reflected a little the next question involved the simultaneous expression of two ideas and the next question cost her an effort  he only saw me once she said and he only saw me some time ago how came he to remember me when he found me here  aha said the captain now you have hit the right nail on the head at last you cant possibly be more surprised at his remembering you than i am a word of advice my dear when you are well enough to get up and see mr kirke try how that sharp question of yours sounds in his ears and insist on his answering it himself slipping out of the dilemma in that characteristically adroit manner captain wragge got briskly on his legs again and took up his hat  wait she pleaded i want to ask you  not another word said the captain i have given you quite enough to think of for one day my time is up and my gig is waiting for me i am off to scour the country as usual i am off to cultivate the field of public indigestion with the triple plowshare of aloes scammony and gamboge he stopped and turned round at the door bytheby a message from my unfortunate wife if you will allow her to come and see you again mrs wragge solemnly promises not to lose her shoe next time i dont believe her what do you say may she come  yes whenever she likes said magdalen if i ever get well again may poor mrs wragge come and stay with me  certainly my dear if you have no objection i will provide her beforehand with a few thousand impressions in red blue and yellow of her own portrait you might have blown this patient away with a feather before she took the pill look at her now she is sure to drop herself about perpetually wherever she goes and the most gratifying results in an advertising point of view must inevitably follow dont think me mercenaryi merely understand the age i live in he stopped on his way out for the second time and turned round once more at the door you have been a remarkably good girl he said and you deserve to be rewarded for it ill give you a last piece of information before i go have you heard anybody inquiring after you for the last day or two outside your door ah i see you have a word in your ear my dear thats mr kirke he tripped away from the bedside as briskly as ever magdalen heard him advertising himself to the nurse before he closed the door if you are ever asked about it he said in a confidential whisper the name is wragge and the pill is to be had in neat boxes price thirteen pence halfpenny government stamp included take a few copies of the portrait of a female patient whom you might have blown away with a feather before she took the pill and whom you are simply requested to contemplate now many thanks goodmorning   the door closed and magdalen was alone again she felt no sense of solitude captain wragge had left her with something new to think of hour after hour her mind dwelt wonderingly on mr kirke until the evening came and she heard his voice again through the halfopened door  i am very grateful she said to him before the nurse could answer his inquiriesvery very grateful for all your goodness to me  try to get well he replied kindly you will more than reward me if you try to get well  the next morning mr merrick found her impatient to leave her bed and be moved to the sofa in the front room the doctor said he supposed she wanted a change yes she replied i want to see mr kirke the doctor consented to move her on the next day but he positively forbade the additional excitement of seeing anybody until the day after she attempted a remonstrancemr merrick was impenetrable she tried when he was gone to win the nurse by persuasionthe nurse was impenetrable too  on the next day they wrapped her in shawls and carried her in to the sofa and made her a little bed on it on the table near at hand were some flowers and a number of an illustrated paper she immediately asked who had put them there the nurse failing to notice a warning look from the doctor said mr kirke had thought that she might like the flowers and that the pictures in the paper might amuse her after that reply her anxiety to see mr kirke became too ungovernable to be trifled with the doctor left the room at once to fetch him  she looked eagerly at the opening door her first glance at him as he came in raised a doubt in her mind whether she now saw that tall figure and that open sunburned face for the first time but she was too weak and too agitated to follow her recollections as far back as aldborough she resigned the attempt and only looked at him he stopped at the foot of the sofa and said a few cheering words she beckoned to him to come nearer and offered him her wasted hand he tenderly took it in his and sat down by her they were both silent his face told her of the sorrow and the sympathy which his silence would fain have concealed she still held his handconsciously nowas persistently as she had held it on the day when he found her her eyes closed after a vain effort to speak to him and the tears rolled slowly over her wan white cheeks  the doctor signed to kirke to wait and give her time she recovered a little and looked at him how kind you have been to me she murmured and how little i have deserved it  hush hush he said you dont know what a happiness it was to me to help you  the sound of his voice seemed to strengthen her and to give her courage she lay looking at him with an eager interest with a gratitude which artlessly ignored all the conventional restraints that interpose between a woman and a man where did you see me she said suddenly before you found me here  kirke hesitated mr merrick came to his assistance  i forbid you to say a word about the past to mr kirke interposed the doctor and i forbid mr kirke to say a word about it to you you are beginning a new life today and the only recollections i sanction are recollections five minutes old  she looked at the doctor and smiled i must ask him one question she said and turned back again to kirke is it true that you had only seen me once before you came to this house  quite true he made the reply with a sudden change of color which she instantly detected her brightening eyes looked at him more earnestly than ever as she put her next question  how came you to remember me after only seeing me once  his hand unconsciously closed on hers and pressed it for the first time he attempted to answer and hesitated at the first word i have a good memory he said at last and suddenly looked away from her with a confusion so strangely unlike his customary selfpossession of manner that the doctor and the nurse both noticed it  every nerve in her body felt that momentary pressure of his hand with the exquisite susceptibility which accompanies the first faltering advance on the way to health she looked at his changing color she listened to his hesitating words with every sensitive perception of her sex and age quickened to seize intuitively on the truth in the moment when he looked away from her she gently took her hand from him and turned her head aside on the pillow can it be she thought with a flutter of delicious fear at her heart with a glow of delicious confusion burning on her cheeks can it be  the doctor made another sign to kirke he understood it and rose immediately the momentary discomposure in his face and manner had both disappeared he was satisfied in his own mind that he had successfully kept his secret and in the relief of feeling that conviction he had become himself again  goodby till tomorrow he said as he left the room  goodby she answered softly without looking at him  mr merrick took the chair which kirke had resigned and laid his hand on her pulse just what i feared remarked the doctor too quick by half  she petulantly snatched away her wrist dont she said shrinking from him pray dont touch me  mr merrick goodhumoredly gave up his place to the nurse ill return in half an hour he whispered and carry her back to bed dont let her talk show her the pictures in the newspaper and keep her quiet in that way  when the doctor returned the nurse reported that the newspaper had not been wanted the patients conduct had been exemplary she had not been at all restless and she had never spoken a word   the days passed and the time grew longer and longer which the doctor allowed her to spend in the front room she was soon able to dispense with the bed on the sofashe could be dressed and could sit up supported by pillows in an armchair her hours of emancipation from the bedroom represented the great daily event of her life they were the hours she passed in kirkes society  she had a double interest in him nowher interest in the man whose protecting care had saved her reason and her life her interest in the man whose hearts deepest secret she had surprised little by little they grew as easy and familiar with each other as old friends little by little she presumed on all her privileges and wound her way unsuspected into the most intimate knowledge of his nature  her questions were endless everything that he could tell her of himself and his life she drew from him delicately and insensibly he the least selfconscious of mankind became an egotist in her dexterous hands she found out his pride in his ship and practiced on it without remorse she drew him into talking of the fine qualities of the vessel of the great things the vessel had done in emergencies as he had never in his life talked yet to any living creature on shore she found him out in private seafaring anxieties and unutterable seafaring exultations which he had kept a secret from his own mate she watched his kindling face with a delicious sense of triumph in adding fuel to the fire she trapped him into forgetting all considerations of time and place and striking as hearty a stroke on the rickety little lodginghouse table in the fervor of his talk as if his hand had descended on the solid bulwark of his ship his confusion at the discovery of his own forgetfulness secretly delighted her she could have cried with pleasure when he penitently wondered what he could possibly have been thinking of  at other times she drew him from dwelling on the pleasures of his life and led him into talking of its perilsthe perils of that jealous mistress the sea which had absorbed so much of his existence which had kept him so strangely innocent and ignorant of the world on shore twice he had been shipwrecked times innumerable he and all with him had been threatened with death and had escaped their doom by the narrowness of a hairbreadth he was always unwilling at the outset to speak of this dark and dreadful side of his life it was only by adroitly tempting him by laying little snares for him in his talk that she lured him into telling her of the terrors of the great deep she sat listening to him with a breathless interest looking at him with a breathless wonder as those fearful storiesmade doubly vivid by the simple language in which he told themfell one by one from his lips his noble unconsciousness of his own heroismthe artless modesty with which he described his own acts of dauntless endurance and devoted courage without an idea that they were anything more than plain acts of duty to which he was bound by the vocation that he followedraised him to a place in her estimation so hopelessly high above her that she became uneasy and impatient until she had pulled down the idol again which she herself had set up it was on these occasions that she most rigidly exacted from him all those little familiar attentions so precious to women in their intercourse with men this hand she thought with an exquisite delight in secretly following the idea while he was close to herthis hand that has rescued the drowning from death is shifting my pillows so tenderly that i hardly know when they are moved this hand that has seized men mad with mutiny and driven them back to their duty by main force is mixing my lemonade and peeling my fruit more delicately and more neatly than i could do it for myself oh if i could be a man how i should like to be such a man as this  she never allowed her thoughts while she was in his presence to lead her beyond that point it was only when the night had separated them that she ventured to let her mind dwell on the selfsacrificing devotion which had so mercifully rescued her kirke little knew how she thought of him in the secrecy of her own chamber during the quiet hours that elapsed before she sank to sleep no suspicion crossed his mind of the influence which he was exerting over herof the new spirit which he was breathing into that new life so sensitively open to impression in the first freshness of its recovered sense she has nobody else to amuse her poor thing he used to think sadly sitting alone in his small secondfloor room if a rough fellow like me can beguile the weary hours till her friends come here she is heartily welcome to all that i can tell her  he was out of spirits and restless now whenever he was by himself little by little he fell into a habit of taking long lonely walks at night when magdalen thought he was sleeping upstairs once he went away abruptly in the daytimeon business as he said something had passed between magdalen and himself the evening before which had led her into telling him her age twenty last birthday he thought take twenty from fortyone an easy sum in subtractionas easy a sum as my little nephew could wish for he walked to the docks and looked bitterly at the shipping i mustnt forget how a ship is made he said it wont be long before i am back at the old work again on leaving the docks he paid a visit to a brother sailora married man in the course of conversation he asked how much older his friend might be than his friends wife there was six years difference between them i suppose thats difference enough said kirke yes said his friend quite enough are you looking out for a wife at last try a seasoned woman of thirtyfivethats your mark kirke as near as i can calculate   the time passed smoothly and quicklythe present time in which she was recovering so happilythe present time which he was beginning to distrust already  early one morning mr merrick surprised kirke by a visit in his little room on the second floor  i came to the conclusion yesterday said the doctor entering abruptly on his business that our patient was strong enough to justify us at last in running all risks and communicating with her friends and i have accordingly followed the clew which that queer fellow captain wragge put into our hands you remember he advised us to apply to mr pendril the lawyer i saw mr pendril two days ago and was referred by himnot overwillingly as i thoughtto a lady named miss garth i heard enough from her to satisfy me that we have exercised a wise caution in acting as we have done it is a very very sad story and i am bound to say that i for one make great allowances for the poor girl downstairs her only relation in the world is her elder sister i have suggested that the sister shall write to her in the first instance and then if the letter does her no harm follow it personally in a d ay or two i have not given the address by way of preventing any visits from being paid here without my permission all i have done is to undertake to forward the letter and i shall probably find it at my house when i get back can you stop at home until i send my man with it there is not the least hope of my being able to bring it myself all you need do is to watch for an opportunity when she is not in the front room and to put the letter where she can see it when she comes in the handwriting on the address will break the news before she opens the letter say nothing to her about ittake care that the landlady is within calland leave her to herself i know i can trust you to follow my directions and that is why i ask you to do us this service you look out of spirits this morning natural enough youre used to plenty of fresh air captain and youre beginning to pine in this close place  may i ask a question doctor is she pining in this close place too when her sister comes will her sister take her away  decidedly if my advice is followed she will be well enough to be moved in a week or less goodday you are certainly out of spirits and your hand feels feverish pining for the blue water captainpining for the blue water with that expression of opinion the doctor cheerfully went out  in an hour the letter arrived kirke took it from the landlady reluctantly and almost roughly without looking at it having ascertained that magdalen was still engaged at her toilet and having explained to the landlady the necessity of remaining within call he went downstairs immediately and put the letter on the table in the front room magdalen heard the sound of the familiar step on the floor i shall soon be ready she called to him through the door  he made no reply he took his hat and went out after a momentary hesitation he turned his face eastward and called on the shipowners who employed him at their office in cornhill    chapter iii  magdalens first glance round the empty room showed her the letter on the table the address as the doctor had predicted broke the news the moment she looked at it  not a word escaped her she sat down by the table pale and silent with the letter in her lap twice she attempted to open it and twice she put it back again the bygone time was not alone in her mind as she looked at her sisters handwriting the fear of kirke was there with it my past life she thought what will he think of me when he knows my past life  she made another effort and broke the seal a second letter dropped out of the inclosure addressed to her in a handwriting with which she was not familiar she put the second letter aside and read the lines which norah had written   ventnor isle of wight august 24th  my dearest magdalenwhen you read this letter try to think we have only been parted since yesterday and dismiss from your mind as i have dismissed from mine the past and all that belongs to it  i am strictly forbidden to agitate you or to weary you by writing a long letter is it wrong to tell you that i am the happiest woman living i hope not for i cant keep the secret to myself  my darling prepare yourself for the greatest surprise i have ever caused you i am married it is only a week today since i parted with my old nameit is only a week since i have been the happy wife of george bartram of st crux  there were difficulties at first in the way of our marriage some of them i am afraid of my making happily for me my husband knew from the beginning that i really loved him he gave me a second chance of telling him so after i had lost the first and as you see i was wise enough to take it you ought to be especially interested my love in this marriage for you are the cause of it if i had not gone to aldborough to search for the lost trace of youif george had not been brought there at the same time by circumstances in which you were concerned my husband and i might never have met when we look back to our first impressions of each other we look back to you  i must keep my promise not to weary you i must bring this letter sorely against my will to an end patience patience i shall see you soon george and i are both coming to london to take you back with us to ventnor this is my husbands invitation mind as well as mine dont suppose i married him magdalen until i had taught him to think of you as i thinkto wish with my wishes and to hope with my hopes i could say so much more about this so much more about george if i might only give my thoughts and my pen their own way but i must leave miss garth at her own special request a blank space to fill up on the last page of this letter and i must only add one word more before i say goodbya word to warn you that i have another surprise in store which i am keeping in reserve until we meet dont attempt to guess what it is you might guess for ages and be no nearer than you are now to the discovery of the truth your affectionate sister  norah bartram  added by miss garth  my dear childif i had ever lost my old loving recollection of you i should feel it in my heart again now when i know that it has pleased god to restore you to us from the brink of the grave i add these lines to your sisters letter because i am not sure that you are quite so fit yet as she thinks you to accept her proposal she has not said a word of her husband or herself which is not true but mr bartram is a stranger to you and if you think you can recover more easily and more pleasantly to yourself under the wing of your old governess than under the protection of your new brotherinlaw come to me first and trust to my reconciling norah to the change of plans i have secured the refusal of a little cottage at shanklin near enough to your sister to allow of your seeing each other whenever you like and far enough away at the same time to secure you the privilege when you wish it of being alone send me one line before we meet to say yes or no and i will write to shanklin by the next post  always yours affectionately  harriet garth   the letter dropped from magdalens hand thoughts which had never risen in her mind yet rose in it now  norah whose courage under undeserved calamity had been the courage of resignationnorah who had patiently accepted her hard lot who from first to last had meditated no vengeance and stooped to no deceitnorah had reached the end which all her sisters ingenuity all her sisters resolution and all her sisters daring had failed to achieve openly and honorably with love on one side and love on the other norah had married the man who possessed the comberaven moneyand magdalens own scheme to recover it had opened the way to the event which had brought husband and wife together  as the light of that overwhelming discovery broke on her mind the old strife was renewed and good and evil struggled once more which should win herbut with added forces this time with the new spirit that had been breathed into her new life with the nobler sense that had grown with the growth of her gratitude to the man who had saved her fighting on the better side all the higher impulses of her nature which had never from first to last let her err with impunitywhich had tortured her before her marriage and after it with the remorse that no woman inherently heartless and inherently wicked can feelall the nobler elements in her character gathered their forces for the crowning struggle and strengthened her to meet with no unworthy shrinking the revelation that had opened on her view clearer and clearer in the light of its own immortal life the truth rose before her from the ashes of her dead passions from the grave of her buried hopes when she looked at the letter againwhen she read the words once more which told her that the recovery of the lost fortune was her sisters triumph not hers she had victoriously trampled down all little jealousies and all mean regrets she could say in he r hearts of hearts norah has deserved it  the day wore on she sat absorbed in her own thoughts and heedless of the second letter which she had not opened yet until kirkes return  he stopped on the landing outside and opening the door a little way only asked without entering the room if she wanted anything that he could send her she begged him to come in his face was worn and weary he looked older than she had seen him look yet did you put my letter on the table for me she asked  yes i put it there at the doctors request  i suppose the doctor told you it was from my sister she is coming to see me and miss garth is coming to see me they will thank you for all your goodness to me better than i can  i have no claim on their thanks he answered sternly what i have done was not done for them but for you he waited a little and looked at her his face would have betrayed him in that look his voice would have betrayed him in the next words he spoke if she had not guessed the truth already when your friends come here he resumed they will take you away i suppose to some better place than this  they can take me to no place she said gently which i shall think of as i think of the place where you found me they can take me to no dearer friend than the friend who saved my life  there was a moments silence between them  we have been very happy here he went on in lower and lower tones you wont forget me when we have said goodby  she turned pale as the words passed his lips and leaving her chair knelt down at the table so as to look up into his face and to force him to look into hers  why do you talk of it she asked we are not going to say goodby at least not yet  i thought he began  yes  i thought your friends were coming here  she eagerly interrupted him do you think i would go away with anybody she said even with the dearest relation i have in the world and leave you here not knowing and not caring whether i ever saw you again oh you dont think that of me she exclaimed with the passionate tears springing into her eyesim sure you dont think that of me  no he said i never have thought i never can think unjustly or unworthily of you  before he could add another word she left the table as suddenly as she had approached it and returned to her chair he had unconsciously replied in terms that reminded her of the hard necessity which still remained unfulfilledthe necessity of telling him the story of the past not an idea of concealing that story from his knowledge crossed her mind will he love me when he knows the truth as he loves me now that was her only thought as she tried to approach the subject in his presence without shrinking from it  let us put my own feelings out of the question she said there is a reason for my not going away unless i first have the assurance of seeing you again you have a claimthe strongest claim of any oneto know how i came here unknown to my friends and how it was that you found me fallen so low  i make no claim he said hastily i wish to know nothing which distresses you to tell me  you have always done your duty she rejoined with a faint smile let me take example from you if i can and try to do mine  i am old enough to be your father he said bitterly duty is more easily done at my age than it is at yours  his age was so constantly in his mind now that he fancied it must be in her mind too she had never given it a thought the reference he had just made to it did not divert her for a moment from the subject on which she was speaking to him  you dont know how i value your good opinion of me she said struggling resolutely to sustain her sinking courage how can i deserve your kindness how can i feel that i am worthy of your regard until i have opened my heart to you oh dont encourage me in my own miserable weakness help me to tell the truthforce me to tell it for my own sake if not for yours  he was deeply moved by the fervent sincerity of that appeal  you shall tell it he said you are rightand i was wrong he waited a little and considered would it be easier to you he asked with delicate consideration for her to write it than to tell it  she caught gratefully at the suggestion far easier she replied i can be sure of myselfi can be sure of hiding nothing from you if i write it dont write to me on your side she added suddenly seeing with a womans instinctive quickness of penetration the danger of totally renouncing her personal influence over him wait till we meet and tell me with your own lips what you think  where shall i tell it  here she said eagerly here where you found me helplesshere where you have brought me back to life and where i have first learned to know you i can bear the hardest words you say to me if you will only say them in this room it is impossible i can be away longer than a month a month will be enough and more than enough if i come back she stopped confusedly i am thinking of myself she said when i ought to be thinking of you you have your own occupations and your own friends will you decide for us will you say how it shall be  it shall be as you wish if you come back in a month you will find me here  will it cause you no sacrifice of your own comfort and your own plans  it will cause me nothing he replied but a journey back to the city he rose and took his hat i must go there at once he added or i shall not be in time  it is a promise between us she said and held out her hand  yes he answered a little sadly it is a promise  slight as it was the shade of melancholy in his manner pained her forgetting all other anxieties in the anxiety to cheer him she gently pressed the hand he gave her if that wont tell him the truth she thought nothing will  it failed to tell him the truth but it forced a question on his mind which he had not ventured to ask himself before is it her gratitude or her love that is speaking to me he wondered if i was only a younger man i might almost hope it was her love that terrible sum in subtraction which had first presented itself on the day when she told him her age began to trouble him again as he left the house he took twenty from fortyone at intervals all the way back to the shipowners office in cornhill   left by herself magdalen approached the table to write the line of answer which miss garth requested and gratefully to accept the proposal that had been made to her  the second letter which she had laid aside and forgotten was the first object that caught her eye on changing her place she opened it immediately and not recognizing the handwriting looked at the signature to her unutterable astonishment her correspondent proved to be no less a person thanold mr clare  the philosophers letter dispensed with all the ordinary forms of address and entered on the subject without prefatory phrases of any kind in these uncompromising terms   i have more news for you of that contemptible cur my son here it is in the fewest possible words  i always told you if you remember that frank was a sneak the very first trace recovered of him after his running away from his employers in china presents him in that character where do you think he turns up next he turns up hidden behind a couple of flour barrels on board an english vessel bound homeward from hongkong to london  the name of the ship was the deliverance and the commander was one captain kirke instead of acting like a sensible man and throwing frank overboard captain kirke was fool enough to listen to his story he made the most of his misfortunes you may be sure he was half starved he was an englishman lost in a strange country without a friend to help him his only chance of getting home was to sneak into the hold of an english vesseland he had sneaked in accordingly at hongkong two days since that was his story any other l out in franks situation would have been ropes ended by any other captain deserving no pity from anybody frank was as a matter of course coddle d and compassionated on the spot the captain took him by the hand the crew pitied him and the passengers patted him on the back he was fed clothed and presented with his passage home luck enough so far you will say nothing of the sort nothing like luck enough for my despicable son  the ship touched at the cape of good hope among his other acts of folly captain kirke took a woman passenger on board at that placenot a young woman by any meansthe elderly widow of a rich colonist is it necessary to say that she forthwith became deeply interested in frank and his misfortunes is it necessary to tell you what followed look back at my sons career and you will see that what followed was all of a piece with what went before he didnt deserve your poor fathers interest in himand he got it he didnt deserve your attachmentand he got it he didnt deserve the best place in one of the best offices in london he didnt deserve an equally good chance in one of the best mercantile houses in china he didnt deserve food clothing pity and a free passage homeand he got them all last not least he didnt even deserve to marry a woman old enough to be his grandmotherand he has done it not five minutes since i sent his weddingcards out to the dusthole and tossed the letter that came with them into the fire the last piece of information which that letter contains is that he and his wife are looking out for a house and estate to suit them mark my words frank will get one of the best estates in england a seat in the house of commons will follow as a matter of course and one of the legislators of this assridden country will bemy lout  if you are the sensible girl i have always taken you for you have long since learned to rate frank at his true value and the news i send you will only confirm your contempt for him i wish your poor father could but have lived to see this day often as i have missed my old gossip i dont know that i ever felt the loss of him so keenly as i felt it when franks weddingcards and franks letter came to this house your friend if you ever want one  francis clare sen   with one momentary disturbance of her composure produced by the appearance of kirkes name in mr clares singular narrative magdalen read the letter steadily through from beginning to end the time when it could have distressed her was gone by the scales had long since fallen from her eyes mr clare himself would have been satisfied if he had seen the quiet contempt on her face as she laid aside his letter the only serious thought it cost her was a thought in which kirke was concerned the careless manner in which he had referred in her presence to the passengers on board his ship without mentioning any of them by their names showed her that frank must have kept silence on the subject of the engagement once existing between them the confession of that vanished delusion was left for her to make as part of the story of the past which she had pledged herself unreservedly to reveal  she wrote to miss garth and sent the letter to the post immediately  the next morning brought a line of rejoinder miss garth had written to secure the cottage at shanklin and mr merrick had consented to magdalens removal on the following day norah would be the first to arrive at the house and miss garth would follow with a comfortable carriage to take the invalid to the railway every needful arrangement had been made for her the effort of moving was the one effort she would have to make  magdalen read the letter thankfully but her thoughts wandered from it and followed kirke on his return to the city what was the business which had once already taken him there in the morning and why had the promise exchanged between them obliged him to go to the city again for the second time in one day  was it by any chance business relating to the sea were his employers tempting him to go back to his ship    chapter iv  the first agitation of the meeting between the sisters was over the first vivid impressions half pleasurable half painful had softened a little and norah and magdalen sat together hand in hand each rapt in the silent fullness of her own joy magdalen was the first to speak  you have something to tell me norah  i have a thousand things to tell you my love and you have ten thousand things to tell medo you mean that second surprise which i told you of in my letter  yes i suppose it must concern me very nearly or you would hardly have thought of mentioning it in your first letter  it does concern you very nearly you have heard of georges house in essex you must be familiar at least with the name of st cruxwhat is there to start at my dear i am afraid you are hardly strong enough for any more surprises just yet  quite strong enough norah i have something to say to you about st cruxi have a surprise on my side for you  will you tell it me now  not now you shall know it when we are at the seaside you shall know it before i accept the kindness which has invited me to your husbands house  what can it be why not tell me at once  you used often to set me the example of patience norah in old times will you set me the example now  with all my heart shall i return to my own story as well yes then we will go back to it at once i was telling you that st crux is georges house in essex the house he inherited from his uncle knowing that miss garth had a curiosity to see the place he left word when he went abroad after the admirals death that she and any friends who came with her were to be admitted if she happened to find herself in the neighborhood during his absence miss garth and i and a large party of mr tyrrels friends found ourselves in the neighborhood not long after georges departure we had all been invited to see the launch of mr tyrrels new yacht from the builders yard at wivenhoe in essex when the launch was over the rest of the company returned to colchester to dine miss garth and i contrived to get into the same carriage together with nobody but my two little pupils for our companions we gave the coachman his orders and drove round by st crux the moment miss garth mentioned her name we were let in and shown all over the house i dont know how to describe it to you it is the most bewildering place i ever saw in my life  dont attempt to describe it norah go on with your story instead  very well my story takes me straight into one of the rooms at st cruxa room about as long as your street hereso dreary so dirty and so dreadfully cold that i shiver at the bare recollection of it miss garth was for getting out of it again as speedily as possible and so was i but the housekeeper declined to let us off without first looking at a singular piece of furniture the only piece of furniture in the comfortless place she called it a tripod i think there is nothing to be alarmed at magdalen i assure you there is nothing to be alarmed at at any rate it was a strange threelegged thing which supported a great panful of charcoal ashes at the top it was considered by all good judges the housekeeper told us a wonderful piece of chasing in metal and she especially pointed out the beauty of some scrollwork running round the inside of the pan with latin mottoes on it signifyingi forget what i felt not the slightest interest in the thing myself but i looked close at the scrollwork to satisfy the housekeeper to confess the truth she was rather tiresome with her mechanically learned lecture on fine metal work and while she was talking i found myself idly stirring the soft feathery white ashes backward and forward with my hand pretending to listen with my mind a hundred miles away from her i dont know how long or how short a time i had been playing with the ashes when my fingers suddenly encountered a piece of crumpled paper hidden deep among them when i brought it to the surface it proved to be a lettera long letter full of cramped close writingyou have anticipated my story magdalen before i can end it you know as well as i do that the letter which my idle fingers found was the secret trust hold out your hand my dear i have got georges permission to show it to you and there it is  she put the trust into her sisters hand magdalen took it from her mechanically you she said looking at her sister with the remembrance of all that she had vainly ventured of all that she had vainly suffered at st cruxyou have found it  yes said norah gayly the trust has proved no exception to the general perversity of all lost things look for them and they remain invisible leave them alone and they reveal themselves you and your lawyer magdalen were both justified in supposing that your interest in this discovery was an interest of no common kind i spare you all our consultations after i had produced the crumpled paper from the ashes it ended in georges lawyer being written to and in george himself being recalled from the continent miss garth and i both saw him immediately on his return he did what neither of us could dohe solved the mystery of the trust being hidden in the charcoal ashes admiral bartram you must know was all his life subject to fits of somnambulism he had been found walking in his sleep not long before his deathjust at the time too when he was sadly troubled in his mind on the subject of that very letter in your hand georges idea is that he must have fancied he was doing in his sleep what he would have died rather than do in his waking momentsdestroying the trust the fire had been lighted in the pan not long before and he no doubt saw it still burning in his dream this was georges explanation of the strange position of the letter when i discovered it the question of what was to be done with the letter itself came next and was no easy question for a woman to understand but i determined to master it and i did master it because it related to you  let me try to master it in my turn said magdalen i have a particular reason for wishing to know as much about this letter as you know yourself what has it done for others and what is it to do for me  my dear magdalen how strangely you look at it how strangely you talk of it worthless as it may appear that morsel of paper gives you a fortune  is my only claim to the fortune the claim which this letter gives me  yes the letter is your only claim shall i try if i can explain it in two words taken by itself the letter might in the lawyers opinion have been made a matter for dispute though i am sure george would have sanctioned no proceeding of that sort taken however with the postscript which admiral bartram attached to it you will see the lines if you look under the signature on the third page it becomes legally binding as well as morally binding on the admirals representatives i have exhausted my small stock of legal words and must go on in my own language instead of in the lawyers the end of the thing was simply this all the money went back to mr noel vanstones estate another legal word my vocabulary is richer than i thought for one plain reasonthat it had not been employed as mr noel vanstone directed if mrs girdlestone had lived or if george had married me a few months earlier results would have been just the other way as it is half the money has been already divided between mr noel vanstones next of kin which means translated into plain english my husband and his poor bedridden sisterwho took the money formally one day to satisfy the lawyer and who gave it back again generously the next to satisfy herself so much for one half of this legacy the other half my dear is all yours how strangely events happen magdalen it is only two years since you and i were left disinherited orphansand we are sharing our poor fathers fortune between us after all  wait a little norah our shares come to us in very different ways  do they mine comes to me by my husband yours comes to you she stopped confusedly and changed color forgive me my own love she said putting magdalens hand to her lips i have forgotten what i ought to have remembered i have thoughtlessly distressed you  no said magdalen you have encouraged me  encouraged you  you shall see  with those words she rose quietly from the sofa and walked to the open window before norah could follow her she had torn the trust to pieces and had cast the fragments into the street  she came back to the sofa and laid her head with a deep sigh of relief on norahs bosom i will owe nothing to my past life she said i have parted with it as i have parted with those torn morsels of paper all the thoughts and all the hopes belonging to it are put away from me forever  magdalen my husband will never allow you i will never allow you myself  hush hush what your husband thinks right norah you and i will think right too i will take from you what i would never have taken if that letter had given it to me the end i dreamed of has come nothing is changed but the position i once thought we might hold toward each other better as it is my lovefar far better as it is  so she made the last sacrifice of the old perversity and the old pride so she entered on the new and nobler life         a month had passed the autumn sunshine was bright even in the murky streets and the clocks in the neighborhood were just striking two as magdalen returned alone to the house in aarons buildings  is he waiting for me she asked anxiously when the landlady let her in  he was waiting in the front room magdalen stole up the stairs and knocked at the door he called to her carelessly and absently to come in plainly thinking that it was only the servant who applied for permission to enter the room  you hardly expected me so soon she said speaking on the threshold and pausing there to enjoy his surprise as he started to his feet and looked at her  the only traces of illness still visible in her face left a delicacy in its outline which added refinement to her beauty she was simply dressed in muslin her plain straw bonnet had no other ornament than the white ribbon with which it was sparingly trimmed she had never looked lovelier in her best days than she looked now as she advanced to the table at which he had been sitting with a little basket of flowers that she had brought with her from the country and offered him her hand  he looked anxious and careworn when she saw him closer she interrupted his first inquiries and congratulations to ask if he had remained in london since they had partedif he had not even gone away for a few days only to see his friends in suffolk no he had been in london ever since he never told her that the pretty parsonage house in suffolk wanted all those associations with herself in which the poor four walls at aarons buildings were so rich he only said he had been in london ever since  i wonder she asked looking him attentively in the face if you are as happy to see me again as i am to see you  perhaps i am even happier in my different way he answered with a smile  she took off her bonnet and scarf and seated herself once more in her own armchair i suppose this street is very ugly she said and i am sure nobody can deny that the house is very small and yetand yet it feels like coming home again sit there where you used to sit tell me about yourself i want to know all that you have done all that you have thought even while i have been away she tried to resume the endless succession of questions by means of which she was accustomed to lure him into speaking of himself but she put them far less spontaneously far less adroitly than usual her one allabsorbing anxiety in entering that room was not an anxiety to be trifled with after a quarter of an hour wasted in constrained inquiries on one side in reluctant replies on the other she ventured near the dangerous subject at last  have you received the letters i wrote to you from the seaside she asked suddenly looking away from him for the first time  yes he said all  have you read them  every one of themmany times over  her heart beat as if it would suffocate her she had kept her promise bravely the whole story of her life from the time of the homewreck at comberaven to the time when she had destroyed the secret trust in her sisters presence had been all laid before him nothing that she had done nothing even that she had thought had been concealed from his knowledge as he would have kept a pledged engagement with her so she had kept her pledged engagement with him she had not faltered in the resolution to do this and now she faltered over the one decisive question which she had come there to ask strong as the desire in her was to know if she had lost or won him the fear of knowing was at that moment stronger still she waited and trembled she waited and said no more  may i speak to you about your letters he asked may i tell you  if she had looked at him as he said those few words she would have seen what he thought of her in his face she would have seen innocent as he was in this worlds knowledge that he knew the priceless value the allennobling virtue of a woman who speaks the truth but she had no courage to look at himno courage to raise her eyes from her lap  not just yet she said faintly not quite so soon after we have met again  she rose hurriedly from her chair and walked to the window turned back again into the room and approached the table close to where he was sitting the writing materials scattered near him offered her a pretext for changing the subject and she seized on it directly were you writing a letter she asked when i came in  i was thinking about it he replied it was not a letter to be written without thinking first he rose as he answered her to gather the writing materials together and put them away  why should i interrupt you she said why not let me try whether i cant help you instead is it a secret  no not a secret  he hesitated as he answered her she instantly guessed the truth  is it about your ship  he little knew how she had been thinking in her absence from him of the business which he believed that he had concealed from her he little knew that she had learned already to be jealous of his ship do they want you to return to your old life she went on do they want you to go back to the sea must you say yes or no at once  at once  if i had not come in when i did would you have said yes  she unconsciously laid her hand on his arm forgetting all inferior considerations in her breathless anxiety to hear his next words the confession of his love was within a hairbreadth of escaping him but he checked the utterance of it even yet i dont care for myself he thought but how can i be certain of not distressing her  would you have said yes she repeated  i was doubting he answeredi was doubting between yes and no  her hand tightened on his arm a sudden trembling seized her in every limb she could bear it no longer all her heart went out to him in her next words  were you doubting for my sake  yes he said take my confession in return for yoursi was doubting for your sake  she said no more she only looked at him in that look the truth reached him at last the next instant she was folded in his arms and was shedding delicious tears of joy with her
