friends she repeated with a certain wistfulness  in her tone                                                     65   at halfpast four his servant brought in a small  tea equipage                                                    83   with an oldfashioned courtesy  he offered  her his arm                                                    105   there seemed to him something almost unearthly  about this woman with her soft grey gown  and marble face                                                111   matravers was suddenly conscious of an odd sense  of disturbance                                                 135   i can do it she assured him i believe you  doubt my ability but you need not                            143   do you know that man is driving me slowly  mad                                                          149   matravers found himself wondering at this new  and very natural note of domesticity in her                    169   she did not answer him but indeed there was  no need                                                        173   i am compelled to tell you and these gentlemen  that your statement is a lie                                 191   you mean this he cried thickly say it  againquick                                                 211   berenice was lying in a crumpled heap on the low  couch                                                          233   but there was no answerthere never could be  any answer                                                     259     berenice     chapter i   you may not care for the play ellison said eagerly you are of the old world and isteinism to you will simply spell chaos and vulgarity but the woman well you will see her i dont want to prejudice you by praises which you would certainly think extravagant i will say nothing  matravers smiled gravely as he took his seat in the box and looked out with some wonder at the illlit halfempty theatre  i am afraid he said that i am very much out of place here yet do not imagine that i bring with me any personal bias whatever i know nothing of the play and isteinism is merely a phrase to me tonight i have no individuality i am a critic  so much depends ellison remarked upon the point of view i am afraid that you are the last man in the world to have any sympathy with the decadent  i do not properly understand the use of the word decadent matravers said but you need not be alarmed as to my attitude whatever my own gods may be i am no slave to them isteinism has its devotees and whatever has had humanity and force enough in it to attract a following must at least demand a respectful attention from the press and tonight i am the press  i am sorry ellison remarked glancing out into the gloomy well of the theatre with an impatient frown that there is so bad a house tonight it is depressing to play seriously to a handful of people  it will not affect my judgment matravers said  it will affect her acting though ellison replied gloomily there are times when even to us who know her strength and are partial to her she appears to act with difficultyto be encumbered with all the diffidence of the amateur for a whole scene she will be little better than a stick the change when it comes is like a sudden fire from heaven something flashes into her face she becomes inspired she holds us breathless hanging upon every word it is then one realizes that she is a genius  let us hope matravers said that some such moment may visit her tonight one needs some compensation for a dinnerless evening and such surroundings as these  he turned from the contemplation of the dreary halfempty auditorium with a faint shudder the theatre was an ancient and unpopular one the hallmark of failure and poverty was set alike upon the tawdry and faded hangings the dusteaten decorations and the rows of bare seats it was a relief when the feeble overture came to an end and the curtain was rung up he settled himself down at once to a careful appreciation of the performance  matravers was not in any sense of the word a dramatic critic he was a man of letters amongst the elect he was reckoned a master in his art he occupied a singular in many respects a unique position but in matters dramatic he confessed to an ignorance which was strictly actual and in no way assumed his presence at the new theatre on that night which was to become for him a very memorable one was purely a matter of chance and good nature the greatest of london dailies had decided to grant a passing notice to the extraordinary series of plays which in flightier journals had provoked something between the blankest wonderment and the most boisterous ridicule their critic was illmatravers who had at first laughed at the idea had consented after much pressure to take his place he felt himself from the first confronted with a difficult task yet he entered upon it with a certain grave seriousness characteristic of the man anxious to arrive at and to comprehend the true meaning of what in its first crude presentation to his senses seemed wholly devoid of anything pertaining to art  the first act was almost over before the heroine of the play and the actress concerning whose merits there was already some difference of opinion appeared a little burst of applause halfhearted from the house generally enthusiastic from a few greeted her entrance ellison watching his companions face closely was gratified to find a distinct change there in matravers altered expression was something more than the transitory sensation of pleasure called up by the unexpected appearance of a very beautiful woman the whole impassiveness of that calm almost marblestill face with its set cold lips and slightly wearied eyes had suddenly disappeared and what ellison had hoped for had arrived matravers was without doubt interested  illustration what i have seen matravers said gravely i do not like  yet the woman whose appearance had caused a certain thrill to quiver through the house and whose coming had certainly been an event to matravers did absolutely nothing for the remainder of that dreary first act to redeem the forlorn play or to justify her own peculiar reputation she acted languidly her enunciation was imperfect her gestures were forced and inapt when the curtain went down upon the first act matravers was looking grave ellison was obviously uneasy  berenice he muttered is not herself tonight she will improve you must suspend your judgment  matravers fingered his programme nervously  you are interested in this production ellison he said and i should be sorry to write anything likely to do it harm i think it would be better if i went away now i cannot be blamed if i decline to give an opinion on anything which i have only partially seen  ellison shook his head  no ill chance it he said dont go you havent seen berenice at her best yet you have not seen her at all in fact  what i have seen matravers said gravely i do not like  at least ellison protested she is beautiful  according to what canons of beauty i wonder matravers remarked i hold myself a very poor judge of womans looks but i can at least recognize the classical and renaissance standards the beauty which this woman possesses if any is of the decadent order i do not recognize it i cannot appreciate it  ellison laughed softly he had a marvellous belief in this woman and in her power of attracting  you are not a womans man matravers or you would know that her beauty is not a matter of curves and colouring you cannot judge her as a piece of statuary all your remarks you would retract if you talked with her for five minutes i am not sure he continued that i dare not warrant you to retract them before this evening is over at least i ask you to stay i will run my risk of your pulverization  the curtain rang up again the play proceeded but not the same playat least so it seemed to matraversnot the same play surely not the same woman a situation improbable enough but dramatic had occurred at the very beginning of the second act she had risen to the opportunity triumphed over it electrified her audience delighted ellison moved matravers to silent wonder her personality seemed to have dilated with the flash of genius which matravers himself had been amongst the first to recognize the strange pallor of her face seemed no longer the legacy of illhealth her eyes wonderfully soft and dark were lit now with all manner of strange fires she carried herself with supreme grace there was not the faintest suspicion of staginess in any one of her movements and more wonderful than anything to matravers himself a delighted worshipper of the beautiful in all human sounds was that marvellously sweet voice so low and yet so clear expressing with perfect art the highest and most hallowed emotions with the least amount of actual sound she seemed to pour out the vial of her wrath her outraged womanhood in tones raised little above a whisper and the man who fronted her seemed turned into the actual semblance of an ashamed and unclean thing matravers made no secret now of his interest he had drawn his chair to the front of the box and the footlights fell full upon his pale studious face turned with grave and absolute attention upon the little drama working itself out upon the stage ellison in the midst of his jubilation found time to notice what to him seemed a somewhat singular incident in crossing the stage her eyes had for a moment met matravers earnest gaze and ellison could almost have declared that a faint welcoming light flashed for a moment from the woman to the man yet he was sure that the two were strangers they had never mether very name had been unknown to him it must have been his fancy  the curtain fell upon the second and final act amidst as much applause as the sparsely filled theatre could offer but mingled with it almost as the last words of her final speech had left her lips came a curious hoarse cry from somewhere in the cheaper seats near the back of the house it was heard very distinctly in every part it rang out upon the deep quivering stillness which reigns for a second between the end of a play which has left the audience spellbound and the burst of applause which is its first reawakening instinct it was drowned in less than a moment yet many people turned their startled heads towards the rows of back seats matravers one of the first to hear it was one of the most interestedperhaps because his sensitive ears had recognized in it that peculiar inflection the true ring of earnestness for it was essentially a human cry a cry of sorrow a strange note charged in its very hoarseness and spontaneity with an unutterable pathos it was as though it had been actually drawn from the heart to the lips and long after the house had become deserted matravers stood there his hands resting upon the edge of the box and his dark face turned steadfastly to that faraway corner where it seemed to him that he could see a solitary human figure sitting with bowed head amongst the wilderness of empty seats  ellison touched him upon the elbow  you must come with me and be presented to berenice he said  matravers shook his head  please excuse me he said i would really rather not  ellison held out a crumpled halfsheet of notepaper  this has just been brought in to me he said  matravers read the single line hastily written and in pencil       bring your friend to meb  it will scarcely take us a moment ellison continued dont stop to put on your coat we are the last in the theatre now  matravers whose will was usually a very dominant one found himself calmly obeying his companion following ellison he was bustled down a long narrow passage across a bare wilderness of boards and odd pieces of scenery to the door of a room immediately behind the stage as ellison raised his fingers to knock it was opened from the inside and berenice came out wrapped from head to foot in a black satin coat and with a piece of white lace twisted around her hair she stopped when she saw the two men and held out her hand to ellison who immediately introduced matravers  again ellison fancied that in her greeting of him there were some traces of a former knowledge but nothing in her words or in his alluded to it  i am very much honoured matravers said simply i am a rare attendant at the theatre and your performance gave me great pleasure  i am very glad she answered do you know that you made me wretchedly nervous i was told just as i was going on that you had come to smash us all to atoms in that terrible day  i came as a critic he answered but i am a very incompetent one perhaps you will appreciate my ignorance more when i tell you that this is my first visit behind the scenes of a theatre  illustration but nothing in her words or in his alluded to it  she laughed softly and they looked around together at the dimly burning gaslights the creaking scenery being drawn back from the stage the woman with a brush and mop sweeping and at that dismal perspective of hollandshrouded auditorium beyond now quite deserted  at least she said your impressions cannot be mixed ones it is hideous here  he did not contradict her and they both ignored ellisons murmured compliment  it is very draughty he remarked and you seem cold we must not keep you here may wecan i he added glancing down the stone passage show you to your carriage  she laughed softly  you may come with me she said but our exit is like a rabbit burrow we must go in single file and almost on hands and knees  she led the way and they followed her into the street a small brougham was waiting at the door and her maid was standing by it the commissionaire stood away and matravers closed the carriage door upon them her white ungloved hand loadedoverloaded it seemed to himwith rings stole through the window and he held it for a moment in his he felt somehow that he was expected to say something she was looking at him very intently there was some powder on her cheeks which he noted with an instinctive thrill of aversion  shall i tell him home he asked  if you please she answered  madam her maid interposed  home please berenice said calmly goodby mr matravers  good night  the carriage rolled away at the corner of the street berenice pulled the checkstring the milan restaurant she told the man briefly  matravers and ellison lit their cigarettes and strolled away on foot at the corner of the street ellison had an inspiration  let us he said have some supper somewhere  matravers shook his head  i really have a great deal of work to do he said and i must write this notice for the day i think that i will go straight home  ellison thrust his arm through his companions and called a hansom  it will only take us half an hour he declared and we will go to one of the fashionable places you will be amused come it all enters you know into your revised scheme of lifethe attainment of a fuller and more catholic knowledge of your fellowcreatures we will see our fellowcreatures en fête  matravers suffered himself to be persuaded they drove to a restaurant close at hand and stood for a moment at the entrance looking for seats the room was crowded  i will go ellison said and find the director he knows me well and he will find me a table  illustration her companion who was intent upon the wine list noticed nothing  he elbowed his way up to the further end of the apartment matravers remained a somewhat conspicuous figure in the doorway looking from one to another of the little parties with a smile half amused half interested suddenly his face became gravehis heart gave an unaccustomed leap he stood quite still his eyes fixed upon the bent head and white shoulders of a woman only a few yards away from him almost at the same moment berenice looked up and their eyes met the colour left her cheeksshe was ghastly pale a sentence which she had just begun died away upon her lips her companion who was intent upon the wine list noticed nothing she made a movement as though to rise simultaneously matravers turned upon his heel and left the room  ellison came hurrying back in a few moments and looked in vain for his companion as he stood there watching the throng of people berenice called him to her  your friend she said has gone away he stood for a moment in the doorway like banquos ghost and then he disappeared  ellison looked vaguely bewildered  matravers is an odd sort he remarked i suppose it is one of the penalties of genius to be compelled to do eccentric things i must have my supper alone  or with us she said you know mr thorndyke dont you there is plenty of room here     chapter ii   matravers stood at an open window reading a note by the grey dawn light below him stretched the broad thoroughfare of piccadilly noiseless shadowy deserted he had thrown up the window overcome by a sudden sense of suffocation and a chill damp breeze came stealing in cooling his parched forehead and hot dry eyes for the last two or three hours he had been working with an unwonted and rare zest it had happened quite by chance for as a rule he was a man of regular even mechanical habits but tonight he scarcely knew himselfhe had all the sensations of a man who had passed through a new and altogether unexpected experience at midnight he had let himself into his room after that swift impulsive departure from the milan and had dropped by chance into the chair before his writingtable the sight of his last unfinished sentence abruptly abandoned in the centre of a neatly written page of manuscript had fascinated him and as he sat there idly with the loose sheet in his hands holding it so that the lamplight might fall upon its very legible characters an idea flashed into his brainan idea which had persistently eluded him for days with the sudden stimulus of a purely mental activity he had hastily thrown aside his outdoor garment and had written for several hours with a readiness and facility which seemed somehow for the last few days to have been denied to him  he had become his old self againthe events of the evening lay already far behind then had come a soft knocking at the door followed by the apologetic entrance of his servant bearing a note upon which his name was written in hasty characters with an immediate scrawled as though by an afterthought upon the lefthand corner he had torn it open wondering at the womans writing and glanced at its brief contents carelessly enoughbut since then he had done no work for the present he was not likely to do any more  the cold breeze acting like a tonic upon his dazed senses awoke in him also a peculiar restlessness a feeling of intolerable restraint at the close environment of his little room and its associations its atmosphere had suddenly become stifling he caught up his cloak and hat and walked out again into the silent street it seemed to him momentarily forgetful of the hour like a city of the dead into which he had wandered  as he turned from habit towards the park the great houses on his right frowned down upon him lightless and lifeless the broad pavement pressed a few hours ago and so soon to be pressed again by the steps of an innumerable multitude was deserted his own footfall seemed to awaken a strange and curiously persistent echo as though some one were indeed following him on the opposite side of the way under the shadow of the drooping lime trees once he stopped and listened the footsteps ceased too there was no one with a faint smile at the illusion to which he had for a moment yielded he continued his walk  before him the outline of the arch stood out with gloomy distinctness against a cold lowering background of vapourous sky like a man who was still half dreaming he crossed the road and entered the park making his way towards the trees there was a spot about halfway down where in the afternoons he usually sat near it he found two chairs one on top of the other he removed the upper one and sat down crossing his legs and lighting a cigarette which he took from his case then in a transitory return of his ordinary state of mind he laughed softly to himself people would say that he was going mad  through halfclosed eyes he looked out upon the broad drive with the aid of an imagination naturally powerful he was passing with marvellous facility into an unreal world of his own creation the scene remained the same but the environment changed as though by magic sunshine pierced the grey veil of clouds gay voices and laughter broke the chill silence the horn of a fourinhand sounded from the corner the path before him was thronged with men and women whose rustling skirts brushed often against his knees as they made their way with difficulty along the promenade a glittering show of carriages and coaches swept past the railings the air was full of the sound of the trampling of horses and the rolling of wheels with a mental restraint of which he was all the time halfconscious he kept back the final effort of his imagination for some time but it came at last  a victoria drawn by a single dark bay horse with servants in quiet liveries drew up at the paling and a woman leaning back amongst the cushions looked out at him across the sea of faces as she had indeed looked more than once she was surrounded by handsomer women in more elaborate toilettes and more splendid equipages her cheeks were pale and she was undoubtedly thin nevertheless to other people as well as to him she was a personality even then he seemed to feel the little stir which always passed like electricity into the air directly her carriage was stayed when she had come when he was perfectly sure of her and indeed under the spell of her near presence he drew that note again from his pocket and read it                               18 large street w                                             1230       i told you a lie and i feel that you will never forgive      me yet i want to explain it there is something i want you      to know will you come and see me i shall be at home until      one oclock tomorrow morning or if the afternoon suits      you better from 4 to 6                                berenice  a lie yes it was that to him an inveterate lover of truth the offence had seemed wholly unpardonable he had set himself to forget the woman and the incident as something altogether beneath his recollection the night with its host of strange halfawakened sensations was a memory to be lived down to be crushed altogether for him doubtless that lie had been a providence it put a stop to any further intercourse between themit stamped her at once with the hallmark of unworthiness yet he knew that he was disappointed disappointment was perhaps a mild word he had walked through the streets with ellison after that meeting with her at the theatre conscious of an unwonted buoyancy of spirits feeling that he had drawn into his life a new experience which promised to be a very pleasant one  there were things about the woman which had not pleased him but they were on the whole merely superficial incidents accidents he chose to think of her environment he had even permitted himself to look forward to their next meeting to a definite continuance of their acquaintance standing in the doorway of the brilliantly lighted milan he had looked in at the vivid little scene with a certain eager tolerancethere was much after all that was attractive in this side of life so much that was worth cultivating he blamed himself that he had stood aloof from it for so long  then their eyes had met he had seen her sudden start had felt his heart sink like lead she was a creature of common clay after all his eyes rested for a moment upon her companion a man well known to him though of a class for whom his contempt was great and with whom he had no kinship she was like this then it was a pity  his cigarette went out and a raindrop which had been hovering upon a leaf above him fell with a splash upon the sheet of heavy white paper he rose to his feet stiff and chilled and disillusioned his little ghostworld of fancies had faded away morning had come and eastwards a single shaft of cold sunlight had pierced the grey sky     chapter iii   at ten oclock he breakfasted after three hours sleep and a cold bath in the bright yet soft spring daylight the lines of his face had relaxed and the pallor of his cheeks was less unnatural he was still a man of remarkable appearance his features were strong and firmly chiselled his forehead was square and almost hard he wore no beard but a slight black moustache only halfconcealed a delicate and sensitive mouth his complexion and his soft grey eyes were alike possessed of a singular clearness as though they were indeed the indices of a temperate and wellcontained life his dress and every movement and detail of his person were characterized by an extreme deliberation his whole appearance bespoke a peculiar and almost feminine fastidiousness the few appointments of his simple meal were the most perfect of their kind a delicate vase of freshly cut flowers stood on the centre of the spotless tablecloththe hangings and colouring of the apartment were softly harmonious the walls were hung with fine engravings with here and there a brilliant little watercolour of the school of corot a few marble and bronze statuettes were scattered about on the mantelpiece and on brackets there was nothing particularly striking anywhere yet there was nothing on which the eye could not rest with pleasure  at halfpast ten he lit a cigarette and sat down at his desk he wrote quite steadily for an hour at the end of that time he pinned together the result of his work and wrote a hasty note                                113 piccadilly       dear mr haslup       i went last night to the new theatre and i send you my      views as to what i saw there but i beg that you will      remember my absolute ignorance on all matters pertaining to      the modern drama and use your own discretion entirely as to      the disposal of the enclosed i do not feel myself in any      sense of the word a competent critic and i trust that you      will not feel yourself under the least obligation to give to      my views the weight of your journal                                i remain                                 yours truly                                   john matravers  his finger was upon the bell when his servant entered bearing a note upon a salver matravers glanced at the handwriting already becoming familiar to him recognizing too the faint odour of violets which seemed to escape into the room as his fingers broke the seal       it is halfpast eleven and you have not come does that      mean that you will not listen to me that you mean to judge      me unheard you will not be so unkind i shall remain      indoors until one oclock and i shall expect you                                berenice  matravers laid the note down and covered it with a paperweight then he sealed his own letter and gave it with the manuscript to his servant the man withdrew and matravers continued his writing  he worked steadily until two oclock then a simple luncheon was brought in to him and upon the tray another note matravers took it with some hesitation and read it thoughtfully                                two oclock       you have made up your mind then not to come very well i      too am determined if you will not come to me i shall come      to you i shall remain in until four oclock you may expect      to see me any time after then                                berenice  matravers ate his luncheon and pondered finally deciding to abandon a struggle in which his was obviously the weaker position he lingered for a while over his coffee at three oclock he retired for a few moments into his dressingroom and then descending the stairs made his way out into the street  he had told himself only a few hours back that he would be wise to ignore this summons from a woman the ways of whose life must lie very far indeed from his yet he knew that his meeting with her had affected him as nothing of the sort had ever affected him beforea man unimpressionable where women were concerned and ever devoted to and cultivating a somewhat unnatural exclusiveness her first note he had been content to ignoreshe might have written it in a fit of piquebut the second had made him thoughtful her very persistence was characteristic perhaps after all she was in the righthe had arrived too hastily at an ignoble conclusion her attitude towards him was curiously unconventional it was an attitude such as none of the few women with whom he had ever been brought into contact would have dreamed of assuming but none the less it had for him a fascination which he could not measure or defineit had awakened a new sensation which as a philosopher he was anxious to probe the mysticism of his early morning wanderings seemed to him as he walked leisurely through the sunlit streets in a sense ridiculous after all it was a little thing that he was going to do he was going to make against his will an afternoon call to other men it would have seemed less than nothing albeit he knew he was about to draw into his life a new experience  he rang the bell at number 18 large street and gave his card to the trim little maidservant who opened the door in a minute or two she returned and invited him to follow her upstairs her mistress was in and would see him at once she led the way up the broad staircase into a room which could perhaps be most aptly described as a feminine den the walls above the low bookshelves which bordered the whole apartment were hung with a medley of watercolours and photographs watercolours which a single glance showed him were good and of the school then most in vogue the carpet was soft and thick divans and easy chairs filled with cushions were plentiful by the side of one of these which bore signs of recent occupation was a reading stand and upon it a shakespeare and a volume of his own critical essays  to him with all his senses quickened by an intense curiosity there seemed to hang about the atmosphere of the room that subtle odour of femininity which in the case of a man would probably have been represented by tobacco smoke a sèvres jar of neapolitan violets stood upon the table near the divan henceforth the perfume of violets seemed a thing apart from the perfume of all other flowers to the man who stood there waiting himself with a few of the light purple blossoms in the buttonhole of his frock coat     chapter iv   she came to him so noiselessly that for a moment or two he was unaware of her entrance there was neither the rustle of skirts nor the sound of any movement to apprise him of it yet he became suddenly conscious that he was not alone he turned around at once and saw her standing within a few feet of him she held out her hand frankly  so you have come she said i thought that you would but then you had very little choice had you she added with a little laugh  she passed him and deliberately seated herself amongst a pile of cushions on the divan nearest her reading stand for the moment he neglected her gestured invitation and remained standing looking at her  i was very glad to come he said simply  she shook her head  you were afraid of my threat you were afraid that i might come to you well it is probable almost certain that i should have come you have saved yourself from that at any rate  although the situation was a novel one to him he was not in the least embarrassed he was altogether too sincere to be possessed of any selfconsciousness he found himself at last actually in the presence of the woman who since first he had seen her months ago driving in the park had been constantly in his thoughts and he began to wonder with perfect clearness of judgment wherein lay her peculiar fascination that she was handsome of her type went for nothing the world was full of more beautiful women whom he saw day by day without the faintest thrill of interest besides her face was too pale and her form too thin for exceptional beauty there must be something elsesomething about her personality which refused to lend itself to any absolute analysis she was perfectly dressedhe realized that because he was never afterwards able to recall exactly what she wore her eyes were soft and dark and luminoussoft with a light the power of which he was not slow to recognize  but none of these things were of any important account in reckoning with the woman he became convinced in those few moments of deliberate observation that there was nothing in her personnel which could justify her reputation on the whole he was glad of it any other form of attraction was more welcome to him than a purely physical one  first of all she began leaning forward and looking at him over her interlaced fingers i want you to tell me this you will answer me faithfully i know what did you think of my writing to you of my persistence tell me exactly what you thought  i was surprised he answered how could i help it i was surprised too he added to find that i wanted very much to come  the women whom you know she said quietlyi suppose you do know somewould not have done such a thing some people say that i am mad one may as well try to live up to ones reputation i have taken a little of the license of madness  it was unusual perhaps he admitted but who is not weary of usual things i gathered from your note that you had something to explain i was anxious to hear what that explanation could be  she was silent for a moment her eyes fixed upon vacancy a faint smile at the corners of her lips  first she said let me tell you this i want to have you understand why i was anxious that you should not think worse of me than i deserved i am rather a spoilt woman i have grown used to having my own way i wanted to know you i have wanted to for some time we have passed one another day after day i knew quite well all the time who you were and it seemed so stupid do you know once or twice i have had an insane desire to come right up to your chair and break in upon your meditationshold out my hand and make you talk to me that would have been worse than this would it not but i firmly believe that i should have done it some day so you see i wrote my little note in selfdefence  i do not know that i should have been so completely surprised after all he said i too have felt something of what you have expressed i have been interested in your comings and your goings but then you knew that or you would never have written to me  one sacrifices so much she murmured on the altars of the modern goddess we live in such a tiny compassnothing ever happens it is only psychologically that ones emotions can be reached at all events are quite out of date i am speaking from a womans point of view  you should have lived he said smiling in the days of joan of arc  no doubt she answered i should have found that equally dull what i was endeavouring to do was first of all to plead some justification for wanting to know you for a woman there is nothing left but the study of personalities  mine he answered with a faint gleam in his eyes is very much at your service  i am going to take you at your word she warned him  you will be very much disappointed i am perfectly willing to be dissected but the result will be inadequate  she leaned back amongst the cushions and looked at him thoughtfully  listen she said i can tell you something of your history as you will see i want you to fill in the blanks  mine he murmured will be the greater task my life is a record of blank places the history is to come  this she said is the extent of my knowledge you were the second son of sir lionel matravers and you have been an orphan since you were very young you were meant to take holy orders but when the time came you declined at oxford you did very well indeed you established a brilliant reputation as a classical scholar and you became a fellow of st johns  it was whilst you were there that you wrote studies in character two years ago i do not know why you gave up your fellowship and came to london you took up the editorship of a reviewthe biweekly i thinkbut you resigned it on a matter of principle you have a somewhat curious reputation the scrutineer invariably alludes to you as the apostle of Æstheticism you are reported to have fixed views as to the conduct of life down even to its most trifling details that sounds unpleasant but it probably isnt altogether true dont interrupt please you have no intimate friends but you go sometimes into society you are apparently a mixture of poet philosopher and man of fashion i have heard you spoken of more than once as a disciple of epicurus you also in the course of your literary work review novelsunfortunately for meand six months ago you were the cause of my nearly crying my eyes out it was perhaps silly of me to attempt without any literary experience to write a modern story but my own life supplied the motive and at least i was faithful to what i felt and knew no one else has ever said such cruel things about my work  womanlike you see i repay my injuries by becoming interested in you if you had praised my book i daresay i should never have thought of you at all then there is one thing more every day you sit in the park close to where i stop andyou look at me it seems as though we had often spoken there shall i tell you what i have been vain enough to think sometimes  i have watched you from a distance often before you have seen me you always sit in the same attitude your eyebrows are a little contracted there is generally the ghost of a smile upon your lips you are like an outsider who has come to look upon a brilliant show i could fancy that you have clothed yourself in the personality of that young roman noble whose name you have made so famous and from another age were gazing tolerantly and even kindly upon the folly and the pageantry which have survived for two thousand years and then i have taken my little place in the procession and i have fancied that a subtle change has stolen into your face you have looked at me as gravely as ever but no longer as an impersonal spectator  it is as though i have seemed a live person to you and the others mummies once the change came so swiftly that i smiled at youi could not help itand you looked away  i remember it distinctly he interrupted i thought the smile was for some one behind me  she shook her head  it was for you now i have finished fill in the blanks please  he was content to answer her in the same strain the effect of her complete naturalness was already upon him  so far as my personal history is concerned he told her you are wonderfully correct there is nothing more to be said about it i gave up my fellowship at oxford because i have always been convinced of the increasing narrowness and limitations of purely academic culture and scholarship i was afraid of what i should become as an old man of what i was already growing into i wanted to have a closer grip upon human things to be in more sympathetic relations with the great world of my fellowmen can you understand me i wonder the influences of a university town are too purely scholarly to produce literary work of wide human interest london had always fascinated methough as yet i have met with many disappointments as to the biweekly it was my first idea to undertake no fixed literary work and it was only after great pressure that i took it for a time as you know my editorship was a failure  he paused for a moment or two and looked steadily at her he was anxious to watch the effect of what he was going to say  you have mentioned my review upon your novel in the biweekly i cannot say that i am sorry i wrote it i never attacked a book with so much pleasure but i am very sorry indeed that you should have written it with your gifts you could have given to the world something better than a mere psychological debauch  she laughed softly but genuinely  i adore sincerity she exclaimed and it is so many years since i was actually scolded a psychological debauch is delightful but i cannot help my views can i my experiences were made for me i became the creature of circumstances no one is morally responsible for their opinions  there are things he said which find their way into our thoughts and consciousness but of which it would be considered flagrantly bad taste to speak and there are things in the world which exist which have existed from time immemorial the evil legacy of countless generations of which it seems to me to be equally bad taste to write art has a limitless choice of subjects i would not have you sully your fine gifts by writing of anything save of the beautiful  this is rank hedonism she laughed it is a survival of your academic days  some day he answered we will talk more fully of this it is a little early for us to discuss a subject upon which we hold such opposite views  you are afraid that we might quarrel  he shook his head  no not that only as i am something of an idealist and you i suppose have placed yourself amongst the ranks of the realists we should scarcely meet upon a common basis but will you forgive me if i say soi am very sure that some day you will be a deserter  and why  illustration friends she repeated with a certain wistfulness in her tone  i do not know anything of your history he continued gently nor am i asking for your confidence only in your story there was a personal note which seemed to me to somehow explain the bitterness and directness with which you wroteof certain subjects i think that you yourself have had troubleor perhaps a dear friend has suffered and her grief has become yours there was a little poison in your pen i think never mind we shall be friends and i shall watch it pass away  friends she repeated with a certain wistfulness in her tone but have you forgottenwhat you came for  i do not think he said slowly that it is of much consequence  but it is she insisted you asked me distinctly where i wished to be driven to from the theatre and i told youhome all the time i knew that i was going to have supper with mr thorndyke at the milan morally i lied to you  why he asked  i cannot tell you she answered it was an impulse i thought nothing of accepting the mans invitation you know him i daresay he is a millionaire and it is his money which supports the theatre he has asked me several times and although personally i dislike him he has of course a certain claim upon my acquaintance i have made excuses once or twice last night was the first time i have ever been out anywhere with him i do not of course pretend to be in the least conventionali have always permitted myself the utmost liberty of action yeti had wanted so much to know youi was afraid of prejudicing you after all you see i have no explanation it was just an impulse i have hated myself for it but it is done  it was he said a trifle of no importance we will forget it  a gleam of gratitude shone in her dark eyes her head drooped a little he fancied that her voice was not quite so steady  it is good she said to hear you say that  he looked around the room and back into her face some dim foreknowledge of what was to come between them seemed to flash before his eyes it was like a sudden glimpse into that unseen world so close at hand in which hethat roman noblehad at any rate implicitly believed there was a faint smile upon his face as his eyes met hers  at least he said i shall be able to come and talk with you now at the railing instead of watching you from my chair for you were quite right in what you said just now i have watched for you every dayfor many days  you will be able to come she said gravely if you care to you mix so little with the men who love to talk scandal of a woman that you may never have heard themtalk of me but they do i know i hear all about itit used to amuse me you have the reputation of ultra exclusiveness if you and i are known to be friends you may have to risk losing it  his brows were slightly contracted and he had half closed his eyesa habit of his when anything was said which offended his taste  i wonder whether you would mind not talking like that he said  why not i would not have you hear these things from other people it is best to be truthful is it not to run no risk of any misunderstandings  there is no fear of anything of that sort he said calmly i do not pretend to be a magician or a diviner yet i think i know you for what you are and it is sufficient some day  he broke off in the middle of a sentence the door had opened a man stood upon the threshold the servant announced himmr thorndyke  matravers rose at once to his feet he had a habitthe outcome doubtless of his epicurean tenets of leaving at once and at any costs society not wholly agreeable to him he bowed coldly to the man who was already greeting berenice and who was carrying a great bunch of parma violets  mr thorndyke was evidently astonished at his presenceand not agreeably  have you come mr matravers he asked coldly to make your peace  i am not aware matravers answered calmly of any reason why i should do so  mr thorndyke raised his eyebrows and drew an afternoon paper from his pocket  this is your writing is it not he asked  matravers glanced at the paragraph  certainly  mr thorndyke threw the paper upon the table  well he said i have no doubt it is an excellent piece of literary worka satire i suppose you would call itand i must congratulate you upon its complete success i dont mind running the theatre at a financial loss but i have a distinct objection to being made a laughing stock of i suppose this paper appeared about two hours ago and already i cant move a yard without having to suffer the condolences of some sympathizing ass i shall close the theatre next week  that is naturally matravers said a matter of complete indifference to me in the cause of art i should say that you will do well unless you can select a play from a very different source what i wrote of the performance last night i wrote according to my convictions you he added turning to berenice will at least believe that i am sure  most certainly i do she assured him holding out her hand must you really go you will come and see me againvery soon  he bowed over her fingers and then their eyes met for a moment she was very pale but she looked at him bravely he realized suddenly that mr thorndykes threat was a serious blow to her  i am very sorry he said you will not bear me any ill will  none she answered you may be sure of that  she walked with him to the open door outside which the servant was waiting to show him downstairs  you will come and see me againvery soon she repeated  yes he answered simply if i may i shall come again i will come as soon as you care to have me     chapter v   matravers passed out into the street with a curious admixture of sensations in a mind usually so free from any confusion of sentiments or ideas the few words which he had been compelled to exchange with thorndyke had grated very much against his sense of what was seemly he was on the whole both repelled and fascinated by the incidents of this visit of his yet as he walked leisurely homewards through the bright crowded streets he recognized the existence of that strange personal charm in berenice of which so many people had written and spoken he himself had become subject to it in some slight degree not enough indeed to engross his mind yet enough to prevent any feeling of disappointment at the result of his visit  she was not an ordinary womanshe was not an ordinarily clever woman she did not belong to any type with which he was acquainted she must for ever occupy a place of her own in his thoughts and in his estimation it was a place very well defined he told himself and by no means within that inner circle of his brain and heart wherein lay the few things in life sweet and precious to him the vague excitement of the early morning seemed to him now as he moved calmly along the crowded fashionable thoroughfare a thing altogether unreal and unnatural he had been in an emotional frame of mind he told himself with a quiet smile when the sight of those few lines in a handwriting then unknown had so curiously stirred him now that he had seen and spoken to her her personality would recede to its proper proportions the old philosophic calm which hung around him in his studious life like a mantle would have no further disturbance  and then he suffered a rude shock as he passed the corner of a street the perfume of neapolitan violets came floating out from a florists shop upon the warm sunlit air every fibre of his being quivered with a sudden emotion the interior of that little room was before him and a womans eyes looked into his he clenched his hands and walked swiftly on with pale face and rigid lips like a man oppressed by some acute physical pain  there must be nothing of this for him it was part of a world which was not his worldof which he must never even be a temporary denizen the thing passed away with studious care he fixed his mind upon trifles there was a crease in his silk hat clearly visible as he glanced at his reflection in a plateglass window he turned into scotts and waited whilst it was ironed then he walked homewards and spent the remainder of the day carefully revising a bundle of proofs which he found on his table fresh from the printer  on the following morning he lunched at his club somehow although he was in no sense of the word an unpopular man it was a rare thing for any one to seek his company uninvited the scholarly exclusiveness of his oxford days had not been altogether brushed off in this contact with a larger and more spontaneous social life and he figured in a world which would gladly have known more of him as a man of courteous but severe reserve  today he occupied his usual round table set in an alcove before a tall window for a recluse he always found a singular pleasure in watching the faces of the people in that broad living stream little units in the wheeling cycle of humanity of which he too felt himself to be a part but today his eyes were idle and his sympathies obstructed although a pronounced epicure in both food and drink he passed a new and delicate entrée and not only ordered the wrong claret but drank it without a grimace the world of his sensations had been rudely disturbed for the moment his sense of proportions was at fault and before luncheon was over it received a further shock a handsomely appointed drag rattled past the club on its way into piccadilly the woman who occupied the front seat turned to look at the window as they passed with some evident curiosityand their eyes met matravers set down the glass which he had been in the act of raising to his lips untasted  berenice and her father confessor he heard some one remark lightly from the next table pity some one cant teach thorndyke how to drive hes a disgrace to the fourinhand  it was berenice the sight of her in such intimate association with a man utterly distasteful to him was one before which he winced and suffered he was aware of a new and altogether undesired experience to rid himself of it with all possible speed he finished his lunch abruptly and lighting a cigarette started back to his rooms  on the way he came face to face with ellison and the two men stood together upon the pavement for a moment or two  i am not quite sure ellison remarked with a little grimace whether i want to speak to you or not what on earth has kindled the destructive spirit in you to such an extent every one is talking of your attack upon the new theatre  i was sent matravers answered with a free hand to write an honest criticismand i did it isteins work may have some merit but it is unclean work it is not fit for the english stage  it is exceedingly unlikely ellison remarked that the english stage will know him any more no play could survive such an onslaught as yours i hear that thorndyke is going to close the theatre  if it was opened matravers said for the purpose of presenting such work as this latest production the sooner it is closed the better  ellison shrugged his shoulders  it is a large subject he said and i am not sure that we are of one mind we will not discuss it at any rate i am very sorry for berenice  i do not think matravers said in measured tones that you need be sorry for her with her gifts she will scarcely remain long without an engagement i trust that she may secure one which will not involve the prostitution of her talent ellison laughed shortly he had an immense admiration for matravers but just at present he was a little out of temper with him  you admit her talent then he remarked i am glad of that  i am not sure matravers said that talent is the proper word to use one might almost call it genius  ellison was considerably mollified  i am glad to hear you say so he declared at the same time i am afraid her position will be rather an awkward one she will lose some money by the closing of the theatre and i dont exactly see what london house is open for her just at present these actormanagers are all so clannish and they have their own women  i am sorry matravers said thoughtfully at the same time i cannot believe that she will remain very long undiscovered good afternoon i am forgetting that i have some writing to do  matravers walked slowly back to his rooms filled with a new and fascinating idea which ellisons words had suddenly suggested to him if it was true that his pen had done her this ill turn did he not owe her some reparation it would be a very pleasant way to pay his debt and a very simple one by the time he had reached his destination the idea had taken definite hold of him  illustration at halfpast four his servant brought in a small teaequipage  for several hours he worked at the revision of a certain manuscript polishing and remodelling with infinite care and pains not even content with the correct and tasteful arrangement of his sentences he read them over to himself aloud lest by any chance there should have crept into them some trick of alliteration or juxtaposition of words not entirely musical in his work he gained or seemed to gain a complete absorption the cloudy disquiet of the last few hours appeared to have passed awayto have been indeed only a fugitive and transitory thing  at halfpast four his servant brought in a small teaequipagea silver tray with an old blue worcester teapot and cup and a quaintly cut glass creamjug he made his tea and drank it with his pen still in his hand he had scarcely turned back to his work before the same servant reentered carrying a frock coat an immaculately brushed silk hat and a fresh bunch of neapolitan violets for a moment matravers hesitated then he laid down his pen changed his coat and once more passed out into the streets more brilliant than ever now with the afternoon sunshine he joined the throng of people leisurely making their way towards the park     chapter vi   for nearly half an hour he sat in his usual place under the trees watching with indifferent eyes the constant stream of carriages passing along the drive it seemed to him only a few hours since he had sat there before almost in the same spot a solitary figure in the cold grey twilight yet watching then even as he was watching now for that small victoria with its single occupant whose soft dark eyes had met his so often with a frank curiosity which she had never troubled to conceal something of that same perturbation of spirit which had driven him then out into the dawnlit streets was upon him once more only with a very real and tangible difference the grey halflights the ghostly shadows and the faint wind sounding in the treetops like the rising and falling of a midnight sea upon some lonely shore had given to his early morning dreams an indefiniteness which they could scarcely hope to possess now he himself was a living unit of this gay and brilliant world whose conversation and light laughter filled the sunlit air around him whose skirts were brushing against his knees and whose jargon fell upon his ears with a familiar and a kindly sound there was no possibility here for such a wave of passionhe could call it nothing elseas had swept through him when he had first read that brief message from the woman who had already become something of a disturbing element in his seemly life yet under a calm exterior he was conscious of a distinct tremor of excitement when her carriage drew up within a few feet of him and obeying her mute but smiling command he rose and offered his hand as she stepped out on to the path  this she remarked resting her daintily gloved fingers for a moment in his is the beginning of a new order of things do you realize that only the day before yesterday we passed one another here with a polite stare  i remember it he answered perfectly long may the new order last  but it is not going to last longwith me at any rate she said laughing dont you know that i am almost ruined mr thorndyke is going to close the theatre he says that we have been losing money every week i shall have to sell my horses and go and live in the suburbs  i hope he said fervently that you will not find it so bad as that  of course she remarked you know that yours is the hand which has given us our deathblow i have just read your notice it is a brilliant piece of satirical writing of course but need you have been quite so severe dont you regret your handiwork a little  i cannot he answered deliberately on the contrary i feel that i have done you a service if you do not agree with me today the time will certainly come when you will do so you have a gift which delighted me you are really an actress you are one of very few  that is a kind speech she answered but even if there is truth in it i am as yet quite unrecognized there is no other theatre open to me you and i look upon istein and his work from a different point of view but even if you are right the part of herdrine suited me i was beginning to get some excellent notices if we could have kept the thing going for only a few weeks longer i think that i might have established some sort of a reputation  he sighed  a reputation perhaps he admitted but not of the best order you do not wish to be known only as the portrayer of unnatural passions the interpreter of diseased desires it would be an ephemeral reputation it might lead you into many strange byways but it would never help you to rise art is above all things catholic and universal you may be a perfect herdrine but herdrine herself is but a night weeda thing of no account even you cannot make her natural she is the puppet of a mans fantasy she is never a woman  i suppose she said sorrowfully that your judgment is the true one yetbut we will talk of something else how strange to be walking here with you  berenice was always a muchobserved woman but today she seemed to attract more even than ordinary attention her personality her toilette which was superb and her companion were all alike interesting to the slowly moving throng of men and women amongst whom they were threading their way the attitude of her sex towards berenice was in a certain sense a paradox she was distinctly the most talented and the most original of all the petticoat apostles as the very man who was now walking by her side had scornfully described the little band of women writers who were accused of trying to launch upon society a new type of their own sex her last novel was flooding all the bookstalls and if not of the day was certainly the book of the hour she herself known before only as a brilliant journalist writing under a curious nom de plume had suddenly become one of the most marked figures in london life yet she had not gone so far as other writers who had dealt with the same subject marriage she had dared to write had become the whitewashing of the impure the sanctifying of the vicious but she had not added the almost natural corollarytherefore let there be no marriage on the contrary marriage in the ideal she had written of as the most wonderful and the most beautiful thing in lifeonly marriage in the ideal did not exist  she had never posed as a woman with a mission she formulated nowhere any scheme for the reorganization of those social conditions whose bases she had very eloquently and very trenchantly held to be rotten and impure she had written as a prophet of woe she had preached only destruction and from the first she had left her readers curious as to what sexual system could possibly replace the old the thing which happened was inevitable the amazing demand for her book was exactly in inverse proportion to its popularity amongst her sex the crusade against men was well admittedly they were a bad lot and needed to be told of it a little selfassertion on behalf of his superior was a thing to be encouraged and applauded but a crusade against marriage berenice must be a most abandoned as well as a most immoral woman no one who even hinted at the doctrine of love without marriage could be altogether respectable not that berenice had ever done that still she had written of marriagethe usual run of marriagesfrom a womans point of view as a very hateful thing what did she require then of her sex to live and die old maids whilst men became regenerated it was too absurd there were a good many curious things said and it was certainly true that since she had gone upon the stage her toilette and equipage were unrivalled berenice looked into the eyes of the women whom she met day by day and she read their verdict but if she suffered she said not a word to any of it  they passed out from the glancing shadows of the trees towards the piccadilly entrance here they paused for a moment and stood together looking down the drive the sunlight seemed to touch with quivering fire the brilliant phantasmagoria berenice was serious her dark eyes swept down the broad path and her underlip quivered  it is this she exclaimed with a slight forward movement of her parasol which makes me long for an earthquake can one do anything for women like that they are not the creations of a god they are the parasitical images of type only it is a very small type and a very large reproduction why do i say these things to you i wonder you are against me too but then you are not a woman  i am not against you in your detestation of type he answered the whole world of our sex as well as yours is full of wornout and effete reproductions of an unworthy model it is this intolerable sameness which suffocates all thought one meets it everywhere the deep melancholy of our days is its fruit but the children of this generation will never feel it the taste of life between their teeth will be neither like ashes nor green figs they are numbed  she flashed a look almost of anger upon him  yet you have ranged yourself upon their side when my story first appeared its fate hung for days in the balance women had not made up their minds how to take it it came into your hands for review well you did not spare it did you it was you who turned the scale your denunciation became the keynote of popular opinion concerning me the women for whose sake i had written it that they might at least strike one blow for freedom took it with a virtuous shudder from the hands of their daughters i was pronounced unwholesome and depraved even my personal character was torn into shreds how odd it all seems she added with a light mirthless laugh it was you who put into their hands the weapon with which to scourge me their trim selfsatisfied little sentences of condemnation are emasculated versions of your judgment it is you whom i have to thank for the closing of the theatre and the failure of herdrineyou who are responsible for the fact that these women look at me with insolence and the men as though i were a courtesan how strange it must seem to them to see us togetherthe wolf and the lamb well never mind take me somewhere and give me some tea you owe me that at least  they turned and left the park for a few minutes conversation was impossible but as soon as they had emerged from the crowd he answered her  if i have ever helped any one to believe ill of you he said slowly i am only too happy that they should have the opportunity of seeing us together you are rather severe on me i thought then as i think now that it isto put it mildlyimpolitic to enter upon a passionate denunciation of such an institution as marriage when any substitute for it must necessarily be another step upon the downward grade the decadence of selfrespect amongst young men any contrast between their lives and the lives of the women who are brought up to be their wives is too terribly painful a subject for us to discuss here forgive me if i think now as i have always thought that it is not a fitting subject for a novelistcertainly not for a woman i may be prejudiced yet it was my duty to write as i thought you must not forget that so far as your story went i had nothing but praise for it there were many chapters which only an artist could have written  she raised her eyebrows they had turned into bond street now and were close to their destination  you men of letters are so odd she exclaimed what is art but truth and if my book be not true how can it know anything of art but never mind we are talking shop and i am a little tired of taking life seriously here we are order me some tea please and a chocolate éclair  he followed her to a tiny round table and sat down by her side upon the cushioned seat as he gave his order and looked around the little room he smiled gravely to himself it was the first time in his lifeat any rate since his boyhoodthat he had taken a woman into a public room decidedly it was a new era for him     chapter vii   an incident which matravers had found once or twice uppermost in his mind during the last few days was recalled to him with sudden vividness as he took his seat in an illlit shabbily upholstered box in the second tier of the new theatre he seemed almost to hear again the echoes of that despairing cry which had rung out so plaintively across the desert of empty benches from somewhere amongst the shadows of the auditorium several times during the performance he had glanced up in the same direction once he had almost fancied he could see a solitary bent figure sitting rigid and motionless in the first row of the amphitheatre no man was possessed of a smaller share of curiosity in the ordinary sense of the word than matravers but the thought that this might be the same man come again to witness a play which had appealed to him before with such peculiar potency interested him curiously at the close of the second act he left his seat and after several times losing his way found himself in the little narrow space behind the amphitheatre leaning over the partition and looking downwards he had a good view of the man who sat there quite alone his head resting upon his hand his eyes fixed steadily upon a soiled and crumpled programme which was spread out carefully before him matravers wondered whether there was not in the clumsy figure and awkward pose something vaguely familiar to him  an attendant of the place standing by his side addressed him respectfully  not much of a house for the last night sir he remarked  matravers agreed and moved his head downwards towards the solitary figure  there is one man at least he said who finds the play interesting  the attendant smiled  i am afraid that the gentleman is a little bit hoff sir he seems half silly to talk to hes a queer sort anyway comes here every blessed night and in the same place never misses once he came sixpence short and there was a rare fuss they wouldnt let him in and he wouldnt go away i lent it him at last  did he pay you back matravers asked  the very next night never had to ask him either there goes the bell sir curtain up in two minutes  the subject of their conversation had not once turned his head or moved towards them matravers conscious that he was not likely to do so returned to his seat just as the curtain rose upon the last act the play grim pessimistic yet lifted every now and then to a higher level by strange flashes of genius on the part of the woman dragged wearily along to an end the echoes of her last speech died away she looked at him across the footlights her dark eyes soft with many regrets which consciously or not spoke to him also of reproach the curtain descended and her hands fell to her side it was the end and it was failure  matravers making his way more hurriedly than usual from the house hoped to gain another glimpse of the man who had remained the solitary tenant of the round of empty seats but he was too late the man and the audience had melted away in a thin little stream matravers stood on the kerbstone hesitating he had not meant to go behind tonight he had a feeling that she must be regarding him at that moment as the executioner of her ambitions besides she was going on to a reception she would only be in a hurry nevertheless he made his way round to the stage door he would at least have a glimpse of her but as he turned the corner she was already stepping into her carriage he paused and simultaneously with her disappearance he realized that he was not the only one who had found his way to the narrow street to see the last of berenice a man was standing upon the opposite pavement a little way from the carriage yet at such an angle that a faint yellow light shone upon what was visible of his pale face he had watched her come out and was gazing now fixedly at the window of her brougham matravers knew in a moment that this was the man whom he had seen sitting alone in the amphitheatre and almost without any definite idea as to his purpose he crossed the street towards him the man hearing his footstep looked up with a sudden start then without a seconds hesitation he turned and hurried off matravers still followed him the man heard his footsteps and turned round then with a little moan he started running his shoulders bent his head forward matravers halted at once the man plunged into the shadows and was lost amongst the stream of people pouring forth from the doors of the strand theatres  at her door an hour later berenice saw the outline of a figure now become very familiar to her and matravers who had been leaving a box of roses whose creamy pinkandwhite blossoms mingled together in a neighbouring flowershop had pleased his fancy heard his name called softly across the pavement he turned and saw berenice stepping from her carriage with an oldfashioned courtesy which always sat well upon him he offered her his arm  illustration with an oldfashioned courtesy  he offered her his arm  i thought that you were to be late he said looking down at her with a shade of anxiety in his clear grave face was not this lady trutons night  she nodded  yes dont talk to mejust yet i am upset come in and sit with me  he hesitated with a scrupulous delicacy which sometimes almost irritated her he had invariably refrained from paying her visits so late as this but tonight was different her fingers were clasping his armand she was in trouble he suffered himself to be led up the stairs into her little room  some coffee for two she told her woman you can go to bed then i shall not want you again  she threw herself into an empty chair and loosened the silk ribbons of her opera cloak  do you mind opening the window she asked it is stifling in here i can scarcely breathe  he threw it wide open and wheeled her chair up to it the glare from the west end lit up the dark sky the silence of the little room and the empty street below seemed deepened by that faint faraway roar from the pandemonium of pleasure a light from the opposite side of the wayor was it the rising moon behind the dark housesgleamed upon her white throat and in her soft dim eyes she lay quite still looking into vacancy her hand hung over the side of the chair nearest to him half unconsciously he took it up and stroked it soothingly the tears gushed from her eyes at his kindly touch her overwrought feelings gave way her fingers closed spasmodically upon his  he said nothing the time had passed when words were necessary between them they were near enough to one another now to understand the value of silence but those few moments seemed to him for ever like a landmark in his life a new relation was born between them in the passionate intensity of that deep quietness  he watched her bosom cease to heave and the dimness pass from her eyes then he took up the box which he had been carrying and emptied the pinkandwhite blossoms into her lap she stooped down and buried her face in them their faint delicate perfume seemed to fill the room  you are very good she said abruptly thank god that there is some one who is good to me  the coffee was in the room and berenice threw off her cloak and brought it to him a fit of restlessness seemed to have followed upon her moment of weakness she began walking with quick uneven steps up and down the room matravers forgot to drink his coffee he was watching her with a curious sense of emotional excitement the little chamber was full of half lights and shadows and there seemed to him something almost unearthly about this woman with her soft grey gown and marble face he was stirred by her presence in a new way the rustle of her silken skirts as she swept in and out of the dim light the delicate whiteness of her arms and throat the flashing of a single diamond in her dark coiled hairthese seemed trivial things enough yet they were yielding him a new and mysterious pleasure for the first time his sense of her beauty was fully aroused every now and then he caught faint glimpses of her face it was like the face of a new woman to him there was some tender and wonderful change there which he could not understand and yet which seemed to strike some responsive chord in his own emotions instinctively he felt that she was passing into a new phase of life surely he too was walking hand and hand with her through the shadows the touch of her interlaced fingers had burned his flesh  illustration there seemed to him something almost unearthly about this woman with her soft grey gown and marble face  presently she came and sat down beside him  forgive me she murmured it does me so much good to have you here i am very foolish  tell me about it  she frowned very slightly and looked away at a star  it is nothing it is beginning to seem less than nothing i have written a book for women for the sake of women because my heart ached for their sufferings and because i too have felt the fire i wonder whether it was really an evil book she added still looking away from him at that single star in the dark sky people say so the newspapers say so yet it was a true book i wrote it from my souli wrote it with my own blood i have not been a good woman but i have been a pure woman when i wrote it i was lonely i have always been lonely but i thought now i shall know what it is like to have friends many women will understand that i have suffered in doing this thing for their sakes for it was my own life which i lay bare my own life my own sufferings my own agony i thought they will come to me and they will thank me for it i shall have sympathy and i shall have friends and now my book is written and i am wiser i know now that woman does not want her freedom though they drag her down into hell the chains of her slavery have grown around her heart and have become precious to her tell me are those pure women who willingly give their souls and their bodies in marriage to men who have sinned and who will sin again they do it without disguise without shame for position or for freedom or for money yet there are other women whom they call courtesans and from whose touch they snatch away the hem of their skirts in horror oh it is terrible there can be no corruption worse than this in hell  yours has been the common disappointment of all reformers he said gravely gratitude is the rarest tribute the world ever offers to those who have laboured to cleanse it when you are a little older you will have learnt your lesson but it is always very hard to learn tell me about tonight  she raised her head a little a faint spot of colour stained her cheek  there was one woman who praised me who came to see me and sent me cards to go to her house tonight i went foolishly i had hoped a good deal from it i did not like lady truton herself but i hoped that i should meet other women there who would be different it was a new experience to me to be going amongst my own sex i was like a child going to her first party i was quite excited almost nervous i had a little dreamthere would be some women thereone would be enoughwith whom i might be friends and it would make life very different to me to have even one woman friend but they were all horrid they were vulgar and one woman she took me on one side and praised my book she agreed she said with every word in it she had found out that her husband had a mistresssome chorusgirland she was repaying him in his own coin she too had a loverand for every infidelity of his she was repaying him in this manner she dared to assume that ii should approve of her conduct she asked me to go and see her my god it was hideous  matravers laid his hand upon hers and leaned forward in his chair  lady trutons was the very worst house you could have gone to he said gently you must not be too discouraged all at once the women of her set thank god are not in the least typical englishwomen they are fast and sillya few i am afraid worse they make use of the free discussions in these days of the relations between our sexes to excuse grotesque extravagances in dress and habits which society ought never to pardon do not let their judgments or their misinterpretations trouble you you are as far above them berenice as that little star is from us  i do not pretend to be anything but a woman she said bending her head and to stand alone always is very hard  it is very hard for a man it must be very much harder for a woman but berenice you would not call yourself absolutely friendless  she raised her head for a moment her dark eyes were wonderfully soft  who is there that cares she murmured  he touched the tips of her fingers her soft warm hand yielded itself readily and slid into his  do i count for no one he whispered  there was a silence in the little room the yellow glare had faded from the sky and a night wind was blowing softly in a clock in the distance struck one together they sat and gazed out upon the darkness looking more than once into her pale face matravers realized again that wonderful change his own emotions were curiously disturbed he himself so remarkable through all his life for a changeless serenity of purpose and a fixed masterly control over his whole environment felt himself suddenly like a rudderless ship at the mercy of a great unknown sea a sense of drifting was upon him they were both drifting surely this little room with its dim light and shadows and its faint odour of roses had become a hotbed of tragedy he had imagined that death itself was something like thisa dissolution of all fixed purposes and with it all this remnant of life if it were but a remnant seemed suddenly to be flowing through his veins with all the rich surpassing sweetness of some exquisite symphony  you count for a great deal she said if you had not come to me i think that i must have died if i were to lose you  i think that i should die  she threw herself back in her chair with a gesture of complete abandonment her arms hung loosely down over its sides the moonlight which had been gradually gathering strength shone softly upon her pale face and on the soft lustrous pearls at her throat her dark wet eyes seemed touched with smouldering fire she looked at him he sprang to his feet and walked restlessly up and down the room his forehead was hot and dry and his hands were trembling  there is not any reason he said halting suddenly in front of her why we should lose one another i was coming tomorrow morning to make a proposition to you if you accept it we shall be forced to see a great deal of one another  yes  you perhaps did not know that i had any ambitions as a dramatic author yet my first serious work after i left oxford was a play i took it up yesterday  you have really written a play she murmured and you never told me  at least i am telling you now he reminded her i am telling you before any one because i want your help  you want what  i want you to help me by taking the part of my heroine i read it yesterday by appointment to fergusson he accepted it at once on the most liberal terms i told him there was one conditionthat the part of my heroine must be offered to you if you would accept it there was a little difficulty as of course miss robinson is a fixture at the pall mall however fergusson saw you last night from the back of the dress circle and this morning he has agreed it only remains for you to read or allow me to read to you the play  do you mean to say that you are offering me the principal part in a play of yoursat the pall mallwith fergusson  well i think that is about what it comes to he assented  she rose to her feet and took his hands in hers  you are too goodmuch too good to me she said softly i dare not take it i am not strong enough  it will be you or no one he said decidedly but first i am going to read you the play if i may i shall bring it to you tomorrow  i want to ask you something she said abruptly you must answer me faithfully you are doing this you are making me this offer because you think that you owe me something it is a sort of reparation for your attack upon herdrine i want to know if it is that  i can assure you he said earnestly that i am not nearly so conscientious i wrote the play solely as a literary work i had no thought of having it produced of offering it to anybody then i saw you at the new theatre i think that you inspired me with a sort of dramatic excitement i went home and read my play bathilde seemed to me then to speak with your tongue to look at me with your eyes to be clothed from her soul outwards with your personality in the morning i wrote to fergusson  i want to believe you she said softly but it seems so strange i am no actress like adelaide robinson i am afraid that if i accept your offer i may hurt the play she is popular and i am unknown  she has talent he said and experience you have genius which is far above either i am not leaving you any choice at all tomorrow i shall bring the play  you may at least do that she answered it will be a pleasure to hear it read come to luncheon and we will have a long afternoon  matravers took his leave with a sense of relief their farewell had been cordial enough but unemotional yet even he ignorant of women and their ways as he was was conscious that they had entered together upon a new phase of their knowledge of each other the touch of their fingers the few conventional words which passed between them as she leaned over the staircase watching him descend seemed to him to savour somehow of mockery he passed out from her presence into the cool soft night dazed not a little bewildered at this new strong sense of living which had set his pulses beating to music and sent his blood rushing through his body with a new sweetness yet with it all he was distressed and unhappy he was confronted with the one great influence of life against which he had deliberately set his face     chapter viii   matravers began to find himself for the first time in his life seriously attracted by a woman he realized it in some measure as he walked homeward in the early morning after this last interview with berenice he knew it for an absolute fact on the following evening as he walked through the crowded streets back to his rooms with the manuscript of the play which he had been reading to her in his pocket he felt himself moving in what was to some extent an unreal atmosphere his senses were tingling with the excitement of the last few hoursfor the first time he knew the full fascination of a womans intellectual sympathy he had gone to his task wholly devoid of any pleasurable anticipation it spoke much for the womans tact that before he had read half a dozen pages he was not only completely at his ease but was experiencing a new and very pleasurable sensation the memory of it was with him nowhe had no mind to disturb it by any vague alarm as to the future of their relationship  in piccadilly he met fergusson who turned and walked with him  i have been to your rooms matravers the actor said i want to know whether you have arranged with your friend  i have just left her matravers replied she appears to like the play and has consented to play bathilde  the actor smiled was matravers really so simple or did he imagine that an actress whose name was as yet unknown would hesitate to play with him at the pall mall theatre yet he himself had been hoping that there might be some difficultyhe had a bathilde of his own who would take a great deal of pacifying the thing was settled now however  i should like he said to make her acquaintance at once  i have thought of that matravers said will you lunch with me at my rooms on sunday and meet her that is of course if she is able to come  i shall be delighted fergusson answered about two i suppose  matravers assented and the two men parted the actor with a little shrug of his shoulders and the air of a man who has an unpleasant task before him turned southwards to interview the lady who certainly had the first claim to play bathilde he found her at home and anxiously expecting him  if you had not come today she remarked i should have sent for you i want you to contradict that rubbish  she threw the theatrical paper across at him and watched him whilst he read the paragraph to which she had pointed he laid the paper down  i cannot altogether contradict it he said there is some truth in what the man writes  the lady was getting angry she came over to fergusson and stood by his side  you mean to tell me she exclaimed that you have accepted a play for immediate production which i have not even seen and in which the principal part is to be given to one of those crackpots down at the new theatre an amateur an outsidera woman no one ever heard of before  you cant exactly say that he interposed calmly i see you have her novel on your table there and she is a woman who has been talked about a good deal lately but the facts of the case are these matravers brought me a play a few days ago which almost took my breath away it is by far the best thing of the sort i ever read it is bound to be a great success i cant tell you any more nowyou shall read it yourself in a day or two he was very easy to deal with as to terms but he made one condition that a certain part in itthe principal one i admitshould be offered to this woman i tried all i could to talk him out of it but absolutely without effect i was forced to consent there is not a manager in london who would not jump at the play on any conditions you know our position her majesty is a failure and i havent a single decent thing to put on i simply dared not let such a chance as this go by  i never heard anything so ridiculous in my life the lady exclaimed no im not blaming you reggie i dont suppose you could have done anything else but this woman what a nerve she must have to imagine that she can do it i see her horrid norwegian play has come to utter grief at the new theatre  she is a clever woman fergusson remarked one can only hope for the best  she flashed a quiet glance at him  you know her thenyou have been to see her  not yet fergusson answered i am going to meet her tomorrow matravers has asked me to lunch  tell me about matravers she said  i am afraid i do not know much he is a very distinguished literary man but his work has generally been critical or philosophicalevery one will be surprised to hear that he has written a play you will find that there will be quite a stir about it the reason why we have no plays nowadays which can possibly be classed as literature is because the wrong class of man is writing for the stage smith and francis and all these men have fine dramatic instincts but they are not scholars their dialogue is mostly beneath contempt there is a dash of conventionality in their best work now matravers is a writer of an altogether different type  thanks she interrupted but i dont want a homily i am only curious about the man himself  fergusson pulled himself up a little annoyed he had begun to talk about a subject of peculiar interest to him  oh the man himself is rather an interesting personality he declared he is a recluse a dilettante and a very brilliant man of letters  i want to know the lady said impatiently whether he is married  married certainly not fergusson assured her  very well then i am going there to luncheon with you tomorrow  fergusson looked blank  but my dear girl he protested how on earth  dont be foolish reggie she said calmly it is perfectly natural for me to go i have been your principal actress for several seasons i suppose if there is a second womans part in the piece it will be mine if i choose to take it you must write and ask matravers for permission to bring me you can mention my desire to meet the new actress if you like  fergusson took up his hat  matravers is not the sort of man one feels like taking a liberty with he said but ill try him  you can let me know tonight at the theatre she directed     chapter ix   nothing short of a miracle could have made matravers luncheon party a complete success yet so far as berenice was concerned it could scarcely be looked upon in any other light her demeanour towards adelaide robinson and fergusson was such as to give absolutely no opportunity for anything disagreeable she frankly admitted both her inexperience and her ignorance yet before they left both fergusson and his companion began to understand matravers confidence in her there was something almost magnetically attractive about her personality  the luncheon was very much what one who knew him would have expected from matraverssimple yet served with exceeding elegance the fruit the flowers and the wine had been his own care and the table had very much the appearance of having been bodily transported from the palace of a noble of some southern land after the meal was over they sat out upon the shaded balcony and sipped their coffee and liqueursfergusson and berenice wrapt in the discussion of many details of the work which lay before them whilst matravers with an effort which he carefully concealed talked continually with adelaide robinson  is it true she asked him that you did not intend your play for the stagethat you wrote it from a literary point of view only  in a sense that is quite true he admitted i wrote it without any definite idea of offering it to any london manager my doing so was really only an impulse  illustration matravers was suddenly conscious of an odd sense of disturbance  if mr fergusson is rightand he is a pretty good judgeyou wont regret having done so she remarked he thinks it is going to have a big run  he may be right matravers answered for all our sakes i hope so  it will be a magnificent opportunity for your friend  matravers looked over towards berenice she was talking eagerly to fergusson whose dark handsome head was very close to hers and in whose eyes was already evident his growing admiration matravers was suddenly conscious of an odd sense of disturbance he was grateful to adelaide robinson for her intervention she had risen to her feet and glanced downwards at the little brougham drawn up below  i am so sorry to go she said but i positively must make some calls this afternoon  fergusson rose also with obvious regret and they left together  dont forget he called back from the door we read our parts tomorrow and rehearsals begin on thursday  i have it all down berenice answered i will do my best to be ready for thursday  berenice remained standing looking thoughtfully after the little brougham which was being driven down piccadilly  matravers came back to her and laid his hand gently upon her arm  you must not think of going yet he said i want you to stay and have tea with me  i should like to she answered i seem to have so much to say to you  he piled her chair with cushions and drew it back into the shade then he lit a cigarette and sat down by her side  i suppose you must think that i am very ungrateful she said i have scarcely said thank you yet have i  you will please me best by never saying it he answered i only hope that it will be a step you will never regret  how could i  he looked at her steadily a certain grave concentration of thought manifest in his dark eyes berenice was looking her best that afternoon she was certainly a very beautiful and a very distinguishedlooking woman her eyes met his frankly her lips were curved in a faintly tender smile  well i hardly know he said you are going to be a popular actress henceforth the stage will have claims upon you it will become your career  you have plenty of confidence  i have absolute confidence in you he declared and fergusson is equally confident about the play chance has given you this opportunitythe result is beyond question yet i confess that i have a presentiment if the manuscript of the heart of the people were in my hands at this moment i think that i would tear it into little pieces and watch them flutter down on to the pavement there  i do not understand you she said softly you say that you have no doubt  it is because i have no doubtit is because i know that it will make you a popular and a famous actress you will gain this i wonder what you will lose  she moved restlessly on her chair  why should i lose anything  it is only a presentiment he reminded her i pray that you may not lose anything yet you are coming under a very fascinating influence it is your personality i am afraid of you are going to belong definitely to a profession which is at once the most catholic and the most narrowing in the world i believe that you are strong enough to stand alone to remain yourself i pray that it may be so and yet there is just the shadow of the presentiment perhaps it is foolish  their chairs were close together he suddenly felt the perfume of her hair and the touch of her fingers upon his hand her face was quite close to his  at least she murmured i pray that i may never lose your friendship  if only i could ensure you as confidently the fulfilment of all your desires he answered you would be a very happy woman i am too lonely a man berenice to part with any of my few joys whether you change or no you must never change towards me  she was silent there were no signs left of the brilliant levity which had made their little luncheon pass off so successfully she sat with her head resting upon her elbow gazing steadily up at the little white clouds which floated over the housetops a tea equipage was brought out and deftly arranged between them  today matravers said i am going to have the luxury of having my tea made for me please come back from dreamland and realize the englishmans idyll of domesticity  she turned in her chair and smiled upon him  i can do it she assured him i believe you doubt my ability but you need not  they talked lightly for some timean art which matravers found himself to be acquiring with wonderful facility then there was a pause when she spoke again it was in an altogether different tone  illustration i can do it she assured him i believe you doubt my ability but you need not  i want you to answer me she said it is not too late shall i give up bathildeand the stage listen you do not know anything of my circumstances i am not dependent upon either the stage or my writing for a living i ask you for your honest advice shall i give it up  you are placing a very heavy responsibility upon my shoulders he answered her thoughtfully yet i will try to answer you honestly i should be happier if i could advise you to give it up but i cannot you have the giftyou must use it the obligation of selfdevelopment is heaviest upon the shoulders of those whose foreheads natures twinsister has touched with fire i would it were any other gift berenice but that is only a personal feeling no you must follow out your destiny you have an opportunity of occupying a unique and marvellous position you can create a new ideal only be true always to yourself be very jealous indeed of absorbing any of the modes of thought and life which will spring up everywhere around you in the new world remember it is the old ideals which are the sweetest and the truest forgive me please i am talking like a pedagogue  you are talking as i like to be talked to she answered yet you need not fear that my head will be turned even if the success should come you forget that i am almost an old woman the religion of my life has long been conceived and fashioned  he looked at her with a curious smile if thirty seemed old to her what must she think of him  i wonder he said simply if you would think me impertinent if i were to ask you to tell me more about yourself how is it that you are altogether alone in the world  the words had scarcely left his lips before he would have given much to have recalled them he saw her start flinch back as though she had been struck and a grey pallor spread itself over her face almost to the lips she looked at him fixedly for several moments without speaking  one day she said i will tell you all that you shall know everything but not now not yet  whenever you will he answered ignoring her evident agitation come what do you say to a walk down through the park today is a holiday for mea day to be marked with a white stone i have registered an oath that i will not even look at a pen will you not help me to keep it  by all means she answered blithely i will take you home with me and keep you there till the hour of temptation has passed today is to be my last day of idleness i too have need of a white stone  we will place them he said side by side     chapter x   matravers luncheon party marked the termination for some time of any confidential intercourse between berenice and himself every moment of her time was claimed by fergusson who in his anxiety to produce a play from which he hoped so much before the wane of the season gave no one any rest and worked himself almost into a fever there were two full rehearsals a day and many private ones at her rooms matravers calling there now and then found fergusson always in possession and by degrees gave it up in despair he had a horror of interfering in any way even of being asked for his advice concerning the practical reproduction of his work fergussons invitations to the rehearsals at the theatre he rejected absolutely as the time grew shorter berenice became pale and almost haggard with the unceasing work which fergussons anxiety imposed upon her one night she sent for matravers and hastening to her rooms he found her for the first time alone  illustration do you know that man is driving me slowly mad  i have sent mr fergusson home she exclaimed welcoming him with outstretched hands but making no effort to rise from her easy chair do you know that man is driving me slowly mad i want you to interfere  what can i do he said  anything to bring him to reason he is overrehearsing every line every sentence every gesture he makes the subject of the most exhaustive deliberation he will have nothing spontaneous it is positively stifling a few more days of it and my reason will go he is a great actor but he does not seem to understand that to reduce everything to mathematical proportions is to court failure  i will go and see him matravers said you wish for no more rehearsals then  i do not want to see his face again before the night of the performance she declared vehemently i am perfect in my part i have thought about itdreamed about it i have lived more as bathilde than as myself for the last three weeks perhaps she continued more slowly you will not be satisfied i scarcely dare to hope that you will be yet i have reached my limitations the more i am made to rehearse now the less natural i shall become  i will speak to fergusson matravers promised i will go and see him tonight but so far as you are concerned i have no fear you will be the bathilde of my heart and my brain you cannot fail  she rose to her feet it is she said the desire of my life to make your bathilde a creature of flesh and blood if i fail i will never act again  if you fail he said the fault will be in my conception not in your execution but indeed we will not consider anything so improbable let us put the play behind us for a time and talk of something else you must be weary of it  she shook her head not that never that just now it is my life only it is the details which weary me the eternal harping upon the mechanical side of it will you read to me for a little and i will make you some coffee you are not in a hurry are you  i have come he said to stay with you until you send me away i will read to you with pleasure what will you have  she handed him a little volume of poems he glanced at the title and made a faint grimace they were his own  nevertheless he read for an hour till the streets below grew silent and his own voice unaccustomed to such exercise lost something of its usual clearness then he laid the volume down and there was silence between them  i have been thinking he said at last of a singular incident in connection with your performance at the new theatre it was brought into my mind just then i meant to have mentioned it before  she looked up with only a slight show of interest those days at the theatre seemed to her now to be very far behind there was nothing in connection with them which she cared to remember  it was the night of my first visit there he continued there is a terrible scene at the end of the second act between herdrine and her husbandyou recollect it of course just as you finished your denunciation i distinctly heard a curious cry from the back of the house it was a greater tribute to your acting than the applause for it was genuine  the piece was gloomy enough she remarked to have dissolved the house in tears  at least he said it wrung the heart of one man for i have not told you all i was interested enough to climb up into the amphitheatre the man sat there alone amongst a wilderness of empty seats he was the picture of abject misery i could scarcely see his face but his attitude was convincing it was not a thing of chance either i made some remark about him to an attendant and he told me that night after night that man had occupied the same seat always following every line of the play with the same mournful concentration never speaking to any one never moving from his seat from the beginning of the play to the end  he must have been she declared a person of singularly morbid taste when i think of it now i shiver i would not play herdrine again for worlds  i am very glad to hear you say so he said smiling do you know that to me the most interesting feature of the play was its obvious effect upon this man its extreme pessimism is too much paraded is laid on altogether with too thick a hand to ring true the thing is an involved nightmare one feels that as a work of art it is never convincing yet underneath it all there must be something human for it found its way into the heart of one man  it is possible she remarked that he was mad the man who found it sufficiently amusing to come to the theatre night after night could scarcely have been in full possession of his senses  that is possible he admitted but i do not believe it the mans face was sad enough but it was not the face of a madman  you did see his face then  on the last night of the play he continued you remember you were going on to lady trutons so i did not come behind but i had a fancy to see you for a moment and i came round into pitt street just as you were driving off on the other side of the way this man was standing watching you  she looked at him with a suddenly kindled interestor was it fearin her dark eyes the colour had left her cheeks she was white to the lips  watching me  yes as your carriage drove off he stood watching it i dont know what prompted me but i crossed the street to speak to him he seemed such a lone mournful figure standing there half dazed shabby muttering softly to himself but when he saw me coming he gave one halffrightened look at me and ran literally ran down the street on to the strand i could not followthe police would have stopped him so he disappeared  you saw his face what was he like  berenice had leaned right back amongst the yielding cushions of her divan and he could scarcely see her face yet her voice sounded to him strange and forced he looked at her in some surprise  i had a glimpse of it it was an ordinary face enough in fact it disappointed me a little but the odd part of it was that it seemed vaguely familiar to me i have seen it before often yet try as i will i cannot recollect where or under what circumstances  at oxford she suggested by the bye what was your college  st johns no i do not thinki hope that it was not at oxford some day i shall think of it quite suddenly  berenice rose from her chair with a sudden tempestuous movement and stood before him  listen she exclaimed supposing i were to tell you that i knew or could guess who that man waswhy he came oh if i were to tell you that i were a fraud that  matravers stopped her  i beg he said that you will tell me nothing  there was a short silence berenice seemed on the point of breaking down she was nervously lacing and interlacing her fingers her breath was coming spasmodically  berenice he said softly you are overwrought you are not quite yourself tonight do not tell me anything indeed there is no need for me to know just as you are i am content with you and proud to be your friend  ah  she sat down again he could not see her face but he fancied that she was weeping he himself found his customary serenity seriously disturbed perhaps for the first time in his life he found himself not wholly the master of his emotions the atmosphere of the little room the perfume of the flowers the soft beauty of the woman herself whose breath fell almost upon his cheek affected him as nothing of the sort had ever done before he rose abruptly to his feet  you will be so much better alone he said taking her fingers and smoothing them softly in his for a moment i am going away now  yes goodby  at the threshold he paused she had not looked up at him she was still sitting there with bowed head and hidden face he closed the door softly and went out     chapter xi   the enthusiasm with which matravers play had been received on the night of its first appearance was if anything exceeded on the night before the temporary closing of the theatre for the usual summer vacation the success of the play itself had never been for a moment doubtful for once the critics the general press and the public were in entire and happy agreement the first night had witnessed an extraordinary scene an audience as brilliant as any which could have been brought together in the first city in the world had flatly refused to leave the theatre until matravers himself reluctant and illpleased had joined fergusson and berenice before the footlights and now on the eve of its temporary withdrawal something of the same sort was threatened again and matravers only escaped by standing up in the front of his box and bowing his acknowledgments to the delighted audience  it was a welldeserved success for certainly as a play it was a brilliant exception to anything which had lately been produced upon the english stage the wornout methods and motives of most living playwrights were rigorously avoided everything about it was fresh and spontaneous its sentiment was relieved by the most delicate vein of humour it was everywhere tender and human the dialogue to which matravers had devoted his usual fastidious care was polished and sprightly there was not anywhere a single dull or unmusical line it was a classic the critics declaredthe first literary play by a living author which london had witnessed for many years the bookings for months ahead were altogether phenomenal fergusson saw a certain fortune within his hands and matravers sharing also in the golden harvest found another and a still greater cause for satisfaction  for berenice had justified his selection the same night as the greatest of critics speaking through the columns of the principal daily paper had said which had presented to them a new writer for the stage had given them also a new actress she had surprised matravers she had amazed fergusson who found himself compelled to look closely to his own laurels in short she was a success descended if not from the clouds at least from the mists of isteinism but accorded without demur or hesitation a foremost place amongst the few accepted actresses her future and his position were absolutely secured and her reputation as matravers was happy to think was made not as the portrayer of a sickly and unnatural type of diseased womanhood but as the woman of his own creation a very sweet and pure english lady  the house emptied at last and matravers made his way behind where many of fergussons friends had gathered together and where congratulations were the order of the day a species of informal reception was going on champagne cup and sandwiches were being handed around and a general air of extreme good humour pervaded the place berenice was the centre of a group of men amongst whom matravers was annoyed to see thorndyke if he could have withdrawn unseen he would have done so but already he was surrounded a little stir at the entrance attracted his attention he turned round and found fergusson presenting him to a royal personage who was graciously pleased however to remember a former meeting and waved away the words of introduction  it chanced without any design on his part that berenice and he left almost at the same time and met near the stage door she dropped fergussons armhe had left his guests to see her to her carriageand motioned to matravers  wont you see me home she asked quietly i have sent my maid on she was so tired and i am all alone  i shall be very pleased matravers answered may i come in with you fergusson lingered for a moment or two at the carriage door and then they drove off berenice with a little sigh leaned back amongst the cushions  you are very tired i am afraid he said gently the last few weeks must have been a terrible strain upon you  they have been in many ways she said the happiest of my life  i am glad of that yet it is quite time that you had a rest  she did not answer himshe did not speak again until the carriage drew up before her house he handed her out and opened the door with the latchkey which she passed over to him  good night he said holding out his hand  you must please come in for a little time she begged i have seen you scarcely at all lately you have not even told me about your travels  he hesitated for a moment then seeing the shade upon her face he stepped forward briskly  i should like to come very much he said only you must be sure to send me away if i stay too long you are tired already  i am tired she admitted leading the way upstairs only it will rest me much more to have you talk to me than to go to bed mine is scarcely a physical fatigue my nerves are all quivering i could not sleep tell me where you have been  matravers took the seat to which she motioned him and obeyed her watching whilst she stooped down over the fire and poured water into a brazen coffeepot and took another cup and saucer from a quaint little cupboard she made the coffee carefully and well and matravers as he lit his cigarette found himself wondering at this new and very natural note of domesticity in her  illustration matravers found himself wondering at this new and very natural note of domesticity in her  all the time he was talking telling her in a few chosen sentences of the little tour for which she really was responsibleof the pinkandwhite appleblossoms of brittany of the peasants in their quaint and picturesque garb and of the old timeworn churches the exploration of which had constituted his chief interest she listened eagerly every word of his description so vivid and picturesque was interesting when he had finished he looked at her thoughtfully  you too he said need a change you have worked very hard and you will need all your strength for the autumn season  i am going away she said very soon perhaps tomorrow  he looked at her surprised  so soon  why not what is there to keep me the theatre is closed london is positively stifling i am longing for some fresh air  he was silent for a moment or two it was so natural that she should go and yet in a sense it was so unexpected looking steadily across at her as she leaned back amongst the cushions of her chair her dark eyes watching his face her attitude and expression alike convincing him in some subtle way of her satisfaction at his presence he became suddenly conscious that the time which he had dimly anticipated with mingled fear and pleasure was now close at hand his heart was beating with a quickened throb he was aghast as he realized with quick unerring truth the full effect of her words upon him he drew a sharp little breath and walked to the open window taking in a long draught of the fresh night air sweetly scented with the perfume of the flowers in her boxes her voice came to him low and sweet from the interior of the room  there is a little farmhouse in devonshire which belongs to me it is nothing but a tumbledown grey stone place but there are hills and meadows and country lanes and the sea i want to go there  away from me he cried hoarsely  will you come too she murmured  illustration she did not answer him but indeed there was no need  he turned back into the room and looked at her she was standing up coming towards him a faint tinge of pink colour had stained her cheekher bosom was heavingher eyes were challenging his with a light which needed no borrowed brilliancy go with her the mans birthright his passion which through the long days of his austere life had lain dormant and undreamt of swept up from his heart he held out his arms and she came across the room to him with a sweet effort of selfyielding which yet waited for while it invited his embrace  you mean it he murmured you are sure  she did not answer him but indeed there was no need     chapter xii   matravers never altogether forgot the sensations with which he awoke on the following morning notwithstanding a sleepless night he rose and made a deliberate toilet with a wonderful buoyancy of spirits the change which had come into his life was a thing so wonderful that he could scarcely realize it yet it was true he had found the one experience in life which had hitherto been denied him and he was amazed at the full extent of its power and sweetness he felt himself to be many years younger old dreams and enthusiasms were suddenly revived once more his foot seemed to be poised upon the threshold of life after all he had not yet reached middle age he was surprised to find himself so young marriage although so far as regarded himself he had never imagined it a possible part of his life was a condition against which he held no vows instinctively he felt that with berenice existence must inevitably become a fuller and a richer thing the old days of philosophic quietude of selfcontained and cultured ease had been in themselves very pleasant but his was altogether too large a nature to become in any way the slave of habit he looked forward to their abandonment without regretwhat was to come would be a continuation of the best part of them set to the sweetest music he was conscious of holding himself differently as he entered his breakfastroom was it his fancy or was the perfume of his little bowl of roses indeed more sweet this morning the sunshine mellower and warmer the flavour of his grapes more delicate at any rate he ate with a rare appetite and then whilst he smoked a cigarette afterwards an idea came to him the colour rose in his cheekshe felt like a boy in a few minutes he was walking through the streets smiling softly to himself as he thought of his strange errand  he found his way to a jewellers shop in bond street and asked for pearls they were the only jewels she cared for and he made a deliberate and careful choice wondering more than once with a curious sort of shyness whether the man who served him so gravely had any idea for what purpose he was buying the ring which had been the object of his first inquiry he walked home with a little square box in his hand and a much smaller one in his waistcoat pocket on the pavement he had hesitated for a moment but a glance at his watch had decided him it was too early to go and see her yet he walked back to his rooms there was a little work which he must finish during the day he had better attempt it at once  on his desk a letter was waiting for him with a little tremor of pleasure he recognized her handwriting he took it over to the tall sunny window with a smile of anticipation upon his lips he broke the seal and read       my love the daylight has come and i am here where you      left me a very happy and yet a very unhappy woman is it      indeed only a few hours since we parted it all seems so      different the starlight and the night wind and the deep      sweet silence have gone there is a great shaft of yellow      light in the sky and a bank of purple clouds where the sun      has risen only the perfume of your roses lying crushed in      my lap remains to prove to me that it has not all been a      very sweet dream dearest i have a secret to tell youthe      sorrow of my life the time has come when you must alas      know it last night it was enough for me to hear you tell me      of your love nothing else in the world seemed worthy of a      moments thought but as you were leaving you whispered      something about our marriage how sweetly it soundedand      yet how bitterly for dear i can never marry you i am      already married i can see you start when you read this you      will blame me for having kept this secret from you very      likely you will be angry with me only for the love of god      pity me a little       my story is so commonplace i can tell it you in a few      sentences i married when i was seventeen at my fathers      command to save him from ruin my husband like my father      was a city merchant i did not love him but then i did not      know what love was my girlhood was a miserable one my      father belonged to the sect of calvinists our home was      hideous and we were poor any release from it was welcome      john drage the man whom i married had one good quality he      was generous he bought me pictures and booksthings which      i always craved when my fathers command came it did not      seem a hardship i married him he was not so much a bad      man perhaps as a weak one we lived together for four      years i had one child a little boy then i made a horrible      discovery my husband whom i knew to be a drunkard was      hideously debasingly false to me the bald facts are these      i myself saw him drunk and helped into his carriage by one      of those women whose trade it is to prey upon such      creatures this was not an exceptional occurrence it was a      habit       there i have told you it would have hurt me less to have      cut off my right hand but there shall be no      misunderstanding nor any concealment between us i left      john drages house that night i took little freddy with me      but when i refused to return he stole the child away from      me then i drew a sharp line at that point in my life i had      neither friend nor relation but there was some money which      had been left me soon after my marriage i lived alone and      i began to write that is my story that is why i cannot      marry you       dear i want you now that you know my very ugly history      to consider this whilst i was married i was faithful to my      husband since then i have been faithful to my selfrespect      but i have told myself always that if ever the time came      when i should love i would give myself to that man without      hesitation and without shame and that time has come dear      you know that i love you your coming has been the great      awakening joy of my life nothing that has gone before      nothing that the future may hold can ever trouble me if we      are togetheryou and i i have suffered more than most      women but you will help me to forget it       i sit here with my face to the morning and i seem to see a      new life stretching out before me is not love a beautiful      thing i am not ambitious any more i do not want any other      object in life than to make you happy and to be made happy      by you i began this letter with a heavy heart and with      trembling fingers but now i am quite calm and quite happy      i know that you will come to me you see i have great faith      in your love thank god for it                                berenice  the letter fluttered from matravers fingers on to the floor for several minutes he stood quite still with his hand pressed to his heart then he calmly seated himself in a little easy chair which stood by his side with its back to the window he had a curious sense of being suddenly removed from his own personalityhis own self he was another man gazing for the last time upon a very familiar scene  he sat there with his head resting upon the palm of his hand looking with lingering eyes around his little room even the simplest objects of which were in a sense typical of the life which he was abandoning he knew that that life if even its influence had not been wide had been a studiously wellordered and a seemly thing a touch of that ultra æstheticism which had given to all his writings a peculiar tone and individuality had permeated also his ideas as to the simplest events of living all that was commonplace and ugly and vicious had ever repelled him he had lived not only a clean life but a sweet one his intense love for pure beauty combined with a strong dash of epicureanism had given a certain colour to its outward form as well as to its inward workings even the simplest objects by which he was surrounded were the best of their kindcarefully and faithfully chosen the smallest details of his daily life had always been governed by a love of comely and kindly order both in his conversation and in his writings he had studiously avoided all excess all shadow of evil or unkindness his opinions well chosen and deliberate though they were were flavoured with a delicate temperateness so distinctive of the man and of his habits and now it was all to come to an end he was about to sever the cords to cut himself adrift from all that had seemed precious and dear and beautiful to him he to whom even the women of the streets had been as sacred things was about to become the established and the open lover of a woman whom he could never marry to a certain extent it was like moral shipwreck to him yet he loved her he was sure of that he had called himself in the past as indeed he had every right to something of a philosopher but he had never tried to harden within himself the human leaven which had kept him in sympathy and kindliness always in close touch with his fellows and this was its fruit to him of all men there had come this  soon he found himself in the street on his way to her such a letter as this called for no delay it was barely twelve oclock when he rang the bell at her house the girl who answered it handed him a note he asked quickly for her mistress  she left an hour ago by the early train he was told she has gone into the country  she had made up her mind quite suddenly and had not even taken her maid the address would probably be in the letter  still standing on the doorstep he tore open the note and read it there were only a few lines       dearest can you take a short holiday i have a fancy to      have you come to me at my little house in devonshire london      is stifling me and i want to taste the full sweetness of my      happiness you see i do not doubt you i know that you will      come shall you mind a tiresome railway journey the address      is bossington old manor house devonshire and the station      is minehead wire what train you are coming by and i will      send something to meet you                                berenice     chapter xiii   matravers walked back to his rooms and ordered his portmanteau to be packed then he went out and after making all his arrangements for an absence from town bought a bradshaw there were two trains he found by which he could travel one at three the other at halfpast four he arranged to catch the earlier one and drove to his club for lunch afterwards he strolled towards the smokingroom but finding it unusually full was on the point of withdrawing as he lingered on the threshold a womans name fell upon his ears the speaker was mr thorndyke he became rigid  why yes i gave her the victoria he was saying we called it a birthday present or something of that sort i supposed every one knew about that those little arrangements generally are known somehow  the innuendo was unmistakable matravers advanced with his usual leisurely walk to the little group of men  i beg your pardon he said quietly i understood mr thorndyke to say i believe that he had given a carriage to a certain lady am i correct  thorndyke turned upon him sharply there was a sudden silence in the crowded room matravers clear cold voice although scarcely raised above the pitch of ordinary conversation had penetrated to its furthest corner  and if i did sir what  these gentlemen will bear me witness that you did say so matravers interrupted calmly i regret to have to use unpleasant language mr thorndyke but i am compelled to tell you and these gentlemen that your statement is a lie  thorndyke was a florid and a puffy man the veins upon his temples stood out like whipcord he was not a pleasant sight to look upon  what do you mean sir he spluttered the carriage was mine before she had it everybody recognizes it  illustration i am compelled to tell you and these gentlemen that your statement is a lie  exactly the carriage was yours you intended every one to recognize it but you have omitted to state both here and in other places that the lady bought that carriage from you for two hundred and sixty guineasa good deal more than its worth i should imagine you heard her say that she was thinking of buying a victoria and you offered her yourspressed her to buy it it was too small for your horses you said and you were hard up you even had it sent round to her stables without her consent i have heard this story before sir and i have furnished myself with proofs of its falsehood this gentlemen he added drawing some papers from his pocket is mr thorndykes receipt for the two hundred and sixty guineas for a victoria signed as you will see in his own handwriting and here is the ladys cheque with mr thorndykes endorsement cancelled and paid  the papers were handed round thorndyke picked up his hat but matravers barred his egress  with regard to the insinuation which you coupled with your falsehood he continued both are equally and absolutely false i know her to be a pure and upright woman a short time ago you took advantage of your position to make certain cowardly and disgraceful propositions to her since when her doors have been closed upon you i would have you know sir and remember that the honour of that lady whom last night i asked to be my wife is as dear to me as my own and if you dare now or at any future time to slander her i shall treat you as you deserve you can go  and be very careful sir thundered the old earl of ellesmere veteran member of the club that you never show your face inside these doors again or egad im an old man but ill kick you out myself  thorndyke left the room amidst a chilling and unsympathetic silence as soon as he could get away matravers followed him there was a strange pain at his heart a sense of intolerable depression had settled down upon him after all what good had he done only a few more days and her name which for the moment he had cleared would be besmirched in earnest his impeachment of thorndyke would sound to these men then like mock heroics there would be no one to defend her any more there would be no defence for ever in the eyes of all these people she was doomed to become one of the magdalens of the world  it seemed a very unreal london through which matravers was whirled on his way from the club to paddington but before a third of the distance was accomplished there was a sudden check a little boy who had wandered from his nurse in crossing the road narrowly escaped being run over by a carriage and pair only to find himself knocked down by the shaft of matravers hansom there was a cry and the driver pulled his horse on to her haunches but apparently just a second too late with a sickening sense of horror matravers saw the little fellow literally under the horses feet and heard his shrill cry of terror  he leaped out and was the first to pick the child up immeasurably relieved to find that after all he was not seriously hurt his clothes were torn and his hands were scratched and there apparently the mischief ended matravers lifted him into the cab and turned to the frightened nursegirl for the address  nine greenfield gardens west kensington sir she told him and please tell the master it wasnt my fault he is so venturesome i cant control him nohow his name is dragefreddy drage sir  and then once more matravers felt that strange dizziness which had come to him earlier in the day again he had that curious sense of moving in a dream as though he had indeed become part of an unreal and shadowy world the renewed motion of the cab as they drove back again along pall mall recalled him to himself he leaned back and looked at the boy steadily  yes they were her eyes there was no doubt about it the little fellow not in the least shy and in fact now become rather proud of his adventure commenced to prattle very soon matravers interrupted him with a question  wont your mother be frightened to see you like this the child stared at him with wideopen eyes  why mammy aint there he exclaimed mammy went away ever so long ago i dont think shes dead though cos daddy wouldnt let me talk about her only just lately since he was ill you see he went on with an explanatory wave of the hand daddys been a very bad man hes better nowleastways he aint so bad as he was but i spect thats why mammy went away dont you  i daresay freddy matravers answered softly  were getting very near now freddy remarked looking over the apron of the cab my wont dada be surprised to see me drive up in a cab with you i hope hes at the window  will your father be at home now matravers asked  freddy stared at him  why of course dads always at home is my face very buggy dont rub it any more please thats jack mason over there i play with him i want him to see me hullo jack he shouted leaning out of the cab ive been run over right over face all buggy look at it hands too spreading them out hes a nice boy freddy continued as the cab turned a corner but he cant run near so fast as me and hes lots older hullo here we are kicking vigorously at the apron  matravers looked up in surprise they had stopped short before a long row of shabbygenteel houses in the outskirts of kensington he took the boys outstretched hand and pushed open the gate the door was open and freddy dragged him into a room on the ground floor  a man was lying on a sofa before the window wrapped in an untidy dressinggown and with the lower part of his body covered up with a rug his face fair and florid with more than a suggestion of coarseness in the heavy jaw and thick lips was drawn and wrinkled as though with pain his lips wore an habitually peevish expression he did not offer to rise when they came in matravers was thankful that freddy spared him the necessity of immediate speech he had recognized in a moment the man who had sat alone night after night in the back seats of the new theatre whose slow drawnout cry of agony had so curiously affected him on that night of her performance he recognized too the undergraduate of his college sent down for flagrant misbehaviour the leader of a set whom he himself had denounced as a disgrace to the university and this man was her husband  daddy the boy cried dropping matravers hand and running over to the couch ive been run over by a hansom cab and im all buggy but i aint hurt and this gentleman brought me home daddy cant get up you know freddy explained his legs is bad  run over eh exclaimed the man on the couch its like that girls damned carelessness  he patted the boys head not unkindly and matravers found words  my cab unfortunately knocked your little boy down near trafalgar square but i am thankful to say that he was not hurt i thought that i had better bring him straight home though as he has had a roll in the dust  at the sound of matravers voice the man started and looked at him earnestly a dull red flush stained his cheeks he looked away  it was very good of you mr matravers he said i cant think what the girl could have been about  i did not see her until after the accident i am glad that it was no worse matravers answered you have not forgotten me then  john drage shook his head  no sir he said i have not forgotten you i should have known your voice anywhere besides i knew that you were in london i saw you at the new theatre  there was a short silence matravers glanced around the room with an inward shiver the usual horrors of a suburban parlour were augmented by a general slovenliness and an obvious disregard for any sort of order  i am afraid drage he said gently that things have not gone well with you  you are quite right the man answered bitterly they have not they have gone very wrong indeed and i have no one to blame but myself  i am sorry matravers said you are an invalid too are you not  i am worse than an invalid the man on the couch groaned i am a prisoner on my back most likely for ever curse it i have had a paralytic stroke i cant think why i couldnt die its hard linesdamned hard lines i wish i were dead twenty times a day i am alone here from morning to night and not a soul to speak to if it wasnt for freddy i should jolly soon end it  the little boys mother matravers ventured with bowed head  she left meyears ago i dont know that i blame her particularly sit down if you will for a bit i never have a visitor and it does me good to talk  matravers took the only unoccupied chair and drew it back a little into the darker part of the room  you remember me then drage he remarked yet it is a long time since our college days  i knew you directly i heard your voice sir the man answered it seemed to take me back to a night many years agoi want you to let me remind you of it i should like you to know that i never forgot it we were at st johns then you were right above mein a different world altogether you were a leader amongst the best of them and i was a hangeron amongst the worst you were in with the gentlemen set and the reading set neither of them would have anything to do with meand they were quite right i was what they thought mea cad id no head for work and no taste for anything worth doing and i wasnt a gentleman and hadnt sense to behave like one id no right to have been at the university at all but my poor old dad would have me go he had an idea that he could make a gentleman of me it was a mistake  matravers moved slightly in his chairhe was suffering tortures  is it worth while recalling all these things he asked quietly life cannot be a success for all of us yet it is the future and not the past  i have no future the man interrupted doggedly no future here or in any other place i have got my deserts i wanted to remind you of that night when you came to see me in my rooms after id been sent down for being drunk i suppose you were the first gentleman who had ever crossed my threshold and i remember wondering what on earth youd come for you didnt lecture me and you didnt preach you came and sat down and smoked one of my cigars and talked just as though we were friends and tried to make me see what a fool i was it didnt do much good in the endbut i never forgot it you shook hands with me when you left and for once in my life i was ashamed of myself  i am sorry matravers said with an effort that i did not go to see you oftener  drage shook his head  it was too late then i was done fordone for as far as oxford was concerned but that was only the beginning i might easily have picked up if id had the pluck the dad forgave me and made me a partner in the business before he died i was a rich man and i might have been a millionaire instead of that i was a damned fool i cant help swearing you mustnt mind sir remember what i am i dont swear when freddys in the room if i can help it i went the pace drank kept women and all the rest of it my wife found me out and went away i aint saying a word against her she was a good woman and i was a bad man and she left me she was right enough i wasnt fit for a decent woman to live with all the same i missed her and it was another kick down hellward for me when she went i got desperate then i took to drink worse than ever and i began to let my business go and speculate you wouldnt know anything of the city sir but i can tell you this when a cool chap with all his wits about him starts speculating outside his business its touch and go with him when a chap in the state i was in goes for it you can spell the result in four letters its ruin ruin thats what it meant for me i lost two hundred thousand pounds in three years and my business went to pot too then i had this cursed stroke and here i am i may stick on for years but i shall never be able to earn a penny again where freddys schooling is to come from or how we are to live i dont know  i am very sorry matravers said gently have you no friends then or relations who will help you  not a damned one growled the man on the couch i had plenty of pals once only too glad to count themselves john drages friends but where they are now i dont know they seem to have melted away theres never a one comes near me i could do without their money or their help somehow but its damned hard to lie here for ever and have not one of em drop in just now and then for a bit of a talk and a cheering word thats what gives me the blues i always was fond of company i hated being alone and its like hell to lie here day after day and see no one but a cross landlady and a miserable servant girl lately i cant bear to be alone with freddy hes so damned like his mother you know it brings a lump in my throat i wouldnt mind so much if it were only myself ive had my cake but its rough on the boy  it is rough on the boy and it is rough on you matravers said kindly i wonder you have never thought of sending him to his mother she would surely like to have him  the mans face grew black  not till im dead he said doggedly i dont want him set against me hes all ive got im going to keep him for a bit it ought not to be so difficult for us to live if only i could get down to the city for a few hours  could not a friend there do some good for you matravers asked  of course he could mr drage answered eagerly but i havent got a friend see here  he took a little account book from under his pillow and with trembling fingers thrust it before his visitor  you see all these amounts they are all owing to me from those peoplemoney lent and one thing and another there is an envelope with bills and i o us they belong to me you understand he said with a sudden touch of dignity i never failed my business was stopped when i was taken ill but there was enough to pay everybody now some of these amounts have never been collected if i could see these people myself they would pay or if i could get a friend whom i could trust but there isnt a man comes near me  iam not a business man matravers said slowly but if you cared to explain things to me i would go into the city and see what i could do  the man raised himself on his elbow and gazed at his visitor openmouthed  you mean this he cried thickly say it againquick you mean it  certainly matravers answered i will do what i can  john drage did not doubt his good fortune for a moment no one ever looked into matravers face and failed to believe him  iill thank you some day he murmured youve done me up will youshake hands  he held out a thin white hand matravers took it between his own  in a few moments they were absorbed in figures and explanations finally the book was passed over to matravers keeping  i will see what i can do he said quietly some of these accounts should certainly be recovered i will come down and let you know how i have got on  illustration you mean this he cried thickly say it againquick  if you would if you dont mind and i wonderdo you take a morning paper if so will you bring it when youve done with it or an old one will do i cant read anything but newspapers and lately i havent dared to spend a pennybecause of freddy you know its so cursed lonely  i will come and i will bring you something to read matravers promised i must go now  john drage held out his hand wistfully  goodby he said youre a good man i wish id been like you its an odd thing for me to say butgod bless you sir  matravers stood on the doorstep with his watch in his hand it was halfpast three there was just time to catch the fourthirty from waterloo for a moment the little street faded away from before his eyes he saw himself at his journeys end berenice was there to meet him a breath of the country came to him on the breezea breath of sweetsmelling flowers and fresh moorland air and the low murmur of the blue sea yes there was berenice with her dark hair blowing in the wind and that look of passionate peace in her pale tired face her arms were open wide open she had been weary so long the struggle had been so hard and he too was weary  he started he was still on the doorstep freddy was drumming on the pane and behind there was a man lying on the couch with his face buried in his hands he waved his hand and descended the steps firmly  back to my rooms 147 piccadilly he told the cabman i shall not be going away today     chapter xiv   a man wrote it from his little room in the heart of london whilst night faded into morning he wrote it with leaden heart and unwilling mechanical effortwrote it as a man might write his own doom every fresh sentence which stared up at him from the closely written sheets seemed like another landmark in his sad descent from the pinnacles of his late wonderful happiness down into the black waters of despair when he had finished and the pen slipped from his stiff nerveless fingers there were lines and marks in his face which had never been there before and which could never altogether pass away                                        a woman read it seated on a shelving slant of moorland with the blue sky overhead and the soft murmur of the sea in her ears and the sunlight streaming around her when she had finished and the letter had fallen to her side crushed into a shapeless mass the light had died out of the sky and the air and the song of the birds had changed into a wail and this was what the man had said to the woman       berenice i have had a dream i dreamed that i was coming      to you that you and i were together somewhere in a new      world where the men were gods and the women were saints      where the sun always shone and nothing that was not pure      and beautiful had any place and now i am awake and i know      that there is no such world       you and i are standing on opposite sides of a deep dark      precipice i may not come to you you must not come to me       i have thought over this matter with all the seriousness      which befits it you will never know how great and how      fierce the struggle has been i am feeling an older and a      tired man but now that is all over i have crossed the      rubicon the mists have rolled away and the truth is very      clear indeed to me i shudder when i think to what misery i      might have brought you if i had yielded to that sweetest      and most fascinating impulse of my life which bade me      accept your sacrifice and come to you berenice you are      very young yet and you have woven some new and very      beautiful fancies which you have put into a book and which      the world has found amusing to you alone they have become      the essence of your life they have become by constant      contemplation a part of yourself out of the greatness of      your heart you do not fear to put them into practice but      dear you must find a new world to fit your fancies for the      one in which we are forced to dwell the world which in      theory finds them delightful would find another and an      uglier world if we should venture upon their embodiment      after all we are creatures of this world and by this      worlds laws we shall be judged the things which are right      are right and the things which are pure are pure love is      the greatest power in the world but it cannot alter things      which are unalterable       once when i was climbing with a friend of mine in the      engadine we saw a white flower growing virtually out of a      cleft in the rocks high above our heads my friend was a      botanist and he would have that flower i lay on my back      and watched him struggle to reach it watched him often      slipping backwards but gradually crawling nearer and      nearer until at last breathless with torn clothes and      bleeding hands he grasped the tiny blossom and held it out      to me in triumph together we admired it ceaselessly as we      retraced our steps but as we left the high altitudes and      descended into the valley a change took place in the      flower its petals drooped its leaves shrank and faded      white became grey the freshness which had been its chief      beauty faded away with every step we took my friend kept      it but he kept it with sorrow it was no longer a beautiful      flower       berenice you are that flower you are beautiful and pure      and strong you think that you are strong enough to live in      the lowlands but you are not no love of mine changeless      and whole as it must ever be could keep your soul from      withering in the nether land of sin for it would be sin      in these days when you are young when the fires of your      enthusiasm are newly kindled and the wings of your      imagination have not been shorn you may say to yourself      that it is not sin you may say that love is the only true      and sweet shrine before which we need keep our lives holy      and pure and that the time for regrets would never come       illusion i too have tried to reason with myself in this      manner i have tried passionately earnestly feverishly i      have failed i cannot no one can i know that to you i seem      to be writing like a philistine like a man of a generation      gone by you have filled your little world with new ideals      you have lit it with the lamp of love and it all seems very      real and beautiful to you but some day though the lamp may      burn still as brightly as ever a great white daylight will      break in through the walls you will see things that you      have never seen before and the light of that lamp will seem      cold and dim and ghostly nothing nothing can ever alter      the fact that your husband lives and that your little boy      is growing up with a great void in his heart some day he      will ask for his mother even now he may be asking for her      berenice would he ever look with large indulgent eyes      upon that little world of yours alas                                                 i have read my letter over to myself berenice and i fear      that it must sound to you very commonplace even perhaps      cold yet believe me when i tell you that i have passed      through a very fire of suffering and if i am calm now it is      with the calm of an ineffable despair in my life at oxford      and later here in london women have never borne any share      part of my scheme of living has been to regard them as      something outside my little cycle an influence great      indeed but one which had passed me by       yet i am now one of the worlds great sufferers one of      those who have found at once their greatest joy linked with      an unutterable despair for i love you berenice never      doubt it though i should never look upon your face      againwhich god in his mercy forbidmy love for you must      be for ever a part and the greatest part of my life always      remember that i pray you       it seems strange to talk of ones plans with such a great      black cloud of sorrow filling the air but the outward form      of life does not change even when the light has gone out      and ones heart is broken i have some work before me which      i must finish when it is over i shall go abroad but that      can wait when you are back in london send for me i am      schooling myself to meet a new berenicemy friend and i      have something still more to say to you                                matravers     chapter xv   the week that followed the sending of his letter was to matravers with his love for equable times and emotions like a week in hell he had set himself a task not easy even to an ordinary man of business but to him trebly difficult and harassing day after day he spent in the citya somewhat strange visitor there with his grave dignified manner and studied fastidiousness of dress and deportment he was unversed in the ways of the men with whom he had to deal and he had no commercial aptitude whatever but in a quiet way he was wonderfully persistent and he succeeded better perhaps than any other emissary whom john drage could have employed the sum of money which he eventually collected amounted to nearly fifteen hundred pounds and late one evening he started for kensington with a bundle of papers under his arm and a chequebook in his pocket  it was his last visitat any rate for the presenthe told himself with a sense of wonderful relief as he walked through the park in the gathering twilight for of late something in connection with his days efforts had taken him every evening to the shabby little house at kensington where his coming was eagerly welcomed by the tired sick man and the lonely boy he had esteemed himself a man well schooled in all manner of selfcontrol and little to be influenced in a matter of duty by his personal likes and dislikes but these visits were a torture to him to sit and talk for hours with a man grateful enough but peevish and commonplace and with a curious lack of virility or selfreliance in his untoward circumstances was trial enough to matravers who had been used to select his associates and associations with delicate and close care but to remember that this man had been and indeed was the husband of berenice was madness it was this man whom at the best he could only regard with a kindly and gentle contempt who stood between him and such surprising happiness this man and the boy with his pale serious face and dark eyes and the bitterness of fatefor he never realized that it would have been possible for him to have acted otherwisehad made him their benefactor  just as he was leaving the park he glanced up at the sound of a carriage passing him rapidly and as he looked up he stood still it seemed to him that life itself was standing still in his veins berenice had been silent there had come no word from her but nothing so tragic so horrible as this had ever occurred to him his heart had been full of black despair and his days had been days of misery but even the possibility of seeking for himself solace by means not altogether worthy had never dawned upon him nor had he dreamed it of her yet the man who waved his hand from the boxseat of the phaeton with a courtesy seemingly real but under the circumstances brutally ironical was thorndyke and the woman who sat by his side was berenice  the carriage passed on down the broad drive and matravers stood looking after it was it his fancy or was that indeed a faint cry which came travelling through the dim light to his ears as he stood there under the treesa figure turned to stone a faint cry or the wailing of a lost spirit a sudden dizziness came over him and he sat down on one of the seats close at hand there was a singing in his ears and a pain at his heart he sat there with halfclosed eyes battling with his weakness  presently he got up and continued his journey he found himself on the doorstep of the shabby little house and mechanically he passed in and told the story of his days efforts to the man who welcomed him so eagerly with his pocketbook in his hand he successfully underwent a searching crossexamination faithfully recording what one man had said and what another their excuses and their protestations he made no mistakes and his memory served him amply but when he had come to the end of the list and had placed the chequebook in john drages fingers he felt that he must get away even his stoical endurance had a measurable depth but it was hard to escape from the mans most unwelcome gratitude john drage had not the tact to recognize in his benefactor the man to whom thanks are hateful  and i had no claim upon you whatever the sick man wound up halfbreathless if you had cut me dead after my oxford disgrace it would only have been exactly what i deserved thats what makes it so odd your doing all this for me i cant understand it im damned if i can  matravers stood over him a silent unresponsive figure seeking only to make his escape with difficulty he broke in upon the torrent of words  will you do me the favour mr drage he begged earnestly of saying no more about it any man of leisure would have done for you what i have done if you really wish to afford me a considerable happiness you can do so  anything in this world john drage declared vehemently  matravers thought for a moment the proposition which he was about to make had been in his mind from the first the time had come now to put it into words  you must not be offended at what i am going to say he began gently i am a rich man and i have taken a great fancy to your boy i have no children of my own in fact i am quite alone in the world if you will allow me i should like to undertake freddys education  a light broke across the mans coarse face momentarily transfiguring it he raised himself on his elbow and gazed at his visitor with eager scrutiny then he drew a deep sigh and there were tears in his eyes he did not say a word matravers continued  it will be a great pleasure for me he said quietly what i propose is to invest a thousand pounds for that purpose in freddys name in fact i have taken the liberty of already doing it the papers are here  matravers laid an envelope on the little table between them then he rose up  will you forgive me now he said if i hurry away i will come and see you again and we will talk this over more thoroughly  and still john drage said nothing but he held out his hand matravers pressed the thin fingers between his own  you must see freddy he said eagerly i promised him that he should come in before you went  but matravers shook his head there was a pain at his heart like the cutting of a knife  i cannot stay another instant he declared send freddy over to my rooms any time let him come and have tea with me  then they parted and matravers walked through a world of strange shadows to berenices house her maid recognizing him took him up to her room without ceremony the door was softly opened and shut he stood upon the threshold for a moment everything seemed dark before him     chapter xvi   berenice seemed to dwell always in the twilight at first matravers thought that the room was empty and he advanced slowly towards the window and then he stopped short berenice was lying in a crumpled heap on the low couch almost within touch of his hands she was lying on her side her supple figure all doubled up and the folds of her loose gown flowing around her in wild disorder her face was half hidden in her clasped hands  berenice he cried softly  illustration berenice was lying in a crumpled heap on the low couch  she did not answer she was asleep he stood looking down upon her his heart full of an infinite tenderness she too had suffered then her hair was in wild confusion and there were marks of recent tears upon her pale cheeks a little lace handkerchief had slipped from her fingers down on to the floor he picked it up it was wet the glow of the heavilyshaded lamp was upon her clasped white fingers and her bowed head he watched the rising and falling of her bosom as she slept to him so great a stranger to women and their ways there was a curious fascination in all the trifling details of her toilette and person the innate daintiness of which appealed to him with a very potent and insidious sweetness whilst she slept he felt as one far removed from her it was like a beautiful picture upon which he was gazing the passion which had been raging within him like an autumn storm was suddenly stilled only the purely æsthetic pleasure of her presence and his contemplation of it remained it seemed to him then that he would have had her stay thus for ever before his fixed eyes there floated a sort of mystic dream there was another worldwas it the world of sleep or of deathwhere they might join hands and dwell together in beautiful places and there was no one not even their consciences to say them nay the dust of earthly passion and sin and all the commonplace miseries of life had faded for ever from their knowledge it was their souls which had come together  and there was a wonderful peace  then she opened her eyes and looked up at him there was no more dreaming the old miserable passion flooded his heart and senses his feet were upon the earth again the whole world of those strange poignant sensations stronger because of their late coming welled up within him  berenice  she was only half awake and she held up her soft white arms to him gleaming like marble through the lace of her wide sleeves she looked up at him with the faint smile of a child  my love  he stooped down and her arms closed around him like a soft yoke but he kissed her forehead so lightly that she scarcely realized that this was almost his first caress  berenice you have been angry with me  she sat up and the lamplight fell upon his face  you have been ill she cried in a shocked tone  it is nothing i am well but tonighti had a shock i saw you withmr thorndyke  her eyes met his the hideous phantom which had been dogging his steps was slain he was ashamed of that awful but nameless fear  it is true mr thorndyke has offered me an apology which i am forced to believe sincere he has asked me to be his wife i was sorry for him  he is a bad man he has spoken ill of you he has already a wife  i am glad of it i can obey my instincts now and see him no more personally he is distasteful to me i had an idea he was honest it is nothing  she dismissed the subject with a wave of the hand to her it was altogether a minor matter then she looked at him  well  you never answered my letter  no there was no answer i came back  you did not let me know  you will find a message at your rooms when you get back  he walked up and down the room he knew at once that all he had done hitherto had been in vain the battle was still before him she sat and watched him with an inscrutable smile once as he passed her she laid her hand upon his arm he stopped at once  your white flower was born to die and to wither she said a nights frost would have killed it as surely as the lowland air it is like these violets she took a bunch from her bosom this morning they were fresh and beautiful now they are crushed and faded yet they have lived their life  she threw them down upon the floor  do you think a woman is like that she said softly you are very very ignorant she has a soul  he held out his hand  a soul to keep white and pure a soul to give backto god  again she smiled at him slowly and shook her dark head you are like a child in some things you have lived so long amongst the dry bones of scholarship that you have lost your touch upon humanity and of us women you knowso very little you have tried to understand us from books how foolish you must be my disciple and i will teach you  it is not teaching he cried it is temptation  she turned upon him with a gleam of passion in her eyes  temptation she cried there spoke the whole selfishness of the philosopher the dilettante in morals what is it that you fear it is the besmirchment of your own ideals your own little code framed and moulded with your own hands what do you know of sin or of purity you who have held yourself aloof from the world with a sort of delicate care as though you forsooth were too precious a thing to be soiled with the dust of human passion and human love that is where you are all wrong that is where you make your great mistake you have judged without experience you speak of a soul which may be stained with sin you have no more knowledge than the pharisees of old what constitutes sin love can never stain anything love that is constant and true and pure is above the marriage laws of men it is above your little selfconstructed ideals it is a thing of heaven and of god you wrote to me like a childand you are a child for until you have learnt what love is you are without understanding  suddenly her outstretched hands dropped to her side her voice became soft and low her dark eyes were dimmed  come to me and you shall know i will show you in what narrow paths you have been wandering i will show you how beautiful a womans love can make your life  if we can love and be pure he said hoarsely what is sin what is that  he was standing by the window and he pointed westwards with shaking finger the roar of piccadilly and regent street came faintly into the little room she understood him  you have a great deal to learn dear she whispered softly remember this first and before all love can sanctify everything  but they too loved in the beginning  she shook her head  that they never could have done love is eternal if it fades or dies then it never was love then it was sin  but those poor creatures how are they to tell between the true love and the false  she stamped her foot and a quiver of passion shook her frame  we are not talking about them we are talking about ourselves do you doubt your love or mine  i cannot he answered berenice  yes  did you ever tellyour husband that you loved him  never  did he love you  i believe so far as he knew how to love anythinghe did  and now  she waved her hand impatiently  he has forgotten he was shallow and he was fond of life he has found consolation long ago do not talk of him do not dare to speak of him again oh why do you make me humble myself so  he may not have forgotten he may have repented he may be longing for you nowand suffering should we be sinless then  she swept from her place and stood before him with flashing eyes  i forbid you to remind me of my shame i forbid you to remind me that i too like those poor women on the street have been bought and sold for money i have worked out my own emancipation i am free it was while i was living with him as his wife that i sinnedfor i hated him speak to me no more of that time if you cannot forget it you had better go  he stretched out his hands and held hers tightly  berenice if you were alone in the world and there was some great barrier to our marriage i would not hesitate any longer i would take you to myself dont think too hardly of me i am like a man who is denying himself heaven but your husband lives you belong to him you do not know whether he is in prosperity or whether he has forgotten you do not know whether he has repented or whether his life is still such as to justify your taking the law into your own hands and forsaking him for ever listen to me dear if you will find out these things if you can say to yourself and to me and to your conscience he has found happiness without me he has ignored and forgotten the tie between us he does not need my sympathy or my care or my companionship then i will have no more scruples only let us be sure that you are morally free from that man  she wrenched her hands away from his there was a bright red spot of colour flaring on her cheeks her eyes were on fire  you are mad she cried you do not love me no man can know what love is who talks about doubts and scruples like you do you are too cold and too selfish to realize what love can be and to think that i have stopped to reason to reason with you oh my god what have i done to be humbled like this  berenice  leave me dont come near me any more i shall thrust you out of my life you never loved me i could not have loved you go away it has been a hideous mistake  berenice  my god will you leave me she moaned you are driving me mad i hate you  her white hand flashed out into the darkness as though she would have struck him he bowed his head and went     chapter xvii   matravers knew after that night that his was a broken life any future such as he had planned for himself of active intellectual toil had now he felt become impossible his ideals were all broken down a woman had found her way in between the joints of an armour which he had grown to believe impenetrable and henceforth life was a wreck the old quiet stoicism which had been the inner stimulus of his career was a thing altogether overthrown and impotent he was too old to reconstruct life anew the fragments were too many and the wreck too complete only his philosophy showed him very plainly what the end must be across the sky of his vision it seemed to be written in letters of fire  early in the morning having made his toilette as usual with a care almost fastidious he went out into the sunlit streets moving like a man in a deep dream amongst scenes which had become familiar to him day by day at his lawyers he made his will and signed it thankful for once for his great loneliness insomuch as there was no one who could call the disposal of his property to a stranger an injusticefor he had left all to little freddy left it to him because of his mothers eyes as he thought with a faint smile then he called at his publishers and at the office of a leading review to which he was a regular contributor telling them to expect no more work from him for a while he was going abroad to take a longearned holiday he lunched at his club speaking in a more than usually friendly manner to the few men with whom at times he had found it a pleasure to associate and finally with that sense of unreality growing stronger and stronger he found himself once more in the park in his usual chair looking out with the same keen sympathy upon the intensely joyous beautiful phase of life which floated around him the afternoon breeze rustled pleasantly among the cool green leaves above his head and the sunlight slanted full across the shaded walk on every hand were genial voices cordial greetings and light farewells with a sense almost of awe he thought of the days when he had sat there waiting for her carriage that he might look for a few moments upon that palefaced woman whose influence over him seemed already to have commenced before even any words had passed between them he sat there gravely acknowledging the salutes of those with whom he was acquainted wearing always the same faint and impenetrable smilewonderful mask of a broken heart and still the memories came surging into his brain he thought of that grey morning when he had sat there alone oppressed by some dim premonitions of the tragedy amongst whose shadows he was already passing so that even the wind which had followed the dawn and shaken the raindrops down upon him had seemed to carry upon its bosom wailing cries and sad human voices as the slow moments passed along he found himself watching for her carriage with some remnant of the old wistfulness but it never came and for that he was thankful  at last he rose and walked leisurely back to his rooms he gave orders to his servant to pack all his things for a journey then for the last time he stood up in the midst of his possessions looking around him with a vague sorrowfulness at the little familiar objects which had become dear to him both by association and by reason of a certain sense of companionship which he had always been able to feel for beautiful things however inanimate it was here that he had come when he had first left oxford full of certain definite ambitions and with a mind fixed at least upon living a serene and wellordered life he had woven many dreams within these four walls how far away those days now seemed to be from him he would never dream any more for him the worlds great dream was very close at hand  he poured himself out a glass of wine from a quaintly cut decanter and set it down on his writingdesk emptying into it with scrupulous care the contents of a little packet which he had been carrying all day in his waistcoat pocket he paused for a moment before taking up his pen to move a little on one side the deep blue china bowl of flowers which summer and winter alike stood always fresh upon his writingtable today it chanced by some irony of fate that they were roses and a swift flood of memories rushed into his tingling senses as the perfume of the creamy blossoms floated up to him  he set his teeth and taking out some paper began to write       berenice farewell tonight i am going on a very long      journey to a very far land you and i may never meet again      and so farewell farewell to you berenice whom i have      loved and whom i dearly love you are the only woman who      has ever wandered into my little life to teach me the great      depths of human passionand you came too late but that was      not your fault       for what i am doing do you at least not blame me if      there were a single person in the world dependent upon me      or to whom my death would be a real loss i would remain      but there is no one and whereas alive i can do you no      good dead i may berenice your husband livesin suffering      and in poverty your husband and your little boy freddy has      looked at me out of your dark eyes my love and whilst i      live i can never forget it i hold his little hands and i      look into his pure childish face and the great love which      i bear for his mother seems like an unholy thing leave your      husband out of the questionput every other consideration      on one side freddys eyes must have kept us apart for ever       and dear it is your boys future and the care of your      stricken husband which must bring you into closer and more      intimate touch with the vast world of human sorrows love      is a sacrifice and life is a sacrifice i know and that      knowledge is the comfort of my last sad night on earth      that you will find your rightful place amongst her toiling      daughters and it is because there is no fitting place for      me by your side that i am very well content to die for      myself i have well counted the cost death is an infinite      compulsion our little lives are but the veriest trifle in      the scale of eternity whether we go into everlasting sleep      or into some other mystic state a few short years here more      or less are no great matter berenice  again there came that curious pain at his heartstrings and the singing in his ears the pen slipped from his fingers his head drooped  berenice he whispered berenice                                       and as though by a miracle she heard him for she was close at hand whilst he had been writing the door was softly opened and closed a tall greymantled figure stood upon the threshold it was berenice  may i come in she cried softly her face was flushed and her cheeks were wet but a smile was quivering upon her lips  he did not answer she came into the room close to his side her fingers clasped the hand which was hanging over the side of his chair the lamp had burnt very low she could scarcely see his face  dear i have come to you she murmured i am sorry i want you to forgive me i do love you you know that i love you  the pressure of her fingers upon his hand was surely returned she stood up and her cloak slipped from her shoulders on to the floor  why dont you speak to me dont you hear dont you understand i have come to you i will not be sent away it is too late my carriage brought me here i have told my people that i shall not be returning come away with me tonight let us start now listen it is too late to draw back every one knows that i have come to you we shall be so happy tell me that you are glad  there was no answer he did not move she came close to him so that her cheek almost touched his  tell me that you are glad she begged dont argue with me any more if you do i shall stop your mouth with kisses i am not like you dear i must have love i cannot live alone any longer i have touched the utmost limits of my endurance i will stay with you you shall love me listen if you do not i swearbut no you will save me from that oh i know that you will but dont argue with me words are so cold and i am a womanand i must love and be loved or i shall die ah  she started round with a little scream her eyes frightened and dilated were fixed upon the door on the threshold a little boy was standing in his nightshirt looking at her with dark inquiring eyes  i want mr matravers if you please he said deliberately will you tell him he dont know that im here yet he will be so surprised charlie dunlopthats where i livehas the fever and dad sent me here with a letter but mr matravers was out when we came and nurse put me to bed now shes gone away and im so lonely is he asleep please wake him and tell him  she turned up the lamp without moving her eyes from the little whiteclad figure a great trembling was upon her it was like a voice from the shadows of another world and matravers why did he not speak  slowly the lamp burned up she leaned forward he was sitting with his head resting upon his hand and the old faint smile parting his lips but he did not look up he did not speak to her he was sitting like a carved image  for gods sake speak to me she cried  then a certain rigidity in his posture struck her for the first time and she threw herself on the ground beside him with a cry of fear she pressed her lips to his chafed his cold hand and whispered frantically in his ear but there was no answerthere never could be any answer matravers was dead and the wineglass at his side was untasted  illustration but there was no answerthere never could be any answer                                       berenice did not faint she did not even lose consciousness for a moment moaning softly to herself but dryeyed she leaned over his shoulder and read the words which he had written to her of which indeed the ink was scarcely dry when she had finished she took up the wineglass in her own fingers holding it so steadily that not a drop was spilt  here was the panacea she craved the problem of her troubled life was so easily to be solved rest with the man she loved  her arms would fold around him as she sank to the ground perhaps he was already waiting for her somewherein one of those mystic worlds where the soul might shake itself free from this weary burden of human passions and sorrows her lips parted in a wonderful smile she raised the glass  there was a soft patter across the carpet and a gentle tug at her dress  i am very cold freddy cried piteously holding out a little blue foot from underneath his nightshirt if you dont want to wake mr matravers will you take me up to bed please  through a mist of sudden tears she looked down into her boys face she drew a deep quick breathher fingers were suddenly nerveless there was a great dull stain on the front of her dress the wineglass shattered into many pieces lay at her feet she fell on her knees and with a little burst of passionate sobs took him into her arms

summons a querulous little cry reached her from the bath chair drawn up on the promenade she waved her hand cheerfully  i am coming she cried wait for me  but her face was turned towards that dim grey line of silvery light and the wind caught hold of her words and carried them away over the bosom of the seaupwards                                the end     e phillips oppenheims novels  illustrated
