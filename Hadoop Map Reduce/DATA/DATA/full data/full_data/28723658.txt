28723658	phantasmagoria and other poems     phantasmagoria    canto ithe trystyng    one winter night at halfpast nine cold tired and cross and muddy i had come home too late to dine and supper with cigars and wine was waiting in the study  there was a strangeness in the room and something white and wavy was standing near me in the gloom  i took it for the carpetbroom left by that careless slavey  but presently the thing began to shiver and to sneeze on which i said come come my man thats a most inconsiderate plan less noise there if you please  ive caught a cold the thing replies out there upon the landing i turned to look in some surprise and there before my very eyes a little ghost was standing  he trembled when he caught my eye and got behind a chair how came you here i said and why i never saw a thing so shy come out  dont shiver there  he said id gladly tell you how and also tell you why but here he gave a little bow youre in so bad a temper now youd think it all a lie  and as to being in a fright allow me to remark that ghosts have just as good a right in every way to fear the light as men to fear the dark  no plea said i can well excuse such cowardice in you for ghosts can visit when they choose whereas we humans cant refuse to grant the interview  he said a flutter of alarm is not unnatural is it i really feared you meant some harm but now i see that you are calm let me explain my visit  houses are classed i beg to state according to the number of ghosts that they accommodate the tenant merely counts as weight with coals and other lumber  this is a oneghost house and you when you arrived last summer may have remarked a spectre who was doing all that ghosts can do to welcome the newcomer  in villas this is always done  however cheaply rented for though of course theres less of fun when there is only room for one ghosts have to be contented  that spectre left you on the third  since then youve not been haunted for as he never sent us word twas quite by accident we heard that any one was wanted  a spectre has first choice by right in filling up a vacancy then phantom goblin elf and sprite  if all these fail them they invite the nicest ghoul that they can see  the spectres said the place was low and that you kept bad wine so as a phantom had to go and i was first of course you know i couldnt well decline  no doubt said i they settled who was fittest to be sent yet still to choose a brat like you to haunt a man of fortytwo was no great compliment  im not so young sir he replied as you might think  the fact is in caverns by the waterside and other places that ive tried ive had a lot of practice  but i have never taken yet a strict domestic part and in my flurry i forget the five good rules of etiquette we have to know by heart  my sympathies were warming fast towards the little fellow he was so utterly aghast at having found a man at last and looked so scared and yellow  at least i said im glad to find a ghost is not a dumb thing but pray sit down  youll feel inclined if like myself you have not dined to take a snack of something  though certainly you dont appear a thing to offer food to and then i shall be glad to hear  if you will say them loud and clear  the rules that you allude to  thanks  you shall hear them by and by this is a piece of luck what may i offer you said i well since you are so kind ill try a little bit of duck  one slice  and may i ask you for another drop of gravy i sat and looked at him in awe for certainly i never saw a thing so white and wavy  and still he seemed to grow more white more vapoury and wavier  seen in the dim and flickering light as he proceeded to recite his maxims of behaviour    canto iihys fyve rules    my firstbut dont suppose he said im setting you a riddle  isif your victim be in bed dont touch the curtains at his head but take them in the middle  and wave them slowly in and out while drawing them asunder and in a minutes time no doubt hell raise his head and look about with eyes of wrath and wonder  and here you must on no pretence make the first observation wait for the victim to commence no ghost of any common sense begins a conversation  if he should say how came you here the way that you began sir in such a case your course is clear  on the bats back my little dear is the appropriate answer  if after this he says no more youd best perhaps curtail your exertionsgo and shake the door and then if he begins to snore youll know the things a failure  by day if he should be alone  at home or on a walk  you merely give a hollow groan to indicate the kind of tone in which you mean to talk  but if you find him with his friends the thing is rather harder in such a case success depends on picking up some candleends or butter in the larder  with this you make a kind of slide it answers best with suet on which you must contrive to glide and swing yourself from side to side  one soon learns how to do it  the second tells us what is right in ceremonious calls first burn a blue or crimson light a thing i quite forgot tonight then scratch the door or walls  i said youll visit here no more if you attempt the guy ill have no bonfires on my floor  and as for scratching at the door id like to see you try  the third was written to protect the interests of the victim and tells us as i recollect to treat him with a grave respect and not to contradict him  thats plain said i as tare and tret to any comprehension i only wish some ghosts ive met would not so constantly forget the maxim that you mention  perhaps he said you first transgressed the laws of hospitality all ghosts instinctively detest the man that fails to treat his guest with proper cordiality  if you address a ghost as thing or strike him with a hatchet he is permitted by the king to drop all formal parleying  and then youre sure to catch it  the fourth prohibits trespassing where other ghosts are quartered and those convicted of the thing unless when pardoned by the king must instantly be slaughtered  that simply means be cut up small ghosts soon unite anew the process scarcely hurts at all  not more than when youre what you call cut up by a review  the fifth is one you may prefer that i should quote entire the king must be addressed as sir this from a simple courtier is all the laws require  but should you wish to do the thing with outandout politeness accost him as my goblin king and always use in answering the phrase your royal whiteness  im getting rather hoarse i fear after so much reciting  so if you dont object my dear well try a glass of bitter beer  i think it looks inviting    canto iiiscarmoges    and did you really walk said i on such a wretched night i always fancied ghosts could fly  if not exactly in the sky yet at a fairish height  its very well said he for kings to soar above the earth but phantoms often find that wings  like many other pleasant things  cost more than they are worth  spectres of course are rich and so can buy them from the elves but we prefer to keep below  theyre stupid company you know for any but themselves  for though they claim to be exempt from pride they treat a phantom as something quite beneath contempt  just as no turkey ever dreamt of noticing a bantam  they seem too proud said i to go to houses such as mine pray how did they contrive to know so quickly that the place was low and that i kept bad wine  inspector kobold came to you the little ghost began here i broke ininspector who inspecting ghosts is something new explain yourself my man  his name is kobold said my guest one of the spectre order youll very often see him dressed in a yellow gown a crimson vest and a nightcap with a border  he tried the brocken business first but caught a sort of chill  so came to england to be nursed and here it took the form of thirst which he complains of still  portwine he says when rich and sound warms his old bones like nectar and as the inns where it is found are his especial huntingground we call him the innspectre  i bore itbore it like a man  this agonizing witticism and nothing could be sweeter than my temper till the ghost began some most provoking criticism  cooks need not be indulged in waste yet still youd better teach them dishes should have some sort of taste pray why are all the cruets placed where nobody can reach them  that man of yours will never earn his living as a waiter is that queer thing supposed to burn its far too dismal a concern to call a moderator  the duck was tender but the peas were very much too old and just remember if you please the next time you have toasted cheese dont let them send it cold  youd find the bread improved i think by getting better flour and have you anything to drink that looks a little less like ink and isnt quite so sour  then peering round with curious eyes he muttered goodness gracious and so went on to criticise  your rooms an inconvenient size its neither snug nor spacious  that narrow window i expect serves but to let the dusk in but please said i to recollect twas fashioned by an architect who pinned his faith on ruskin  i dont care who he was sir or on whom he pinned his faith constructed by whatever law so poor a job i never saw as im a living wraith  what a remarkable cigar how much are they a dozen i growled no matter what they are youre getting as familiar as if you were my cousin  now thats a thing i will not stand and so i tell you flat aha said he were getting grand taking a bottle in his hand ill soon arrange for that  and here he took a careful aim and gaily cried here goes i tried to dodge it as it came but somehow caught it all the same exactly on my nose  and i remember nothing more that i can clearly fix till i was sitting on the floor repeating two and five are four but five and two are six  what really passed i never learned nor guessed  i only know that when at last my sense returned the lamp neglected dimly burned  the fire was getting low   through driving mists i seemed to see a thing that smirked and smiled and found that he was giving me a lesson in biography as if i were a child    canto ivhys nouryture    oh when i was a little ghost a merry time had we each seated on his favourite post we chumped and chawed the buttered toast they gave us for our tea  that story is in print i cried dont say its not because its known as well as bradshaws guide the ghost uneasily replied he hardly thought it was  its not in nursery rhymes  and yet i almost think it is  three little ghosteses were set on posteses you know and ate their buttered toasteses  i have the book so if you doubt it i turned to search the shelf dont stir he cried  well do without it i now remember all about it i wrote the thing myself  it came out in a monthly or at least my agent said it did some literary swell who saw it thought it seemed adapted for the magazine he edited  my father was a brownie sir my mother was a fairy the notion had occurred to her the children would be happier if they were taught to vary  the notion soon became a craze and when it once began she brought us all out in different ways  one was a pixy two were fays another was a banshee  the fetch and kelpie went to school and gave a lot of trouble next came a poltergeist and ghoul and then two trolls which broke the rule a goblin and a double   if thats a snuffbox on the shelf he added with a yawn ill take a pinchnext came an elf and then a phantom thats myself and last a leprechaun  one day some spectres chanced to call dressed in the usual white i stood and watched them in the hall and couldnt make them out at all they seemed so strange a sight  i wondered what on earth they were that looked all head and sack but mother told me not to stare and then she twitched me by the hair and punched me in the back  since then ive often wished that i had been a spectre born but whats the use  he heaved a sigh they are the ghostnobility and look on us with scorn  my phantomlife was soon begun when i was barely six i went out with an older one  and just at first i thought it fun and learned a lot of tricks  ive haunted dungeons castles towers  wherever i was sent ive often sat and howled for hours drenched to the skin with driving showers upon a battlement  its quite oldfashioned now to groan when you begin to speak this is the newest thing in tone and here it chilled me to the bone he gave an awful squeak  perhaps he added to your ear that sounds an easy thing try it yourself my little dear it took me something like a year with constant practising  and when youve learned to squeak my man and caught the double sob youre pretty much where you began just try and gibber if you can thats something like a job  ive tried it and can only say im sure you couldnt do it e ven if you practised night and day unless you have a turn that way and natural ingenuity  shakspeare i think it is who treats of ghosts in days of old who gibbered in the roman streets dressed if you recollect in sheets  they must have found it cold  ive often spent ten pounds on stuff in dressing as a double but though it answers as a puff it never has effect enough to make it worth the trouble  long bills soon quenched the little thirst i had for being funny the settingup is always worst such heaps of things you want at first one must be made of money  for instance take a haunted tower with skull crossbones and sheet blue lights to burn say two an hour condensing lens of extra power and set of chains complete  what with the things you have to hire  the fitting on the robe  and testing all the coloured fire  the outfit of itself would tire the patience of a job  and then theyre so fastidious the hauntedhouse committee ive often known them make a fuss because a ghost was french or russ or even from the city  some dialects are objected to  for one the irish brogue is and then for all you have to do one pound a week they offer you and find yourself in bogies    canto vbyckerment    dont they consult the victims though i said  they should by rights give them a chancebecause you know the tastes of people differ so especially in sprites  the phantom shook his head and smiled consult them  not a bit twould be a job to drive one wild to satisfy one single child  thered be no end to it  of course you cant leave children free said i to pick and choose but in the case of men like me i think mine host might fairly be allowed to state his views  he said it really wouldnt pay  folk are so full of fancies we visit for a single day and whether then we go or stay depends on circumstances  and though we dont consult mine host before the things arranged still if he often quits his post or is not a wellmannered ghost then you can have him changed  but if the hosts a man like you  i mean a man of sense and if the house is not too new why what has that said i to do with ghosts convenience  a new house does not suit you know  its such a job to trim it but after twenty years or so the wainscotings begin to go so twenty is the limit  to trim was not a phrase i could remember having heard perhaps i said youll be so good as tell me what is understood exactly by that word  it means the loosening all the doors the ghost replied and laughed it means the drilling holes by scores in all the skirtingboards and floors to make a thorough draught  youll sometimes find that one or two are all you really need to let the wind come whistling through  but here therell be a lot to do i faintly gasped indeed  if id been rather later ill be bound i added trying most unsuccessfully to smile youd have been busy all this while trimming and beautifying  why no said he perhaps i should have stayed another minute  but still no ghost thats any good without an introduction would have ventured to begin it  the proper thing as you were late was certainly to go but with the roads in such a state i got the knightmayors leave to wait for half an hour or so  whos the knightmayor i cried  instead of answering my question well if you dont know that he said either you never go to bed or youve a grand digestion  he goes about and sits on folk that eat too much at night his duties are to pinch and poke and squeeze them till they nearly choke i said it serves them right  and folk who sup on things like these he muttered eggs and bacon  lobsterand duckand toasted cheese  if they dont get an awful squeeze im very much mistaken  he is immensely fat and so well suits the occupation in point of fact if you must know we used to call him years ago the mayor and corporation  the day he was elected mayor i know that every sprite meant to vote for me but did not dare  he was so frantic with despair and furious with excitement  when it was over for a whim he ran to tell the king and being the reverse of slim a twomile trot was not for him a very easy thing  so to reward him for his run as it was baking hot and he was over twenty stone the king proceeded half in fun to knight him on the spot  twas a great liberty to take i fired up like a rocket he did it just for punnings sake the man says johnson that would make a pun would pick a pocket  a man said he is not a king i argued for a while and did my best to prove the thing  the phantom merely listening with a contemptuous smile  at last when breath and patience spent i had recourse to smoking  your aim he said is excellent butwhen you call it argument  of course youre only joking  stung by his cold and snaky eye i roused myself at length to say at least i do defy the veriest sceptic to deny that union is strength  thats true enough said he yet stay i listened in all meekness  union is strength im bound to say in fact the things as clear as day but onions are a weakness    canto vidyscomfyture    as one who strives a hill to climb who never climbed before who finds it in a little time grow every moment less sublime and votes the thing a bore  yet having once begun to try dares not desert his quest but climbing ever keeps his eye on one small hut against the sky wherein he hopes to rest  who climbs till nerve and force are spent with many a puff and pant who still as rises the ascent in language grows more violent although in breath more scant  who climbing gains at length the place that crowns the upward track and entering with unsteady pace receives a buffet in the face that lands him on his back  and feels himself like one in sleep glide swiftly down again a helpless weight from steep to steep till with a headlong giddy sweep he drops upon the plain   so i that had resolved to bring conviction to a ghost and found it quite a different thing from any human arguing yet dared not quit my post  but keeping still the end in view to which i hoped to come i strove to prove the matter true by putting everything i knew into an axiom  commencing every single phrase with therefore or because i blindly reeled a hundred ways about the syllogistic maze unconscious where i was  quoth he thats regular claptrap dont bluster any more now do be cool and take a nap such a ridiculous old chap was never seen before  youre like a man i used to meet who got one day so furious in arguing the simple heat scorched both his slippers off his feet i said thats very curious  well it is curious i agree and sounds perhaps like fibs but still its true as true can be  as sure as your names tibbs said he i said my names not tibbs  not tibbs he criedhis tone became a shade or two less hearty  why no said i  my proper name is tibbets  tibbets  aye the same why then youre not the party  with that he struck the board a blow that shivered half the glasses why couldnt you have told me so three quarters of an hour ago you prince of all the asses  to walk four miles through mud and rain to spend the night in smoking and then to find that its in vain  and ive to do it all again  its really too provoking  dont talk he cried as i began to mutter some excuse who can have patience with a man thats got no more discretion than an idiotic goose  to keep me waiting here instead of telling me at once that this was not the house he said there thatll dobe off to bed dont gape like that you dunce  its very fine to throw the blame on me in such a fashion why didnt you enquire my name the very minute that you came i answered in a passion  of course it worries you a bit to come so far on foot  but how was i to blame for it well well said he  i must admit that isnt badly put  and certainly youve given me the best of wine and victual  excuse my violence said he but accidents like this you see they put one out a little  twas my fault after all i find  shake hands old turniptop the name was hardly to my mind but as no doubt he meant it kind i let the matter drop  goodnight old turniptop goodnight when i am gone perhaps theyll send you some inferior sprite wholl keep you in a constant fright and spoil your soundest naps  tell him youll stand no sort of trick then if he leers and chuckles you just be handy with a stick mind that its pretty hard and thick and rap him on the knuckles  then carelessly remark old coon perhaps youre not aware that if you dont behave youll soon be chuckling to another tune  and so youd best take care  thats the right way to cure a sprite of such like goingson  but gracious me  its getting light goodnight old turniptop goodnight a nod and he was gone    canto viisad souvenaunce    whats this i pondered  have i slept or can i have been drinking but soon a gentler feeling crept upon me and i sat and wept an hour or so like winking  no need for bones to hurry so i sobbed  in fact i doubt if it was worth his while to go  and who is tibbs id like to know to make such work about  if tibbs is anything like me its possible i said he wont be overpleased to be dropped in upon at halfpast three after hes snug in bed  and if bones plagues him anyhow  squeaking and all the rest of it as he was doing here just now  i prophesy therell be a row and tibbs will have the best of it  then as my tears could never bring the friendly phantom back it seemed to me the proper thing to mix another glass and sing the following coronach  and art thou gone beloved ghost best of familiars nay then farewell my duckling roast farewell farewell my tea and toast my meerschaum and cigars  the hues of life are dull and gray the sweets of life insipid when thou my charmer art away  old brick or rather let me say old parallelepiped  instead of singing verse the third i ceasedabruptly rather but after such a splendid word i felt that it would be absurd to try it any farther  so with a yawn i went my way to seek the welcome downy and slept and dreamed till break of day of poltergeist and fetch and fay and leprechaun and brownie  for year ive not been visited by any kind of sprite yet still they echo in my head those parting words so kindly said old turniptop goodnight    echoes    lady clara vere de vere was eight years old she said every ringlet lightly shaken ran itself in golden thread  she took her little porringer of me she shall not win renown for the baseness of its nature shall have strength to drag her down  sisters and brothers little maid there stands the inspector at thy door like a dog he hunts for boys who know not two and two are four  kind words are more than coronets she said and wondering looked at me it is the dead unhappy night and i must hurry home to tea    a sea dirge    there are certain thingsas a spider a ghost the incometax gout an umbrella for three  that i hate but the thing that i hate the most is a thing they call the sea  pour some salt water over the floor  ugly im sure youll allow it to be suppose it extended a mile or more thats very like the sea  beat a dog till it howls outright  cruel but all very well for a spree suppose that he did so day and night that would be like the sea  i had a vision of nurserymaids tens of thousands passed by me  all leading children with wooden spades and this was by the sea  who invented those spades of wood who was it cut them out of the tree none i think but an idiot could  or one that loved the sea  it is pleasant and dreamy no doubt to float with thoughts as boundless and souls as free but suppose you are very unwell in the boat how do you like the sea  there is an insect that people avoid whence is derived the verb to flee where have you been by it most annoyed in lodgings by the sea  if you like your coffee with sand for dregs a decided hint of salt in your tea and a fishy taste in the very eggs  by all means choose the sea  and if with these dainties to drink and eat you prefer not a vestige of grass or tree and a chronic state of wet in your feet theni recommend the sea  for i have friends who dwell by the coast  pleasant friends they are to me it is when i am with them i wonder most that anyone likes the sea  they take me a walk  though tired and stiff to climb the heights i madly agree and after a tumble or so from the cliff they kindly suggest the sea  i try the rocks and i think it cool that they laugh with such an excess of glee as i heavily slip into every pool that skirts the cold cold sea    ye carpette knyghte    i

special merit for this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy  any fairly practised writer with the slightest ear for rhythm could compose for hours together in the easy running metre of the song of hiawatha  having then distinctly stated that i challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle i must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject   from his shoulder hiawatha took the camera of rosewood made of sliding folding rosewood neatly put it all together in its case it lay compactly folded into nearly nothing  but he opened out the hinges pushed and pulled the joints and hinges till it looked all squares and oblongs like a complicated figure in the second book of euclid  this he perched upon a tripod  crouched beneath its dusky cover  stretched his hand enforcing silence  said be motionless i beg you mystic awful was the process  all the family in order sat before him for their pictures each in turn as he was taken volunteered his own suggestions his ingenious suggestions  first the governor the father he suggested velvet curtains looped about a massy pillar and the corner of a table of a rosewood diningtable he would hold a scroll of something hold it firmly in his lefthand he would keep his righthand buried like napoleon in his waistcoat he would contemplate the distance with a look of pensive meaning as of ducks that die ill tempests  grand heroic was the notion yet the picture failed entirely failed because he moved a little moved because he couldnt help it  next his better half took courage she would have her picture taken she came dressed beyond description dressed in jewels and in satin far too gorgeous for an empress gracefully she sat down sideways with a simper scarcely human holding in her hand a bouquet rather larger than a cabbage all the while that she was sitting still the lady chattered chattered like a monkey in the forest am i sitting still she asked him is my face enough in profile shall i hold the bouquet higher will it came into the picture and the picture failed completely  next the son the stunningcantab he suggested curves of beauty curves pervading all his figure which the eye might follow onward till they centered in the breastpin centered in the golden breastpin he had learnt it all from ruskin author of the stones of venice seven lamps of architecture modern painters and some others and perhaps he had not fully understood his authors meaning but whatever was the reason all was fruitless as the picture ended in an utter failure  next to him the eldest daughter she suggested very little only asked if he would take her with her look of passive beauty  her idea of passive beauty was a squinting of the lefteye was a drooping of the righteye was a smile that went up sideways to the corner of the nostrils  hiawatha when she asked him took no notice of the question looked as if he hadnt heard it but when pointedly appealed to smiled in his peculiar manner coughed and said it didnt matter bit his lip and changed the subject  nor in this was he mistaken as the picture failed completely  so in turn the other sisters  last the youngest son was taken very rough and thick his hair was very round and red his face was very dusty was his jacket very fidgety his manner and his overbearing sisters called him names he disapproved of called him johnny daddys darling called him jacky scrubby schoolboy and so awful was the picture in comparison the others seemed to ones bewildered fancy to have partially succeeded  finally my hiawatha tumbled all the tribe together grouped is not the right expression and as happy chance would have it did at last obtain a picture where the faces all succeeded each came out a perfect likeness  then they joined and all abused it unrestrainedly abused it as the worst and ugliest picture they could possibly have dreamed of giving one such strange expressions  sullen stupid pert expressions really any one would take us any one that did not know us for the most unpleasant people hiawatha seemed to think so seemed to think it not unlikely all together rang their voices angry loud discordant voices as of dogs that howl in concert as of cats that wail in chorus  but my hiawathas patience his politeness and his patience unaccountably had vanished and he left that happy party neither did he leave them slowly with the calm deliberation the intense deliberation of a photographic artist but he left them in a hurry left them in a mighty hurry stating that he would not stand it stating in emphatic language what hed be before hed stand it hurriedly he packed his boxes hurriedly the porter trundled on a barrow all his boxes hurriedly he took his ticket hurriedly the train received him thus departed hiawatha    melancholetta    with saddest music all day long she soothed her secret sorrow at night she sighed i fear twas wrong such cheerful words to borrow dearest a sweeter sadder song ill sing to thee tomorrow  i thanked her but i could not say that i was glad to hear it i left the house at break of day and did not venture near it till time i hoped had worn away her grief for nought could cheer it  my dismal sister  couldst thou know the wretched home thou keepest thy brother drowned in daily woe is thankful when thou sleepest for if i laugh however low when thourt awake thou weepest  i took my sister tother day excuse the slang expression to sadlers wells to see the play in hopes the new impression might in her thoughts from grave to gay effect some slight digression  i asked three gay young dogs from town to join us in our folly whose mirth i thought might serve to drown my sisters melancholy the lively jones the sportive brown and robinson the jolly  the maid announced the meal in tones that i myself had taught her meant to allay my sisters moans like oil on troubled water i rushed to jones the lively jones and begged him to escort her  vainly he strove with ready wit to joke about the weather  to ventilate the last on dit  to quote the price of leather  she groaned here i and sorrow sit let us lament together  i urged youre wasting time you know delay will spoil the venison my heart is wasted with my woe there is no restin venice on the bridge of sighs she quoted low from byron and from tennyson  i need not tell of soup and fish in solemn silence swallowed the sobs that ushered in each dish and its departure followed nor yet my suicidal wish to be the cheese i hollowed  some desperate attempts were made to start a conversation madam the sportive brown essayed which kind of recreation hunting or fishing have you made your special occupation  her lips curved downwards instantly as if of indiarubber hounds in full cry i like said she oh how i longed to snub her of fish a whales the one for me it is so full of blubber  the nights performance was king john its dull she wept and soso awhile i let her tears flow on she said they soothed her woe so at length the curtain rose upon bombastes furioso  in vain we roared in vain we tried to rouse her into laughter her pensive glances wandered wide from orchestra to rafter  tier upon tier she said and sighed and silence followed after    a valentine    sent to a friend who had complained that i was glad enough to see him when he came but didnt seem to miss him if he stayed away   and cannot pleasures while they last be actual unless when past they leave us shuddering and aghast with anguish smarting and cannot friends be firm and fast and yet bear parting  and must i then at friendships call calmly resign the little all trifling i grant it is and small i have of gladness and lend my being to the thrall of gloom and sadness  and think you that i should be dumb and full dolorum omnium excepting when you choose to come and share my dinner at other times be sour and glum and daily thinner  must he then only live to weep whod prove his friendship true and deep by day a lonely shadow creep at nighttime languish oft raising in his broken sleep the moan of anguish  the lover if for certain days his fair one be denied his gaze sinks not in grief and wild amaze but wiser wooer he spends the time in writing lays and posts them to her  and if the verse flow free and fast till even the poet is aghast a touching valentine at last the post shall carry when thirteen days are gone and past of february  farewell dear friend and when we meet in desert waste or crowded street perhaps before this week shall fleet perhaps tomorrow i trust to find your heart the seat of wasting sorrow    the three voices    the first voice   he trilled a carol fresh and free he laughed aloud for very glee there came a breeze from off the sea  it passed athwart the glooming flat  it fanned his forehead as he sat  it lightly bore away his hat  all to the feet of one who stood like maid enchanted in a wood frowning as darkly as she could  with huge umbrella lank and brown unerringly she pinned it down right through the centre of the crown  then with an aspect cold and grim regardless of its battered rim she took it up and gave it him  a while like one in dreams he stood then faltered forth his gratitude in words just short of being rude  for it had lost its shape and shine and it had cost him fourandnine and he was going out to dine  to dine she sneered in acid tone to bend thy being to a bone clothed in a radiance not its own  the teardrop trickled to his chin there was a meaning in her grin that made him feel on fire within  term it not radiance said he tis solid nutriment to me dinner is dinner  tea is tea  and she yea so  yet wherefore cease let thy scant knowledge find increase say men are men and geese are geese  he moaned  he knew not what to say the thought that i could get away strove with the thought but i must stay  to dine she shrieked in dragonwrath to swallow wines all foam and froth to simper at a tablecloth  say can thy noble spirit stoop to join the gormandising troup who find a solace in the soup  canst thou desire or pie or puff thy wellbred manners were enough without such gross material stuff  yet wellbred men he faintly said are not willing to be fed nor are they well without the bread  her visage scorched him ere she spoke there are she said a kind of folk who have no horror of a joke  such wretches live  they take their share of common earth and common air we come across them here and there  we grant themthere is no escape  a sort of semihuman shape suggestive of the manlike ape  in all such theories said he one fixed exception there must be that is the present company  baffled she gave a wolfish bark he aiming blindly in the dark with random shaft had pierced the mark  she felt that her defeat was plain yet madly strove with might and main to get the upper hand again  fixing her eyes upon the beach as though unconscious of his speech she said each gives to more than each  he could not answer yea or nay he faltered gifts may pass away yet knew not what he meant to say  if that be so she straight replied each heart with each doth coincide what boots it  for the world is wide  the world is but a thought said he the vast unfathomable sea is but a notionunto me  and darkly fell her answer dread upon his unresisting head like half a hundredweight of lead  the good and great must ever shun that reckless and abandoned one who stoops to perpetrate a pun  the man that smokesthat reads the times  that goes to christmas pantomimes  is capable of any crimes  he felt it was his turn to speak and with a shamed and crimson cheek moaned this is harder than bezique  but when she asked him wherefore so he felt his very whiskers glow and frankly owned i do not know  while like broad waves of golden grain or sunlit hues on cloistered pane his colour came and went again  pitying his obvious distress yet with a tinge of bitterness she said the more exceeds the less  a truth of such undoubted weight he urged and so extreme in date it were superfluous to state  roused into sudden passion she in tone of cold malignity to others yea  but not to thee  but when she saw him quail and quake and when he urged for pitys sake once more in gentle tones she spake  thought in the mind doth still abide that is by intellect supplied and within that idea doth hide  and he that yearns the truth to know still further inwardly may go and find idea from notion flow  and thus the chain that sages sought is to a glorious circle wrought for notion hath its source in thought  so passed they on with even pace yet gradually one might trace a shadow growing on his face   the second voice   they walked beside the waveworn beach her tongue was very apt to teach and now and then he did beseech  she would abate her dulcet tone because the talk was all her own and he was dull as any drone  she urged no cheese is made of chalk and ceaseless flowed her dreary talk tuned to the footfall of a walk  her voice was very full and rich and when at length she asked him which it mounted to its highest pitch  he a bewildered answer gave drowned in the sullen moaning wave lost in the echoes of the cave  he answered her he knew not what like shaft from bow at random shot he spoke but she regarded not  she waited not for his reply but with a downward leaden eye went on as if he were not by  sound argument and grave defence strange questions raised on why and whence and wildly tangled evidence  when he with racked and whirling brain feebly implored her to explain she simply said it all again  wrenched with an agony intense he spake neglecting sound and sense and careless of all consequence  mindi believeis essenceent  abstractthat isan accident  which wethat is to sayi meant  when with quick breath and cheeks all flushed at length his speech was somewhat hushed she looked at him and he was crushed  it needed not her calm reply she fixed him with a stony eye and he could neither fight nor fly  while she dissected word by word his speech half guessed at and half heard as might a cat a little bird  then having wholly overthrown his views and stripped them to the bone proceeded to unfold her own  shall man be man  and shall he miss of other thoughts no thought but this harmonious dews of sober bliss  what boots it  shall his fevered eye through towering nothingness descry the grisly phantom hurry by  and hear dumb shrieks that fill the air see mouths that gape and eyes that stare and redden in the dusky glare  the meadows breathing amber light the darkness toppling from the height the feathery train of granite night  shall he grown gray among his peers through the thick curtain of his tears catch glimpses of his earlier years  and hear the sounds he knew of yore old shufflings on the sanded floor old knuckles tapping at the door  yet still before him as he flies one pallid form shall ever rise and bodying forth in glassy eyes  the vision of a vanished good low peering through the tangled wood shall freeze the current of his blood  still from each fact with skill uncouth and savage rapture like a tooth she wrenched some slow reluctant truth  till like a silent watermill when summer suns have dried the rill she reached a full stop and was still  dead calm succeeded to the fuss as when the loaded omnibus has reached the railway terminus  when for the tumult of the street is heard the engines stifled beat the velvet tread of porters feet  with glance that ever sought the ground she moved her lips without a sound and every now and then she frowned  he gazed upon the sleeping sea and joyed in its tranquillity and in that silence dead but she  to muse a little space did seem then like the echo of a dream harked back upon her threadbare theme  still an attentive ear he lent but could not fathom what she meant she was not deep nor eloquent  he marked the ripple on the sand the even swaying of her hand was all that he could understand  he saw in dreams a drawingroom where thirteen wretches sat in gloom waitinghe thought he knew for whom  he saw them drooping here and there each feebly huddled on a chair in attitudes of blank despair  oysters were not more mute than they for all their brains were pumped away and they had nothing more to say   save one who groaned three hours are gone who shrieked well wait no longer john tell them to set the dinner on  the vision passed  the ghosts were fled he saw once more that woman dread he heard once more the words she said  he left her and he turned aside he sat and watched the coming tide across the shores so newly dried  he wondered at the waters clear the breeze that whispered in his ear the billows heaving far and near  and why he had so long preferred to hang upon her every word in truth he said it was absurd   the third voice   not long this transport held its place within a little moments space quick tears were raining down his face  his heart stood still aghast with fear a wordless voice nor far nor near he seemed to hear and not to hear  tears kindle not the doubtful spark if so why not  of this remark the bearings are profoundly dark  her speech he said hath caused this pain easier i count it to explain the jargon of the howling main  or stretched beside some babbling brook to con with inexpressive look an unintelligible book  low spake the voice within his head in words imagined more than said soundless as ghosts intended tread  if thou art duller than before why quittedst thou the voice of lore why not endure expecting more  rather than that he groaned aghast id writhe in depths of cavern vast some loathly vampires rich repast  twere hard it answered themes immense to coop within the narrow fence that rings thy scant intelligence  not so he urged nor once alone but there was something in her tone that chilled me to the very bone  her style was anything but clear and most unpleasantly severe her epithets were very queer  and yet so grand were her replies i could not choose but deem her wise i did not dare to criticise  nor did i leave her till she went so deep in tangled argument that all my powers of thought were spent  a little whisper inly slid yet truth is truth  you know you did a little wink beneath the lid  and sickened with excess of dread prone to the dust he bent his head and lay like one threequarters dead  the whisper left himlike a breeze lost in the depths of leafy trees  left him by no means at his ease  once more he weltered in despair with hands through densermatted hair more tightly clenched than then they were  when bathed in dawn of living red majestic frowned the mountain head tell me my fault was all he said  when at high noon the blazing sky scorched in his head each haggard eye then keenest rose his weary cry  and when at eve the unpitying sun smiled grimly on the solemn fun alack he sighed what have i done  but saddest darkest was the sight when the cold grasp of leaden night dashed him to earth and held him tight  tortured unaided and alone thunders were silence to his groan bagpipes sweet music to its tone  what  ever thus in dismal round shall pain and mystery profound pursue me like a sleepless hound  with crimsondashed and eager jaws me still in ignorance of the cause unknowing what i broke of laws  the whisper to his ear did seem like echoed flow of silent stream or shadow of forgotten dream  the whisper trembling in the wind her fate with thine was intertwined so spake it in his inner mind  each orbed on each a baleful star each proved the others blight and bar each unto each were best most far  yea each to each was worse than foe thou a scared dullard gibbering low and she an avalanche of woe    tema con variazioni    why is it that poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of dilution which has proved so advantageous to her sisterart music  the diluter gives us first a few notes of some wellknown air then a dozen bars of his own then a few more notes of the air and so on alternately  thus saving the listener if not from all risk of recognising the melody at all at least from the too exciting transports which it might produce in a more concentrated form  the process is termed setting by composers and any one that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar will recognise the truthfulness of this happy phrase  for truly just as the genuine epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme venisonwhose every fibre seems to murmur excelsioryet swallows ere returning to the toothsome dainty great mouthfuls of oatmealporridge and winkles  and just as the perfect connoisseur in claret permits himself but one delicate sip and then tosses off a pint or more of boardingschool beer  so also    i never loved a dear gazelle  nor anything that cost me much high prices profit those who sell but why should i be fond of such  to glad me with his soft black eye my son comes trotting home from school hes had a fight but cant tell why  he always was a little fool  but when he came to know me well he kicked me out her testy sire and when i stained my hair that belle might note the change and thus admire  and love me it was sure to dye a muddy green or staring blue whilst one might trace with half an eye the still triumphant carrot through    a game of fives    five little girls of five four three two one rolling on the hearthrug full of tricks and fun  five rosy girls in years from ten to six sitting down to lessonsno more time for tricks  five growing girls from fifteen to eleven music drawing languages and food enough for seven  five winsome girls from twenty to sixteen each young man that calls i say now tell me which you mean  five dashing girls the youngest twentyone but if nobody proposes what is there to be done  five showy girlsbut thirty is an age when girls may be engaging but they somehow dont engage  five dressy girls of thirtyone or more so gracious to the shy young men they snubbed so much before       five passe girlstheir age  well never mind we jog along together like the rest of human kind but the quondam careless bachelor begins to think he knows the answer to that ancient problem how the money goes    poeta fit non nascitur    how shall i be a poet how shall i write in rhyme you told me once the very wish partook of the sublime then tell me how  dont put me off with your another time  the old man smiled to see him to hear his sudden sally he liked the lad to speak his mind enthusiastically and thought theres no humdrum in him nor any shillyshally  and would you be a poet before youve been to school ah well  i hardly thought you so absolute a fool first learn to be spasmodic  a very simple rule  for first you write a sentence and then you chop it small then mix the bits and sort them out just as they chance to fall the order of the phrases makes no difference at all  then if youd be impressive remember what i say that abstract qualities begin with capitals alway the true the good the beautiful  those are the things that pay  next when you are describing a shape or sound or tint dont state the matter plainly but put it in a hint and learn to look at all things with a sort of mental squint  for instance if i wished sir of muttonpies to tell should i say dreams of fleecy flocks pent in a wheaten cell why yes the old man said  that phrase would answer very well  then fourthly there are epithets that suit with any word  as well as harveys reading sauce with fish or flesh or bird  of these wild lonely weary strange are much to be preferred  and will it do o will it do to take them in a lump  as the wild man went his weary way to a strange and lonely pump nay nay  you must not hastily to such conclusions jump  such epithets like pepper give zest to what you write and if you strew them sparely they whet the appetite but if you lay them on too thick you spoil the matter quite  last as to the arrangement your reader you should show him must take what information he can get and look for no im mature disclosure of the drift and purpose of your poem  therefore to test his patience  how much he can endure  mention no places names or dates and evermore be sure throughout the poem to be found consistently obscure  first fix upon the limit to which it shall extend then fill it up with padding beg some of any friend your great sensationstanza you place towards the end  and what is a sensation grandfather tell me pray i think i never heard the word so used before today be kind enough to mention one exempli gratia  and the old man looking sadly across the gardenlawn where here and there a dewdrop yet glittered in the dawn said go to the adelphi and see the colleen bawn  the word is due to boucicault  the theory is his where life becomes a spasm and history a whiz if that is not sensation i dont know what it is  now try your hand ere fancy have lost its present glow and then his grandson added well publish it you know green clothgoldlettered at the back  in duodecimo  then proudly smiled that old man to see the eager lad rush madly for his pen and ink and for his blottingpad  but when he thought of publishing his face grew stern and sad    size and tears    when on the sandy shore i sit beside the salt seawave and fall into a weeping fit because i dare not shave  a little whisper at my ear enquires the reason of my fear  i answer if that ruffian jones should recognise me here hed bellow out my name in tones offensive to the ear he chaffs me so on being stout a thing that always puts me out  ah me  i see him on the cliff farewell farewell to hope if he should look this way and if hes got his telescope to whatsoever place i flee my odious rival follows me  for every night and everywhere i meet him out at dinner and when ive found some charming fair and vowed to die or win her the wretch hes thin and i am stout is sure to come and cut me out  the girls just like them all agree to praise j jones esquire i ask them what on earth they see about him to admire they cry he is so sleek and slim its quite a treat to look at him  they vanish in tobacco smoke those visionary maids  i feel a sharp and sudden poke between the shoulderblades  why brown my boy  your growing stout i told you he would find me out  my growth is not your business sir no more it is my boy but if its yours as i infer why brown i give you joy a man whose business prospers so is just the sort of man to know  its hardly safe though talking here  id best get out of reach for such a weight as yours i fear must shortly sink the beach  insult me thus because im stout i vow ill go and call him out    atalanta in camdentown    ay twas here on this spot in that summer of yore atalanta did not vote my presence a bore nor reply to my tenderest talk she had heard all that nonsense before  shed the brooch i had bought and the necklace and sash on and her heart as i thought was alive to my passion and shed done up her hair in the style that the empress had brought into fashion  i had been to the play with my pearl of a peri  but for all i could say she declared she was weary that the place was so crowded and hot and she couldnt abide that dundreary  then i thought lucky boy tis for you that she whimpers and i noted with joy those sensational simpers and i said this is scrumptiousa phrase i had learned from the devonshire shrimpers  and i vowed twill be said im a fortunate fellow when the breakfast is spread when the topers are mellow when the foam of the bridecake is white and the fierce orangeblossoms are yellow  o that languishing yawn o those eloquent eyes i was drunk with the dawn of a splendid surmise  i was stung by a look i was slain by a tear by a tempest of sighs  then i whispered i see the sweet secret thou keepest and the yearning for me that thou wistfully weepest and the question is license or banns though undoubtedly banns are the cheapest  be my hero said i and let me be leander but i lost her reply  something ending with gander  for the omnibus rattled so loud that no mortal could quite understand her    the lang coortin    the ladye she stood at her lattice high wi her doggie at her feet thorough the lattice she can spy the passers in the street  theres one that standeth at the door and tirleth at the pin now speak and say my popinjay if i sall

silken string and a but it wasna prepaid said that highborn maid sae i gard them tak it awa  o ever alack that ye sent it back it was written sae clerkly and well now the message it brought and the boon that it sought i must even say it mysel  then up and spake the popinjay sae wisely counselled he now say it in the proper way gae doon upon thy knee  the lover he turned baith red and pale went doon upon his knee o ladye hear the waesome tale that must be told to thee  for five lang years and five lang years i coorted thee by looks by nods and winks by smiles and tears as i had read in books  for ten lang years o weary hours i coorted thee by signs by sending game by sending flowers by sending valentines  for five lang years and five lang years i have dwelt in the far countrie till that thy mind should be inclined mair tenderly to me  now thirty years are gane and past i am come frae a foreign land i am come to tell thee my love at last  o ladye gie me thy hand  the ladye she turned not pale nor red but she smiled a pitiful smile sic a coortin as yours my man she said takes a lang and a weary while  and out and laughed the popinjay a laugh of bitter scorn a coortin done in sic a way it ought not to be borne  wi that the doggie barked aloud and up and doon he ran and tugged and strained his chain o gowd all for to bite the man  o hush thee gentle popinjay o hush thee doggie dear there is a word i fain wad say it needeth he should hear  aye louder screamed that ladye fair to drown her doggies bark ever the lover shouted mair to make that ladye hark  shrill and more shrill the popinjay upraised his angry squall i trow the doggies voice that day was louder than them all  the servingmen and servingmaids sat by the kitchen fire they heard sic a din the parlour within as made them much admire  out spake the boy in buttons i ween he wasna thin now wha will tae the parlour gae and stay this deadlie din  and they have taen a kerchief casted their kevils in for wha will tae the parlour gae and stay that deadlie din  when on that boy the kevil fell to stay the fearsome noise gae in they cried whateer betide thou prince of buttonboys  syne he has taen a supple cane to swinge that dog sae fat the doggie yowled the doggie howled the louder aye for that  syne he has taen a muttonbane  the doggie ceased his noise and followed doon the kitchen stair that prince of buttonboys  then sadly spake that ladye fair wi a frown upon her brow o dearer to me is my sma doggie than a dozen sic as thou  nae use nae use for sighs and tears nae use at all to fret sin yeve bided sae well for thirty years ye may bide a wee langer yet  sadly sadly he crossed the floor and tirled at the pin sadly went he through the door where sadly he cam in  o gin i had a popinjay to fly

friends who had gone to a ball at an oxford commemorationand also as a specimen of what might be done by making the double acrostic a connected poem instead of what it has hitherto been a string of

soon be done bands cannot always play nor ladies smile endure with patience the distasteful fun for just a little while  a change came oer my visionit was night we clove a pathway through a frantic throng the steeds wildplunging filled us with affright the chariots whirled along  within a marble hall a river ran  a living tide half muslin and half cloth and here one mourned a broken wreath or fan yet swallowed down her wrath  and here one offered to a thirsty fair his words halfdrowned amid those thunders tuneful some frozen viand there were many there a toothache in each spoonful  there

the corks and busy knives dispense the tongue and chicken  flushed with new life the crowd flows back again and all is tangled talk and mazy motion  much like a waving field of golden grain or a tempestuous ocean  and thus they give the time that nature meant for peaceful sleep and meditative snores to ceaseless din and mindless merriment and waste of shoes and floors  and one we name him not
