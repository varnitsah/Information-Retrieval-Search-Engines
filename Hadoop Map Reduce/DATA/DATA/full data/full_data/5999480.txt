remarkable than those of the two preceding and the three following years wordsworths poetical activity in 1804 is not recorded however in lyrical ballads or sonnets but in the prelude much of which was thought out and afterwards dictated to dorothy or mary wordsworth on the terrace walk of lancrigg during that year while the ode intimations of immortality was altered and added to although it did not receive its final form till 1806 in the sixth book of the prelude p 222 the lines occur    four years and thirty told this very week   have i been now a sojourner on earth  that part of the great

fenwick note tells us was the germ of this poem they may be lines now incorporated in those to a highland girl vol ii p 389 or they may be lines in the present poem which wordsworth wrote at first for the highland girl but afterwards transferred to this one they may have been the first four lines of the later poem the two should be read consecutively and compared  after wordsworths death a writer in the daily news january 1859then understood to be miss harriet martineauwrote thus    in the memoirs by the nephew of the poet it is said that these   verses refer to mrs wordsworth but for half of wordsworths life it   was always understood that they referred to some other phantom which   gleamed upon his sight before mary hutchinson  this statement is much more than improbable it is i think disproved by the fenwick note they cannot refer to the lucy of the goslar poems and wordsworth indicates as plainly as he chose to whom they actually do refer compare the hon justice coleridges account of a conversation with wordsworth memoirs vol ii p 306 in which the poet expressly said that the lines were written on his wife the question was however set at rest in a conversation of wordsworth with henry crabb robinson who wrote in his diary on    may 12 1842wordsworth said that the poems our walk was far   among the ancient trees vol ii p 167 then she was a phantom of   delight

wordsworths journal under date thursday april 15 1802    when we were in the woods beyond gowbarrow park we saw a few   daffodils close to the water side we fancied that the sea had floated   the seeds ashore and that the little colony had so sprung up but as   we went along there were more and yet more and at last under the   boughs of the trees we saw that there was a long belt of them along   the shore about the breadth of a country turnpike road i never saw   daffodils so beautiful they grew among the mossy stones about and   above them some rested their heads upon these stones as on a pillow   for weariness and the rest tossed and reeled and danced and seemed   as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the   lake they looked so gay ever glancing ever changing this wind blew   directly over the lake to them there was here and there a little   knot and a few stragglers higher up but they were so few as not to   disturb the simplicity unity and life of that one busy highway we   rested again and again the bays were stormy and we heard the waves   at different distances and in the middle of the water like the   sea  in the edition of 1815 there is a footnote to the lines    they flash upon that inward eye   which is the bliss of solitude  to the following effect    the subject of these stanzas is rather an elementary feeling and   simple impression approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum   upon the imaginative faculty than an exertion of it the one which   follows a is strictly a reverie and neither that nor the next   after it in succession power of music would have been placed here   except for the reason given in the foregoing note  the being placed here refers to its being included among the poems of the imagination the foregoing note is the note appended to the horn of egremont castle and the reason given in it is to avoid a needless multiplication of the classes into which wordsworth divided his poems this note of 181 b is reprinted mainly to show the difficulties to which wordsworth was reduced by the artificial method of arrangement referred to the following letter to mr wrangham is a more appropriate illustration of the poem of the daffodils it was written the late bishop of lincoln says sometime afterwards see memoirs of wordsworth vol i pp 183 184 and for the whole of the letter see a subsequent volume of this edition    grasmere nov 4    my dear wranghami am indeed much pleased that mrs wrangham and   yourself have been gratified by these breathings of simple nature you   mention butler montagus friend not tom butler but the conveyancer   when i was in town in spring he happened to see the volumes lying on   montagus mantelpiece and to glance his eye upon the very poem of   the daffodils aye says he a fine morsel this for the   reviewers when this was told me for i was not present i observed   that there were two lines in that little poem which if thoroughly   felt would annihilate ninetenths of the reviews of the kingdom as   they would find no readers the lines i alluded to were these      they flash upon that inward eye     which is the bliss of solitude  these two lines were composed by mrs wordsworth in 1877 the daffodils were still growing in abundance on the shore of ullswater below gowbarrow park  compare the last four lines of james montgomerys poem the

there is a peele castle on a small rocky island close to the town of peele in the isle of man yet separated from it much as st michaels mount in cornwall is separated from the mainland this castle was believed by many to be the one which sir george painted and which gave rise to the foregoing lines i visited it in 1879 being then ignorant that any other peele castle existed and although the day being calm and the season summer i thought sir george had idealized his subject muchas i had just left coleorton where the picture still existsi accepted the customary opinion but i am now convinced both from the testimony of the arnold family b and as the result of a visit to piel castle near barrow in furness that wordsworth refers to it the late bishop of lincoln in his uncles memoirs vol i p 299 quotes the line    i was thy neighbour once thou rugged pile  and adds    he had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the   house of his cousin mr barker  this house was at rampside the village opposite piel on the coast of lancashire the rugged pile too now cased in the unfeeling armour of old time painted by beaumont is obviously this piel castle near barrow i took the engraving of his picture with me when visiting it and although sir georgeafter the manner of landscape artists of his daytook many liberties with his subjects it is apparent that it was this and not

1881 it was proposed by one of the members the rev h d rawnsley then vicar of wray to erect some memorial at the partingplace of the brothers the brothers john and william wordsworth parted at grisedale tarn on the 29th september 1800 the originator of the idea wrote thus of it in june 1882    a proposition made by one of its members to the wordsworth society   when it met in grasmere in 1881 to mark the spot in the grisedale   pass of wordsworths parting from his brother johnand to carry out a   wish the poet seems to have hinted at in the last of his elegiac   verses in memory of that partingis now being put into effect it has   been determined after correspondence with lord coleridge dr   cradock professor knight and mr hills to have inscribedon the   native rock if possiblethe first four lines of stanzas iii and   vii of these verses      here did we stop and here looked round     while each into himself descends     for that last thought of parting friends     that is not to be found          brother and friend if verse of mine     have power to make thy virtues known     here let a monumental stone     standsacred as a shrine    the rock selected is a fine mass facing the east on the left of the   track as one descends from grisedale tarn towards patterdale and is   about 100 yards from the tarn no more suitable one can be found and   we have the testimony of mr david richardson of newcastle who has   practical knowledge of engineering that it is the fittest both from   shape and from slight incline of plane    it has been proposed to sink a panel in the face of the rock that so   the inscription may be slightly protected and to engrave the letters   upon the face of the panel thus obtained but it is not quite certain   yet that the grain of the rockvolcanic ashwill admit of the   lettering if this cannot be carried out it has been determined to   have the letters engraved upon a slab of langdale slate and imbed it   in the grisedale rock    it is believed that the simplicity of the design the lonely isolation   of this mountain memorial will appeal at once        to the few who pass this way     traveller or shepherd    and we in our turn appeal to english tourists who may chance to see   it to forego the wish of adding to it or taking anything from it by   engraving their own names and to let the monumental stone stand as   the poet wished it might        stand sacred as a shrine    we owe great thanks to mrs sturge for first surveying the place to   ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently   striking in position to mr richardson jun for his etching of the   rock upon which the inscription is to be made to his father for the   kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock and   particularly to the seconder of the original proposal and my   coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work   mr w h hills    h d rawnsley    p swhen we came to examine the rock we found the area for the   panel less than we had hoped for owing to certain rock fissures   which by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface would   have much interfered with the durability of the inscription the   available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7 in length by 1 foot 9   inches in depth owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone it   may be quite possible to letter the native rock but it has been   difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that   shall be at once in good taste forcible and plain it was proposed   that the script type of letter which was made use of in the   inscription cut on the rock in the late mr balls garden grounds   below the mount at rydal should be adopted but a final decision has   been given in favour of a style of lettering which mrs rawnsley has   designed the panel is from its position certain to attract the eye   of the wanderer from patterdale up to the grisedale pass    h d r  see the note to the

green and co 1868refers to the loss of the abergavenny    one morning coming down early i saw what i thought was a great big   ship without any hull this was the abergavenny east indiaman   which had sunk with all sails set hardly three miles from the shore   and all on board perished    had any of the crew taken refuge in the maintop they might have been   saved but the bowsprit which was crowded with human beings gave a   lurch into the sea as the ship settled down and thus all were washed   offthough the timber appeared again above water when the   abergavenny touched the ground the ship had sprung a leak off st   albans head and in spite of pumps she went to the bottom just   within reach of safety    pp 12 13  a narrative of the loss of the earl of abergavenny east indiaman off portland feb 5 1805 was published in pamphlet form 8vo 1805 by hamilton and bird 21 high street islington  for much in reference to john wordsworth which illustrates both these elegiac verses and the poem on the naming of places which follows them i must refer to his life to be published in another volume of this series but there is one letter of dorothy wordsworths written to her friend miss jane pollard afterwards mrs marshall in reference to her brothers death which may find a place here for the use of it i am indebted to the kindness of mrs marshalls daughter the dowager lady monteagle    march 16th 1805 grasmere     it does me good to weep for him and it does me good to find that   others weep and i bless them for it  it is with me when i write   as when i am walking out in this vale once so full of joy i can turn   to no object that does not remind me of our loss i see nothing that   he would not have loved and enjoyed my consolations rather come   to me in gusts of feeling than are the quiet growth of my mind i   know it will not always be so the time will come when the light of   the setting sun upon these mountain tops will be as heretofore a pure   joy not the same gladness that can never bebut yet a joy even   more tender it will soothe me to know how happy he would have been   could he have seen the same beautiful spectacle he was taken away   in the freshness of his manhood pure he was and innocent as a child   never human being was more thoroughly modest and his courage i need   not speak of he was seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the   first mate a few minutes before the ship went down and when nothing   more could be done he said the will of god be done i have no   doubt when he felt that it was out of his power to save his life he   was as calm as before if some thought of what we should endure did   not awaken a pang he loved solitude and he rejoiced in society   he would wander alone amongst these hills with his fishingrod or led   on by the mere pleasure of walking for many hours or he would walk   with w or me or both of us and was continually pointing outwith a   gladness which is seldom seen but in very young peoplesomething   which perhaps would have escaped our observation for he had so fine   an eye that no distinction was unnoticed by him and so tender a   feeling that he never noticed anything in vain many a time has he   called out to me at evening to look at the moon or stars or a cloudy   sky or this vale in the quiet moonlight but the stars and moon were   his chief delight he made of them his companions when he was at sea   and was never tired of those thoughts which the silence of the night   fed in him then he was so happy by the fireside any little business   of the house interested him he loved our cottage he helped us to   furnish it and to make the garden trees are growing now which he   planted he staid with us till the 29th of september having come   to us about the end of january during that time mary hutchinsonnow   mary wordsworthstaid with us six weeks john used to walk with her   everywhere and they were exceedingly attached to each other so my   poor sister mourns with us not merely because we have lost one who   was so dear to william and me but from tender love to john and an   intimate knowledge of him her hopes as well as ours were fixed on   john i can think of nothing but of our departed brother yet i am   very tranquil today i honour him and love him and glory in his   memory  southey writing to his friend c w w wynn on the 3rd of april 1805 says    dear wynn    i have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the   abergavenny of which wordsworths brother was captain of course   the news came flying up to us from all quarters and it has disordered   me from head to foot at such circumstances i believe we feel as much   for others as for ourselves just as a violent blow occasions the same   pain as a wound and he who breaks his shin feels as acutely at the   moment as the man whose leg is shot off in fact i am writing to you   merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to   do anything else it is the heaviest calamity wordsworth has ever   experienced and in all probability i shall have to communicate it to   him as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him   what renders any near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is   that the recollection is perpetually freshened when any like event   occurs by the mere mention of shipwreck or the sound of the wind of   all deaths it is the most dreadful from the circumstances of terror   which accompany it  see the life and correspondence of robert southey vol ii p 321  the following is part of a letter from mary lamb to dorothy wordsworth on the same subject it is undated    my dear miss wordsworth    i wished to tell you that you would one day feel the kind of peaceful   state of mind and sweet memory of the dead which you so happily   describe as now almost begun but i felt that it was improper and   most grating to the feelings of the afflicted to say to them that the   memory of their affliction would in time become a constant part not   only of their dreams but of their most wakeful sense of happiness   that you would see every object with and through your lost brother   and that that would at last become a real and everlasting source of   comfort to you i felt and well knew from my own experience in   sorrow but till you yourself began to feel this i did not dare to   tell you so but i send you some poor lines which i wrote under this   conviction of mind and before i heard coleridge was returning home          why is he wandering on the sea     coleridge should now with wordsworth be     by slow degrees hed steal away     their woes and gently bring a ray     so happily hed time relief     of comfort from their very grief     hed tell them that their brother dead     when years have passed oer their head     will be remembered with such holy     true and tender melancholy     that ever this lost brother john     will be their hearts companion     his voice theyll always hear       his face theyll always see     theres naught in life so sweet       as such a memory  see final memorials of charles lamb by thomas noon talfourd vol ii pp 233 234ed

from my cottage stands   a stately firgrove whither i was wont   to hasten for i found beneath the roof                          10   of that perennial shade a cloistral place   of refuge with an unincumbered floor   here in safe covert on the shallow snow   and sometimes on a speck of visible earth   the redbreast near me hopped nor was i loth                      15   to sympathise with

pathed    this wish was not granted the lamented person not long after perished by shipwreck in discharge of his duty as commander of the honourable east india companys vessel the earl of abergavennyw w 1815  for the date of this poem in the chronological tables given in the editions of 1815 and 1820 wordsworth assigned the year 1802 but in the edition of 1836 he assigned it to the year 1805 the date retained by mr carter in the edition of 1857 captain wordsworth perished on the 5th of february 1805 and if the poem was written in 1805 it must have been in the month of january of that year the note to the poem is explicitnot long after he perished by shipwreck etc thus the poem may have been written in the beginning of 1805 but it is not at all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year john wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the townend cottage grasmere during part of the winter and during the whole of the spring summer and autumn of 1800 william and john going together on foot into yorkshire from the 14th of may to the 7th of june john left grasmere on michaelmas day september 29th 1800 and never returned to it again the following is miss wordsworths record of that day in her journal of 1800    on monday 29th john left us william and i parted with him in sight   of ullswater it was a fine day showery but with sunshine and fine   clouds poor fellow my heart was right sad i could not help thinking   we should see him again because he was only going to penrith  in the spring of 1801 john wordsworth sailed for china in the abergavenny  he returned from this voyage in safety and the brothers met once again in london he went to sea again in 1803 and returned to london in 1804 but could not visit grasmere and in the month of february 1805shortly after he was appointed to the command of the abergavennythe ship was lost at the bill of portland and every one on board perished it is clear that the latter part of the poem when to the attractions of the busy world was written between john wordsworths departure from grasmere and the loss of the abergavenny i e between september 1800 and february 1805 as there are references in it both to what his brother did at grasmere and to his return to sea    back to the joyless ocean thou art gone  there are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to negative the idea of its having been written in 1800 the opening lines seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant he speaks of being wont to do certain things but on the other hand i find an entry in dorothy wordsworths journal which leads me to believe that the poem may have been begun in 1800 and that the first part ending as it did then with the line    while she is travelling through the dreary sea  may have been finished before john wordsworth left grasmere the second part being written afterwards while he was at sea and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions of 1815 and 1820 viz 1802  passages occur in dorothy wordsworths journal to the following effect    monday morning 1st septemberwe walked in the wood by the lake   william read joanna and the firgrove to coleridge  a little earlier there is the record    saturday 22nd augustwilliam was composing all the morning   william read us the poem of joanna beside the rothay by the   roadside  then on friday the 25th august there is the entry    we walked over the hill by the firgrove i sate upon a rock and   observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head   we walked through the wood to the stepping stones the lake of rydale   very beautiful partly still i left william to compose an   inscription that about the path  then next day    saturday morning 30th augustwilliam finished his inscription of   the pathway then walked in the wood and when john returned he sought   him and they bathed together  to what poem dorothy wordsworth referred under the name of the inscription of the pathway has puzzled me much there is no poem amongst his inscriptions written in or before august 1800 that corresponds to it in the least but if my conjecture is right that this poem on the naming of places beginning    when to the attractions of the busy world  was composed at two different times it is quite possible that the firgrove which was readalong with joannato coleridge on september 1st 1800 was the first part of this very poem  if this supposition is correct some light is cast both on the inscription of the pathway and on the date assigned by wordsworth himself to the poem there is a certain fitness however in this poem being placedas it now isin sequence to the elegiac verses in memory of john wordsworth beginning the sheepboy whistled loud and near the fourth poem to the daisy beginning sweet flower belike one day to have  the firgrove still exists it is between wishing gate and white moss common and almost exactly opposite the former standing at the gate and looking eastwards the grove is to the left not forty yards distant some of the firs scotch ones still survive and several beech trees not a single beechtree as in the poem from this one might infer that the present colony had sprung up since the beginning of the century and that the special tree in which was the thrushs nest had perished but dr cradock wrote to me that wordsworth pointed out the tree to miss cookson a few days before dora wordsworths death the tree is near the upper wall and tells its own tale the firgrovejohns grovecan easily be entered by a gate about a hundred yards beyond the wishinggate as one goes toward rydal the view from it the visionary scene                             the spectacle   of clouded splendour  this dreamlike sight   of solemn loveliness  is now much interfered with by the new larch plantations immediately below the firs it must have been very different in wordsworths time and is constantly referred to in his sisters journal as a favourite retreat resorted to                             when cloudless suns   shone hot or wind blew troublesome and strong  in the absence of contrary testimony it might be supposed that the track which the brother had worn    by pacing here unwearied and alone  faced silverhow and the grasmere island and that the single beech tree was nearer the lower than the upper wall but miss cooksons testimony is explicit only a few fir trees survive at this part of the grove which is now open and desolate not as it was in those earlier days when                                    the trees   had been so thickly planted and had thriven   with such perplexed and intricate array   that vainly did i seek beneath their stems   a length of open space   dr cradock remarks    as to there being more than one beech wordsworth would not have   hesitated to sacrifice servile exactness to poetical effect he had a   fancy for one      fair as a star when only one     is shining in the sky    one abode no more grasmeres one green island one green   field  since the above note was printed new light has been cast on the inscription of the pathway for which see volume viii of this editioned

in the preface to the edition of 1815 wordsworth wrote    three short pieces now first published are the work of a female   friend  if any one regard them with dislike or be disposed to   condemn them let the censure fall upon him who trusting in his own   sense of their merit and their fitness for the place which they   occupy extorted them from the authoress  in the edition of 1845 he disclosed the authorship and gave the more natural title by my sister other two poems by her were introduced into the edition of 1815 and subsequent ones viz the address to a child and the mothers return in an appendix to a ms copy of the recollections of a tour made in scotland by dorothy wordsworth transcribed by mrs clarkson i find the poem the cottager to her infant with two additional stanzas which are there attributed to wordsworth the appendix runs thus    to my niece dorothy a sleepless baby      the cottager to her infant    the third and fourth stanzas which follow by w w      ah if i were a

the higher tone of imagination and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the former i apprehended this little piece could not accompany it without disadvantage in the year 1806 if i am not mistaken the waggoner was read to you in manuscript and as you have remembered it for so long a time i am the more encouraged to hope that since the localities on which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you it may prove acceptable to others being therefore in some measure the cause of its present appearance you must allow me the gratification of inscribing it to you

grasmere district of the english lakesand with the road from grasmere to keswickthan the waggoner is and in none are the topographical allusions more minute and faithful  wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what class of his poems to place the waggoner and his frequent changesremoving it from one group to anothershew the artificial character of these classes thus in the edition of 1820 it stood first among the poems of the fancy in 1827 it was the last of the poems founded on the affections in 1832 it was reinstated among the poems of the fancy in 1836 it had a place of its own and was inserted between the poems of the fancy and those founded on the affections while in 1845 it was sent back to its original place among the poems of the fancy although in the table of contents it was printed as an independent poem closing the series  the original text of the waggoner underwent little change till the year 1836 when it was carefully revised and altered throughout the final edition of 1845 however reverted in many instancesespecially in the first cantoto the original text of 1819  as this poem was dedicated to charles lamb it may be of interest to note that some six months afterwards lamb presented wordsworth with a copy of the first edition of paradise regained the edition of 1671 writing on it the following sentence    charles lamb to the best knower of milton and therefore the   worthiest occupant of this pleasant editionjan 2nd 1820  the opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry june evening with a thunderstorm imminent     tis spentthis

breeze   with a haunting and a panting   like the stifling of disease   but the dews allay the heat   and the silence makes it sweet   the waggoner takes what is now the middle road of the three leading from rydal to grasmere see the note to the primrose of the rock the craggy hill referred to in the lines    now he leaves the lower ground   and up the craggy hill ascending      steep the way and wearisome  is the road from rydal quarry up to white moss common with the glowworm rock on the right and the two heathclad rocks referred to in the last of the poems on the naming of places on the left he next passes the wishing gate on the left johns grove on the right and descends by dove cottagewhere wordsworth livedto grasmere     at the bottom of the brow   where once the dove and olivebough   offered a greeting of good ale   to all who entered grasmere vale   and called on him who must depart   to leave it with a jovial heart   there where the dove and olivebough   once hung a poet harbours now   a simple waterdrinking bard  he goes through grasmere passes the swan inn    he knows it to his cost good man   who does not know the famous swan   object uncouth and yet our boast   for it was painted by the host   his own conceit the figure planned   twas coloured all by his own hand  as early as 1819 when the poem was first published this rude piece of selftaught art had been supplanted by a more pretentious figure the waggoner passes the swan    and now the conqueror essays   the long ascent of dunmailraise  as he proceeds the storm gathers and struggles to get free road hill and sky are dark and he barely sees the wellknown rocks at the summit of helmcrag where two figures seem to sit like those on the cobbler near arrochar in argyle    black is the skyand every hill   up to the sky is blacker still   sky hill and dale one dismal room   hung round and overhung with gloom   save that above a single height   is to be seen a lurid light   above helmcraga streak half dead   a burning of portentous red   and near that lurid light full well   the astrologer sage sidrophel   where at his desk and book he sits   puzzling aloft his curious wits   he whose domain is held in common   with no one but the ancient woman   cowering beside her rifted cell   as if intent on magic spell   dread pair that spite of wind and weather   still sit upon helmcrag together  at the top of the raisethe watershed between the vales of grasmere and wytheburnhe reaches the familiar pile of stones at the boundary between the shires of westmoreland and cumberland     that pile of stones   heaped over brave king dunmails bones      green is the grass for beast to graze   around the stones of dunmailraise  the allusion to seatsandal laid bare by the flash of lightning and the description in the last canto of the ascent of the raise by the waggoner on a summer morning are as true to the spirit of the place as anything that wordsworth has written he tells his friend lamb fourteen years after he wrote the poem of the waggoner    yes i and all about me here   through all the changes of the year   had seen him through the mountains go   in pomp of mist or pomp of snow   majestically huge and slow   or with a milder grace adorning   the landscape of a summers morning   while grasmere smoothed her liquid plain   the moving image to detain   and mighty fairfield with a chime   of echoes to his march kept time   when little other business stirred   and little other sound was heard   in that delicious hour of balm   stillness solitude and calm   while yet the valley is arrayed   on this side with a sober shade   on that is prodigally bright   crag lawn and woodwith rosy light  from dunmailraise the waggoner descends to wytheburn externally     wytheburns modest house of prayer   as lowly as the lowliest dwelling  remains very much as it was in 1805 but the primitive simplicity and lowliness of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of an apse by the removal of some of the old rafters and by the reseating of the pews  the cherry tree tavern where the village merrynight was being celebrated still stands on the eastern or helvellyn side of the road it is now a farmhouse but it will be regarded with interest from the description of the rustic dance which recalls longo intervallo the jolly beggars of burns after two hours delay at the cherry tree the waggoner and sailor coast the silent lake of thirlmere and pass the rock of names  this rock was until lately one of the most interesting memorials of wordsworth and his friends that survived in the lake district but the vale of thirlmere is now a manchester watertank and the place which knew the rock of names now knows it no more it was a sort of trysting place of the poets of grasmere and keswickbeing nearly halfway between the two placesand there wordsworth coleridge and other members of their households often met when coleridge left grasmere for keswick the wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock and they often met him there on his way over from keswick to grasmere compare the hon mr justice coleridges reminiscences memoirs of wordsworth vol ii p 310  the rock was on the right hand of the road a little way past waterhead at the southern end of thirlmere and on it were cut the letters    w w   m h   d w   s t c   j w   s h  the initials of william wordsworth mary hutchinson dorothy wordsworth samuel taylor coleridge john wordsworth and sarah hutchinson the wordsworths settled at grasmere at the close of the year 1799 as mentioned in a previous note john wordsworth lived with his brother and sister during most of that winter and during the whole of the spring summer and autumn of 1800 leaving it finally on september 29 1800 these names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of 1800 there is no record of the occurrence and no allusion to the rock in dorothy wordsworths grasmere journal of 1800 but that journal so far as i have seen it begins on the 14th of may 1800 almost every detail of the daily life and ways of the household at dove cottage is so minutely recorded in it that i am convinced that this incident of the cutting of names in the thirlmere rock would have been mentioned had it happened between the 14th of may and john wordsworths departure from grasmere in september such references as this for example occur in the journal    saturday august 2william and coleridge went to keswick john went   with them to wytheburn and staid all day fishing  i therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that the names were cut  i may add that the late dean of westminsterdean stanleytook much interest in this rock of names and doubt having been cast on the accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions in a letter from dr fraser then bishop of manchester which he forwarded to me he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a church  there were few memorials connected with wordsworth more worthy of preservation than this upright mural block of stone when one remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of william and john wordsworth by samuel taylor coleridge possibly with the assistance of dorothy wordsworth the two hutchinsons mary and sarah and that wordsworth says of it    we worked until the initials took   shapes that defied a scornful look  this thirlmere rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the group of poets that used to meet beside it than the stone in the grounds of rydal mount which was spared at wordsworths suit from some rude beauty of its own there was simplicity as well as strength in the way in which the initials were cut but the stone was afterwards desecrated by tourists and others who had the audacity to scratch their own names or initials upon it in 1877 i wrote the rock is as yet wonderfully free from such and its preservation is probably due to the dark olivecoloured moss with which the pure water trickling down has covered the face of the mural block and thus secured it from observation even on that highway but i found in the summer of 1882 that several other names had been ruthlessly added when the manchester thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon an effort was made to remove the stone with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the side of the new roadway in the course of this attempt the stone was broken to pieces  there is a very good drawing of the rock of

keswick she scents the morning air and    quits the slowpaced waggons side   to wander down yon hawthorn dell   with murmuring greta for her guide  the hawthorn dell is the upper part of the vale of st john    there doth she ken the awful form   of ravencragblack as a storm   glimmering through the twilight pale   and ghimmercrag his tall twin brother   each peering forth to meet the other  ravencrag is well knownhc robinson writes of it in his diary in 1818 as the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is not one insignificanta rock on the western side of thirlmere where the greta issues from the lake but there is no rock in the district now called by the name of ghimmercrag or the crag of the ewelamb i am inclined to think that wordsworth referred to the fishercrag of the ordnance survey and the guide books no other rock round thirlmere can with any accuracy be called the tall twin brother of ravencrag certainly not great how nor any spur of high seat or bleaberry fell fishercrag resembles ravencrag as seen from thirlmere bridge or from the high road above it and it is somewhat remarkable that greenin his guide to the lakes a volume which the poet possessedmakes use of the same expression as that which wordsworth adopts regarding these two crags raven and fisher    the margin of the lake on the dalehead side has its charms of wood   and water and fischer crag twin brother to raven crag is no bad   object when taken near the island called bucks holm  a description of sixty studies from nature by william green of ambleside 1810 p 57 i cannot find any topographical allusion to a ghimmercrag in contemporary local writers clarke in his survey of the lakes does not mention it  the castle rock in the vale of legberthwaite between high fell and

castrigg is the shortened form of castlerigg the ridge between naddle valley and keswick  in the reminiscences of wordsworth which the hon mr justice coleridge wrote for the late bishop of lincoln in 1850 there is the following reference to the waggoner see memoirs vol ii p 310    the waggoner seems a very favourite poem of his he said his object   in it had not been understood it was a play of the fancy on a   domestic incident and lowly character he wished by the opening   descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he   wished it to be read if he failed in doing that he wished him to lay   it down he pointed out with the same view the glowing lines on the   state of exultation in which ben and his companions are under the   influence of liquor then he read the sickening languor of the morning   walk contrasted with the glorious uprising of nature and the songs   of the birds here he has added about six most exquisite lines  the lines referred to are doubtless the eight p 101 beginning    say more for by that power a vein  which were added in the edition of 1836  the following is sara coleridges criticism of the waggoner see biographia literaria vol ii pp 183 184 edition 1847    due honour is done to peter bell at this time by students of   poetry in general but some even of mr wordsworths greatest   admirers do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of the   waggoner a poem which my dear uncle mr southey preferred even to   the former ich will meine denkungs art hierin niemandem aufdringen   as lessing says i will force my way of thinking on nobody but take   the liberty for my own gratification to express it the sketches of   hill and valley in this poem have a lightness and spiritan allegro   touchdistinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which   characterises mr wordsworths representations of nature in general   and from the passive tenderness of those in the white doe while it   harmonises well with the human interest of the piece indeed it is the   harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by   its special admirers in its course it describes with bold brief   touches the striking mountain tract from grasmere to keswick it   commences with an evening storm among the mountains presents a lively   interior of a country inn during midnight and concludes after   bringing us in sight of st johns vale and the vale of keswick seen   by daybreakskiddaw touched with rosy light and the prospect from   nathdale fell hoar with the frostlike dews of dawn thus giving a   beautiful and wellcontrasted panorama produced by the most delicate   and masterly strokes of the pencil well may mr ruskin a fine   observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural   appearances speak of mr wordsworth as the great poetic landscape   painter of the age but mr ruskin has found how seldom the great   landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and   affections on canvas or even successful in the introduction of human   figures into their foregrounds whereas in the poetic paintings of mr   wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest   certainly in the waggoner the little sketch of human nature which   occupies as it were the front of that encircling background the   picture of benjamin and his temptations his humble friends and the   mute companions of his way has a character of its own combining with   sportiveness a homely pathos which must ever be delightful to some of   those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of mr   wordsworths poetry it may be compared with the alehouse scene in   tam oshanter parts of vosss luise or ovids baucis and philemon   though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each   other the epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very   beautifully  the editor of southeys life and correspondencehis son the rev charles cuthbert southeytells us in a note to a letter from st coleridge to his father that the waggoners name was jackson and that all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct this jackson after retiring from active work as waggoner became the tenant of greta hall where first coleridge and afterwards southey lived the hall was divided into two houses one of which jackson occupied and the other of which he let to coleridge who speaks thus of him in the letter to southey dated greta hall keswick april 13 1801    my landlord who dwells next door has a very respectable library   which he has put with mine

we are here of the   dedication we read it twice for once that we do the poem i mean all   through yet benjamin is no common favourite there is a spirit of   beautiful tolerance in it it is as good as it was in 1806 and it   will be as good in 1829 if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse it   methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject of   the narrative and the subject of the dedication       i do not know which i like bestthe prologue the latter part   especially to p bell or the epilogue to benjamin yes i tell   stories i do know i like the last best and the waggoner

composed 17991805published 1850   advertisement  the following poem was commenced in the beginning of the year 1799 and completed in the summer of 1805  the design and occasion of the work are described by the author in his preface to the excursion first published in 1814 where he thus speaks    several years ago when the author retired to his native mountains   with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might   live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his   own mind and examine how far nature and education had qualified him   for such an employment    as subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse   the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted   with them    that work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his   knowledge and genius and to whom the authors intellect is deeply   indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation   which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical   poem containing views of man nature and society and to be entitled   the recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and   opinions of a poet living in retirement    the preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the   authors mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his   faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous   labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the   same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as   the antechapel has to the body of a gothic church continuing this   allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which   have been long before the public when they shall be properly   arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such   connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to   the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily   included in those edifices  such was the authors language in the year 1814  it will thence be seen that the present poem was intended to be introductory to the recluse and that the recluse if completed would have consisted of three parts of these the second part alone viz the excursion was finished and given to the world by the author  the first book of the first part of the recluse still remains in manuscript but the third part was only planned the materials of which it would have been formed have however been incorporated for the most part in the authors other publications written subsequently to the excursion  the friend to whom the present poem is addressed was the late samuel taylor coleridge who was resident in malta for the restoration of his health when the greater part of it was composed  mr coleridge read a considerable portion of the poem while he was abroad and his feelings on hearing it recited by the author after his return to his own country are recorded in his verses addressed to mr wordsworth which will be found in the sibylline leaves p 197 edition 1817 or poetical works by s t coleridge vol i p 206  rydal mount july 13th 1850   this advertisement to the first edition of the prelude published in 1850the year of wordsworths deathwas written by mr carter who edited the volume mr carter was for many years the poets secretary and afterwards one of his literary executors the poem was not only kept back from publication during wordsworths lifetime but it remained without a title being alluded to by himself when he spoke or wrote of it as the poem on my own poetical education the poem on my own life etc  as the prelude is autobiographical a large part of wordsworths life might be written in the notes appended to it but besides breaking up the text of the poem unduly this plan has many disadvantages and would render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or repetitive the notes which follow will therefore be limited to the explanation of local historical and chronological allusions or to references to wordsworths own career that are not obvious without them it has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the allusions to minute points in ancient history mediæval mythology and contemporary politics should be explained or left alone but i have preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details with which every scholar is familiar  the prelude was begun as wordsworth left the imperial city of goslar in lower saxony where he spent part of the last winter of last century and which he left on the 10th of february 1799 only lines 1 to 45 however were composed at that time and the poem was continued at desultory intervals after the settlement at grasmere during 1800 and following years large portions of it were dictated to his devoted amanuenses as he walked or sat on the terraces of lancrigg six books were finished by 1805    the seventh was begun in the opening of that year  and the   remaining seven were written before the end of june 1805 when his   friend coleridge was in the island of malta for the restoration of   his health  the late bishop of lincoln  there is no uncertainty as to the year in which the later books were written but there is considerable difficulty in fixing the precise date of the earlier ones writing from grasmere to his friend francis wranghamthe letter is undatedwordsworth says    i am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life which will   take five parts or books to complete three of which are nearly   finished  the late bishop of lincoln supposed that this letter to wrangham was written at the close of 1803 or beginning of 1804 see memoirs of wordsworth vol i p 303 there is evidence that it belongs to 1804 at the commencement of the seventh book p 247 he says    six changeful years have vanished since i first   poured out saluted by that quickening breeze   which met me issuing from the citys walls   a glad preamble to this verse i sang   aloud with fervour irresistible   of shortlived transport like a torrent bursting   from a black thundercloud down scafells side   to rush and disappear but soon broke forth   so willed the muse a less impetuous stream   that flowed awhile with unabating strength   then stopped for years not audible again   before last primrosetime  i have italicised the clauses which give some clue to the dates of composition from these it would appear that the glad preamble written on leaving goslar in 1799 which i think included only the first two paragraphs of book first was a shortlived transport but that soon afterwards a less impetuous stream broke forth which after the settlement at grasmere flowed awhile with unabating strength and then stopped for years now the above passage recording these things was written in 1805 and in the late autumn of that year as is evident from the reference which immediately follows to the choir of redbreasts and the approach of winter we must therefore assign the flowing of the less impetuous stream to 1802 in order to leave room for the intervening years in which it ceased to flow till it was audible again in the spring of 1804 last primrosetime  a second reference to date occurs in the sixth book p 224 entitled cambridge and the alps in which he says    four years and thirty told this very week   have i been now a sojourner on earth  this fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of that part of the work viz april 1804 which corresponds exactly to the last primrosetime of the previous extract from the seventh book in which he tells us that after its long silence his muse was heard again so far wordsworths own allusions to the date of the prelude  but there are others supplied by his own and his sisters letters and also by the grasmere journal in the dove cottage household it was known and talked of as the poem to coleridge and dorothy records on 11th january 1803 that her brother was working at it on 13th february 1804 she writes to mrs clarkson that her brother was engaged on a poem on his own life and was going on with great rapidity on the 6th of march 1804 wordsworth wrote from grasmere to de quincey    i am now writing a poem on my own earlier life i have just finished   that part of it in which i speak of my residence at the university    it is better than half complete viz four books amounting to   about 2500 linesa  on the 24th of march dorothy wrote to mrs clarkson that since coleridge left them which was in january 1804 her brother had added 1500 lines to the poem on his own life on the 29th of april 1804 wordsworth wrote to richard sharpe    i have been very busy these last ten weeks having written between   two and three thousand linesaccurately near three thousandin that   time namely four books and a third of another i am at present at   the seventh book  on the 25th december 1804 he wrote to sir george beaumont    i have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks  we thus find that books i to iv had been written by the 6th of march 1804 that from the 19th february to the 29th of april nearly 3000 lines were written that march and april were specially productive months for by the 29th april he had reached book vii while from 16th october to 25th december he wrote over 2000 lines  dorothy and mary wordsworth transcribed the earlier books more than once and a copy of some of them was given to coleridge to take with him to malta  it is certain that the remaining books of the prelude were all written in the spring and early summer of 1805 the seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh and part of the twelfth being finished about the middle of april the last 300 lines of book twelfth in the last week of april and the two remaining booksthe thirteenth and fourteenthbefore the 20th of may the following extracts from letters of wordsworth to sir george beaumont make this clear and also cast light on matters much more important than the mere dates of composition    grasmere dec 25 1804    my dear sir georgeyou will be pleased to hear that i have been   advancing with my work i have written upwards of 2000 verses during   the last ten weeks i do not know if you are exactly acquainted with   the plan of my poetical labour it is twofold first a poem to be   called the recluse in which it will be my object to express in   verse my most interesting feelings concerning man nature and   society and next a poem in which i am at present chiefly engaged   on my earlier life or the growth of my own mind taken up upon a   large scale this latter work i expect to have finished before the   month of may and then i purpose to fall with all my might on the   former which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been   fixed these many years of this poem that of the pedlar which   coleridge read to you is part and i may have written of it   altogether about 2000 lines it will consist i hope of about ten or   twelve thousand     grasmere may 1 1805    unable to proceed with this work b i turned my thoughts again to   the poem on my own life and you will be glad to hear that i have   added 300 lines to it in the course of last week two books more will   conclude it it will not be much less than 9000 linesnot hundred   but thousand lines longan alarming length and a thing   unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about   himself it is not selfconceit as you will know well that has   induced me to do this but real humility i began the work because i   was unprepared to treat any more arduous subject and diffident   of my own powers here at least i hoped that to a certain degree i   should be sure of succeeding as i had nothing to do but describe what   i had felt and thought and therefore could not easily be bewildered   this might have been done in narrower compass by a man of more   address but i have done my best if when the work shall be finished   it appears to the judicious to have redundancies they shall be lopped   off if possible but this is very difficult to do when a man has   written with thought and this defect whenever i have suspected it or   found it to exist in any writings of mine i have always found it   incurable the fault lies too deep and is in the first conception     grasmere june 3 1805    i have the pleasure to say that i finished my poem about a   fortnight ago i had looked forward to the day as a most happy one    but it was not a happy day for me i was dejected on many   accounts when i looked back upon the performance it seemed to have a   dead weight about itthe reality so far short of the expectation it   was the first long labour that i had finished and the doubt whether i   should ever live to write the recluse and the sense which i had of   this poem being so far below what i seemed capable of executing   depressed me much above all many heavy thoughts of my poor departed   brother hung upon me the joy which i should have had in showing him   the manuscript and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams i have   spoken of this because it was a state of feeling new to me the   occasion being new this work may be considered as a sort of portico   to the recluse part of the same building which i hope to be able   ere long to begin with in earnest and if i am permitted to bring it   to a conclusion and to write further a narrative poem of the epic   kind i shall consider the task of my life as over i ought to add   that i have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of   so alarming a length as i apprehended   these letters explain the delay in the publication of the prelude they show that what led wordsworth to write so much about himself was not selfconceit but selfdiffidence he felt unprepared as yet for the more arduous task he had set before himself he saw its faults as clearly or more clearly than the critics who condemned him he knew that its length was excessive he tried to condense it he kept it beside him unpublished and occasionally revised it with a view to condensation in vain the text received his final corrections in the year 1832  wordsworths reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem the recluse other than the excursion during his lifetime was a matter of surprise to his friends to whom he or the ladies of his household had read portions of it in the year 1819 charles lamb wrote to him    if as you say the waggoner in some sort came at my call oh for   a potent voice to call forth the recluse from his profound   dormitory where he sleeps forgetful of his foolish chargethe   world  the letters of charles lamb edited by alfred ainger vol ii p 26  the admission made in the letter of may 1st 1805 is noteworthy    this defect of redundancy whenever i have suspected it or found   it to exist in any writings of mine i have always found incurable   the fault lies too deep and is in the first conception  the actual resultin the poem he had at length committed to writingwas so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise that he could never be induced to publish it he spoke of the ms as forming a sort of portico to his larger workthe poem on man nature and societywhich he meant to call the recluse and of which one portion only viz the excursion was finished it is clear that throughout the composition of the prelude he felt that he was experimenting with his powers he wished to find out whether he could construct a literary work that might live on a larger scale than his lyrics and it was on the writing of a philosophical poem dealing with man and nature in their deepest aspects that his thoughts had been fixed for many years from the letter to sir george beaumont december 25 1804 it is evident that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this larger work to which he hoped to turn with all his might after the prelude was finished and of which he had already written about a fifth or a sixth see memoirs vol i p 304 this was the part known in the grasmere household as the pedlar a title given to it from the character of the wanderer but afterwards happily set aside he did not devote himself however to the completion of his wider purpose immediately after the prelude was finished he wrote one book of the recluse which he called home at grasmere and though detached from the prelude it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life at the point where it is left off in the latter poem it consists of 733 lines two extracts from it were published in the memoirs of wordsworth in 1851 vol i pp 151 and 155 beginning    on natures invitation do i come  and    bleak season was it turbulent and bleak  these will be found in vol ii of this edition pp 118 and 121 respectively  the autobiographical poem remained as already stated during wordsworths lifetime without a title the name finally adoptedthe preludewas suggested by mrs wordsworth both to indicate its relation to the larger work and the fact of its having been written comparatively early  as the poem was addressed to coleridge it may be desirable to add in this place his critical verdict upon it along with the poem which he wrote on hearing wordsworth read a portion of it to him in the winter of 1806 at coleorton  in his table talk london 1835 vol ii p 70 coleridges opinion is recorded thus    i cannot help regretting that wordsworth did not first publish his   thirteen fourteen books on the growth of an individual   mindsuperior as i used to think upon the whole to the excursion   you may judge how i felt about them by my own poem upon the occasion   then the plan laid out and i believe partly suggested by me was   that wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose   one whose principles were made up and so prepared to deliver upon   authority a system of philosophy he was to treat man as mana   subject of eye ear touch and taste in contact with external nature   and informing the senses from the mind and not compounding a mind out   of the senses then he was to describe the pastoral and other states   of society assuming something of the juvenalian spirit as he   approached the high civilisation of cities and towns and opening a   melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice thence   he was to infer and reveal the proof of and necessity for the whole   state of man and society being subject to and illustrative of a   redemptive process in operation showing how this idea reconciled all   the anomalies and promised future glory and restoration something of   this sort was i think agreed on it is in substance what i have   been all my life doing in my system of philosophy    i think wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great   philosopher than any man i ever knew or as i believe has existed in   england since milton but it seems to me that he ought never to have   abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarlyperhaps i   might say exclusivelyfitted for him his proper title is spectator   ab extra  the following are coleridges lines addressed to

conscious of its close   i sate my being blended in one thought   thought was it or aspiration or resolve   absorbed yet hanging still upon the sound   and when i rose i found myself in prayer   it

felt within   a correspondent breeze that gently moved                           35   with quickening virtue but is now become   a tempest a redundant energy   vexing its own creation thanks to both   and their congenial powers that while they join   in breaking up a longcontinued frost                              40   bring with them vernal promises the hope   of active days urged on by flying hours   days of sweet leisure taxed with patient thought   abstruse nor wanting punctual service high   matins and vespers of harmonious verse                             45      thus far o friend d did i not used to make   a present joy the matter of a song   pour forth that day my soul in measured strains   that would not be forgotten and are here   recorded to the open fields i told                                 50   a prophecy poetic numbers came   spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe   a renovated spirit singled out   such hope was mine for holy services   my own voice cheered me and far more the minds                  55   internal echo of the imperfect sound   to both i listened drawing from them both   a cheerful confidence in things to come      content and not unwilling now to give   a respite to this passion i paced on                               60   with brisk and eager steps and came at length   to a green shady place e where down i sate   beneath a tree slackening my thoughts by choice   and settling into gentler happiness   twas autumn and a clear and placid day                           65   with warmth as much as needed from a sun   two hours declined towards the west a day   with silver clouds and sunshine on the grass   and in the sheltered and the sheltering grove   a perfect stillness many were the thoughts                         70   encouraged and dismissed till choice was made   of a known vale f whither my feet should turn   nor rest till they had reached the very door   of the one cottage g which methought i saw   no picture of mere memory ever looked                               75   so fair and while upon the fancied scene   i gazed with growing love a higher power   than fancy gave assurance of some work   of glory there forthwith to be begun   perhaps too there performed thus long i mused                     80   nor eer lost sight of what i mused upon   save when amid the stately groves of oaks   now here now there an acorn from its cup   dislodged through sere leaves rustled or at once   to the bare earth dropped with a startling sound                   85   from that soft couch i rose not till the sun   had almost touched the horizon casting then   a backward glance upon the curling cloud   of city smoke by distance ruralised   keen as a truant or a fugitive                                     90   but as a pilgrim resolute i took   even with the chance equipment of that hour   the road that pointed toward the chosen vale f   it was a splendid evening and my soul   once more made trial of her strength nor lacked                    95   Æolian visitations but the harp   was soon defrauded and the banded host   of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds   and lastly utter silence be it so   why think of any thing but present good h                      100   so like a homebound labourer i pursued   my way beneath the mellowing sun that shed   mild influence nor left in me one wish   again to bend the sabbath of that time   to a servile yoke what need of many words                        105   a pleasant loitering journey through three days   continued brought me to my hermitage i   i spare to tell of what ensued the life   in common thingsthe endless store of things   rare or at least so seeming every day                            110   found all about me in one neighbourhood   the selfcongratulation and from morn   to night unbroken cheerfulness serene k   but speedily an earnest longing rose   to brace myself to some determined aim                            115   reading or thinking either to lay up   new stores or rescue from decay the old   by timely interference and therewith   came hopes still higher that with outward life   i might endue some airy phantasies                                 120   that had been floating loose about for years   and to such beings temperately deal forth   the many feelings that oppressed my heart   that hope hath been discouraged welcome light   dawns from the east but dawns to disappear                        125   and mock me with a sky that ripens not   into a steady morning if my mind   remembering the bold promise of the past   would gladly grapple with some noble theme   vain is her wish whereer she turns she finds                     130   impediments from day to day renewed      and now it would content me to yield up   those lofty hopes awhile for present gifts   of humbler industry but oh dear friend   the poet gentle creature as he is                                135   hath like the lover his unruly times   his fits when he is neither sick nor well   though no distress be near him but his own   unmanageable thoughts his mind best pleased   while she as duteous as the mother dove                            140   sits brooding lives not always to that end   but like the innocent bird hath goadings on   that drive her as in trouble through the groves l   with me is now such passion to be blamed   no otherwise than as it lasts too long                            145      when as becomes a man who would prepare   for such an arduous work i through myself   make rigorous inquisition the report   is often cheering for i neither seem   to lack that first great gift the vital soul                     150   nor general truths which are themselves a sort   of elements and

perhaps with toil   and needful to build up a poets praise   time place and manners do i seek and these   are found in plenteous store but nowhere such   as may be singled out with steady choice                          160   no little band of yet remembered names   whom i in perfect confidence might hope   to summon back from lonesome banishment   and make them dwellers in the hearts of men   now living or to live in future years                            165   sometimes the ambitious power of choice mistaking   proud springtide swellings for a regular sea   will settle on some british theme some old   romantic tale by milton left unsung   more often turning to some gentle place                            170   within the groves of chivalry i pipe   to shepherd swains or seated harp in

  and christian meekness hallowing faithful loves                   185   sometimes more sternly moved i would relate   how vanquished mithridates northward passed   and hidden in the cloud of years

but not the soul   of liberty which fifteen hundred years   survived and when the european came   with skill and power that might not be withstood   did like a pestilence maintain its hold                          200   and wasted down by glorious death that race   of natural heroes or i would record   how in tyrannic times some highsouled man   unnamed among the chronicles of kings   suffered in silence for truths sake or tell                     205   how that one frenchman q through continued force   of meditation on the inhuman deeds   of those who conquered first the indian isles   went single in his ministry across   the ocean not to comfort the oppressed                           210   but like a thirsty wind to roam about   withering the oppressor how gustavus sought   help at his

sometimes it suits me better to invent   a tale from my own heart more near akin   to my own passions and habitual thoughts   some variegated story in the main   lofty but the unsubstantial structure melts                       225   before the very sun that brightens it   mist into air dissolving then a wish   my best and favourite aspiration mounts   with yearning toward some philosophic song   of truth that cherishes our daily life                            230   with meditations passionate from deep   recesses in mans heart immortal verse t   thoughtfully fitted to the orphean lyre u   but from this awful burthen i full soon   take refuge and beguile myself with trust                          235   that mellower years will bring a riper mind   and clearer insight thus my days are past   in contradiction with no skill to part   vague longing haply bred by want of power   from paramount impulse not to be withstood                        240   a timorous capacity from prudence   from circumspection infinite delay   humility and modest awe themselves   betray me serving often for a cloak   to a more subtle selfishness that now                             245   locks every function up in blank reserve   now dupes me trusting to an anxious eye   that with intrusive restlessness beats off   simplicity and selfpresented truth   ah better far than this to stray about                           250   voluptuously through fields and rural walks   and ask no record of the hours resigned   to vacant musing unreproved neglect   of all things and deliberate holiday   far better never to have heard the name                            255   of zeal and just ambition than to live   baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour   turns recreant to her task takes heart again   then feels immediately some hollow thought   hang like an interdict upon her hopes                             260   this is my lot for either still i find   some imperfection in the chosen theme   or see of absolute accomplishment   much wanting so much wanting in myself   that i recoil and droop and seek repose                           265   in listlessness from vain perplexity   unprofitably travelling toward the grave   like a false steward who hath much received   and renders nothing back                              was it for this   that one the fairest of all rivers v loved                     270   to blend his murmurs with my nurses song   and from his alder shades and rocky falls   and from his fords and shallows sent a voice   that flowed along my dreams for this didst thou   o derwent winding among grassy holms                              275   where i was looking on a babe in arms   make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts   to more than infant softness giving me   amid the fretful dwellings of mankind   a foretaste a dim earnest of the calm                            280   that nature breathes among the hills and groves   when he had left the mountains and received   on his smooth breast the shadow of those towers w   that yet survive a shattered monument   of feudal sway the bright blue river passed                       285   along the margin of our terrace walk x   a tempting playmate whom we dearly loved   oh many a time have i a five years child   in a small millrace severed from his stream   made one long bathing of a summers day                           290   basked in the sun and plunged and basked again   alternate all a summers day or scoured   the sandy fields leaping through flowery groves   of yellow ragwort or when rock and hill   the woods and distant skiddaws lofty height                     295   were bronzed with deepest radiance stood alone   beneath the sky as if i had been born   on indian plains and from my mothers hut   had run abroad in wantonness to sport   a naked savage in the thunder shower                             300      fair seedtime had my soul and i grew up   fostered alike by beauty and by fear   much favoured in my birthplace and no less   in that beloved vale to which erelong   we were transplanted ythere were we let loose                  305   for sports of wider range ere i had told   ten birthdays z when among the mountain slopes   frost and the breath of frosty wind had snapped   the last autumnal crocus a twas my joy   with store of springes oer my shoulder hung                       310   to range the open heights where woodcocks run   along the smooth green turf b through half the night   scudding away from snare to snare i plied   that anxious visitationmoon and stars   were shining oer my head i was alone                            315   and seemed to be a trouble to the peace   that dwelt among them sometimes it befel   in these night wanderings that a strong desire   oerpowered my better reason and the bird   which was the captive of anothers toil                            320   became my prey and when the deed was done   i heard among the solitary hills   low breathings coming after me and sounds   of undistinguishable motion steps   almost as silent as the turf they trod                            325    nor less when spring had warmed the cultured vale c   moved we as plunderers where the motherbird   had in high places built her lodge though mean   our object and inglorious yet the end   was not ignoble oh when i have hung                              330   above the ravens nest by knots of grass   and halfinch fissures in the slippery rock   but ill sustained and almost so it seemed   suspended by the blast that blew amain   shouldering the naked crag d oh at that time                    335   while on the perilous ridge i hung alone   with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind   blow through my ear the sky seemed not a sky   of earthand with what motion moved the clouds      dust as we are the immortal spirit grows                         340   like harmony in music there is a dark   inscrutable workmanship that reconciles   discordant elements makes them cling together   in one society how strange that all   the terrors pains and early miseries                             345   regrets vexations lassitudes interfused   within my mind should eer have borne a part   and that a needful part in making up   the calm existence that is mine when i   am worthy of myself praise to the end                             350   thanks to the means which nature deigned to employ   whether her fearless visitings or those   that came with soft alarm like hurtless light   opening the peaceful clouds or she may use   severer interventions ministry                                     355   more palpable as best might suit her aim      one summer evening led by her i found   a little boat tied to a willow tree   within a rocky cave e its usual home   straight i unloosed her chain and stepping in                      360   pushed from the shore it was an act of stealth   and troubled pleasure nor without the voice   of mountainechoes did my boat move on   leaving behind her still on either side   small circles glittering idly in the moon                          365   until they melted all into one track   of sparkling light but now like one who rows   proud of his skill to reach a chosen point   with an unswerving line i fixed my view   upon the summit of a craggy ridge                                  370   the horizons utmost boundary far above   was nothing but the stars and the grey sky   she was an elfin pinnace lustily   i dipped my oars into the silent lake   and as i rose upon the stroke my boat                             375   went heaving through the water like a swan   when from behind that craggy steep till then   the horizons bound a huge peak black and huge   as if with voluntary power instinct   upreared its head f i struck and struck again                   380   and growing still in stature the grim shape   towered up between me and the stars and still   for so it seemed with purpose of its own   and measured motion like a living thing   strode after me with trembling oars i turned                      385   and through the silent water stole my way   back to the covert of the willow tree   there in her mooringplace i left my bark   and through the meadows homeward went in grave   and serious mood but after i had seen                              390   that spectacle for many days my brain   worked with a dim and undetermined sense   of unknown modes of being oer my thoughts   there hung a darkness call it solitude   or blank desertion no familiar shapes                              395   remained no pleasant images of trees   of sea or sky no colours of green fields   but huge and mighty forms that do not live   like living men moved slowly through the mind   by day and were a trouble to my dreams                            400      wisdom and spirit of the universe   thou soul that art the eternity of thought   that givest to forms and images a breath   and everlasting motion not in vain   by day or starlight thus from my first dawn                        405   of childhood didst thou intertwine for me   the passions that build up our human soul   not with the mean and vulgar works of man   but with high objects with enduring things   with life and nature purifying thus                                410   the elements of feeling and of thought   and sanctifying by such discipline   both pain and fear until we recognise   a grandeur in the beatings of the heart   nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me                            415   with stinted kindness in november days   when vapours rolling down the valley made   a lonely scene more lonesome among woods   at noon and mid the calm of summer nights   when by the margin of the trembling lake                          420   beneath the gloomy hills homeward i went   in solitude such intercourse was mine   mine was it in the fields both day and night   and by the waters all the summer long      and in the frosty season when the sun                            425   was set and visible for many a mile   the cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom   i heeded not their summons happy time   it was indeed for all of usfor me   it was a time of rapture clear and loud                            430   the village clock tolled sixi wheeled about   proud and exulting like an untired horse   that cares not for his home all shod with steel   we hissed along the polished ice in games   confederate imitative of the chase                                 435   and woodland pleasuresthe resounding horn   the pack loud chiming and the hunted hare   so through the darkness and the cold we flew   and not a voice was idle with the din   smitten the precipices rang aloud                                 440   the leafless trees and every icy crag   tinkled like iron g while far distant hills   into the tumult sent an alien sound   of melancholy not unnoticed while the stars   eastward were sparkling clear and in the west                      445   the orange sky of evening died away   not seldom from the uproar i retired   into a silent bay or sportively   glanced sideway leaving the tumultuous throng   to cut across the reflex of a star                                  450   that fled and flying still before me gleamed   upon the glassy plain and oftentimes   when we had given our bodies to the wind   and all the shadowy banks on either side   came sweeping through the darkness spinning still                  455   the rapid line of motion then at once

120   the earth was comfortless and touched by faint   internal breezes sobbings of the place   and respirations from the roofless walls   the shuddering ivy dripped large dropsyet still   so sweetly mid the gloom the invisible bird                       125   sang to herself that there i could have made   my dwellingplace and lived for ever there   to hear such music through the walls we flew   and down the valley and a circuit made   in wantonness of heart through rough and smooth                   130   we scampered homewards oh ye rocks and streams   and that still spirit shed from evening air   even in this joyous time i sometimes felt   your presence when with slackened step we breathed   along the sides of the steep hills or when                        135   lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea   we beat with thundering hoofs the level sand      midway on long winanders eastern shore   within the crescent of a pleasant bay i   a tavern stood k no homelyfeatured

a slope surmounted by a plain   of a small bowlinggreen beneath us stood   a grove with gleams of water through the trees   and over the treetops m nor did we want   refreshment strawberries and mellow cream                        160   there while through half an afternoon we played   on the smooth platform whether skill prevailed   or happy blunder triumphed bursts of glee   made all the mountains ring but ere nightfall   when in our pinnace we returned at leisure                         165   over the shadowy lake and to the beach   of some small island steered our course with one

mind   even with a weight of pleasure and the sky   never before so beautiful sank down   into my heart and held me like a dream   thus were my sympathies enlarged and thus                         175   daily the common range of visible things   grew dear to me already i began   to love the sun a boy i loved the sun   not as i since have loved him as a pledge   and surety of our earthly life a

seen   the western mountain p touch his setting orb                    185   in many a thoughtless hour when from excess   of happiness my blood appeared to flow   for its own pleasure and i breathed with joy   and from like feelings humble though intense   to patriotic and domestic love                                     190   analogous the moon to me was dear   for i could dream away my

time   in which a babe by intercourse of touch   i held mute dialogues with my mothers heart   i have endeavoured to display the means   whereby this infant sensibility                                   270   great birthright of our being was in me   augmented and sustained yet is a path   more difficult before me and i fear   that in its broken windings we shall need   the chamois sinews and the eagles wing                         275   for now a trouble came into my mind   from unknown causes i was left alone   seeking the visible world nor knowing why   the props of my affections were removed   and yet the building stood as if sustained                        280   by its own spirit all that i beheld   was dear and hence to finer influxes   the mind lay open to a more exact   and close communion many are our joys   in youth but oh what happiness to live                           285   when every hour brings palpable access   of knowledge when all knowledge is delight   and sorrow is not there the seasons came   and every season wheresoeer i moved   unfolded transitory qualities                                     290   which but for this most watchful power of love   had been neglected left a register   of permanent relations else unknown   hence life and change and beauty solitude   more active even than best societyt                          295   society made

no difference is and hence from the same source   sublimer joy for i would walk alone   under the quiet stars and at that time   have felt whateer there is of power in sound   to breathe an elevated mood by form                               305   or image unprofaned and i would stand   if the night blackened with a coming storm   beneath some rock listening to notes that are   the ghostly language of the ancient earth   or make their dim abode in distant winds                          310   thence did i drink the visionary power   and deem not profitless those fleeting moods   of shadowy exultation not for this   that they are kindred to our purer mind   and intellectual life but that the soul                          315   remembering how she felt but what she felt   remembering not retains an obscure sense   of possible sublimity whereto   with growing faculties she doth aspire   with faculties still growing feeling still                        320   that whatsoever point they gain they yet   have something to pursue                                    and not alone   mid gloom and tumult but no less mid fair   and tranquil scenes that universal power   and fitness in the latent qualities                                325   and essences of things by which the mind   is moved with feelings of delight to me   came strengthened with a superadded soul

our minds   both silent to each other at this time   we live as if those hours had never been   nor seldom did i liftour cottage latch x   far earlier ere one smokewreath had risen                        340   from human dwelling or the vernal thrush   was audible and sate among the woods   alone upon some jutting eminence y   at the first gleam of dawnlight when the vale   yet slumbering lay in utter solitude                             345   how shall i seek the origin where find   faith in the marvellous things which then i felt   oft in these moments such a holy calm   would overspread my soul that bodily eyes   were utterly forgotten and what i saw                             350   appeared like something in myself a dream   a prospect in the mind z                     twere long to tell   what spring and autumn what the winter snows   and what the summer shade what day and night   evening and morning sleep and waking thought                     355   from sources inexhaustible poured forth   to feed the spirit of religious love   in which i walked with nature but let this   be not forgotten that i still retained   my first creative sensibility                                     360   that by the regular action of the world   my soul was unsubdued a plastic power   abode with me a forming hand at times   rebellious acting in a devious mood   a local spirit of his own at war                                  365   with general tendency but for the most   subservient strictly to external things   with which it communed an auxiliar light   came from my mind which on the setting sun   bestowed new splendour the melodious birds                       370   the fluttering breezes fountains that run on   murmuring so sweetly in themselves obeyed   a like dominion and the midnight storm   grew darker in the presence of my eye   hence my obeisance my devotion hence                             375   and hence my transport            nor should this perchance   pass unrecorded that i still had loved   the exercise and produce of a toil   than analytic industry to me   more pleasing and whose character i deem                          380   is more poetic as resembling more   creative agency the song would speak   of that interminable building reared   by observation of affinities   in objects where no brotherhood exists                             385   to passive minds my seventeenth year was come   and whether from this habit rooted now   so deeply in my mind or from excess   in the great social principle of life   coercing all things into sympathy                                 390   to unorganic ratures were transferred   my own enjoyments or the power of truth   coming in revelation did converse   with things that really are i at this time   saw blessings spread around me like a sea                         395   thus while the days flew by and years passed on   from nature and her overflowing soul   i had received so much that all my thoughts   were steeped in feeling i was only then   contented when with bliss ineffable                               400   i felt the sentiment of being spread   oer all that moves and all that seemeth still   oer all that lost beyond the reach of thought   and human knowledge to the human eye   invisible yet liveth to the heart                                405   oer all that leaps and runs and shouts and sings   or beats the gladsome air oer all that glides   beneath the wave yea in the wave itself   and mighty depth of waters wonder not   if high the transport great the joy i felt                       410   communing in this sort through earth and heaven   with every form of creature as it looked   towards the uncreated with a countenance   of adoration with an eye of love   one song they sang and it was audible                            415   most audible then when the fleshly ear   oercome by humblest prelude of that strain   forgot her functions and slept undisturbed      if this be error and another faith   find easier access to the pious mind                              420   yet were i grossly destitute of all   those human sentiments that make this earth   so dear if i should fail with grateful voice   to speak of you ye mountains and ye lakes   and sounding cataracts ye mists and winds                         425   that dwell among the hills where i was

with sneers   on visionary minds if in this time                               440   of dereliction and dismay i yet   despair not of our nature but retain   a more than roman confidence a faith

trinitys loquacious clock   who never let the quarters night or day   slip by him unproclaimed and told the hours                        55   twice over with a male and female voice   her pealing organ was my neighbour too   and from my pillow looking forth by light   of moon or favouring stars i could behold   the antechapel where the statue stood                               60   of newton with his prism and silent face   the marble index of a mind for ever   voyaging through strange seas of thought alone      of college labours of the lecturers room   all studded round as thick as chairs could stand                  65   with loyal students faithful to their books   halfandhalf idlers hardy recusants   and honest duncesof important days   examinations when the man was weighed   as in a balance of excessive hopes                                70   tremblings withal and commendable fears   small jealousies and triumphs good or bad   let others that know more speak as they know   such glory was but little sought by me   and little won yet from the first crude days                       75   of settling time in this untried abode   i was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts   wishing to hope without a hope some fears   about my future worldly maintenance   and more than all a strangeness in the mind                      80   a feeling that i was not for that hour   nor for that place but wherefore be cast down   for not to speak of reason and her pure   reflective acts to fix the moral law   deep in the conscience nor of christian hope                      85   bowing her head before her sister faith   as one far mightier hither i had come   bear witness truth endowed with holy powers   and faculties whether to work or feel   oft when the dazzling show no longer new                            90   had ceased to dazzle ofttimes did i quit   my comrades leave the crowd buildings and groves   and as i paced alone the level fields   far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime   with which i had been conversant the mind                          95   drooped not but there into herself returning   with prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore   at least i more distinctly recognised   her native instincts let me dare to speak   a higher language say that now i felt                             100   what independent solaces were mine   to mitigate the injurious sway of place   or circumstance how far soever changed   in youth or to be changed in manhoods prime   or for the few who shall be called to look                         105   on the long shadows in our evening years   ordained precursors to the night of death   as if awakened summoned roused constrained   i looked for universal things perused   the common countenance of earth and sky                           110   earth nowhere unembellished by some trace   of that first paradise whence man was driven   and sky whose beauty and bounty are expressed   by the proud name she bearsthe name of heaven   i called on both to teach me what they might                      115   or turning the mind in upon herself   pored watched expected listened spread my thoughts   and spread them with a wider creeping felt   incumbencies more awful visitings   of the upholder of the tranquil soul                              120   that tolerates the indignities of time   and from the centre of eternity   all finite motions overruling lives   in glory immutable but peace enough   here to record that i was mounting now                             125   to such community with highest truth   a track pursuing not untrod before   from strict analogies by thought supplied   or consciousnesses not to be subdued   to every natural form rock fruit or flower                      130   even the loose stones that cover the highway   i gave a moral life i saw them feel   or linked them to some feeling the great mass   lay bedded in a quickening soul and all   that i beheld respired with inward meaning                        135   add that whateer of terror or of love   or beauty natures daily face put on   from transitory passion unto this   i was as sensitive as waters

with kindred multitudes of stars                         165   could find no surface where its power might sleep   which spake perpetual logic to my soul   and by an unrelenting agency   did bind my feelings even as in a chain      and here o friend have i retraced my life                      170   up to an eminence and told a tale   of matters which not falsely may be called   the glory of my youth of genius power   creation and divinity itself   i have been speaking for my theme has been                        175   what passed within me not of outward things   done visibly for other minds words signs   symbols or actions but of my own heart   have i been speaking and my youthful mind   o heavens how awful is the might of souls                        180   and what they do within themselves while yet   the yoke of earth is new to them the world   nothing but a wild field where they were sown   this is in truth heroic argument   this genuine prowess which i wished to touch                      185   with hand however weak but in the main   it lies far hidden from the reach of words   points have we all of us within our souls   where all stand single this i feel and make   breathings for incommunicable powers                              190   but is not each a memory to himself   and therefore now that we must quit this theme   i am not heartless for theres not a man   that lives who hath not known his godlike hours   and feels not what an empire we inherit                            195   as natural beings in the strength of nature      no more for now into a populous plain   we must descend a traveller i am   whose tale is only of himself even so   so be it if the pure of heart be prompt                           200   to follow and if thou my honoured friend   who in these thoughts art ever at my side   support as heretofore my fainting steps      it hath been told that when the first delight   that flashed upon me from this novel show                          205   had failed the mind returned into herself   yet true it is that i had made a change   in climate and my natures outward coat   changed also slowly and insensibly   full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts                            210   of loneliness gave way to empty noise   and superficial pastimes now and then   forced labour and more frequently forced hopes   and worst of all a treasonable growth   of indecisive judgments that impaired                             215   and shook the minds simplicityand yet   this was a gladsome time could i behold   who less insensible than sodden clay   in a searivers bed at ebb of tide   could have beheldwith undelighted heart                        220   so many happy youths so wide and fair   a congregation in its buddingtime

decking the matron temples of a place   so famous through the world to me at least   it was a goodly prospect for in sooth   though i had learnt betimes to stand unpropped                    230   and independent musings pleased me so   that spells seemed on me when i was alone   yet could i only cleave to solitude   in lonely places if a throng was near   that way i leaned by nature for my heart                          235   was social and loved idleness and joy      not seeking those who might participate   my deeper pleasures nay i had not once   though not unused to mutter lonesome songs   even with myself divided such delight                             240   or looked that way for aught that might be clothed   in human language easily i passed   from the remembrances of better things   and slipped into the ordinary works   of careless youth unburthened unalarmed                         245   caverns there were within my mind which sun   could never penetrate yet did there not

senseless horsemanship or on the breast   of cam sailed boisterously and let the stars   come forth perhaps without one quiet thought      such was the tenor of the second act   in this new life

his brothers may be   of more use to him as he has not fixed his mind upon any particular   species of reading or conceived an aversion to any he is not fond of   mathematics but has resolution sufficient to study them because it   will be impossible for him to obtain a fellowship without them   william lost the chance indeed the certainty of a fellowship by not   combating his inclinations he gave way to his natural dislike to   studies so dry as many parts of the mathematics consequently could   not succeed in cambridge he reads italian spanish french greek   latin and english but

nights to watch   the moon in splendour couched among the leaves   of a tall ash that near our cottage stood q   had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro                    90   in the dark summit of the waving tree   she rocked with every impulse of the breeze      among the favourites whom it pleased me well   to see again was one by ancient right   our inmate a rough terrier of the hills                           95   by birth and call of nature preordained   to hunt the badger and unearth the fox   among the impervious crags but having been   from youth our own adopted he had passed   into a gentler service and when first                             100   the boyish spirit flagged and day by day   along my veins i kindled with the stir   the fermentation and the vernal heat   of poesy affecting private shades   like a sick lover then this dog was used                          105   to watch me an attendant and a friend   obsequious to my steps early and late   though often of such dilatory walk   tired and uneasy at the halts i made   a hundred times when roving high and low                          110   i have been harassed with the toil of verse   much pains and little progress and at once   some lovely image in the song rose up   fullformed like venus rising from the sea   then have i darted forwards to let                                 115   my hand upon his back with stormy joy   caressing him again and yet again   and when at evening on the public way   i sauntered like a river murmuring   and talking to itself when all things

save   my name from piteous rumours such as wait   on men suspected to be crazed in brain                            130    those walks well worthy to be prized and loved   regrettedthat word too was on my tongue   but they were richly laden with all good   and cannot be remembered but with thanks   and gratitude and perfect joy of heart135   those walks in all their freshness now came back   like a returning spring when first i made   once more the circuit of our little lake   if ever happiness hath lodged with man   that day consummate happiness was mine                            140   widespreading steady calm contemplative   the sun was set or setting when i left   our cottage door and evening soon brought on   a sober hour not winning or serene   for cold and raw the air was and untuned                         145   but as a face we love is sweetest then   when sorrow damps it or whatever look   it chance to wear is sweetest if the heart   have fulness in herself even so with me   it fared that evening gently did my soul                          150   put off her veil and selftransmuted stood   naked as in the presence of her god   while on i walked a comfort seemed to touch   a heart that had not been disconsolate   strength came where weakness was not known to be                  155   at least not felt and restoration came   like an intruder knocking at the door   of unacknowledged weariness i took   the balance and with firm hand weighed myself of that external scene which round me lay                       160   little in this abstraction did i see   remembered less but i had inward hopes   and swellings of the spirit was rapt and soothed   conversed with promises had glimmering views   how life pervades the undecaying mind                             165   how the immortal soul with godlike power   informs creates and thaws the deepest sleep   that time can lay upon her how on earth   man if he do but live within the light   of high endeavours

pastoral quiet mid the stir   of boldest projects and a peaceful end                            175   at last or glorious by endurance won   thus musing in a wood i sate me down   alone continuing there to muse the slopes   and heights meanwhile were slowly overspread   with darkness and before a rippling breeze                        180   the long lake lengthened out its hoary line   and in the sheltered coppice where i sate   around me from among the hazel leaves   now here now there moved by the straggling wind   came ever and anon a breathlike sound                            185   quick as the pantings of the faithful dog   the off and on companion of my walk   and such at times believing them to be   i turned my head to look if he were there   then into solemn thought i passed once more                       190    a freshness also found i at this time   in human life the daily life of those   whose occupations really i loved   the peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise   changed like a garden in the heat of spring                        195   after an eightdays absence for to omit   the things which were the same and yet appeared   fair otherwise amid this rural solitude   a narrow vale where each was known to all   twas not indifferent to a youthful mind                           200   to mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook   where an old man had used to sit alone   now vacant palefaced babes whom i had left   in arms now rosy prattlers at the feet   of a pleased grandame tottering up and down                       205   and growing girls whose beauty filched away   with all its pleasant promises was gone   to deck some slighted playmates homely cheek      yes i had something of a subtler sense   and often looking round was moved to smiles                        210   such as a delicate work of humour breeds   i read without design the opinions thoughts   of those plainliving people now observed   with clearer knowledge with another eye   i saw the quiet woodman in the woods                              215   the shepherd roam the hills with new delight   this chiefly did i note my greyhaired dame   saw her go forth to church or other work   of state equipped in monumental trim   short velvet cloak her bonnet of the like                      220   a mantle such as spanish cavaliers   wore in old time her smooth domestic life   affectionate without disquietude   her talk her business pleased me and no less   her clear though shallow stream of piety                           225   that ran on sabbath days a fresher course   with thoughts unfelt till now i saw her read   her bible on hot sunday afternoons   and loved the book when she had dropped asleep   and made of it a pillow for her head                              230      nor less do i remember to have felt   distinctly manifested at this time   a humanheartedness about my love   for objects hitherto the absolute wealth   of my own private being and no more                               235   which i had loved even as a blessed spirit   or angel if he were to dwell on earth   might love in individual happiness   but now there opened on me other thoughts   of change congratulation or regret                               240   a pensive feeling it spread far and wide   the trees the mountains shared it and the brooks   the stars of heaven now seen in

  yet in themselves less grateful i believe   than as they were a badge glossy and fresh                         285   of manliness and freedom all conspired   to lure my mind from firm habitual quest

would demand   some skill and longer time than may be spared   to paint these vanities and how they wrought   in haunts where they till now had been unknown   it seemed the very garments that i wore

turning of the road   so near that slipping back into the shade   of a thick hawthorn i could mark him well                        390   myself unseen he was of stature tall   a span above mans common measure tall   stiff lank and upright a more meagre man   was never seen before by night or day   long were his arms pallid his hands his mouth                    395   looked ghastly in the moonlight from behind   a milestone propped him i could also ken   that he was clothed in military garb   though faded yet entire companionless   no dog attending by no staff sustained                           400   he stood and in his very dress appeared   a desolation a simplicity   to which the trappings of a gaudy world   make a strange background from his lips ere long   issued low muttered sounds as if of pain                          405   or some uneasy thought yet still his form   kept the same awful steadinessat his feet   his shadow lay and moved not from selfblame   not wholly free i watched him thus at length   subduing my hearts specious cowardice                            410   i left the shady nook where i had stood   and hailed him slowly from his restingplace   he rose and

soldiers tale   that in the tropic islands he had served   whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past   that on his landing he had been dismissed   and now was travelling towards his native home                    425   this heard i said in pity come with me   he stooped and straightway from the ground took up   an oaken staff by me yet unobserved   a staff which must have dropt from his slack hand   and lay till now neglected in the grass                           430   though weak his step and cautious he appeared   to travel without pain and i beheld   with an astonishment but ill suppressed   his ghostly figure moving at my side   nor could i while we journeyed thus forbear                      435   to turn from present hardships to the past   and speak of war battle and pestilence   sprinkling this talk with questions better spared   on what he might himself have seen or felt   he all the while was in demeanour calm                            440   concise in answer

comfort i entreated that henceforth   he would not linger in the public ways                            455   but ask for timely furtherance and help   such as his state required at this reproof   with the same ghastly mildness in his look   he said my trust is in the god of heaven   and in the eye of him who passes me                              460      the cottage door was speedily unbarred   and now the soldier touched his hat once more   with his lean hand and in a faltering voice   whose tone bespake reviving interests   till then unfelt he thanked me i returned                        465   the farewell blessing of the patient man   and so we parted back i cast a look   and lingered near the door a little space   then sought with quiet heart my distant home

of william wordsworths the poets son who told me that if asked where the dames house was he would have pointed to a spot on the eastern side of the valley and out of the village altogether his father having taken him from rydal mount to hawkshead when a mere boy and pointed out that spot doubtless wordsworth took his son to the cottage at colthouse where anne tyson died as the earlier abode in

exactly as described on the opposite side of the lane leading to the   cottage and a few steps above it is a narrow passage through some   new stone buildings on emerging from this you meet a small garden   the farther side of which is bounded by the brook confined on both   sides by larger flags and also covered by flags of the same coniston   formation through the interstices of which you may see and hear the   stream running freely the upper flags are now used as a footpath and   lead by another passage back into the village no doubt the garden has   been reduced in size by the use of that part of it fronting the lane   for building purposes the stream before it enters the area of   buildings and gardens is open by the lane side and seemingly comes   from the hills to the westwards the large flags are extremely hard   and durable and it is probably that the very flags which paved the   channel in wordsworths time may still be doing the same duty  the house adjoining this garden was not dame tysons but a mr watsons possibly however some of the boys had free access to the latter so that wordsworth could speak of it as our garden or dame tyson may have rented it see note ii in

himself had oftentimes given way                            55   to kindred hauntings whereupon i told   that once in the stillness of a summers noon   while i was seated in a rocky cave   by the seaside perusing so it chanced   the famous history of the errant knight                             60   recorded by cervantes these same thoughts   beset me and to height unusual rose   while listlessly i sate and having closed   the book had turned my eyes toward the wide sea   on poetry and geometric truth                                      65   and their high privilege of lasting life   from all internal injury exempt   i mused upon these chiefly and at length   my senses yielding to the sultry air   sleep seized me and i passed into a dream                         70   i saw before me stretched a boundless plain   of sandy wilderness all black and void   and as i looked around distress and fear   came creeping over me when at my side   close at my side an uncouth shape appeared                         75   upon a dromedary mounted high   he seemed an arab of the bedouin tribes   a lance he bore and underneath one arm   a stone and in the opposite hand a shell   of a surpassing brightness at the sight                            80   much i rejoiced not doubting but a guide   was present one who with unerring skill   would through the desert lead me and while yet   i looked and looked selfquestioned what this freight   which the newcomer carried through the waste                       85   could mean the arab told me that the stone   to give it in the language of the dream   was euclids elements and this said he   is something of more worth and at the word   stretched forth the shell so beautiful in shape                   90   in colour so resplendent with command   that i should hold it to my ear i did so   and heard that instant in an unknown tongue   which yet i understood articulate sounds   a loud prophetic blast of harmony                                  95   an ode in passion uttered which foretold   destruction to the children of the earth   by deluge now at hand no sooner ceased   the song than the arab with calm look declared   that all would come to pass of which the voice                     100   had given forewarning and that he himself   was going then to bury those two books   the one that held acquaintance with the stars   and

exhilarate the spirit and to soothe   through every clime the heart of human kind   while this was uttering strange as it may seem                   110   i wondered not although i plainly saw   the one to be a stone the other a shell   nor doubted once but that they both were books   having a perfect faith in all that passed   far stronger now grew the desire i felt                          115   to cleave unto this man but when i prayed   to share his enterprise he hurried on   reckless of me i followed not unseen   for oftentimes he cast a backward look   grasping his twofold treasurelance in rest                     120   he rode i keeping pace with him and now   he to my fancy had become the knight   whose tale cervantes tells yet not the knight   but was an arab of the desert too   of these was neither and was both at once                        125   his countenance meanwhile grew more disturbed   and looking backwards when he looked mine eyes   saw over half the wilderness

waste   with the fleet waters of a drowning world   in chase of him whereat i waked in terror   and saw the sea before me and the book   in which i had been reading at my side d

daviesed   footnote d mr a j duffield the translator of don quixote wrote me the following letter on wordsworth and cervantes which i transcribe in full    so far as i can learn wordsworth had not read any critical work on   don quixote before he wrote the fifth book of the prelude a nor   for that matter had any criticism of the masterpiece of cervantes   then appeared yet wordsworth                       by patient exercise     of study and hard thought    has given us not only a most poetical insight into the real nature of   the illustrious hidalgo of la mancha he has shown us that it was a   nature compacted of the madman and the poet and this in language so   appropriate that the consideration of it cannot fail to give pleasure   to all who have found a reason for weighing wordsworths words    he demands             oh why hath not the mind     some element to stamp her image on    then falls asleep his senses yielding to the sultry air and he   sees before him                  stretched a boundless plain     of sandy wilderness all black and void     and as i looked around distress and fear     came creeping over me when at my side     close at my side an uncouth shape appeared     upon a dromedary mounted high     he seemed an arab     here we have the plains of montiel and the poet realising all that   don quixote felt on that day of july the hottest of the year when   he first set out on his quest and met with nothing worth recording      the uncouth shape    is of course the don himself      the dromedary    is rozinante and      the arab    doubtless is cid hamete benengeli    taking such an one for the guide               who with unerring skill     would through the desert lead me    is a most sweet play of humour like to the lambent flame of his whose   satire was as a summer breath and who smiled all the time he wrote   although he wrote chiefly in a prison      the loud prophetic blast of harmony    is doubtless a continuation of this humour down to the lines      nor doubted once but that they both were books     having a perfect faith in all that passed    our poet now becomes positive                             lance in rest     he rode i keeping pace with him and now     he to my fancy had become the knight     whose tale cervantes tells yet not the knight     but was an arab of the desert too     of these was neither and was both at once    this is absolutely true and was one of the earliest complaints made a   century and a half ago when spaniards began to criticise their one   great book they could not tell at times whether don quixote was   speaking or cervantes or cid hamete benengeli      a bed of glittering light    is a delightful description of the attitude of don quixotes mind   towards external nature while passing through the desert      it is said he the waters of the deep     gathering upon us    it was of course only the mirage but this he changed to suit his   own purpose into the waters of the deep as he changed the row of   castilian windmills into giants and the roar of the fulling mills   into the din of war    wordsworth is now awake from his dream but turning all he saw in it   into a reality as only the poet can he feels that      reverence was due to a being thus employed     and thought that in the blind and awful lair     of such a madness reason did lie couched    here again is a most profound description of the creation of   cervantes don quixote was mad but his was a madness that proceeded   from that blind and awful lair a disordered stomach rather than   from an injured brain had don quixote not forsaken the exercise of   the chase and early rising if he had not taken to eating chestnuts at   night cold spiced meat together with onions and ollas podridas   then proceeding to read exciting unnatural tales of love and war he   would not have gone mad    but his reason only lay couched not overthrown only give him a   dose of the balsam of fierabras his reason shall spring out of its   lair like a lion from out its hidingplace as indeed it did and you   then have that wonderful piece of rhetoric which describes the army   of alifanfaron in the eighteenth chapter part i    there are many other things worthy of note such as                                 crazed     by love and feeling and internal thought     protracted among endless solitudes    all of which are fit epithets blessed in the marriage of pure words   which the author of the prelude without any special learning or   personal knowledge of spain has given us and are so striking as to   compel us once again to go to wordsworth and say we do not all   understand thee yet not all that thou hast given us    very truly yours a j duffield  ed   footnote e compare paradise

birkett at penrith his mother and dame birkett taught him to read and trained his infant memory mr gilbanks also gave him elementary instruction while his father made him commit to memory portions of the english poets at hawkshead he read english literature learned latin and mathematics and wrote both english and latin verse there was little or no method and no mechanical or artificial drill in his early education though he was taught both languages and mathematics he was left as free to range the happy pastures of literature as to range the hawkshead woods on autumn nights in pursuit of woodcocks it is likely that the reference in the above passage is to his education both in childhood and in youth although specially to the former in his autobiographical memoranda wordsworth says    of my earliest days at school i have little to say but that they   were very happy ones chiefly because i was left at liberty then and   in the vacations to read whatever books i liked for example i read   all fieldings works don quixote  gil blas and any part of   swift that i liked gullivers travels and the tale of a tub being   both much to my taste  as wordsworth alludes to coleridges education along with his own in the season of unperilous choice the reference is probably to coleridges early time at the vicarage of ottery st marys devonshire and at the grammar school there as well

hawkshead school in which wordsworth was taught for eight yearsfrom 1778 to 1786was founded by archbishop sandys of york in 1585 and the building is still very much as it was in wordsworths time the main schoolroom is on the ground floor one small chamber on the first floor was used in the end of last century by the head master as a private classroom for teaching a few advanced pupils in another is a small library formed in part by the donations of the scholars it having been a custom for each pupil to present a volume on leaving the school or to send one afterwards very probably one of the volumes now in the library was presented by wordsworth there are several which were presented by his schoolfellows during the years in which wordsworth was at hawkshead the master in 1877 promised me that he would search through his somewhat musty treasures to see if he could discover a book with the poets autograph but i never heard of his success on the wall of the room containing the library is

there broke off   the only track now visible was one                                 570   that from the torrents further brink held forth   conspicuous invitation to ascend   a lofty mountain after brief delay   crossing the unbridged stream that road we took   and clomb with eagerness till anxious fears                       575   intruded for we failed to overtake   our comrades gone before by fortunate chance   while every moment added doubt to doubt   a peasant met us from whose mouth we learned   that to the spot which had perplexed us first                      580   we must descend and there should find the road   which in the stony channel of the stream   lay a few steps and then along its banks   and that our future course all plain to sight   was downwards with the current of that stream                    585   loth to believe what we so grieved to hear   for still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds   we questioned him again and yet again   but every word that from

high the sullen water far beneath   on which a dull red image of the moon                              705   lay bedded changing oftentimes its form   like an uneasy snake from hour to hour   we sate and sate wondering as if the night   had been ensnared by witchcraft on the rock   at last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep                    710   but could not sleep tormented by the stings   of insects which with noise like that of noon   filled all the woods the cry of unknown birds   the mountains more by blackness visible   and their own size than any outward light                        715   the breathless wilderness of clouds the clock   that told with unintelligible voice   the widely parted hours the noise of streams   and sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand   that did not leave us free from personal fear                     720   and lastly the withdrawing moon that set   before us while she still was high in heaven   these were our food and such a summers night ii   followed that pair of golden days that shed   on comos lake and all that round it lay                         725   their fairest softest happiest influence      but here i must break off and bid farewell   to days each offering some new sight or fraught   with some untried adventure in a course   prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow                        730   checked our unwearied

from the homestead bears   a toilsome burden up the craggy ways   and deals it out their regular nourishment   strewn on the frozen snow and when the spring   looks out and all the pastures dance with

his home   at dayspring and no sooner doth the sun                          235   begin to strike him with a firelike heat   than he lies down upon some shining rock   and breakfasts with his dog when

labour interchanged   with that majestic indolence so dear                               255   to native man a rambling schoolboy thus   i felt his presence in his own domain   as of a lord and master or a power   or genius under nature under god   presiding and severest solitude                                   260   had more commanding looks when he was there   when up the lonely brooks on rainy days   angling i went or trod the trackless hills   by mists bewildered x suddenly mine eyes   have glanced upon him distant a few steps                         265   in size a giant stalking through thick fog   his sheep like greenland bears or as he stepped   beyond the boundary line of some hillshadow   his form hath flashed upon me glorified   by the deep radiance of the setting sun                           270   or him have i descried in distant sky   a solitary object and sublime   above all height like an aerial cross   stationed alone upon a spiry rock   of the chartreuse for worship y thus was man                   275   ennobled outwardly before my sight   and thus my heart was early introduced   to an unconscious love and reverence   of human nature hence the human form   to me became an index of delight                                  280   of grace and honour power and worthiness   meanwhile this creaturespiritual almost   as those of books but more exalted far   far more

lot not here   alone that something of a better life   perhaps was round me than it is the privilege   of most to move in but that first i looked                        315   at man through objects that were great or fair   first communed with him by their help and thus   was founded a sure safeguard and defence   against the weight of meanness selfish cares   coarse manners vulgar passions that

crowded life   and those ensuing laughters and contempts   selfpleasing which if we would wish to think   with a due reverence on earths rightful lord                     335   here placed to be the inheritor of heaven   will not permit us but pursue the mind   that to devotion willingly would rise   into the temple and the temples heart      yet deem not friend that human kind with me

magic cave   or palace built by fairies of the rock   nor could i have been bribed to disenchant   the spectacle by visiting the spot                               420   thus wilful fancy in no

  assumed the body and venerable name                                 40   of a republic d lamentable crimes   tis true had gone before this hour dire work   of massacre e in which the senseless sword   was prayed to as a judge but these were past   earth free from them for ever as was thought45   ephemeral monsters to be seen but once   things that could only show themselves and die      cheered with this hope to paris i returned f   and ranged with ardour heretofore unfelt   the spacious city and in progress passed                           50   the prison where the unhappy monarch lay   associate with his children and his wife   in bondage and the palace lately stormed   with roar of cannon by a furious host   i crossed the square an empty area then g                      55   of the carrousel where so late had lain   the dead upon the dying heaped and gazed   on this and other spots as doth a man   upon a volume whose contents he knows   are memorable but from him locked up                              60   being written in a tongue he cannot read   so that he questions the mute leaves with pain   and half upbraids their silence but that night   i felt most deeply in what world i was   what ground i trod on and what air i breathed                     65   high was my room and lonely near the roof   of a large mansion or hotel a lodge   that would have pleased me in more quiet times   nor was it wholly without pleasure then   with unextinguished taper i kept watch                             70   reading at intervals the fear gone by   pressed on me almost like a fear to come   i thought of those september massacres   divided from me by one little month  h   saw them and touched the rest was conjured up                      75   from tragic fictions or true history   remembrances and dim admonishments   the horse is taught his manage and no star   of wildest course but treads back his own steps   for the spent hurricane the air provides                            80   as fierce a successor the tide retreats   but to return out of its hidingplace   in the great deep all things have secondbirth   the earthquake is not satisfied at once   and in this way i wrought upon myself                              85   until i seemed to hear a voice that cried   to the whole city sleep no more the trance   fled with the voice to which it had given birth   but vainly comments of a calmer mind   promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness                        90   the place all hushed and silent as it was   appeared unfit for the repose of night   defenceless as a wood where tigers roam      with early morning towards the palacewalk   of orléans eagerly i turned as yet                                 95   the streets were still not so those long arcades   there mid a peal of illmatched sounds and cries   that greeted me on entering i could hear   shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng   bawling denunciation of the crimes                               100   of maximilian robespierre the hand   prompt as the voice held forth a printed speech   the same that had been recently pronounced   when robespierre not ignorant for what mark   some words of indirect reproof had been                            105   intended rose in hardihood and dared   the man who had an ill surmise of him   to bring his charge in openness whereat   when a dead pause ensued and no one stirred   in silence of all present from his seat                           110   louvet walked single through the avenue   and took his station in the tribune saying   i robespierre accuse thee i well is known   the inglorious issue of that charge and how   he who had launched the startling thunderbolt                    115   the one bold man whose voice the attack had sounded   was left without a follower to discharge   his perilous duty and retire lamenting   that heavens best aid is wasted upon men   who to themselves are false k                   but these are things                               120   of which i speak only as they were storm   or sunshine to my individual mind   no further let me then relate that now   in some sort seeing with my proper eyes   that liberty and life and death would soon                       125   to the remotest corners of the land   lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled   the capital city what was struggled for   and by what combatants victory must be won   the indecision on their part whose aim                             130   seemed best and the straightforward path of those   who in attack or in defence were strong   through their impietymy inmost soul   was agitated yea i could almost   have prayed that throughout earth upon all men                    135   by patient exercise of reason made   worthy of liberty all spirits filled   with zeal expanding in truths holy light   the gift of tongues might fall and power arrive   from the four quarters of the winds to do                          140   for france what without help she could not do   a work of honour think not that to this   i added work of safety from all doubt   or trepidation for the end of things   far was i far as angels are from guilt                           145      yet did i grieve nor only grieved but thought   of opposition and of remedies   an insignificant stranger and obscure   and one moreover little graced with power   of eloquence even in my native speech                             150   and all unfit for tumult or intrigue   yet would i at this time with willing heart   have undertaken for a cause so great   service however dangerous i revolved   how much the destiny of man had still                              155   hung upon single persons that there was   transcendent to all local patrimony   one nature as there is one sun in heaven   that objects even as they are great thereby   do come within the reach of humblest eyes                         160   that man is only weak through his mistrust   and want of hope where evidence divine   proclaims to him that hope should be most sure   nor did the inexperience of my youth   preclude conviction that a spirit strong                         165   in hope and trained to noble aspirations   a spirit thoroughly faithful to itself   is for societys unreasoning herd   a domineering instinct serves at once   for way and guide a fluent receptacle                             170   that gathers up each petty straggling rill   and vein of water glad to be rolled on   in safe obedience that a mind whose rest   is where it ought to be in selfrestraint   in circumspection and simplicity                                  175   falls rarely in entire discomfiture   below its aim or meets with from without   a treachery that foils it or defeats   and lastly if the means on human will   frail human will dependent should betray                          180   him who too boldly trusted them i felt   that mid the loud distractions of the world   a sovereign voice subsists within the soul   arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong   of life and death in majesty severe                               185   enjoining as may best promote the aims   of truth and justice either sacrifice   from whatsoever region of our cares   or our infirm affections nature pleads   earnest and blind against the stern decree

added no farewell to his parting counsel   but said to me my head will soon lie low   and when i saw the turf that covered him                          540   after the lapse of full eight years b

       290   of those led palfreys that should bear us home   my brothers and myself there rose a crag   that from the meetingpoint of two highways f   ascending overlooked them both far stretched   thither uncertain on which road to fix                            295   my expectation thither i repaired   scoutlike and gained the summit twas a day   tempestuous dark and wild and on the grass   i sate halfsheltered by a naked wall   upon my right hand couched a single sheep                         300   upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood   with those companions at my side i watched   straining my eyes intensely as the mist   gave intermitting prospect of the copse   and plain beneath ere we to school returned305   that dreary timeere we had been ten days   sojourners in my fathers house he died   and i and my three brothers orphans then   followed his body to the grave the event   with all the sorrow that it brought appeared                      310   a chastisement and when i called to mind   that day so lately past when from the crag   i looked in such anxiety of hope   with trite reflections of morality   yet in the deepest passion i bowed low                            315   to god who thus corrected my desires   and afterwards the wind and sleety rain   and all the business of the elements   the single sheep and the one blasted tree   and the bleak music from that old stone wall                      320   the noise of wood and water and the mist   that on the line of each of those two roads   advanced in such indisputable shapes   all these were kindred spectacles and sounds   to which i oft repaired and thence would drink                   325   as at a fountain and on winter nights   down to this very time when storm and rain   beat on my roof or haply at noonday   while in a grove i walk whose lofty trees   laden with summers thickest foliage rock                         330   in a strong wind some working of the spirit   some inward

1783 but the locality is difficult to determine it may have been one or other of two places wordsworths father died at penrith and it was there that the sons went for their christmas holiday the road from penrith to hawkshead was by kirkstone pass and ambleside and the led palfreys sent to take the boys home would certainly come through the latter town now there are only two roads from ambleside to hawkshead which meet at a point about a mile north of hawkshead called in the ordnance map outgate the eastern road is now chiefly used by carriages being less hilly and better made than the western one the latter would be quite as convenient as the former for horses if one were to walk out from hawkshead village to the place where the two roads separate at outgate and then ascend the ridge between them he would find several places from which he could overlook both roads far stretched were the view not now intercepted by numerous plantations the latter are of comparatively recent growth dr cradockto whom i am indebted for this and for many other suggestions as to localities alluded to by wordsworththinks that    a point marked on the map as high crag between the two roads and   about threequarters of a mile from their point of divergence answers   the description as well as any other it may be nearly two miles from   hawkshead a distance of which an active eager schoolboy would think   nothing the blasted hawthorn and the naked wall are probably   things of the past as much as the single sheep  doubtless this may be the spota green rocky knoll with a steep face to the north where a quarry is wrought and with a plantation to the east it commands a view of both roads the other possible place is a crag not a quarter of a mile from outgate a little to the right of the place where the two roads divide a low wall runs up across it to the top dividing a plantation of oak hazel and ash from the firs that crown the summit these firs which are larch and spruce seem all of this century the top of the crag may have been bare when wordsworth lived at hawkshead but at the foot of the path along the dividing wall there are a few probably older trees and a solitary walk beneath them at noon or dusk is almost as suggestive to the imagination as repose under the yews of borrowdale listening to the mountain flood on glaramara there one may still hear the bleak music from the old stone wall and the noise of wood and water while the loud dry wind whistles through the underwood or moans amid the fir trees of the crag on the summit of which there is a blasted hawthorn tree it may be difficult now to determine the precise spot to which the boy wordsworth climbed on that eventful dayafterwards so significant to him and from the events of which he says he drank as at a fountainbut i think it may have been to one or other of these two crags see however mr rawnsleys conjecture in note v in the appendix to this volume p 391ed

once more in man an object of delight   of pure imagination and of love                                   50   and as the horizon of my mind enlarged   again i took the intellectual eye   for my

the natural abodes of men   fields with their rural works b recalled to mind   my earliest notices with these compared   the observations made in later youth                              105   and to that day continuedfor the time   had never been when throes of mighty nations   and the worlds tumult unto me could yield   how far soeer transported and possessed   full measure of content but still i craved                        110   an intermingling of distinct regards   and truths of individual sympathy   nearer ourselves such often might be gleaned   from the great city else it must have proved   to me a heartdepressing wilderness                               115   but much was wanting therefore did i turn   to you ye pathways and ye lonely roads   sought you enriched with everything i prized   with human kindnesses and simple joys      oh next to one dear state of bliss vouchsafed                  120   alas to few in this untoward world   the bliss of walking daily in lifes prime   through field or forest with the maid we love   while yet our hearts are young while yet we breathe   nothing but happiness in some lone nook                          125   deep vale or any where the home of both   from which it would be misery to stir   oh next to such enjoyment of our youth   in my esteem next to such dear delight   was that of wandering on from day to day                           130   where i could meditate in peace and cull   knowledge that step by step might lead me on   to wisdom or as lightsome as a bird   wafted upon the wind from distant lands   sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves                135   which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn   and when that pleasant toil had ceased to please   converse with men where if we meet a face   we almost meet a friend on naked heaths   with long long ways before by cottage bench                      140   or wellspring where the weary traveller rests      who doth not love to follow with his eye   the windings of a public way the sight   familiar object as it is hath wrought   on my imagination since the morn                                   145   of childhood when a disappearing line   one daily present to my eyes that crossed   the naked summit of a faroff hill   beyond the limits that my feet had trod   was like an invitation into space                                  150   boundless or guide into eternity c   yes something of the grandeur which invests   the mariner who sails the roaring sea   through storm and darkness early in my mind   surrounded too the wanderers of the earth                       155   grandeur as much and loveliness far more   awed have i been by strolling bedlamites   from many other uncouth vagrants passed   in fear have walked with quicker step but why   take note of this when i began to enquire                        160   to watch and question those i met and speak   without reserve to them the lonely roads   were open schools in which i daily read   with most delight the passions of mankind   whether by words looks sighs or tears revealed                165   there saw into the depth of human souls   souls that appear to have no depth at all   to careless eyes andnow convinced at heart   how little those formalities to which   with overweening trust alone we give                               170   the name of education have to do   with real feeling and just sense how vain   a correspondence with the talking world   proves to the most and called to make good search   if mans estate by doom of nature yoked                           175   with toil be therefore yoked with ignorance   if virtue be indeed so hard to rear   and intellectual strength so rare a boon   i prized such walks still more for there i found   hope to my hope and to my pleasure peace                          180   and steadiness and healing and repose   to every angry passion there i heard   from mouths of men obscure and lowly truths   replete with honour sounds in unison   with loftiest promises of good and fair                           185      there are who think that strong affection love d   known by whatever name is falsely deemed   a gift to use a term which they would use   of vulgar nature that its growth requires   retirement leisure language purified                             190   by manners studied and elaborate   that whoso feels such passion in its strength   must live within the very light and air   of courteous usages refined by art   true is it where oppression worse than death                      195   salutes the being at his birth where grace   of culture hath been utterly unknown   and poverty and labour in excess   from day to day preoccupy the ground   of the affections and to natures self                            200   oppose a deeper nature there indeed   love cannot be nor does it thrive with ease   among the close and overcrowded haunts   of cities where the human heart is sick   and the eye feeds it not and cannot feed                         205   yes in those wanderings deeply did i feel   how we mislead each other above all   how books mislead us seeking their reward   from judgments of the wealthy few who see   by artificial lights how they debase                              210   the many for the pleasure of those few   effeminately level down the truth   to certain general notions for the sake   of being understood at once or else   through want of better knowledge in the heads                      215   that framed them nattering selfconceit with words   that while they most ambitiously set forth   extrinsic differences the outward marks   whereby society has parted man   from man neglect the universal heart                             220      here calling up to mind what then i saw   a youthful traveller and see daily now   in the familiar circuit of my home   here might i pause and bend in reverence   to nature and the power of human minds                           225   to men as they are men within themselves   how oft high service is performed within   when all the external man is rude in show   not like a temple rich with pomp and gold   but a mere mountain chapel that protects                          230   its simple worshippers from sun and shower   of these said i shall be my song of these   if future years mature me for the task   will i record the praises making verse   deal boldly with substantial things in truth                      235   and sanctity of passion speak of these   that justice may be done

walks of homely life   still higher men for contemplation framed   shy and unpractised in the strife of phrase   meek men whose very souls perhaps would sink   beneath them summoned to such

unregarded by the world      also about this time did i receive   convictions still more strong than heretofore                     280   not only that the inner frame is good   and graciously composed but that no less   nature for all conditions wants not power   to consecrate if we have eyes to see   the outside of her creatures and to breathe                       285   grandeur upon the very humblest face   of human life i felt that the array   of act and circumstance and visible form   is mainly to the pleasure of the mind   what passion makes them that meanwhile the forms

dr henry dodgson of cockermouth referring to my suggestion that it might be the road from cockermouth to bridekirk he wrote july 1878    i scarcely think that road answers to the description the hill over   which it goes is not naked but well wooded and has probably been so   for many years besides it is not visible from wordsworths house   nor from the garden behind it this garden extends from the house to   the river derwent from which it is separated by a wall with a raised   terraced walk on the inner side and nearly on a level with the top i   understand that this terrace was in existence in the poets time   its direction is nearly due east and west and looking eastward from   it there is a hill which bounds the view in that direction and which   fully corresponds to the description in the prelude it is from one   and a half to two miles distant of considerable height is bare and   destitute of trees and has a road going directly over its summit as   seen from the terrace in wordsworths garden this road is now used   only as a footpath but fifty or sixty years ago it was the highroad   to isel a hamlet on the derwent about three and a half miles from   cockermouth in the direction of bassenthwaite lake the hill is   locally called the hay but on the ordnance map it is marked watch   hill  there can be little doubt as to the accuracy of this suggestion no other hillroad is visible from the house or garden at cockermouth the view from the front of the old mansion is limited by houses doubtless more so now than in last century but there is no hill towards the lorton fells on the south or southeast with a road over it visible from any part of the town besides as this was a very early experience of wordsworthsit was in the morn of childhood that the road was daily present to his sightit must have been seen either from the house or from the garden it is almost certain that he refers to the path over the hay or watch hill which he and his sister emmeline could see daily from the high terrace at the foot of their garden in cockermouth where they used to chase the butterfly and visit the sparrows nest in the impervious shelter of privet and roses  dr cradock wrote to me january 1886    an old map of the county round about keswick including cockermouth   dated 1789 entirely confirms dr dodgsons statement the road over   hay hill is marked clearly as a carriage road to isel the miles are   marked on the map the summit of the hill is naked for the map   marks woods where they existed and none are marked on hay   hilled

the sky   but undiscouraged we began to climb   the mountainside the mist soon girt us round                     15   and after ordinary travellers talk   with our conductor pensively we sank   each into commerce with his private thoughts   thus did we breast the ascent and by myself   was nothing either seen or heard that checked                       20   those musings or diverted save that

foremost of the band   when at my feet the ground appeared to brighten                    35   and with a step or two seemed brighter still   nor was time given to ask or learn the cause   for instantly a light upon the turf   fell like a flash and lo as i looked up   the moon hung naked in a firmament                                  40   of azure without cloud and at my feet   rested a silent sea of hoary mist   a hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved   all over this still ocean and beyond   far far beyond the solid vapours stretched                       45   in headlands tongues and promontory shapes   into the main atlantic that appeared   to dwindle and give up his majesty   usurped upon far as the sight could reach   not so the ethereal vault encroachment none                        50   was there nor loss only the inferior stars   had disappeared or shed a fainter light   in the clear presence of the fullorbed moon   who from her sovereign elevation gazed   upon the billowy ocean as it lay                                   55   all meek and silent save that through a rift   not distant from the shore whereon we stood   a fixed abysmal gloomy

most   difficult to construe i ever met with but just what you would expect   from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with   great things there is a mistake in the world concerning the italian   language the poetry of dante and michael angelo proves that if there   be little majesty and strength in italian verse the fault is in the   authors and not in the tongue i can translate and have translated   two books of ariosto at the rate nearly of one hundred lines a day   but so much meaning has been put by michael angelo into so little   room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that i found   the difficulty of translating him insurmountable i attempted at   least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed i have   sent you the only one i was able to finish it is far from being the   best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me  the last of the three sonnets probably belongs to the year 1804 as it is quoted in a letter to sir george beaumont dated grasmere august 6 the year is not given but i think it must have been 1804 as he says that within the last month he had written 700 additional lines of the

   that unruly child of mountain birth   the famous brook who soon as he was boxed   within our garden found himself at once   as if by trick insidious and unkind   stripped of his voice and left to dimple down       i looked at him and smiled and smiled again       ha quoth i pretty prisoner are you there     i was not quite content with dr cradocks identification of this   brook or of the garden partly because beyond the present garden   square i found on going up the brook other garden squares which   were much more likely to have been the garden belonging to anne   tysons cottage and because in these garden plots the stream was not   stripped of his voice by the covering of coniston flags as is the   case lower down towards the market place and partly becauseas you   noticeyou can both hear and see the stream through the interstices   of the flags and that it can hardly be described by one who will   listen as stripped of its voice    at the same time i was bound to admit that in comparing the voice of   the stream here in the channel paved by mans officious care with   the sound of it up in the fields beyond the vicarage nearer its   birthplace it certainly might be said to be softer voiced and as   the poet speaks of it as that unruly child of mountain birth it   looks as if he too had realised the difference    but whilst i thought that the identification of dr cradock and   yourself was very happy in absence of other possibilities i had not   thought that wordsworth would describe the stream as dimpling down   or address it as a pretty prisoner a smaller stream seemed   necessary    it was therefore not a little curious that in poking about among   the garden plots on the west bank of the stream fronting as nearly   as i could judge anne tysons cottage to seek for remains of the ash   tree in which so often the poetas he lay awake on summer   nightshad watched the moon in splendour couched among the leaves   rocking with every impulse of the breeze i not only stumbled upon   the remains of an ash treenow a pollardwhich is evidently   sprung from a larger tree since decayed and which for all i know may   be one of the actual parts of the ancient tree itself but also had   the good luck to fall into conversation with a certain isaac hodgson   who volunteered the following information    first that wordsworth it was commonly said had lodged part of his   time with one betty braithwaite in the very house called church hill   house    she was a widow and kept a confectionery shop and did a deal of   baking he believed    secondly that there was a little patch of garden at the back of the   house with a famous spring wellstill called old bettys wellin   it and that only a few paces from where i was then standing by the   pollard ash    on jumping over the fence i found myself on the western side of the   quaint old church hill house with magnificent views of the whole of   the western side of hawkshead vale grassy swell and wooded rises   taking the eye up to the moorland ridge between us and coniston    but said i what about bettys well oh said my friend   thats a noted spring that never freezes and always runs we all   drink of it and neighbours send to it here it is he continued   and gazing down i saw a little dripping well of water lustrous   clear coming evidently in continuous force from the springs or secret   channels up hill pausing for a moment at the trough thence falling   into a box or channel paved by mans officious care and in a moment   out of sight and soundless to pursue its way stripped of its   voice towards the main town beck that ran at the northeast border   of the garden plot ha pretty prisoner and the words dimple down   came to my mind at once as appropriate old bettys well gave the   keynote of the famous brook and boxed within our garden seemed   an appropriate and exact description    trace of                               the sunny seat     round the stone table under the dark pine    was there none not so however the ash tree the remains of which i   have spoken of from the bedroom of betty braithwaites house the boy   could have watched the moon                               while to and fro     in the dark summit of the waving tree     she rocked with every impulse of the breeze    in old times said my friend the wall fence ran across the garden   just beyond this spring well so you see it was but a small spot was   this garden close yes but the                            crowd of things     about its narrow precincts all beloved    were known the better and loved the more on that account certainly   thought i to myself here is the famous spring a brook that   wordsworth must have known and that may have been the centre of   memory to him in his description of those early hawkshead days with   its metaphor of fountain life    may we not as we gaze on this little fountain well in a garden plot   at the back of one of the grey huts of this one dear vale point as   with a wand and say      this portion of the river of his mind     came from yon fountain    is it not possible that the old dame whose      clear though shallow stream of piety     ran on the sabbath days a fresher course    was betty braithwaite the aged dame who owned the cottage hard by   the following additional extract from a letter of mr rawnsleys christmas 1882 casts light both on the hawkshead beck and fountain and on the stone seat in the market square referred to in the fourth book of the prelude    postlethwaite of the sun inn at hawkshead has a father aged 82 who   can remember that there was a stone bench not called old bettys   but old janes stone on which she used to spread nuts and cakes for   the scholars of the grammar school but that it did not stand where   the market hall now is and no one ever remembers a stone or   stonebench standing there this stone or stonebench stood about   opposite the red lion inn in front of the little row of houses that   run east and west just as you pass out of the village in a northerly   direction by the red lion this stone or stonebench is not associated   with dark pine trees but they may have passed away root and branch in   an earlier generation    next and most interesting i think as showing that i was right in the   matter of the famous fountain or spring in the garden behind betty   braithwaites house there exists in hawkshead near this house a   coveredin place or shed to which all the village repair for their   drinkingwater and always have done so it is known by the name of   the spout house and the waterwhich flows all the year from a   longish spout with an overflow one by its sidecomes direct from the   little drop well in betty bs garden after having its voice stripped   and boxed therein and falling out of the spout into a deep stone   basin and culvert runs through the town to join the town beck    so wedded are the hawkshead folk to this their familiar fountainhead   that though water is supplied in standpipes now from a reservoir the   folks wont have it and come here to this spouthouse bucket and jug   in hand morn noon and night i have never seen anything so like a   continental scene at the gathering at hawkshead spouthouse    lastly there is a very aged thorntree in the churchyardblown over   but propped upin which the forefathers of the hamlet used to sit as   boys in the thorn that is not the churchyard and which has been   worn smooth by many hawkshead generations the tradition is that   wordsworth used to sit a deal in it when at school  ed                                               note iiithe hawkshead morning walk summer vacation   see p 197 the prelude book iv ll 32338   if the farmhouse where wordsworth spent the evening before this memorable morning walk was either at elterwater or high arnside and the homeward pathway led across the ridge of ironkeld either by the old mountain road now almost disused or over the pathless fells there are two points from either of which the sea might be seen in the distance the one is from the heights looking down to the duddon estuary across the coniston valley the other is from a spot nearer hawkshead where morecambe bay is visible in the former case the meadows and the lower grounds would be those in yewdale in the latter case they would be those between latterbarrow and hawkshead and on either alternative the solid mountains would be those of the coniston groupthe old man and wetherlam it is also possible that the course of the walk was over the latterbarrow fells or heights of colthouse but from the reference to the sunrise not unseen from the copse and field through which the homeward pathway wound it may be supposed that the course was southeast and therefore not over these fells when his back would have been to the sun dr cradocks note footnote t to book iv to the text p 197 sums up all that can be safely said but mr rawnsley has supplied me with the following interesting remarks    after a careful reading of the passage describing the poets return   from a festal night spent in some farmhouse beyond the hills i am   quite unable to say that the path from high arnside over the ironkeld   range entirely suits the description is it not possible that the lad   had schoolfellows whose parents lived in yewdale if he had and was   returning from the party in one of the yewdale farms he would as he   ascended towards tarn howes and faced about south to gain the main   coniston road by traversing the meadows between berwick ground and   the top of the hawkshead and coniston hill command a view of the sea   that lay laughing at a distance and near the solid   mountainswetherlam and coniston old manwould shine bright as the   clouds i think this is likely to have been the poets track because   he speaks of labourers going forth to till the fields and the yewdale   valley is one that is at its head chiefly arable so that he would   be likelier to have gazed on them there than in the vale of hawkshead   itself one is here howeveras in a former passage when we fixed on   yewdale as the one described as being a cultured valeobliged to   remember that in wordsworths boyhood wheat was grown more extensively   than is now the case in these parts of course the furness fell   above colthouse might have been the scene it is eminently suited to   the description  ed                                               note ivdorothy wordsworth at cambridge in 1808 the ash tree at st johns college   see p 224 the prelude book vi ll 7694   the following is an extract from a letter of dorothy wordsworths to lady beaumont at coleorton dated 14th august probably in 1808     we reached cambridge at halfpast nine in our way to the inn we   stopped at the gate of st johns college to set down one of our   passengers the stopping of the carriage roused me from a sleepy   musing and i was awestricken with the solemnity of the old gateway   and the light from a great distance within streaming along the   pavement when they told me it was the entrance to st johns   college i was still more affected by the gloomy yet beautiful sight   before me for i thought of my dearest brother in his youthful days   passing through that gateway to his home and i could have believed   that i saw him there even then as i had seen him in the first year of   his residence i met with mr clarkson at the inn and was you may   believe rejoiced to hear his voice at the coach door we supped   together and immediately after supper i went to bed and slept well   and at 8 oclock next morning went to trinity chapel there i stood   for many minutes in silence before the statue of newton while the   organ sounded i never saw a statue that gave me one hundredth part so   much pleasurebut pleasure that is not the word it is a sublime   sensationin harmony with sentiments of devotion to the divine being   and reverence for the holy places where he is worshipped we walked in   the groves all the morning and visited the colleges i sought out a   favourite ash tree which my brother speaks of in his poem on his own   lifea tree covered with ivy we dined with a fellow of peterhouse   in his rooms and after dinner i went to kings college chapel there   and everywhere else at cambridge i was even much more impressed with   the effect of the buildings than i had been formerly and i do believe   that this power of receiving an enlarged enjoyment from the sight of   buildings is one of the privileges of our later years i have this   moment received a letter from william  ed                                               note vthe meetingpoint of two highways   see p 353 the prelude book xii l 293   the following extract from a letter of mr rawnsleys casts important light on a difficult question of localization dr cradock is inclined now to select the outgate crag the second of the four places referred to by mr rawnsley but the first may have been the place and the extract which follows will show how much is yet to be done in this matter of localizing poetical allusions    as to                                  the crag     that from the meetingpoint of two highways     ascending overlooked them both far stretched    there seems to be no doubt but that we have four competitors for the   honour of being the place to which the poet                    impatient for the sight     of those led palfreys that should bear them home    repaired with his brothers                         one christmastime     on the glad eve of its dear holidays    and unless as it seems is quite possible from what one sees in other   of wordsworths poems he really stood on one of the crags and then   in his description drew the picture of the landscape at his feet from   his memory of what it was as seen from another of the vantage places   we need a high crag rising gradually or abruptly from the actual   meetingplace of two highways with if possible at this distance of   time a wallor traces of itquite at its summit i may mention   that the wallers in this country still give two hundred years as the   length of time that a dry wall will stand we need also traces of an   old thorn tree close by the wall too must be so placed on the   summit of the crag that as it faces the direction in which the lad is   looking for his palfrey it shall afford shelter to him against                    the sleety rain     and all the business of the elements    it is evident that the lad would be looking out in a northeasterly   direction i e towards the head of windermere and ambleside so that                         the mist     that on the line of each of those two roads     advanced in such indisputable shapes    was urged by a wind that found the poet at his lookout station glad   to have the wall between him and it further there must be in close   proximity wood and the sound of rushing water or the lapping of a   lake winddriven against the marge for the boy remembers that the   bleak music from that old stone wall was mingled with the noise of   wood and water the roads spoken of must be two highways and must be   capable of being seen for some distance unless as it is just   possible the epithet farstretched may be taken as applying not so   much to the roads as to the gradual ascent of the crag from the   meetingplace of the two highways    the scene from the crag must be extended and half plain half   woodland at least one gathers as much from the lines                    as the mist     gave intermitting prospect of the copse     and plain beneath    lastly it was a day of driving sleet and mist and this of itself   would necessitate that the poet and his brothers should only go to the   place close to which the ponies must pass or from which most plainly   the roads were visible    the boys too were              feverish and tired and restless    and a schoolboy to gain his point on such a day and on such an   errand does not take much account of a mile of country to be   travelled over    so that it is immaterial i think to make the distance from hawkshead   of either of the four crags or vantage grounds a factor in decision    the farther the lads were from home when they met their ponies the   longer ride back they would have and this to schoolboys is matter of   consideration at such times    taking then a survey of the ground of choice we have to decide   whether the crag in question is situated at the first division or main   split of the road from ambleside furthest from hawkshead or whether   at the place where the two roads converge again into one nearer   hawkshead    whether that is the crag above the pullwyke quarry at the junction   of the road to water barngates and the road to wray and outgate is to   be selected about two miles from hawkshead or whether we are to fix   on the spot you have chosen at the point about a mile northeast of   hawkshead called in the ordnance map outgate    of the two i incline to the former for these reasons the boys could   not be so certain of not missing the ponies at any other place than   here at pullwyke    the crag exactly answers the poets description a rising ground the   meetingplace of two highways for in the poets time the old   hawkshead and outgate road at the pullwyke corner ran at the very foot   of the rising ground roughly speaking parallel to and some 60 to 100   yards west of the present road from the pull to wray    it is true that no trace of wall is visible at its summit but the   summit has been planted since with trees and walls are often removed   at time of planting    the poet would have a full view of the main road down to and round   the pullwyke bay he would see the branch road from the fork as it   mounted the water barngates hill to the west and would see the other   road of the fork farstretched and going south    he would also have an extended view of copse and meadow land he   might if the wind were southeasterly hear the noise of windermere   sobbing in the pullwyke bay and would without doubt hear also the   roar of the pull beck water as it passed down from the ironkeld   slopes on his left towards the lake    it might be objected that the poem gives us the idea of a crag which   from the hawkshead side at any rate would require to be of more   difficult ascent than this is to justify the idea of difficulty as   suggested in the lines                  thither i repaired     scoutlike and gained the summit    but i do not think we need read more into the lines than that the boy   feltas he scanned the country with his eyes on the qui vive at   every rise in the groundthe feelings of a scout who questions   constantly the distant prospect    and certainly the pullwyke quarry crag rises most steeply from the   meetingpoint of the two highways    next as to the outgate crag which you have chosen i am out of love   with it first if the lads wanted to make sure of the ponies they   would not have ascended it but would have stayed just at the   hawkshead side of outgate or at the village itself at the point of   convergence of the ways    secondly the crag can hardly be described as rising from the   meetingpoint of two highways only one highway passes near it    the crag is of so curious a formation geologically that i cant fancy   the poet describing his memory of it without calling it a terraced   hill or an ascent by natural terraces    then again the prospect is not sufficiently extended from it the   stream not near enough or rather not of size enough to be heard   blelham tarn is not too far to have added to the watery sound it is   true but the wind we suppose to have been northeast and the sound   of the blelham tarn would be much carried away from him    the present stone wall is not near the summit and is of comparatively   recent date it is difficult to believe from the slope of the outcrop   of rock that a wall could ever have been at the summit    but there are two other vantage grounds intermediate between those   extremes both of which were probably in the mind and memory of the   poet as he described the scene and      the intermitting prospect of the copse     and plain beneath    allowed him by the mist one of these is the high crag about   threequarters of a mile from the divergence or convergence of the two   highways which dr cradock has selected    there can be no doubt that this is the crag par excellence for a   wide and extended lookout over all the country between outgate and   ambleside close at its summit there remain aged thorn trees but no   trace of a wall    but high crag can hardly be said to have risen at the meetingpoint   of two highways unless we are to understand the epithet   farstretched as applying to the southwestern slopes or skirts of   the hill and the two highways the roads between water barngates on   the west and the bridle road between pullwyke and outgate at their   outgate junction and this is rather too far a stretch    it is quite true that if bridle paths can be described as highways   there may be said to be a meetingpoint of these close at the   northeastern side of the crag    but remembering that the ponies came from penrith the driver was not   likely to have had any intimate knowledge of these bridle paths   while at the same time on that misty day i much question whether   the boys on the lookout at high crag could have seen ponies creeping   along between walled roads at so great a distance as half a mile or   more    and this would seem to have been the problem for them on that day    i ought in fairness to say that it is not likely that the roads were   then as today walled up high on either side today even from the   summit of high crag only the head and ears of a pony could be seen as   it passed up the water barngates road but at the end of last century   many of the roads were only partially walled off from the moorlands   they passed over in the lake country    still as i said high crag was a point of vantage that the poet as a   lad must have often climbed in this part of the country if he   wanted to indulge in the delights of panoramic scene    there is a wall some hundred yards from the summit on the   southwesterly flank of high crag near thisat a point close by two   large holly treesthe boy might have sheltered himself against the   northeastern wind and have got a closer and better view of the road   between barngates and outgate and randy pike and outgate    here too he could possibly hear the sound of the stream in the   dingle or woody hollow immediately at his feet but i am far from   content with this as being the spot the poet watched from    there is again a fourth possible lookout place to which you will   remember i directed your attention nearer randy pike the slope   covered with larches rises up from the randy pike road to a   precipitous crag which faces north and east    from this a grand view of the country between randy pike and pullwyke   is obtained and if the bridle paths mightas is possible but   unlikelybe called two highways then this crag could be spoken of as   rising from the meeting place of the two highways for the old   hawkshead road passed along to the east within calling distance say   ninety yards and a bridle road from pullwyke now used chiefly by   the quarrymen passed within eighty yards to the west while it is   certain that the brook below when swollen by winter rains might be   loud enough to be heard from the copse this crag is known as coldwell   or caudwell crag and is situated about half a mile eastsoutheast of   the high crag    it has this much in its favour that a wall of considerable age crests   its summit and one can whilst sitting down on a rock close behind it   be sheltered from the north and east and yet obtain an extensive view   of the subadjacent country if it were certain that the ponies when   they got to pullwyke did not go up towards water barngates and so to   hawkshead then there is no crag in the district which would so   thoroughly answer to all the needs of the boys and to all the points   of description the poet has placed on record    but it is just this if that makes me decide on the pullwyke cragthe   one first describedas being the actual spot to which scoutlike   the schoolboys clomb on that eventful eve of their dear holidays   while at the same time it is my firm conviction that wordsworthas   he painted the memories of that eventhad also before his minds eye   the scene as viewed from coldwell and high crag  ed                                               note vicoleridges lines to

our modern english literaturesupplied me some years ago with numerous facts in reference to wordsworths friend general beaupuy and his family from which i extract the following    the prelude gives us very little precise information about the   republican officer with whom wordsworth became acquainted in france   and on whom he bestowed more praise than on almost any other of his   contemporaries we only gather the following factsthat his name was   beaupuy that he was quartered at orleans with royalist officers   sometime between november 1791 and the spring of 1792 and that      he perished fighting in supreme command     upon the borders of the unhappy loire     for liberty against deluded men     his fellowcountrymen    though it seems very easy to identify a general even with such scanty   data the task is rendered more difficult by two inaccuracies in   wordsworths statement which however can be explained and redressed   without much difficulty    the first inaccuracy is in the spelling of the name which is   beaupuy and not beaupuisa slight mistake considering that   wordsworth was a foreigner and besides wrote down his friends name   ten years and perhaps more after losing sight of him moreover the   name of the general who i think was meant by wordsworth i have   found spelt beaupuy in one instance viz the signature of a letter   of his as printed in vie et correspondance de merlin de thionville   publiée par jean reynaud paris 1860 2e partie p 241    the spelling of proper names was not so fixed then as it is nowadays   and this irregularity is not to be wondered at    the second inaccuracy consists in stating that general beaupuy died on   the banks of the loire during the vendean war indeed he was   grievously wounded at the battle of châteaugonthier on the 26th of   october 1793 and reported as dead his soldiers thought he had been   killed and the rumour must have spread abroad as it was recorded by   a thiers himself in his histoire de la révolution and by a   challemel in his histoire musée de la république française    it is no wonder that wordsworth who was then in england and could   only read imperfect accounts of what took place in france should have   been mistaken too    no other general beaupuy is recorded in the history of the revolution   so far as i have been able to ascertain the moral character of the   officer whose life i shall relate answers to wordsworths   description and is worthy of his high estimate    armand michel de bachelier chevalier de beaupuy was born at   mussidan in perigord on the 15th of july 1757 he belonged to a   noble family less proud of its antiquity than of the blood it had   shed for france on many battlefields on his mothers side mlle de   villars he reckoned montaigne the celebrated essayist among his   ancestors his parents having imbibed the philanthropic ideas of the   time educated him according to their principles    he had four brothers who were all destined to turn republicans and do   good service to the new cause though their interest certainly lay in   the opposite direction        he was made sublieutenant in the regiment of bassigny 33rd division   of foot on the 2nd of march 1773 and lieutenant of grenadiers on the   1st of october of the same year    in 1791 he was first lieutenant in the same regiment having sided   with the revolution he was appointed commander of a battalion of   national volunteers in the department of dordogne i have not found   the exact date of this appointment but it must have taken place   immediately after his stay at orléans with wordsworth    i have found no further mention of his name till september 1792 when   he is known to have served in the armée du rhin under general   custine and contributed to the taking of spire    he took an important part in the taking of worms 4th october of   mayence maenz 21st october he was among the garrison of mayence   when this place was besieged by the prussians and obliged to   capitulate after a long and famous siege from 6th april 1793 to 22nd   july 1793 a    during the siege he wrote a journal of all the operations   unfortunately this journal is very short and purely military it has   been handed down to us and is found in the bibliothèque nationale of   paris in the papiers de merlin de thionville n acq fr nos   244252 8 vol in8° beaupuys journal is in the 3rd volume fol   213228        in the vendean war the mayençais or soldiers returned from   mayence made themselves conspicuous and bore almost all the brunt of   the campaign but none of them distinguished himself more than   beaupuy then a general of brigade    the mayençais arrived in vendée at the end of august or beginning of   september 1793 to beaupuys skill the victory of chollet oct 17   1793 is attributed by jomini in this battle he fought hand to hand   with and overcame a vendean cavalier he himself had three horses   killed and had a very narrow escape on the battlefield he was made   general of division by the represéntants du peuple it was after   chollet that the vendeans made the memorable crossing of the loire at   st florent    at laval and châteaugonthier oct 26 a terrible defeat was   inflicted on the republicans owing to the incapacity of their   commanderinchief léchelle the whole corps commanded by general   beaupuy was crushed by a terrible fire he himself after withstanding   for two or three hours with 2000 or 3000 men all the attacks of the   royalists was disabled by a shot and fell crying out laissezmoi   là et portez à mes grenadiers ma chemise sanglante his soldiers   thought he was dead and then the error was spread which was repeated   by wordsworth thiers and challamel wordsworths mistake is so far   interesting as it seems to prove that very little or no   correspondence passed between the two friends after they had parted   beaupuy moreover had too much work upon his hands to give much of   his time to letterwriting    though severely wounded beaupuy lived on and less than six weeks   after the battle of châteaugonthier he was seen on the ramparts of   angers where he required himself to be carried to animate his   soldiers and head the defenders of the place from which the vendeans   were driven after a severe contest dec 5 and 6    on the 22nd of december 1793 he shared in the victory of savenay with   his celebrated friends marceau kleber and westermann after this   battle which put an end to the great vendean war he wrote the   following letter to his friend merlin de thionville the celebrated   représentant du peuple      savenay le 4 nivôse au 2e 25 dec 73      enfin enfin mon cher merlin elle nest plus cette armée royale     ou catholique comme tu voudras jen ai

moment où la guerre recommencera      le gÉneral de brigade beaupuy     i think i can recognize in this letter some traits of beaupuys   character as pointed out by wordsworth not excepting the   halfsuppressed criticism         somewhat vain he was     or seemed so yet it was not vanity     but fondness and a kind of radiant joy     diffused around him     passing over numerous military incidents on the 26th of june 1796   beaupuy received seven or eight sabrecuts at jorichwildstadt but on   the 8th of july he was already back at his post    he again greatly distinguished himself on the 1st of september 1796 at   greisenfeld and langenbruck where the victory of the french was owing   to a timely attack made by desaix and himself    he was one of the generals under moreau when the latter achieved his   wellknown retreat through the black forest begun on the 15th of   september 1796 and during which many battles were fought in one of   the actions on the banks of the elz beaupuy was killed by a   cannonball while opposing general latour on the heights of   malterdingen his soldiers who loved him passionately fought   desperately to avenge his death oct 19 1796    one of beaupuys colleagues general duhem in his account of the   battle to the government thus expressed himself on general beaupuy      ecrivains patriotes orateurs chaleureux je vous propose un noble

remains transported to brisach where a   monument was erected to his memory in 1802 after the peace of   lunéville    in short beaupuy seems to have always remained worthy of the high   praise bestowed on him by wordsworth his name is to be remembered   along with those of the unspotted generals of the first years of the   revolutionhoche marceau etcbefore the craving for conquest had   developed and the love of liberty yielded to a fond admiration of   bonaparte as it did in the case of kleber desaix and so many others   c    n bthe great influence which beaupuy exercised at that time on   wordsworth will be easily understood if we take into account not only   his real qualities but also his age when they met wordsworth was   only twentyone beaupuy nearly thirtyfive the
