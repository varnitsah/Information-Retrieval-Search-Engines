spirit as soon as c√¶sar d     to robert southey esq pl etc etc    my dear friendthe tale of peter bell which i now introduce to   your notice and to that of the public has in its manuscript state   nearly survived its minorityfor it first saw the light in the   summer of 1798 during this long interval pains have been taken at   different times to make the production less unworthy of a favourable   reception or rather to fit it for filling permanently a station   however humble in the literature of our country this has indeed   been the aim of all my endeavours in poetry which you know have   been sufficiently laborious to prove that i deem the art not lightly   to be approached and that the attainment of excellence in it may   laudably be made the principal object of intellectual pursuit by any   man who with reasonable consideration of circumstances has faith in   his own impulses    the poem of peter bell as the prologue will show was composed   under a belief that the imagination not only does not require for its   exercise the intervention of supernatural agency but that though   such agency be excluded the faculty may be called forth as   imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure by incidents within   the compass of poetic probability in the humblest departments of   daily life since that prologue was written you have exhibited most   splendid effects of judicious daring in the opposite and usual   course let this acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the   supernatural and i am persuaded it will be admitted that to you as   a master in that province of the art the following tale whether from   contrast or congruity is not an unappropriate offering accept it   then as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with   whose name yours has been often coupled to use your own words for   evil and for good and believe me to be with earnest wishes that life   and health may be granted you to complete the many important works in   which you are engaged and with high respect most faithfully yours    william wordsworth    rydal mount april 7 1819   written at alfoxden founded upon an anecdote which i read in a newspaper of an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a wretched posture upon examination a dead body was found in the water and proved to be the body of its master the countenance gait and figure of peter were taken from a wild rover with whom i walked from builth on the river wye downwards nearly as far as the town of hay he told me strange stories it has always been a pleasure to me through life to catch at every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of becoming acquainted with this class of people the number of peters wives was taken from the trespasses in this way of a lawless creature who lived in the county of durham and used to be attended by many women sometimes not less than half a dozen as disorderly as himself and a story went in the country that he had been heard to say while they were quarrelling why cant ye be quiet theres none so many of you benoni or the child of sorrow i knew when i was a schoolboy his mother had been deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood she herself being a gentlewoman by birth the circumstances of her story were told me by my dear old dame ann tyson who was her confidante the lady died brokenhearted in the woods of alfoxden i used to take great delight in noticing the habits tricks and physiognomy of asses and i have no doubt that i was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking for the creature that is often so dreadfully abused the crescent moon which makes such a figure in the prologue assumed this character one evening while i was watching its beauty in front of alfoxden house i intended this poem for the volume before spoken of but it was not published for more than twenty years afterwards the worship of the methodists or ranters is often heard during the stillness of the summer evening in the country with affecting accompaniments of rural beauty in both the psalmody and voice of the preacher there is not unfrequently much solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the rudest characters under favourable circumstancesi f   classed by wordsworth among his poems of the imaginationed    prologue    theres something in a flying horse   theres something 1 in a huge balloon   but through the clouds ill never float   until i have a little boat   shaped like 2 the crescentmoon                         5    and now i have a little boat   in shape a very crescentmoon   fast through the clouds my boat can sail   but if perchance your faith should fail   look upand you shall see me soon                       10    the woods my friends are round you roaring   rocking and roaring like a sea   the noise of dangers in 3 your ears   and ye have all a thousand fears   both for my little boat and me                           15    meanwhile untroubled i admire 4   the pointed horns of my canoe   and did not pity touch my breast   to see how ye are all distrest   till my ribs ached id laugh at you                     20    away we go my boat and i   frail man neer sate in such another

we are as calm in our delight   as is the crescentmoon so bright   among the scattered stars                                30    up goes my boat among 6 the stars   through many a breathless field of light   through many a long blue field of ether   leaving ten thousand stars beneath her   up goes my little boat so bright                         35    the crab the scorpion and the bull   we pry

indignation 16   and i as well as i was able   on two poor legs toward my stonetable   limped on with sore vexation  17                      175    o here he is cried little bess   she saw me at the gardendoor   weve waited anxiously and long   they cried and all around me throng   full nine of them or more                               180    reproach me notyour fears be still   be thankful we

wholly rescued from the pale   of a wild dream or worse illusion   but straight to cover my confusion   began the promised tale 19                            190    part first    all by the moonlight river side   groaned the poor beastalas in vain   the staff was raised to loftier height   and the blows fell with heavier weight   as peter struckand struck again 20                  195    21    hold cried the squire against the rules   of common sense youre surely sinning   this leap is for us all too bold 22   who peter was let that be told   and start from the beginning                           200  a potter f sir he was by trade   said i becoming quite collected   and wheresoever he appeared   full twenty times was peter feared   for once that peter was respected                       205    he twoandthirty years or more   had been a wild and woodland rover   had heard the atlantic surges roar   on farthest cornwalls rocky shore   and trod the cliffs of dover                            210    and he had seen caernarvons towers   and well he knew the spire of sarum   and he had been where lincoln bell   flings oer the fen that ponderous knell   a farrenowned alarum 23                              215    at doncaster at york and leeds   and merry carlisle had he been   and all along the lowlands fair   all through the bonny shire of ayr   and far as aberdeen                                     220    and he had been at inverness   and peter by the mountainrills   had danced his round with highland lasses   and he had lain beside his asses   on lofty cheviot hills                                  225    and he had trudged through yorkshire dales   among the rocks and winding scars   where deep and low the hamlets lie   beneath their little patch of sky   and little lot of stars                                 230    and all along the indented coast   bespattered with the saltsea foam   whereer a knot of houses lay   on headland or in hollow bay   sure never man like him did roam                        235    as well might peter in the fleet   have been fast bound a begging debtor   he travelled here he travelled there   but not the value of a hair   was heart or head the better                            240    he roved among the vales and streams   in the green wood and hollow dell   they were his dwellings night and day   but nature neer could find the way   into the heart of peter bell                            245    in vain through every changeful year   did nature lead him as before   a primrose by a rivers brim   a yellow primrose was to him   and it was nothing more                                 250    small change it made in peters heart   to see his gentle panniered train   with more than vernal pleasure feeding   whereer the tender grass was leading   its earliest green along the lane                       255    in vain through water earth and air   the soul of happy sound was spread   when peter on some april morn   beneath the broom or budding thorn   made the warm earth his lazy bed                        260    at noon when by the forests edge   he lay beneath the branches high   the soft blue sky did never melt   into his heart he never felt   the witchery of the soft blue sky                       265    on a fair prospect some have looked   and felt as i have heard them say   as if the moving time had been   a thing as steadfast as the scene   on which they gazed themselves away                     270    within the breast of peter bell   these silent raptures found no place 24   he was a carl as wild and rude   as ever hueandcry pursued   as ever ran a felons race                              275    of all that lead a lawless life   of all that love their lawless lives   in city or in village small   he was the wildest far of all   he had a dozen wedded wives                             280    nay start notwedded wivesand twelve   but how one wife could eer come near him   in simple truth i cannot tell   for be it said of peter bell   to see him was to fear him                              285    though nature could not touch his heart   by lovely forms and silent 25 weather   and tender sounds yet you might see   at once that peter bell and she   had often been together                                 290    a savage wildness round him hung   as of a dweller out of doors   in his whole figure and his mien   a savage character was seen   of mountains and of dreary moors                        295    to all the unshaped halfhuman thoughts   which solitary nature feeds   mid summer storms or winters ice   had peter joined whatever vice   the cruel city breeds                                   300    his face was keen as is the wind   that cuts along the hawthornfence   of courage you saw little there   but in its stead a medley air   of cunning and of impudence                             305    he had a dark and sidelong walk   and long and slouching was his gait   beneath his looks so bare and bold   you might perceive his spirit cold   was playing with some inward bait                       310    his forehead wrinkled was and furred   a work one half of which was done   by thinking of his whens and hows   and half by knitting of his brows   beneath the glaring sun                                 315    there was a hardness in his cheek   there was a hardness in his eye   as if the man had fixed his face   in many a solitary place   against the wind and open sky                          320                                             one night and now my little bess   weve reached at last the promised tale   one beautiful november night   when the full moon was shining bright   upon the rapid river swale                              325    along the rivers winding banks   peter was travelling all alone   whether to buy or sell or led   by pleasure running in his head   to me was never known                                   330    he trudged along through copse and brake   he trudged along oer hill and dale   nor for the moon cared he a tittle   and for the stars he cared as little   and for the murmuring river swale                       335    but chancing to espy a path   that promised to cut short the way   as many a wiser man hath done   he left a trusty guide for one   that might his steps betray                             340    to a thick wood he soon is brought   where cheerily 26 his course he weaves   and whistling loud may yet be heard   though often buried like a bird   darkling among the boughs and leaves                   345    but quickly peters mood is changed   and on he drives with cheeks that burn   in downright fury and in wrath   theres little sign the treacherous path   will to the road return                                 350    the path grows dim and dimmer still   now up now down the rover wends   with all the sail that he can carry   till brought to a deserted quarry27   and there the pathway ends                              355    28    he pausedfor shadows of strange shape   massy and black before him lay   but through the dark and through the cold 29   and through the yawning fissures old   did peter boldly press his way                           360    right through the quarryand behold   a scene of soft and lovely hue   where blue and grey and tender green   together make 30 as sweet a scene   as ever human eye did view                              365    beneath the clear blue sky he saw   a little field of meadow ground   but field or meadow name it not   call it of earth a small green plot   with rocks encompassed round                            370    the swale flowed under the grey rocks   but he flowed quiet and unseen   you need a strong and stormy gale   to bring the noises of the swale   to that green spot so calm and green                   375    31    and is there no one dwelling here   no hermit with his beads and glass   and does no little cottage look   upon this soft and fertile nook   does no one live near this green grass                  380    across the 32 deep and quiet spot   is peter driving through the grass   and now has reached the skirting trees 33   when turning round his head he sees   a solitary ass                                          385    34    a prize cries peterbut he first   must spy about him far and near 35   theres not a single house in sight   no woodmans hut no cottage light   peter you need not fear                                390    theres nothing to be seen but woods   and rocks that spread a hoary gleam   and this one beast that from the bed   of the green meadow hangs his head   over the silent stream                                  395    his head is with a halter bound   the halter seizing peter leapt   upon the creatures back 36 and plied   with ready heels his shaggy side 37   but still the ass his station kept                      400    38    then peter gave a sudden jerk   a jerk that from a dungeonfloor   would have pulled up an iron ring   but still the heavyheaded thing   stood just as he had stood before                       405    quoth peter leaping from his seat   there is some plot against me laid   once more the little meadowground   and all the hoary cliffs around   he cautiously surveyed                                  410    all all is silentrocks and woods   all still and silentfar and near   only the ass with motion dull   upon the pivot of his skull   turns round his long left ear                           415    thought peter what can mean all this   some ugly witchcraft must be here once more the ass with motion dull   upon the pivot of his skull   turned round his long left ear                          420    suspicion ripened into dread   yet with deliberate action slow   his staff highraising in the pride   of skill upon the sounding hide 39   he dealt a sturdy blow                                  425    the poor ass staggered with the shock   and then as if to take his ease 40   in quiet uncomplaining mood   upon the spot where he had stood   dropped gently down upon his knees                      430    as gently on 41 his side he fell   and by the rivers brink did lie   and while 42 he lay like one that mourned   the patient beast on peter turned   his shining hazel eye 43                              435    twas but one mild reproachful look   a look more tender than severe   and straight in sorrow not in dread   he turned the eyeball in his head   towards the smooth river 44 deep and clear            440    upon the beast the sapling rings   his lank sides heaved 45 his limbs they stirred   he gave a groan and then another   of that which went before the brother   and then he gave a third                                445    all by the moonlight river side   he gave three miserable groans   and not till now hath peter seen   how gaunt the creature ishow lean   and sharp his staring bones 46                         450    with legs stretched out and stiff he lay   no word of kind commiseration   fell at the sight from peters tongue   with hard contempt his heart was wrung   with hatred and vexation                                455    the meagre beast lay still as death   and peters lips with fury quiver   quoth he you little mulish dog   ill fling your carcass like a log   headforemost down the river                           460    an impious oath confirmed the threat   whereat from the earth on which he lay 47   to all the echoes south and north   and east and west the ass sent forth   a long and clamorous bray 48                          465    this outcry on the heart of peter   seems like a note of joy to strike   joy at 49 the heart of peter knocks   but in the echo of the rocks   was something peter did not like                        470    whether to cheer his coward breast   or that he could not break the chain   in this serene and solemn hour   twined round him by demoniac power   to the blind work he turned again                       475    among the rocks and winding crags   among the mountains far away   once more the ass did lengthen out   more ruefully a deepdrawn shout   the hard dry seesaw of his horrible bray 50          480    what is there now in peters heart   or whence the might of this strange sound   the moon uneasy looked and dimmer   the broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer   and the rocks staggered all around485    from peters hand the sapling dropped   threat has he none to execute   if any one should come and see   that i am here theyll think quoth he   im helping this poor dying brute                     490    he scans the ass from limb to limb   and ventures now to uplift his eyes   more steady looks the moon and clear   more like themselves the rocks appear   and touch more quiet skies 51                         495    his scorn returnshis hate revives   he stoops the asss neck to seize   with malicethat again takes flight   for in the pool a startling sight   meets him among the inverted trees 52                500    is it the moons distorted face   the ghostlike image of a cloud   is it a gallows 53 there portrayed   is peter of himself afraid   is it a coffinor a shroud                            505    a grisly idol hewn in stone   or imp from witchs lap let fall   perhaps a ring of shining fairies   such as pursue their feared vagaries 54   in sylvan bower or haunted hall                        510    is it a fiend that to a stake   of fire his desperate self is tethering   or stubborn spirit doomed to yell   in solitary ward or cell   ten thousand miles from all his brethren                515    55    never did pulse so quickly throb   and never heart so loudly panted 56   he looks he cannot choose but look   like some one reading in a book57   a book that is enchanted                                520    ah welladay for peter bell   he will be turned to iron soon   meet statue for the court of fear   his hat is upand every hair   bristles and whitens in the moon                       525    he looks he ponders looks again   he sees a motionhears a groan   his eyes will bursthis heart will break   he gives a loud and frightful shriek   and back he falls 58 as if his life were flown       530   part second    we left our hero in a trance   beneath the alders near the river   the ass is by the riverside   and where the feeble breezes glide   upon the stream the moonbeams quiver                    535    a happy respite but at length   he feels the glimmering of the moon   wakes with glazed eye and feebly sighing   to sink perhaps where he is lying   into a second swoon 59                                540    he lifts his head he sees his staff   he touchestis to him a treasure   faint recollection seems to tell   that he is yet where mortals dwell   a thought received with languid pleasure                545    his head upon his elbow propped   becoming less and less perplexed   skyward he looksto rock and wood   and thenupon the glassy 60 flood   his wandering eye is fixed                              550    thought he that is the face of one   in his last sleep securely bound   so toward the stream his head he bent   and downward thrust his staff intent   the rivers depth to sound 61                         555    nowlike a tempestshattered bark   that overwhelmed and prostrate lies   and in a moment to the verge   is lifted of a foaming surge   full suddenly the ass doth rise                         560    his staring bones all shake with joy   and close by peters side he stands   while peter oer the river bends   the little ass his neck extends   and fondly licks his hands                              565    such life is in the asss eyes   such life is in his limbs and ears   that peter bell if he had been   the veriest coward ever seen   must now have thrown aside his fears                    570    the ass looks onand to his work   is peter quietly resigned   he touches herehe touches there   and now among the dead mans hair   his sapling peter has entwined                          575    he pullsand looksand pulls again   and he whom the poor ass had lost   the man who had been four days dead   headforemost from the rivers bed   uprises like a ghost g                                580    and peter draws him to dry land   and through the brain of peter pass   some poignant twitches fast and faster   no doubt quoth he he is the master   of this poor miserable ass                             585    the meagre shadow that looks on   what would he now 62 what is he doing   his sudden fit of joy is flown   he on his knees hath laid him down   as if he were his grief renewing                        590    but nothat peter on his back   must mount he shows well as he can 63   thought peter then come weal or woe   ill do what he would have me do   in pity to this poor drowned man                        595    with that resolve he boldly mounts 64   upon the pleased and thankful ass   and then without a moments stay   that 65 earnest creature turned away   leaving the body on the grass                           600    intent upon his faithful watch   the beast four days and nights had past   a sweeter meadow neer was seen   and there the ass four days had been   nor ever once did break his fast                        605    yet firm his step and stout his heart   the mead is crossedthe quarrys mouth   is reached but there the trusty guide   into a thicket turns aside   and deftly ambles 66 towards the south                610    when hark a burst of doleful sound   and peter honestly might say   the like came never to his ears   though he has been full thirty years   a rovernight and day                                  615    tis not a plover of the moors   tis not a bittern of the fen   nor can it be a barking fox   nor nightbird chambered in the rocks   nor wildcat in a woody glen                            620    the ass is startledand stops short   right in the middle of the thicket   and peter wont to whistle loud   whether alone or in a crowd   is silent as a silent cricket                           625    what ails you now my little bess   well may you tremble and look grave   this crythat rings along the wood   this crythat floats adown the flood   comes from the entrance of a cave                       630    i see a blooming woodboy there   and if i had the power to say   how sorrowful the wanderer is   your heart would be as sad as his   till you had kissed his tears away                      635    grasping 67 a hawthorn branch in hand   all bright with berries ripe and red   into the caverns mouth he peeps   thence back into the moonlight creeps   whom seeks hewhomthe silent dead 68              640    his fatherhim doth he require   him hath he sought 69 with fruitless pains   among the rocks behind the trees   now creeping on his hands and knees   now running oer the open plains                        645    and hither is he come at last   when he through such a day has gone   by this dark cave to be distrest   like a poor birdher plundered nest   hovering around with dolorous moan                      650    of that intense and piercing cry   the listening ass conjectures well 70   wild as it is he there can read   some intermingled notes that plead   with touches irresistible                               655    but peterwhen he saw the ass   not only stop but turn and change   the cherished tenor of his pace   that lamentable cry 71 to chase   it wrought in him conviction strange                    660    a faith that for the dead mans sake   and this poor slave who loved him well   vengeance upon his head will fall   some visitation worse than all   which ever till this night befel                        665    meanwhile the ass to reach his home 72   is striving stoutly as he may   but while he climbs the woody hill   the cry grows weakand weaker still   and now at last it dies away                            670    so with his freight the creature turns   into a gloomy grove of beech   along the shade with footsteps 73 true   descending slowly till the two   the open moonlight reach                                675    and there along the 74 narrow dell   a fair smooth pathway you discern   a length of green and open road   as if it from a fountain flowed   winding away between the fern                           680    the rocks that tower on either side   build up a wild fantastic scene   temples like those among the hindoos   and mosques and spires and abbeywindows   and castles all with ivy green                          685    and while the ass pursues his way   along this solitary dell   as pensively his steps advance   the mosques and spires change countenance   and look at peter bell                                  690    that unintelligible cry   hath left him high in preparation   convinced that he or soon or late   this very night will meet his fate   and so he sits in expectation                           695    75    the strenuous animal hath clomb   with the green path and now he wends   where shining like the smoothest sea   in undisturbed immensity   a 76 level plain extends                              700    but whence this faintlyrustling sound   by which the journeying pair are chased a withered leaf is close behind 77   light plaything for the sportive wind   upon that solitary waste                                705    when peter spied the moving thing   it only doubled his distress 78   where there is not a bush or tree   the very leaves they follow me   so huge hath been my wickedness                        710    to a close lane they now are come   where as before the enduring ass   moves on without a moments stop   nor once turns round his head to crop   a brambleleaf or blade of grass                        715    between the hedges as they go   the white dust sleeps upon the lane   and peter ever and anon   backlooking sees upon a stone   or in the dust a crimson stain                         720    a stainas of a drop of blood   by moonlight made more faint and wan   ha why these sinkings of despair 79   he knows not how the blood comes there   and peter is a wicked man                               725    at length he spies a bleeding wound   where he had struck the asss head 80   he sees the blood knows what it is   a glimpse of sudden joy was his   but then it quickly fled                                730    of him whom sudden death had seized   he thoughtof thee o faithful ass   and once again those ghastly pains   shoot to and fro through heart and reins   and through his brain like lightning pass 81          735   part third    ive heard of one a gentle soul   though given to sadness and to gloom   and for the fact will vouchone night   it chanced that by a tapers light   this man was reading in his room                        740    bending as you or i might bend   at night oer any pious book 82   when sudden blackness overspread   the snow white page on which he read   and made the good man round him look                    745    the chamber walls were dark all round   and to his book he turned again the light had left the lonely taper 83   and formed itself upon the paper   into large lettersbright and plain                    750    the godly book was in his hand   and on the page more black than coal   appeared set forth in strange array   a wordwhich to his dying day   perplexed the good mans gentle soul                    755    the ghostly word thus plainly seen 84   did never from his lips depart   but he hath said poor gentle wight   it brought full many a sin to light   out of the bottom of his heart                          760    dread spirits to confound the meek 85   why wander from your course so far   disordering colour form and stature let good men feel the soul of nature   and see things as they are                              765    yet potent spirits well i know   how ye that play with soul and sense   are not unused to trouble friends   of goodness for most gracious ends86   and this i speak in reverence                           770    but might i give advice to you   whom in my fear i love so well   from men of pensive virtue go   dread beings and your empire show   on hearts like that of peter bell                       775    your presence often have i 87 felt   in darkness and the stormy night   and with like force 88 if need there be   ye can put forth your agency   when earth is calm and heaven is bright                780    then coming from the wayward world   that powerful world in which ye dwell   come spirits of the mind and try   tonight beneath the moonlight sky   what may be done with peter bell                        785  o would that some more skilful voice   my further labour might prevent   kind listeners that around me sit   i feel that i am all unfit   for such high argument                                  790    ive played ive danced 89 with my narration   i loitered long ere i began   ye waited then on my good pleasure   pour out indulgence still in measure   as liberal as ye can                                    795    our travellers ye remember well   are thridding a sequestered lane   and peter many tricks is trying   and many anodynes applying   to ease his conscience of its pain                      800    by this his heart is lighter far   and finding that he can account   so snugly 90 for that crimson stain   his evil spirit up again   does like an empty bucket mount                         805    and peter is a deep logician   who hath no lack of wit mercurial   blood dropsleaves rustleyet quoth he   this poor man never but for me   could have had christian burial                         810    and say the best you can tis plain   that here has 91 been some wicked dealing   no doubt the devil in me wrought   im not the man who could have thought   an ass like this was worth the stealing                815    so from his pocket peter takes   his shining horn tobaccobox   and in a light and careless way   as men who with their purpose play   upon the lid he knocks                                  820    let them whose voice can stop the clouds   whose cunning eye can see the wind   tell to a curious world the cause   why making here a sudden pause   the ass turned round his head and grinned            825    appalling process i have marked   the like on heath in lonely wood   and verily have seldom met   a spectacle more hideousyet   it suited peters present mood                          830    and grinning in his turn his teeth   he in jocose defiance showed   when to upset 92 his spiteful mirth   a murmur pent within the earth   in the dead earth beneath the road                      835    rolled audibly it swept along   a muffled noisea rumbling sound   twas by a troop of miners made   plying with gunpowder their trade   some twenty fathoms underground                         840    small cause of dire effect for surely   if ever mortal king or cotter   believed that earth was charged to quake   and yawn for his unworthy sake   twas peter bell the potter                             845    but as an oak in breathless air   will stand though to the centre hewn   or as the weakest things if frost   have stiffened them maintain their post   so he beneath the gazing moon850    the beast bestriding thus he reached   a spot where in a sheltering cove 93   a little chapel stands alone   with greenest ivy overgrown   and tufted with an ivy grove                            855    dying insensibly away   from human thoughts and purposes   it seemedwall window roof and tower 94   to bow to some transforming power   and blend with the surrounding trees                    860    as ruinous a place it was   thought peter in the shire of fife   that served my turn when following still   from land to land a reckless will 95   i married my sixth wife                                 865    the unheeding ass moves slowly on   and now is passing by an inn   brimfull of a carousing crew   that make 96 with curses not a few   an uproar and a drunken din                             870    i cannot well express the thoughts   which peter in those noises found   a stifling power compressed his frame   whileas a swimming darkness came 97   over that dull and dreary sound                         875    for well did peter know the sound   the language of those drunken joys   to him a jovial soul i ween   but a few hours ago had been   a gladsome and a welcome noise                          880    now 98 turned adrift into the past   he finds no solace in his course   like planetstricken men of yore   he trembles smitten to the core   by strong compunction and remorse                       885    but more than all his heart is stung   to think of one almost a child   a sweet and playful highland girl   as light and beauteous as a squirrel   as beauteous and as wild                                890    her dwelling was a lonely house 99   a cottage in a heathy dell   and she put on her gown of green   and left her mother at sixteen   and followed peter bell                                 895    but many good and pious thoughts   had she and in the kirk to pray   two long scotch miles through rain or snow   to kirk she had been used to go   twice every sabbathday                                 900    and when she followed peter bell   it was to lead an honest life   for he with tongue not used to falter   had pledged his troth before the altar   to love her as his wedded wife                          905    a mothers hope is hersbut soon   she drooped and pined like one forlorn   from scripture she a name 100 did borrow   benoni or the child of sorrow   she called her babe unborn                              910    for she had learned how peter lived   and took it in most grievous part   she to the very bone was worn   and ere that little child was born   died of a broken heart                                  915    and now the spirits of the mind   are busy with poor peter bell   upon the rights of visual sense   usurping with a prevalence   more terrible than magic spell 101                    920    close by a brake of flowering furze   above it shivering aspens play   he sees an unsubstantial creature   his very self in form and feature   not four yards from the broad highway                   925    and stretched beneath the furze he sees   the highland girlit is no other   and hears her crying as she cried   the very moment that she died   my mother oh my mother                               930    the sweat pours down from peters face   so grievous is his hearts contrition   with agony his eyeballs ache   while he beholds by the furzebrake   this miserable vision                                   935    calm is the welldeserving brute   his peace hath no offence betrayed   but now while down that slope he wends   a voice to peters ear 102 ascends   resounding from the woody glade                         940    the voice though clamorous as a horn   reechoed by a naked rock   comes from that tabernaclelist 103   within a fervent 104 methodist   is preaching to no heedless flock                       945    repent repent he cries aloud   while yet ye may find mercystrive   to love the lord with all your might   turn to him seek him day and night   and save your souls alive                               950    repent repent though ye have gone   through paths of wickedness and woe   after the babylonian harlot   and though your sins be red as scarlet   they shall be white as snow                            955    even as he passed the door these words   did plainly come to peters ears   and they such joyful tidings were   the joy was more than he could bear   he melted into tears                                    960    sweet tears of hope and tenderness   and fast they fell a plenteous shower   his nerves his sinews seemed to melt   through all his iron frame was felt   a gentle a relaxing power                             965    each fibre of his frame was weak   weak all the animal within   but in its helplessness grew mild   and gentle as an infant child   an infant that has known no sin                         970    tis said meek beast that through heavens grace105 h   he not unmoved did notice now   the cross i upon thy shoulder scored   for lasting impress by the lord 106   to whom all humankind shall bow                        975    memorial of his touchthat day 107   when jesus humbly deigned to ride   entering the proud jerusalem   by an immeasurable stream j   of shouting people deified                              980    meanwhile the persevering ass   turned towards a gate that hung in view   across a shady lane 108 his chest   against the yielding gate he pressed   and quietly passed through                              985    and up the stony lane he goes   no ghost more softly ever trod   among the stones and pebbles he   sets down his hoofs inaudibly   as if with felt his hoofs were shod                     990    along the lane the trusty ass   went twice two hundred yards or more   and no one could have guessed his aim   till to a lonely house he came   and stopped beside the door 109                       995    thought peter tis the poor mans home   he listensnot a sound is heard   save from the trickling household rill   but stepping oer the cottagesill   forthwith a little girl appeared                       1000    she to the meetinghouse was bound   in hopes 110 some tidings there to gather   no glimpse it is no doubtful gleam   she sawand uttered with a scream   my father heres my father                          1005    the very word was plainly heard   heard plainly by the wretched mother   her joy was like a deep affright   and forth she rushed into the light   and saw it was another                                 1010    and instantly upon the earth   beneath the full moon shining bright   close to 111 the asss feet she fell   at the same moment peter bell   dismounts in most unhappy plight                       1015    as he beheld the woman lie 112   breathless and motionless the mind   of peter sadly was confused   but though to such demands unused   and helpless almost as the blind                       1020    he raised her up and while he held   her body propped against his knee   the woman wakedand when she spied   the poor ass standing by her side   she moaned most bitterly                               1025    oh god be praisedmy hearts at ease   for he is deadi know it well at this she wept a bitter flood   and in the best way that he could   his tale did peter tell                                1030    he trembleshe is pale as death   his voice is weak with perturbation   he turns aside his head he pauses   poor peter from a thousand causes   is crippled sore in his narration                      1035    at length she learned how he espied   the ass in that small meadowground   and that her husband now lay dead   beside that luckless rivers bed   in which he had been drowned                           1040    a piercing look the widow 113 cast   upon the beast that near her stands   she sees tis he that tis the same   she calls the poor ass by his name   and wrings and wrings her hands                       1045    o wretched lossuntimely stroke   if he had died upon his bed   he knew not one forewarning pain   he never will come home again   is dead for ever dead                                1050    beside the woman peter stands   his heart is opening more and more   a holy sense pervades his mind   he feels what he for humankind   had never felt before                                  1055    at length by peters arm sustained   the woman rises from the ground   oh mercy something must be done   my little rachel you must run   some willing neighbour must be found                   1060    make hastemy little racheldo   the first you meet withbid him come   ask him to lend his horse tonight   and this good man whom heaven requite   will help to bring the body home                      1065    away goes rachel weeping loud   an infant waked by her distress   makes in the house a piteous cry   and peter hears the mother sigh   seven are they and all fatherless                   1070    and now is peter taught to feel   that mans heart is a holy thing   and nature through a world of death   breathes into him a second breath   more searching than the breath of spring               1075    upon a stone the woman sits   in agony of silent grief   from his own thoughts did peter start   he longs to press her to his heart   from love that cannot find relief                      1080    but roused as if through every limb   had past a sudden shock of dread   the mother oer the threshold flies   and up the cottage stairs 114 she hies   and on the pillow lays 115 her burning head          1085    and peter turns his steps aside   into a shade of darksome trees   where he sits down he knows not how   with his hands pressed against his brow   his elbows on 116 his tremulous knees                1090    there selfinvolved does peter sit   until no sign of life he makes   as if his mind were sinking deep   through years that have been long asleep   the trance is passed awayhe wakes                    1095    he lifts 117 his headand sees the ass   yet standing in the clear moonshine   when shall i be as good as thou   oh would poor beast that i had now   a heart but half as good as thine                     1100    but hewho deviously hath sought   his father through the lonesome woods   hath sought proclaiming to the ear   of night his grief and sorrowful fear118   he comes escaped from fields and floods1105    with weary pace is drawing nigh   he sees the assand nothing living   had ever such a fit of joy   as hath 119 this little orphan boy   for he has no misgiving                                1110    forth to 120 the gentle ass he springs   and up about his neck he climbs   in loving words he talks to him   he kisses kisses face and limb   he kisses him a thousand times                         1115    this peter sees while in the shade   he stood beside the cottagedoor   and peter bell the ruffian wild   sobs loud he sobs even like a child   oh god i can endure no more                        1120  here ends my tale for in a trice   arrived a neighbour with his horse   peter went forth with him straightway   and with due care ere break of day   together they brought back the corse                   1125    and many years did this poor ass   whom once it was my luck to see   cropping the shrubs of leminglane   help by his labour to maintain   the widow and her family                               1130    and peter bell who till that night   had been the wildest of his clan   forsook his crimes renounced 121 his folly   and after ten months melancholy   became a good and honest man k                       1135                                          variants on the text  variant 1 1827    and something               1819    variant 2

sir george    i am quite delighted to hear of your picture for peter bell    but remember that no poem of mine will ever be popular and i am   afraid that the sale of peter would not carry the expense of   engraving  the people would love the poem of peter bell but the   public a very different thing will never love it  some days before wordsworths peter bell was issued in 1819 another peter bell was published by messrs taylor and hessey it was a parody written by j hamilton reynolds and issued as peter bell a lyrical ballad with the sentence on its title page i do affirm that i am the real

window he saved them   from incipient suffocation  wordsworth subsequently said that he had omitted the stanza only in deference to the unco guid crabb robinson remonstrated with him against its

1798   july 1798 no poem of mine was composed under circumstances more pleasant for me to remember than this i began it upon leaving tintern after crossing the wye and concluded it just as i was entering bristol in the evening after a ramble of four or five days with my sister not a line of it was altered and not any part of it written down till i reached bristol it was published almost immediately after in the little volume of which so much has been said in these notes the lyrical ballads as first published at bristol by cottleif   included among the poems of the imaginationed      five years have past five summers with the length   of five long wintersc and again i hear   these waters rolling from their mountainsprings   with a soft 1 inland murmur donce again   do i behold these steep and lofty cliffs                      5   that 2 on a wild secluded scene impress   thoughts of more deep seclusion and connect   the landscape with the quiet of the sky   the day is come when i again repose   here under this dark sycamore and view                      10   these plots of cottageground these orchardtufts   which at this season with their unripe fruits   are clad in one green hue and lose themselves   mid groves and copses 3 once again i see   these hedgerows hardly hedgerows little lines             15   of sportive wood run wild these pastoral farms   green to the very door and wreaths of smoke   sent up in silence from among the trees e   with some uncertain notice as might seem   of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods                   20   or of some hermits cave where by his fire   the hermit sits alone       these beauteous forms   through a long absence have not been to me 4   as is a landscape to a blind mans eye                       25   but oft in lonely rooms and mid the din   of towns and cities i have owed to them   in hours of weariness sensations sweet   felt in the blood and felt along the heart   and passing even into my purer mind 5                      30   with tranquil restorationfeelings too   of unremembered pleasure such perhaps   as have no slight or trivial influence 6   on that best portion of a good mans life   his little nameless unremembered acts                      35   of kindness and of love nor less i trust   to them i may have owed another gift   of aspect more sublime that blessed mood   in which the burthen of the mystery   in which the heavy and the weary weight                       40   of all this unintelligible world   is lightenedthat serene and blessed mood   in which the affections gently lead us on   until the breath of this corporeal frame   and even the motion of our human blood                        45   almost suspended we are laid asleep   in body and become a living soul   while with an eye made quiet by the power   of harmony and the deep power of joy   we see into the life of things                               50       if this   be but a vain belief yet oh how oft   in darkness and amid the many shapes   of joyless daylight when the fretful stir   unprofitable and the fever of the world                     55   have hung upon the beatings of my heart   how oft in spirit have i turned to thee   o sylvan wye thou wanderer thro the woods 7   how often has my spirit turned to thee       and now with gleams of halfextinguished thought        60   with many recognitions dim and faint   and somewhat of a sad perplexity   the picture of the mind revives again   while here i stand not only with the sense   of present pleasure but with pleasing thoughts               65   that in this moment there is life and food   for future years and so i dare to hope   though changed no doubt from what i was when first   i came among these hills when like a roe   i bounded oer the mountains by the sides                    70   of the deep rivers and the lonely streams   wherever nature led more like a man   flying from something that he dreads than one   who sought the thing he loved for nature then   the coarser pleasures of my boyish days                     75   and their glad animal movements all gone by   to me was all in alli cannot paint   what then i was the sounding cataract   haunted me like a passion the tall rock   the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood                   80   their colours and their forms were then to me   an appetite a feeling and a love   that had no need of a remoter charm   by thought supplied nor 8 any interest   unborrowed from the eyethat time is past                  85   and all its aching joys are now no more   and all its dizzy raptures f not for this   faint i nor mourn nor murmur other gifts   have followed for such loss i would believe   abundant recompence for i have learned                       90   to look on nature not as in the hour   of thoughtless youth but hearing oftentimes   the still sad music of humanity   nor 9 harsh nor grating though of ample power   to chasten and subdue and i have felt                        95   a presence that disturbs me with the joy   of elevated thoughts a sense sublime   of something far more deeply interfused   whose dwelling is the light of setting suns   and the round ocean and the living air                      100   and the blue sky and in the mind of man   a motion and a spirit that impels   all thinking things all objects of all thought   and rolls through all things therefore am i still   a lover of the meadows and the woods                        105   and mountains and of all that we behold   from this green earth of all the mighty world   of eye and earboth what they half create g   and what perceive well pleased to recognise   in nature and the language of the sense                     110   the anchor of my purest thoughts the nurse   the guide the guardian of my heart and soul   of all my moral being       nor perchance   if i were not thus taught should i the more                 115   suffer my genial spirits to decay   for thou art with me here upon the banks   of this fair river thou my dearest friend   my dear dear friend and in thy voice i catch   the language of my former heart and read                    120   my former pleasures in the shooting lights   of thy wild eyes h oh yet a little while   may i behold in thee what i was once   my dear dear sister and this prayer i make   knowing that nature never did betray                         125   the heart that loved her tis her privilege   through all the years of this our life to lead   from joy to joy for she can so inform   the mind that is within us so impress   with quietness and beauty and so feed                       130   with lofty thoughts that neither evil tongues   rash judgments nor the sneers of selfish men   nor greetings where no kindness is nor all   the dreary intercourse of daily life   shall eer prevail against us or disturb                    135   our cheerful faith that all which we behold   is full of blessings therefore let the moon   shine on thee in thy solitary walk   and let the misty mountainwinds be free   to blow against thee and in after years                   140   when these wild ecstasies shall be matured   into a sober pleasure when thy mind   shall be a mansion for all lovely forms   thy memory be as a dwellingplace   for all sweet sounds and harmonies oh then                145   if solitude or fear or pain or grief   should be thy portion with what healing thoughts   of tender joy wilt thou remember me   and these my exhortations nor perchance   if i should be where i no more can hear                      150   thy voice nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams   of past existence bwilt thou then forget   that on the banks of this delightful stream   we stood together and that i so long   a worshipper of nature hither came                          155   unwearied in that service rather say   with warmer loveoh with far deeper zeal   of holier love nor wilt thou then forget   that after many wanderings many years   of absence these steep woods and lofty cliffs              160   and this green pastoral landscape were to me   more dear both for themselves

except in the table of contents in 1836 the finally adopted title of the poem was given in the text as well as in the table of contentsed      there was a boy ye knew him well ye cliffs   and islands of winandermany a time   at evening when the earliest stars began 1   to move along the edges of the hills   rising or setting would he stand alone                        5   beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake   and there with fingers interwoven both hands   pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth   uplifted he as through an instrument   blew mimic hootings to the silent owls                        10   that they might answer himand they would shout   across the watery vale and shout again   responsive to his callwith quivering peals   and long halloos and screams and echoes loud   redoubled and redoubled concourse wild                        15   of jocund din 2 and when there came a pause   of silence such as baffled his best skill 3   then sometimes in that silence while he hung   listening a gentle shock of mild surprise   has carried far into his heart the voice                       20   of mountaintorrents or the visible scene   would enter unawares into his mind   with all its solemn imagery its rocks   its woods and that uncertain heaven received   into the bosom of the steady lake                             25      this boy was taken from his mates

wordsworth sent this fragment in ms to coleridge who was then living at ratzeburg and coleridge wrote in reply on the 10th dec 1798    the blank lines gave me as much direct pleasure as was possible in   the general bustle of pleasure with which i received and read your   letter i observed i remember that the fingers woven etc only   puzzled me and though i liked the twelve or fourteen first lines very   well yet i liked the remainder much better well now i have read   them again they are very beautiful and leave an affecting   impression that      uncertain heaven received     into the bosom of the steady lake    i should have recognised anywhere and had i met these lines running   wild in the deserts of arabia i should have instantly screamed out   wordsworth  the ms copy of this poem sent to coleridge probably lacked the explanatory line    pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth  as another ms in the possession of the poets grandson lacks it and the line was possibly

                                 1799   the poems belonging to the year 1799 were chiefly if not wholly composed at goslar in germany and all with three exceptions appeared in the second edition of lyrical ballads 1800 the exceptions were the following the lyric beginning i travelled among unknown men which was first published in the poems of 1807 and two fragments from the prelude viz the influence of natural objects which appeared in the friend in 1809 and the simplon pass first published in the 8vo edition of the poems in 1845  wordsworth reached goslar on the 6th of october 1798 and left it on the 10th of february 1799 it is impossible to determine the precise order in which the nineteen or twenty poems associated with that city were composed but it is certain that the fragment on the immortal boy of windermerewhom its cliffs and islands knew so wellwas written in 1798 and not in 1799 as wordsworth himself states because coleridge sent a letter to his friend thanking him for a ms copy of these lines and commenting on them of which the date is ratzeburg dec 10 1798 for obvious reasons however i place the fragments originally meant to be parts of the recluse together and since wordsworth gave the date 1799 to the others it would be gratuitous to suppose that he erred in reference to them all because we know that his memory failed him in reference to one of the series therefore although he spent more than twice as many days in 1798 as in 1799 at goslar i set down this group of poems as belonging to 1799 rather than to the previous year it will be seen that after placing all the poems of this goslar period in the year to which they belong it is possible also to group them according to their subject matter without violating chronological order i therefore put the fragments afterwards incorporated in the prelude together these are naturally followed by nuttinga poem intended for the prelude but afterwards excluded as inappropriate the five poems referring to lucy are placed in sequence and the same is done with the four matthew poems a small group of four poems follows appropriately viz to a sexton the danish boy lucy gray and ruth while the fenwick note almost necessitates our placing the poets epitaph immediately after the lines written in germany and with wordsworths life at goslar we naturally associate five thingsthe cold winter the prelude

the cross   shining upon thy happy grave    to this poem when first published in the poems of early and late years 1842 wordsworth appended the note see upon the subject of the three foregoing pieces the fountain p 91 etc etc in the fifth volume of the authors poems he thus connects it with the poems referring to matthew in such a way that it may be said to belong to that series and while he assigned it to the year 1798 both in the edition of 1845 and in that of 184950 it is quite possible that it was written in 1799 the village school was the grammar school of hawkshead where wordsworth spent his boyhood and the schoolmaster was the rev william taylor m a emmanuel college cambridge who was the third of the four masters who taught in it during wordsworths residence there he was master from 1782 to 1786 just before his death he sent for the upper boys of the school amongst whom was wordsworth and calling them into his room took leave of them with a solemn blessing this farewell doubtless suggested the lines           the blessing which to you   our common friend and father sent  mr taylor was buried in cartmell churchyard in the prelude wordsworth writes of him as an honoured teacher of my youth and there describes with some minuteness a visit to his grave see book x l 532 it will be seen however from the fenwick note to matthew that the hawkshead schoolmaster like the wanderer in the excursion was made up of several both of his class and men of other occupations but of the four masters who taught wordsworth at hawksheadpeake christian taylor and bowmantaylor was far the ablest the most interesting and the most beloved by the boys and it was doubtless the memory of this man that gave rise to the above poem and the four which follow it he was but thirtytwo years old when he died 12th june 1786 this fact taken in connection with line 14 of the address may illustrate the composite character of matthewed                                               matthew   composed 1799published 1800   in the school ofis a tablet on which are inscribed in gilt letters the names of the several persons who have been schoolmasters there since the foundation of the school with the time at which they entered upon and quitted their office opposite one of those names the author wrote the following linesw w 1800  such a tablet as is here spoken of continued to be preserved in hawkshead school though the inscriptions were not brought down to our time this and other poems connected with matthew would not gain by a literal detail of facts like the wanderer in the excursion this schoolmaster was made up of several both of his class and men of other occupations i do not ask pardon for what there is of untruth in such verses considered strictly as matters of fact it is enough if being true and consistent in spirit they move and teach in a manner not unworthy of a poets callingif a  in the editions of 1800 to 1820 this poem had no title except the note prefixed to it above although in the table of contents it was called lines written on a tablet in a school from 182032 matthew is the page heading though there is no title in the editions of 1827 and 1832 it was named in the table of contents by its first line if nature for a favourite child in 1837 it was entitled matthew it was included among the poems of sentiment and reflection the tablet with the names of the masters inscribed on it still exists in hawkshead schooled       if nature for a favourite child   in thee hath tempered so her clay   that every hour thy heart runs wild

reached the town    the wretched parents all that night   went shouting far and wide   but there was neither sound nor sight               35   to serve them for a guide    at daybreak on a hill they stood   that overlooked the moor   and thence they saw the bridge of wood   a furlong from their door                          40    they weptand turning homeward cried 5   in heaven we all shall meet

the long stonewall    and then an open field they crossed   the marks were still the same                      50   they tracked them on nor ever lost   and 8 to the bridge they came    they followed from the snowy bank   those 9 footmarks one by one   into the middle of the plank                       55   and further there were 10 none  yet some maintain that to this day   she is a living child

robinson wrote in his diary september 11 1816 referring to wordsworth    he mentioned the origin of some poems lucy gray that tender and   pathetic narrative of a child lost on a common was occasioned by the   death of a child who fell into the lock of a canal his object was to   exhibit poetically entire solitude and he represents the child as   observing the daymoon which no town or village girl would ever   notice  a contributor to notes and queries may 12 1883 whose signature is f writes    the scene of lucy grayin one of the editions of wordsworths   works the scene of this ballad is said to have been near halifax in   yorkshire i do not think the poet was acquainted with the locality   beyond a sight of the country in travelling through on some journey i   know of no spot where all the little incidents mentioned in the poem   would exactly fit in and a few of the local allusions are evidently   by a stranger there is no minster the church at halifax from time   immemorial has always been known as the parish church and sometimes   as the old church but has never been styled the minster the   mountain roe which of course may be brought in as poetically   illustrative has not been seen on these hills for generations and i   scarcely think even the fawn at play for more than a hundred years   these misapplications it is almost unnecessary to say do not detract   from the beauty of the poetry some of the touches are graphically   true to the neighbourhood as for instance the wide moor the   many a hill the steep hills edge the long stone wall and the   hint of the general loneliness of the region where lucy no mate no   comrade knew i think i can point out the exact spotno longer a   plank but a broad safe bridgewhere lucy fell into the water   taking a commonsense view that she would not be sent many miles at   two oclock on a winter afternoon to the town halifax of course   over so lonely a mountain moorbearing in mind also that this moor   overlooked the river and that the river was deep and strong enough to   carry the child down the currenti know only one place where such an   accident could have occurred the clue is in this verse      at daybreak on a hill they stood     that overlooked the moor     and thence they saw the bridge of wood     a furlong from their door    the hill i take to be the high ridge of greetland and norland moor   and the plank she had to cross sterne mill bridge which there spans   the calder broad and rapid enough at any season to drown either a   young girl or a grownup person the mountain burns romantic and wild   though they be are not dangerous to cross especially for a child old   enough to go and seek her mother to sum up the matter the hill   overlooking the moor the path to and distance from the town the   bridge the current all indicate one point and one point only where   this accident could have happened and that is the bridge near sterne   mill this bridge is so designated from the sterne family a branch of   whom in the last century resided close by the author of tristram   shandy spent his boyhood here and lucy gray had she safely crossed   the plank would

1820 in 1827 it was transferred to the poems of the imaginationed       when ruth was left half desolate   her father took another mate   and ruth not seven years old   a slighted child at her own will 1   went wandering over dale and hill                     5   in thoughtless freedom bold    and she had made a pipe of straw   and music from that pipe could draw   like sounds of winds and floods 2   had built a bower upon the green                     10   as if she from her birth had been   an infant of the woods    beneath her fathers roof alone 3   she seemed to live her thoughts her own   herself her own delight                              15   pleased with herself nor sad nor gay   and passing thus the livelong day   she grew to womans height 4    there came a youth from georgias shore   a military casque he wore                            20   with splendid feathers drest a   he brought them from the cherokees   the feathers nodded in the breeze   and made a gallant crest    from indian blood you deem him sprung                25   but no 5 he spake the english tongue   and bore 6 a soldiers name   and when america was free   from battle and from jeopardy   he cross the ocean came                             30    with hues of genius on his cheek   in finest tones the youth could speak while he was yet a boy   the moon the glory of the sun   and streams that murmur as they run                  35   had been his dearest joy    he was a lovely youth i guess   the panther in the wilderness   was not so fair as he   and when he chose to sport and play                 40   no dolphin ever was so gay   upon the tropic sea    among the indians he had fought   and with him many tales he brought   of pleasure and of fear                              45   such tales as told to any maid   by such a youth in the green shade   were perilous to hear    he told of girlsa happy rout   who quit their fold with dance and shout             50   their pleasant indian town   to gather strawberries all day long   returning with a choral song   when daylight is gone down    he spake of plants that hourly change                 55   their blossoms through a boundless range   of intermingling hues 7 b   with budding fading faded flowers   they stand the wonder of the bowers   from morn to evening dews c                        60   8   he told of the magnolia d spread   high as a cloud high over head   the cypress and her spire e of flowers f that with one scarlet gleam   cover a hundred leagues and seem                     65   to set the hills on fire g    the youth of green savannahs spake   and many an endless endless lake   with all its fairy crowds   of islands that together lie                         70   as quietly as spots of sky   among the evening clouds h    how pleasant then he said it were 9   a fisher or a hunter there   in sunshine or in shade                               75   to wander with an easy mind   and build a household fire and find 10   a home in every glade    what days and what bright 11 years ah me   our life were life indeed with thee                  80   so passed in quiet bliss   and all the while said he to know   that we were in a world of woe   on such an earth as this    and then he sometimes interwove                       85   fond 12 thoughts about a fathers love   for there said he are spun   around the heart such tender ties   that our own children to our eyes   are dearer than the sun                              90    sweet ruth and could you go with me   my helpmate in the woods

the church our faith will plight   a husband and a wife                               105   even so they did and i may say   that to sweet ruth that happy day   was more than human life    through dream and vision did she sink   delighted all the while to think                     110   that on those lonesome floods   and green savannahs she should share   his board with lawful joy and bear   his name in the wild woods    but as you have before been told                   115   this stripling sportive gay and bold   and with his dancing crest   so beautiful through savage lands   had

he lived 19 much evil saw                145   with men to whom no better law   nor better life was known   deliberately and undeceived   those wild mens vices he received   and gave them back his own                          150    his genius and his moral frame   were thus impaired and he became   the slave of low desires   a man who without selfcontrol   would seek what the degraded soul                    155   unworthily admires    and yet he with no feigned delight   had wooed the maiden day and night   had loved her night and morn   what could he less than love a maid                  160   whose heart with so much nature played   so kind and so forlorn    sometimes most earnestly he said   o ruth i have been worse than dead   false thoughts thoughts bold and vain              165

that better mind was gone 26   no hope no wish remained not one   they stirred him now no more   new objects did new pleasure give   and once again he wished to live                     185   as lawless as before    meanwhile as thus with him it fared   they for the voyage were prepared   and went to the seashore   but when they thither came the youth               190   deserted his poor bride and ruth   could never find him more    god help thee ruthsuch pains she had   that she in half a year was mad   and in a prison housed                              195   and there with many a doleful song   made of wild words her cup of wrong   she fearfully caroused 27    yet sometimes milder hours she knew   nor wanted sun nor rain nor dew                   200   nor pastimes of the may they all were with her in her cell   and a clear brook  28 with cheerful knell   did oer the pebbles play    when ruth three seasons thus had lain               205   there came a respite to her pain   she from her prison fled   but of the vagrant none took thought   and where it liked her best she sought   her shelter and her bread                           210    among the fields she breathed

the greenwood tree   and other home hath none    an innocent life yet far astray   and ruth will long before her day 32             230   be broken down and old   sore aches she needs must have but

district of the lakes two of them were fragments of a canto of the recluse entitled home at grasmere referring to his settlement at dove cottage others such as michael and the brothersclassed by him afterwards among the poems founded on the affectionsdeal with incidents in the rural life of the dalesmen of westmoreland and cumberland most of the poems on the naming of places were written during this year and the places are all in the neighbourhood of grasmere to these were added several pastoral poemssuch as the idle shepherd boys or dungeonghyll forcesundry poems of the fancy and one or two inscriptions in all twentyfive poems were written in the year 1800 and with the exception of the two fragments of the recluse they were published during the same year in the second volume of the second edition of lyrical ballads it is impossible to fix the precise date of the composition of the fragments of the recluse but as they refer to the settlement at dove cottagewhere wordsworth went to reside with his sister on the 21st of december 1799they may fitly introduce the poems belonging to the year 1800 they were first published in 1851 in the memoirs of wordsworth vol i pp 157 and 155 respectively by the poets nephew the late bishop of lincoln the entire canto of the recluse entitled home at grasmere will be included in this edition  the first two poems which follow as belonging to the year 1800 are parts of the recluse viz on natures invitation do i come which is ll 7197 and 110125 and bleak season was it turbulent and bleak which is ll 152167 they are not reprinted from the

identified much more than rydal mount with wordsworths poetic prime it had once been a publichouse bearing the sign of the dove and olive boughand as such is referred to in the waggonerfrom which circumstance it was for a long time and is now usually called dove cottage a small two storied house it is described somewhat minutelyas it was in wordsworths timeby de quincey in his recollections of the lakes and by the late bishop of lincoln in the memoirs of his uncle    the front of it faces the lake behind is a small plot of orchard and   garden ground in which there is a spring and rocks the enclosure   shelves upwards towards the woody sides of the mountains above it   a  the following is de quinceys description of it as he saw it in the summer of 1807    a white cottage with two yew trees breaking the glare of its white   walls these yews still stand on the eastern side of the cottage a   little semivestibule between two doors prefaced the entrance into   what might be considered the principal room of the cottage it was an   oblong square not above eight and a half feet high sixteen feet   long and twelve broad wainscoted from floor to ceiling with dark   polished oak slightly embellished with carving one window there   wasa perfect and unpretending cottage window with little diamond   panes embowered at almost every season of the year with roses and   in the summer and autumn with a profusion of jasmine and other   fragrant shrubs i was ushered up a little flight of stairs   fourteen in all to a little drawingroom or whatever the reader   chooses to call it wordsworth himself has described the fireplace of   this room as his      halfkitchen and halfparlour fire    it was not fully seven feet six inches high and in other respects   pretty nearly of the same dimensions as the rustic hall below there   was however in a small recess a library of perhaps three hundred   volumes which seemed to consecrate the room as the poets study and   composing room and such occasionally it was but far oftener he both   studied as i found and composed on the high road b  other poems of later years refer much more fully than the above to this cottage and its orchard ground where so many of wordsworths lyrics were composed  the orchard ground which was for the most part in grass sloped upwards but a considerable portion of the natural rock was exposed and on its face some rough stone steps were cut by wordsworth helped by a near neighbour of hisjohn fisherso as more conveniently to reach the upper terrace where the poet built for himself a small arbour all this garden and orchard ground is not much altered since 1800 the short terrace walk is curved with a sloping bank of grass above shaded by apple trees hazel holly laburnum laurel and mountain ash below the terrace is the well which supplied the cottage in wordsworths time and there large leaved primroses still grow doubtless the successors of those planted by his own and his sisters hands above and amongst the rocks are the daffodils which they also brought to their gardenground the christmas roses which they planted near the well were removed to the eastern side of the garden where they flourished luxuriantly in 1882 but have now alas disappeared the boxwood planted by the poet grows close to the cottage the arbour is now gone but in the place where it stood a seat is erected the hidden brook still sings its undersong as it used to do its quiet soul on all bestowing and the green linnet may doubtless be seen now as it used to be in 1803 the allusions to the garden ground at dove cottage in the poems which follow will be noted as they occured   footnotes  footnote a see the memoirs of wordsworth vol i p 156ed  footnote b see recollections of the lakes etc pp 130137

bleak   when hitherward we journeyed side by side   through burst of sunshine and through flying showers   paced the long vales how long they were and yet   how fast that length of way was left behind                   5   wensleys rich vale and sedberghs naked heights   the frosty wind as if to make amends   for its keen breath was aiding to our steps   and drove us onward like two ships at sea

which wordsworth and his sister took from sockburn to grasmere by wensleydale and askrigg and since he has left us an account of this journey in a letter to coleridge written a few days after their arrival at grasmerea letter in which his characterisation of nature is almost as happy as it is in his best poemssome extracts from it may here be appended    we left sockburn last tuesday morning we crossed the tees by   moonlight in the sockburn fields and after ten good miles riding came   in sight of the swale it is there a beautiful river with its green   banks and flat holms scattered over with trees four miles further   brought us to richmond with its huge ivied castle its friarage   steeple its castle tower resembling a huge steeple we were now in   wensleydale and d and i set off side by side to foot it as far as   kendal we reached askrigg twelve miles before six in the   evening having been obliged to walk the last two miles over hard   frozen roads next morning the earth was thinly covered with snow   enough to make the road soft and prevent its being slippery on   leaving askrigg we turned aside to see another waterfall it was a   beautiful morning with driving snow showers which disappeared by   fits and unveiled the east which was all one delicious pale orange   colour after walking through two small fields we came to a mill   which we passed and in a moment a sweet little valley opened before   us with an area of grassy ground and a stream dashing over various   lamin√¶ of black rocks close under a bank covered with firs the bank   and stream on our left another woody bank on our right and the flat   meadow in front from which as at buttermere the stream had retired   as it were to hide itself under the shade as we walked up this   delightful valley we were tempted to look back perpetually on the   stream which reflected the orange lights of the morning among the   gloomy rocks with a brightness varying with the agitation of the   current the steeple of askrigg was between us and the east at the   bottom of the valley it was not a quarter of a mile distant the   two banks seemed to join before us with a facing of rock common to   them both when we reached this bottom the valley opened out again   two rocky banks on each side which hung with ivy and moss and   fringed luxuriantly with brushwood ran directly parallel to each   other and then approaching with a gentle curve at their point of   union presented a lofty waterfall the termination of the valley it   was a keen frosty morning showers of snow threatening us but the sun   bright and active we had a task of twentyone miles to perform in a   short winters day on a nearer approach the waters seemed to fall   down a tall arch or niche that had shaped itself by insensible   moulderings in the wall of an old castle we left this spot with   reluctance but highly exhilarated it was bitter cold the wind   driving the snow behind us in the best style of a mountain storm we   soon reached an inn at a place called hardrane and descending from   our vehicles after warming ourselves by the cottage fire we walked   up the brookside to take a view of a third waterfall we had not   walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks   before we came full upon the waterfall which seemed to throw itself   in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock the water which shot   manifestly to some distance from the rock seeming to be dispersed   into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason we   were disappointed in the cascade itself though the introductory and   accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and   beauty after cautiously sounding our way over stones of all   colours and sizes encased in the clearest water formed by the spray   of the fall we found the rock which before had appeared like a wall   extending itself over our heads like the ceiling of a huge cave from   the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a   bason and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white   as snow or rather as dorothy says like congealed froth the water   fell at least ten yards from us and we stood directly behind it the   excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of   darkness but lofty and magnificent but in connection with the   adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared   from a scene so exquisitely beautiful the spot where we stood was as   dry as the chamber in which i am now sitting and the incumbent rock   of which the groundwork was limestone veined and dappled with colours   which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour on   the summit of the cave were three festoons or rather wrinkles in the   rock run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up   each of these was hung with icicles of various length and nearly in   the middle of the festoon in the deepest valley of the waves that ran   parallel to each other the stream shot from the rows of icicles in   irregular fits of strength and with a body of water that varied every   moment sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued   current sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall   and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from   our feet like the heaviest thunder shower in such a situation you   have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky large   fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water and   the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant the rocks on   each side which joining with the side of this cave formed the vista   of the brook were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls or   rather courses of water each of these was a miniature of all that   summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty the rock in the   centre of the falls where the water was most abundant a deep black   the adjoining parts yellow white purple and dove colour covered   with waterplants of the most vivid green and hung with streaming   icicles that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants   and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks and in some places   render the colours more brilliant i cannot express to you the   enchanting effect produced by this arabian scene of colour as the wind   blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood and alternately   hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular   succession or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness   as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed what a scene too   in summer in the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding   upon the pleasure which this cave in the heat of a july noon would   spread through a frame exquisitely sensible that huge rock on the   right the bank winding round on the left with all its living foliage   and the breeze stealing up the valley and bedewing the cavern with   the freshest imaginable spray and then the murmur of the water the   quiet the seclusion and a long summer day  ed   footnote on the text  footnote a this is a fragment of the

the name of the favoured suitor was adam fleming of   kirkpatrick that of the other has escaped tradition although it has   been alleged he was a bell of blackelhouse the addresses of the   latter were however favoured by the friends of the lady and the   lovers were therefore obliged to meet in secret and by night in the   churchyard of kirkconnell a romantic spot surrounded by the river

hartleap well   composed 1800published 1800   hartleap well is a small spring of water about five miles from richmond in yorkshire and near the side of the road which leads from richmond to askrigg its name is derived from a remarkable chace the memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second part of the following poem which monuments do now exist as i have there described themw w 1800  written at townend grasmere the first eight stanzas were composed extempore one winter evening in the cottage when after having tired myself with labouring at an awkward passage in the brothers i started with a sudden impulse to this to get rid of the other and finished it in a day or two my sister and i had passed the place a few weeks before in our wild winter journey from sockburn on the banks of the tees to grasmere a peasant whom we met near the spot told us the story so far as concerned the name of the well and the hart and pointed out the stones both the stones and the well are objects that may easily be missed the tradition by this time may be extinct in the neighbourhood the man who related it to us was very oldi f  included among the poems of the imaginationed       the knight had ridden down from wensley moor   with the slow motion of a summers cloud   and now as he approached a vassals door   bring forth another horse he cried aloud 1    another horsethat shout the vassal heard                   5   and saddled his best steed a comely grey   sir walter mounted him he was the third   which he had mounted on that glorious day    joy sparkled in the prancing coursers eyes   the horse and horseman are a happy pair                       10   but though sir walter like a falcon flies   there is a doleful silence in the air    a rout this morning left sir walters hall   that as they galloped made the echoes roar   but horse and man are vanished one and all                   15   such race i think was never seen before    sir

where is the throng the tumult of the race 5               25   the bugles that so joyfully were blown this chase it looks not like an earthly chase 6   sir walter and the hart are left alone    the poor hart toils along the mountainside   i will not stop to tell how far he fled                       30   nor will i mention by what death he died   but now the knight beholds him lying dead    dismounting then he leaned against a thorn   he had no follower dog nor man nor boy   he neither cracked 7 his whip nor blew his horn            35   but gazed upon the spoil with silent joy    close to the thorn on which sir walter leaned   stood his dumb partner in this glorious feat 8   weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned   and white with foam as if with cleaving sleet 9             40    upon his side the hart was lying stretched   his nostril touched 10 a spring beneath a hill   and with the last deep groan his breath had fetched   the waters of the spring were trembling still    and now too happy for repose or rest                         45   never had living man such joyful lot 11   sir walter walked all round north south and west   and gazed and gazed upon that darling spot 12    and climbing 13 up the hillit was at least   four 14 roods of sheer ascent sir walter found              50   three several hoofmarks which the hunted beast 15   had left imprinted on the grassy 16 ground    sir walter wiped his face and cried till now   such sight was never seen by human 17 eyes   three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow               55   down to the very fountain where he lies    ill build a pleasurehouse upon this spot   and a small arbour made for rural joy   twill be the travellers shed the pilgrims cot   a place of love for damsels that are coy

18 to make thy praises known            65   another monument shall here be raised   three several pillars each a roughhewn stone   and planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed    and in the summertime when days are long   i will come hither with my paramour                           70   and with the dancers and the minstrels song   we will make merry in that pleasant bower    till the foundations of the mountains fail   my mansion with its arbour shall endure   the joy of them who till the fields of swale                  75   and them who dwell among the woods of ure    then home he went and left the hart stonedead   with breathless nostrils stretched above the spring soon did the knight perform what he had said   and far and wide the fame thereof did ring 19               80    ere thrice the moon into her port had steered   a cup of stone received the living well   three pillars of rude stone sir walter reared   and built a house of pleasure in the dell    and near the fountain flowers of stature tall                 85   with trailing plants and trees were intertwined   which soon composed a little sylvan hall   a leafy shelter from the sun and wind    and thither when the summer days were long   sir walter led his wondering paramour 20                    90   and with the dancers and the minstrels song   made merriment within that pleasant bower    the knight sir walter died in course of time   and his bones lie in his paternal vale   but there is matter for a second rhyme                        95   and i to this would add another tale   part second    the moving accident a is not my trade   to freeze the blood i have no ready arts   tis my delight alone in summer shade   to pipe a simple song for 21 thinking hearts                 100    as i from hawes to richmond did repair   it chanced that i saw standing in a dell   three aspens at three corners of a square   and one not four yards distant near a well    what this imported i could ill divine                          105   and pulling now the rein my horse to stop   i saw three pillars standing in a line   the last stonepillar on a dark hilltop    the trees were grey with neither arms nor head   half wasted the square mound of tawny green                    110   so that you just might say as then i said   here in old time the hand of man hath 22 been    i looked upon the hill 23 both far and near   more doleful place did never eye survey   it seemed as if the springtime came not here                  115   and nature here were willing to decay    i stood in various thoughts and fancies lost b   when one who was in shepherds garb attired   came up the hollowhim did i accost   and what this place might be i then inquired                   120    the shepherd stopped and that same story told   which in my former rhyme i have rehearsed   a jolly place said he in times of old   but something ails it now the spot is curst    you see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood125   some say that they are beeches others elms   these were the bower and here a mansion stood   the finest palace of a hundred realms    the arbour does its own condition tell   you see the stones the fountain and the stream               130   but as to the great lodge you might as well   hunt half a day for a forgotten dream    theres neither dog nor heifer horse nor sheep   will wet his lips within that cup of stone   and oftentimes when all are fast asleep                       135   this water doth send forth a dolorous groan    some say that here a murder has been done   and blood cries out for blood but for my part   ive guessed when ive been sitting in the sun   that it was all for that unhappy hart                          140    what thoughts must through the creatures brain have past   even from the topmost stone upon the steep 24   are but three boundsand look sir at this last   o master it has been a cruel leap    for thirteen hours he ran a desperate

john r tutin of hull    june 20 1881 visited hartleap well the subject of wordsworths   poem it is situated on the road side leading from richmond to   askrigg at a distance of not more than three and ahalf miles from   richmond and not five miles as stated in the prefatory note to the   poem the three aspens at three corners of a square are things of   the past also the three stone pillars standing in a line on the   hill above in a straight line with the spring of water and where the   pillars would have been a wall has been built so that it is very   probable the stone pillars were removed at the time of the building of   this wall the scenery around answers exactly to the description      more doleful place did never eye survey     it seemed as if the spring time came not here     and nature here were willing to decay          now here is neither grass nor pleasant shade    it is barren moor for miles around the water still falls into the   cup of stone which appeared to be of very long standing within ten   yards of the well is a small tree at the same side of the road as the   well on the right hand coming from richmond  the rev thomas hutchinson of kimbolton wrote to me on june 18 1883    the tree is not a thorn but a lime it is evidently an old one but   is now in full and beautiful leaf it stands on the western side of   the road and a few yards distant from it the well is somewhat nearer   the road this side of the road is open to the fell on the other side   the road is bounded by a stone wall another wall meeting this one at   right angles exactly opposite the well i ascended the hill on the   north side of this wall for some distance but could find no trace of   any roughhewn stone descending on the other side i found in the   wall one and only one such stone i should say the base was in the   wall the stone itself leans outwards so that at the top three of   its square faces can be seen and two if not three of these faces   bear marks of being hammerdressed the distance from the stone to the   well is about 40 yards and the height of the stone out of the ground   about 3 or 4 feet    the ascent from the well is a gentle one not sheer nor does there   appear to be any hollow by which the shepherd could ascend on the   western side of the road there is a wide plain with a slight fall in   that direction     hartleap well is

little monitory anecdote concerning this subject when coleridge and southey were walking together upon the fells southey observed that if i wished to be considered a faithful painter of rural manners i ought not to have said that my shepherdboys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the poem just as the words had passed his lips two boys appeared with the very plant entwined round their hats i have often wondered that southey who rambled so much about the mountains should have fallen into this mistake and i record it as a warning for others who with far less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are and far less sagacity give way to presumptuous criticism from which he was free though in this matter mistaken in describing a tarn under helvellyn i say    there sometimes doth a leaping fish   send through the tarn a lonely cheer  this was branded by a critic of these days in a review ascribed to mrs barbauld as unnatural and absurd i admire the genius of mrs barbauld and am certain that had her education been favourable to imaginative influences no female of her day would have been more likely to sympathise with that image and to acknowledge the truth of the sentimenti f  included among the poems referring to the period of childhooded       the valley rings with mirth and joy   among the hills the echoes play   a never never ending song   to welcome

lovely sisters almost the first words my poor brother john said when he visited us for the first time at grasmere were were those two angels that i have just seen and from his description i have no doubt they were those two sisters the mother died in childbed and one of our neighbours at grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her babe in her arm i mention this to notice what i cannot but think a salutary custom once universal in these vales every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed which was never done nor i believe is now till a minute or two before the corpse was removed barbara lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom i had seen and overheard as described in the poem i chose the name for reasons implied in the above and here will add a caution against the use of names of living persons within a few months after the publication of this poem i was much surprised and more hurt to find it in a childs school book which having been compiled by lindley murray had come into use at grasmere school where barbara was a pupil and alas i had the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of being thus distinguished and in after life she used to say that she remembered the incident and what i said to her upon the occasioni f  included among the poems referring to the period of childhooded       the dew was falling fast the stars began to blink   i heard a voice it said drink pretty creature drink   and looking oer the hedge before me i espied   a snow white mountainlamb with a maiden at its side    nor sheep nor kine 1 were near the lamb was all alone            5   and by a slender cord was tethered to a stone   with one knee on the grass did the little maiden kneel   while to that mountainlamb she gave its evening meal    the lamb while from her hand he thus his supper took   seemed to feast with head and ears and his tail with pleasure shook   drink pretty creature drink she said in such a tone   that i almost received her heart into my own    twas little barbara lewthwaite a child of beauty rare   i watched them with delight they were a lovely pair   now with her empty can the maiden turned away                      15   but ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay    right towards the lamb she looked and from a shady place 2   i unobserved could see the workings of her face   if nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring   thus thought i to her lamb that little maid might sing           20    what

1800published 1815 a   the character of this man was described to me and the incident upon which the verses turn was told me by mr poole of nether stowey with whom i became acquainted through our common friend s t coleridge during my residence at alfoxden i used to see much of him and had frequent occasions to admire the course of his daily life especially his conduct to his labourers and poor neighbours their virtues he carefully encouraged and weighed their faults in the scales of charity if i seem in these verses to have treated the weaknesses of the farmer and his transgressions too tenderly it may in part be ascribed to my having received the story from one so averse to all harsh judgment after his death was found in his escritoir a lock of grey hair carefully preserved with a notice that it had been cut from the head of his faithful shepherd who had served him for a length of years i need scarcely add that he felt for all men as his brothers he was much beloved by distinguished personsmr coleridge mr southey sir h davy and many others and in his own neighbourhood was highly valued as a magistrate a man of business and in every other social relation the latter

7 and meadow and lea   all caught the infectionas generous as he                        20    yet adam prized little the feast and the bowl 8   the fields better suited the ease of his soul   he strayed through the fields like an indolent wight   the quiet of nature was adams delight    for adam was simple in thought and the poor                       25   familiar with him made an inn of his

and wishes from all living things   went circling like a multitude of sounds   the budding groves seemed eager to urge on   the steps of june as if their various hues                10   were only hindrances that stood between   them and their object but meanwhile prevailed   such an entire contentment in the air 1   that every naked ash and tardy tree   yet leafless showed as if 2 the

which i till then had heard appeared the voice   of common pleasure beast and bird the lamb              25   the shepherds dog the linnet and the thrush   vied with this waterfall and made a song

meanwhile   there was such deep contentment in the air     1800   variant 2  1845     seemd as though     1800    the text of the poems on the naming of places underwent comparatively little alteration in successive editions both the changes in the first poem were made in 1845 from the fenwick note it is evident that the rivulet was easdale beck but where was emmas dell in the autumn of 1877 dr cradock the principal of brasenose college oxford took me to a place of which he afterwards wrote    i have a fancy for a spot just beyond goody bridge to the left where   the brook makes a curve and returns to the road two hundred yards   farther on but i have not discovered a trace of authority in favour   of the idea farther than that the wooded bend of the brook with the   stepping stones across it connected with a fieldpath recently   stopped was a very favourite haunt of wordsworths at the upper part   of this bend near to the place where the brook returns to the road   is a deep pool at the foot of a rush of water in this pool a man   named wilson was drowned many years ago he lived at a house on the   hill called score crag which if my conjecture as to emmas dell is   right is the single mountain cottage on a summit distant a short   space wordsworth happening to be walking at no great distance   heard a loud shriek it was that of mr wilson the father who had   just discovered his sons body in the beck  in the reminiscences of the poet by the hon mr justice coleridge which were contributed to the memoirs of wordsworth written by his nephew vol ii pp 300315 there is a record of a walk they took up easdale to this place entering the field just at the spot which dr cradock supposes to be emmas dell    he turned aside at a little farmhouse and took us into a swelling   field to look down on the tumbling stream which bounded it and which   we saw precipitated at a distance in a broad white sheet from the   mountain this refers to easdale force then as he mused for an   instant he said      i have often thought what a solemn thing it would be could we have     brought to our mind at once all the scenes of distress and misery     which any spot however beautiful and calm before us has been     witness to since the beginning that water break with the glassy     quiet pool beneath it that looks so lovely and presents no images     to the mind but of peacethere i remember the only son of his     father a poor man who lived yonder was drowned  this walk and conversation took place in october 1836 if any one is surprised that wordsworth supposing him to have been then looking into the very dell on which he wrote the above poem in 1800 did not name it to mr coleridge he must remember that he was not in the habit of speaking of the places he had memorialised in verse and that in 1836 his sister emmeline had for a year been a confirmed invalid at rydal i have repeatedly followed easdale beck all the way up from its junction with the rothay to the tarn and found no spot corresponding so closely to the realistic detail of this poem as the one suggested by dr cradock there are two places further up the dale where the sallies of glad sound such as are referred to in the poem are even more distinctly audible but they are not at a sudden turning as is the spot above goody bridge if one leaves the easdale road at this bridge and keeps to the side of the beck for a few hundred yards till he reaches the turningespecially if it be a bright april morning such as that described in the poemand remembers that this path by the brook was a favourite resort of wordsworth and his sister the probability of dr cradocks suggestion will be apparent lady richardson who knew the place and appreciated the poem as thoroughly as any of wordsworths friends told me that she concurred in this identification of the delled                                               to joanna   composed 1800published 1800   written at grasmere the effect of her laugh is an extravagance though the effect of the reverberation of voices in some parts of the mountains is very striking there is in the excursion an allusion to the bleat of a lamb thus reechoed and described without any exaggeration as i heard it on the side of stickle tarn from the precipice that stretches on to langdale pikesif       amid the smoke of cities did you pass   the time 1 of early youth and there you learned   from years of quiet industry to love   the living beings by your own fireside   with such a strong devotion that your heart                    5   is slow to meet 2 the sympathies of them   who look upon the hills with tenderness   and make dear friendships with the streams and groves   yet we who are transgressors in this kind   dwelling retired in our simplicity                             10   among the woods and fields we love you well   joanna and i guess since you have been   so distant from us now for two long years   that you will gladly listen to discourse   however trivial if you thence be taught 3                   15   that they with whom you once were happy talk   familiarly of you and of old times      while i was seated now some ten days past   beneath those lofty firs that overtop   their ancient neighbour the old steepletower                20   the vicar from his gloomy house hard by a   came forth to greet me and when he had asked   how fares joanna that wildhearted maid   and when will she return to us he paused   and after short exchange of village news                     25   he with grave looks demanded for what cause   reviving obsolete idolatry   i like a runic priest in characters   of formidable size had chiselled out   some uncouth name upon the native rock                        30   above the rotha by the forestside now by those dear immunities of heart   engendered between 4 malice and true love   i was not loth to be so catechised   and this was my replyas it befel                          35   one summer morning we had walked abroad   at break of day joanna and myself twas that delightful season when the broom   fullflowered and visible on every steep   along the copses runs in veins of gold                        40   our pathway led us on to rothas banks   and when we came in front of that tall rock   that eastward looks i there stopped shortand stood 5   tracing 6 the lofty barrier with my eye   from base to summit such delight i found                      45   to note in shrub and tree in stone and flower   that intermixture of delicious hues   along so vast a surface all at once   in one impression by connecting force   of their own beauty imaged in the heart                      50 when i had gazed perhaps two minutes space   joanna looking in my eyes beheld   that ravishment of mine and laughed aloud   the rock like something starting from a sleep   took up the ladys voice and laughed again                   55   that ancient woman seated on helmcrag   was ready with her

side   the fair joanna drew as if she wished                         75   to shelter from some object of her fear and hence long afterwards when eighteen moons   were wasted as i chanced to walk alone   beneath this rock at sunrise on a calm   and silent morning i sat down and there                     80   in memory of affections old and true   i chiselled out in those rude characters   joannas

grasmere where wordsworth lived from 1811 to 1813 and where two of his children dieded   in cumberland and westmoreland are several inscriptions upon the native rock which from the wasting of time and the rudeness of the workmanship had been mistaken for runic they are without doubt roman  the rotha mentioned in this poem is the river which flowing through the lakes of grasmere and rydale falls into wyndermere on helmcrag that impressive single mountain at the head of the vale of grasmere is a rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an old woman cowering close by this rock is one of those fissures or caverns which in the language of the country are called dungeons the other mountains either immediately surround the vale of grasmere or belong to the same clusterw w 1800  most of the mountains here mentioned immediately surround the vale of grasmere of the others some are at a considerable distance but they belong to the same clusterw w 1802  the majority of the changes introduced into the text of this poem were made in the year 1836  the place where the echo of the bleat of the lamb was heardreferred to in the fenwick notemay be easily found the precipice is pavy ark the lofty firs that overtop their ancient neighbour the old steepletower stood by the roadside scarcely twenty yards northwest from the steeple of grasmere church their site is now included in the road which has been widened at that point they were scotch firs of unusual size and might justly be said to overtop their neighbour the tower mr fleming green who well remembers the trees gave me this information which is confirmed by other inhabitants    when the road was enlarged not many years ago the roots of the   trees were found by the workmen  dr cradock to the editor the            tall rock     that eastward looks  by the banks of the rotha presenting a lofty barrier from base to summit is manifestly a portion of helmcrag it is impossible to know whether wordsworth carved joanna hutchinsons name anywhere on helmcrag and it is useless to enquire if he did so the discovery of the place would not help any one to understand or appreciate the poem it is obvious that he did not intend to be literally exact in details as the poem was written in 1800 and addressed to joanna hutchinsonwho is spoken of as having been absent from grasmere for two long years and wordsworth says that he carved the runic characters in memoriam eighteen months after that summer morning when he heard the echo of her laugh but the family took up residence at grasmere only in december 1799 and the poems on the naming of places were published before the close of 1800 the effect of these lines to joanna however is certainly not impairedit may even be enhancedby our inability to localise them only one in the list of places referred to can occasion any perplexity viz hammarscar since it is a name now disused in the district it used to be applied to some rocks on the flank of silverhow to the wood around them and also to the gorge between silverhow and loughrigg hammar from the old norse hamar signifies a steep broken rock  the imaginative description of the echo of the ladys laugh suggests a parallel passage from michael draytons polyolbion which wordsworth must doubtless have read see his sisters reference to drayton in her recollections of a tour made in scotland in 1803 in the note to the poem at the grave of burns p 382 of this volume     which copland scarce had spoke but quickly every hill   upon her verge that stands the neighbouring valleys fill   helvillon from his height it through the mountains threw   from whence as soon again the sound dunbalrase drew   from whose stonetroph√®d head it on the wendrosse went   which towrds the sea again resounded it to dent   that brodwater therewith within her banks astound   in sailing to the sea told it to egremound   whose buildings walks and streets with echoes loud and long   did mightily commend old copland for her song  polyolbion the thirtieth song ll 155164   any one who compares this passage with wordsworths joanna will see the difference between the elaborate fancy of a topographical narrator and the vivid imagination of a poetical idealist a somewhat similar instance of indebtednessin which the debt is repaid by additional insightis seen when we compare a passage from sir john daviess orchestra or a poem on dancing stanza 49 with one from the ancient mariner part vi stanzas 2 and 3although there was more of the true imaginative light in davies than in drayton     for lo the sea that fleets about the land     and like a girdle clips her solid waist   music and measure both doth understand     for his great crystal eye is always cast     up to the moon and on her fixed fast       and as she danceth in her palid sphere       so danceth he about his centre here  davies       still as a slave before his lord     the ocean hath no blast     his great bright eye most silently     up to the moon is cast      if he may know which way to go     for she guides him smooth or grim     see brother see how graciously     she looketh down on him  coleridge   these extracts show how both wordsworth and coleridge assimilated past literary products and how they glorified them by reproduction there was little however in the poetic imagery of previous centuries that wordsworth reproduced his imagination worked in a sphere of its own free from the trammels of precedent and he was more original than any other nineteenth century poet in his use of symbol and metaphor the poem to joanna was probably composed on august 22 1800 as the following occurs in dorothy wordsworths journal under that date    william was composing all the morning  w read us the poem of   joanna beside the rothay by the roadside  charles lamb wrote to wordsworth in january 1801 of    these continuous echoes in the story of joannas laugh when the   mountains and all the scenery

tossed ashore   feather or leaf or weed or withered bough   each on the other heaped along the line                    15   of the dry wreck and in our vacant mood   not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft   of dandelion seed or thistles beard   that skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake   suddenly halting nowa lifeless stand                     20   and starting off again with freak as

sounds   and feeding thus our fancies we advanced 6   along the indented shore when suddenly   through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen 7         45   before us on a point of jutting land   the tall and upright figure of a man   attired in peasants garb who stood alone   angling beside the margin of the lake 8   improvident and reckless we exclaimed                   50   the man must be who thus can lose a day 9   of the mid harvest when the labourers hire   is ample and some little might be stored   wherewith to cheer him in the winter time   thus talking of that peasant we approached                 55   close to the spot where with his rod and line   he stood alone whereat he turned his head   to greet usand we saw a man worn down   by sickness gaunt and lean with sunken cheeks   and wasted limbs his legs so long and lean                 60   that for my single self i looked at them   forgetful of the body they sustained   too weak to labour in the harvest field   the man was using his best skill to gain   a pittance from the dead unfeeling lake                     65   that knew not of his wants i will not say   what thoughts immediately were ours nor how   the happy idleness of that sweet morn   with all its lovely images was changed   to serious musing and to selfreproach                     70   nor did we fail to see within ourselves   what need there is to be

which follows to m h with the exception of a single change  in wordsworths early days at grasmere a wild woodland path of quiet beauty led from dove cottage along the margin of the lake to the point referred to in this poem leaving the eastern shore truly safe in its own privacya retired and difficult way the highway road for carriages being at that time over white moss common the late dr arnold of rugby and foxhowe used to name the three roads from rydal to grasmere thus the highest old corruption the intermediate bit by bit reform the lowest and most level radical reform wordsworth was never quite reconciled to the radical reform effected on a road that used to be so delightfully wild and picturesque the spot which the three friends rather infelicitously named point rashjudgment is easily identified although as wordsworth remarks the character of the shore is changed by the public road being carried along its side the friends were quite aware that the memorial name they gave it was uncouth in spite of its awkwardness however it will probably survive if not for brownings reason    the better the uncouther   do roses stick like burrs  at least because of the incident which

brought us to a slip of lawn   and a small bed of water in the woods   all round this pool both flocks and herds might drink   on its firm margin even as from a well   or some stonebasin which the

that of 1800   to find the pool referred to in the fenwick note i have carefully examined the course of rydal beck all the way up to the foot of the fell there is a pool beyond the enclosures of the hall property about five hundred feet above rydal mount which partly corresponds to the description in the poem but there is no wood around it now and the trees which skirt its margin are birch ash oak and hazel but there are no beeches it is a short way below some fine specimens of iceworn rocks which are to the right of the stream as you ascend it and above these rocks is a wellmarked moraine it is a deep crystal pool and has a firm margin of artificially placed stones this may be the spot described in the poem or another within the grounds of the hall may be the place referred to it is a sequestered nook beside the third waterfall as you ascend the beckthis third cascade being itself a treble fall seen two or three days after rain when the stream is full enough to break over the whole face of the rock in showers of snowy brightness yet low enough to shew the rock behind its transparent veil it is specially beautiful trees change so much in eighty years that the absence of beeches now would not make this site impossible in a ms copy of the poem of date dec 28 1800 the last line is    with all its poplars we have named from you  of the circular pool beneath this fall it may be said as wordsworth describes it that     both flocks and herds might drink   on its firm margin even as from a well  and a small slip of lawn might easily have existed there in his time we cannot however be confident as to the locality and i add the opinion of several whose judgment may be deferred to dr cradock writes    as to mary hutchinsons pool i think that it was not on the beck   anywhere but some detached little pool far up the hill to the   eastwards of the hall in the woods the description does not well   suit any part of rydal beck and no spot thereon could long remain   unknown as the brook was until lately much haunted by anglers  my difficulty as to a site far up the hill is that it must have been a pool of some size if both flocks and herds might drink all round it and there is no stream scarce even a rill that joins rydal beck on the right all the way up from its junction with the rothay the late mr hull of rydal cottage wrote    although closely acquainted with every nook about rydal park i have   never been able to discover any spot corresponding to that described   in wordsworths lines to m h it is possible however that the   small bed of water may have been a temporary rain pool such as   sometimes lodges in the hollows on the mountainslope after heavy   rain  mr f m jones the agent of the rydal property writes    i do not know of any pool of water in the upper rydal park there are   some pools up the river mirror pool among them but i hardly think   there can ever have been beechtrees growing near them  there are many difficulties and the place cannot now be identified wordsworths own wish will doubtless be realised    the travellers know it not and twill remain   unknown to them  ed                                               the

stream  dr cradock to the editor in 1877 it still grows luxuriantly there  the following extract from dorothy wordsworths journal illustrates both this and the next poem    friday 23rd april 1802it being a beautiful morning we set off at   eleven oclock intending to stay out of doors all the morning we   went towards rydal under nab scar the sun shone and we were lazy   coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down upon but we could   not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade so we pushed on to   the foot of the scar it was very grand when we looked up very stony   here and there a budding tree william observed that the umbrella   yewtree that breasts the wind had lost its character as a tree and   had become like solid wood coleridge and i pushed on before we left   william sitting on the stones feasting with silence and i sat down   upon a rocky seat a couch it might be under the bower of williams   eglantine andrews broom he was below us and we could see him   he came to us and repeated his poems while we sat beside him we   lingered long looking into the vales ambleside vale with the   copses the village under the hill and the green fields rydale with   a lake all alive and glittering yet but little stirred by breezes   and our own dear grasmere making a little round lake of natures own   with never a house never a green field but the copses and the bare   hills enclosing it and the river flowing out of it above rose the   coniston fells in their own shape and colour  the sky and the   clouds and a few wild creatures coleridge went to search for   something new we saw him climbing up towards a rock he called us   and we found him in a bowerthe sweetest that was ever seen the   rock on one side is very high and all covered with ivy which hung   loosely about and bore bunches of brown berries on the other side   it was higher than my head we looked down on the ambleside vale that   seemed to wind away from us the village lying under the hill the fir   tree island was reflected beautifully about this bower there is   mountainash common ash yew tree ivy holly hawthorn roses   flowers and a carpet of moss above at the top of the rock there is   another spot it is scarce a bower a little parlour not enclosed by   walls but shaped out for a restingplace by the rocks and the ground   rising about it it had a sweet moss carpet we resolved to go and   plant flowers in both these places tomorrow  this extract is taken from the journal as originally transcribed by me in 1889 when it appears in this edition it will be greatly enlargeded

           220   year after year the old man still kept up 25   a cheerful mindand buffeted with bond   interest and mortgages at last he sank   and went into his grave before his time   poor walter whether it was care that spurred him             225   god only knows but to the very last   he had the lightest foot in ennerdale   his pace was never that of an old man   i almost see him tripping down the path   with his two grandsons after himbut you                   230   unless our landlord be your host tonight   have far to traveland on 26 these rough paths   even in the longest day of

         they didand truly   but that was what we almost overlooked   they were such darlings of each other yes   though from the cradle they had lived with walter   the only kinsman near them and though he                     255   inclined to both by reason of his age   with a more fond familiar tenderness   they notwithstanding had much love to spare 28   and it all went into each others hearts   leonard the elder by just eighteen months                   260   was two years taller twas a joy to see   to hear to meet themfrom their house the school   is 29 distant three short miles and in the time   of storm and thaw when every watercourse   and unbridged stream such as you may have noticed            265   crossing our roads at every hundred steps   was swoln into a noisy rivulet   would leonard then when elder boys remained   at home go staggering through the slippery fords 30   bearing his brother on his back i have 31 seen him        270   on windy days in one of those stray brooks   ay more than once i have 31 seen him midleg deep   their two books lying both on a dry stone   upon the hither side and once i said   as i remember looking round these rocks                      275   and hills on which we all of us were born   that god who made the great book of the world   would bless such piety    leonard              it may be then    priest never did worthier lads break english bread        280   the very brightest sunday autumn saw 32   with all its mealy clusters of ripe nuts   could never keep those 33 boys away from church   or tempt them to an hour of sabbath breach   leonard and james i warrant every corner                    285   among these rocks and every hollow place   that venturous foot could reach to one or both 34   was known as well as to the flowers that grow there   like roebucks they went bounding oer the hills   they played like two young ravens on the crags               290   then they could write ay and speak too as well   as many of their bettersand for leonard   the very night before he went away   in my own house i put into his hand   a bible and id wager house and field                        295   that if he be alive he has it yet 35    leonard it seems these brothers have not lived to be   a comfort to each other    priest           that they might   live to such end 36 is what both old and young              300   in this our valley all of us have wished   and what for my part i have often prayed   but leonard    leonard     then james still is left among you    priest tis of the elder brother i am speaking            305   they had an unclehe was at that time   a thriving man and trafficked on the seas   and but for that 37 same uncle to this hour   leonard had never handled rope or shroud   for the boy loved the life which we lead here                310   and though of unripe years a stripling only 38   his soul was knit to this his native soil   but as i said old walter was too weak   to strive with such a torrent when he died   the estate and house were sold and all their sheep          315   a pretty flock and which for aught i know   had clothed the ewbanks for a thousand years   wellall was gone and they were destitute   and leonard chiefly for his brothers sake   resolved to try his fortune on the seas                      320   twelve years are past 39 since we had tidings from him   if there were 40 one among us who had heard   that leonard ewbank was come home again   from the great gavel g down by leezas banks   and down the enna far as egremont                           325   the day would be a joyous festival 41   and those two bells of ours which there you see   hanging in the open airbut o good sir   this is sad talktheyll never sound for him   living or deadwhen last we heard of him                   330   he was in slavery among the moors   upon the barbary coasttwas not a little   that would bring down his spirit and no doubt   before it ended in his death the youth 42   was sadly crossedpoor leonard when we parted             335   he took me by the hand and said to me   if eer he should grow rich he would return   to live in peace upon his fathers land   and lay his bones among us 43    leonard             if that day                            340   should come twould needs be a glad day for him   he would himself no doubt be happy then   as any that should meet him    priest                happy sir    leonard you said his kindred all were in their graves     345   and that he had one brother    priest               that is but   a fellowtale of sorrow from his youth   james though not sickly yet was delicate   and leonard being always by his side                          350   had done so many offices about him   that though he was not of a timid nature   yet still the spirit of a mountainboy   in him was somewhat checked and when his brother   was gone to sea and he was left alone                       355   the little colour that he had was soon   stolen from his cheek he drooped and pined and pined    leonard but these are all the graves of fullgrown men    priest ay sir that passed away we took him to us   he was the child of all the dalehe lived                    360   three months with one and six months with another   and wanted neither food nor clothes nor love   and many many happy days were his   but whether blithe or sad tis my belief   his absent brother still was at his heart                    365   and when he dwelt 44 beneath our roof we found   a practice till this time unknown to him   that often rising from his bed at night   he in his sleep would walk about and sleeping   he sought his brother leonardyou are moved                370   forgive me sir before i spoke to you   i judged you most unkindly    leonard             but this youth   how did he die at last    priest          one sweet maymorning                     375   it will be twelve years since when spring returns   he had gone forth among the newdropped lambs   with two or three companions whom their course   of occupation led from height to height   under a cloudless suntill he at length                    380   through weariness or haply to indulge   the humour of the moment lagged behind 45   you see yon precipiceit wears the shape   of a vast building made of many crags 46   and in the midst is one particular rock                       385   that rises like a column from the vale   whence by our shepherds it is called the pillar   upon its a√´ry summit crowned with heath   the loiterer not unnoticed by his comrades   lay stretched at ease but passing by the place              390   on their return they found that he was gone   no ill was feared till one of them by chance   entering when evening was far spent the house   which at that time was jamess home there learned 47   that nobody had seen him all that day h                    395   the morning came and still he was unheard of   the neighbours were alarmed and to the brook   some hastened some ran to the lake 48 ere noon   they found him at the foot of that same rock   dead and with mangled limbs the third day after             400   i buried him poor youth 49 and there he lies    leonard and that then is his gravebefore his death   you say 50 that he saw many happy years    priest ay that he did    leonard                 and all went well with him405    priest if he had one the youth 51 had twenty homes    leonard and you believe then that his mind was easy    priest yes long before he died he found that time   is a true friend to sorrow and unless   his thoughts were turned on leonards luckless fortune       410   he talked about him with a cheerful love    leonard he could not come to an unhallowed end    priest nay god forbidyou recollect i mentioned   a habit which disquietude and grief   had brought upon him and we all conjectured                  415   that as the day was warm he had lain down   on the soft heath 52 and waiting for his comrades   he there had fallen asleep that in his sleep   he to the margin of the precipice   had walked and from the summit had fallen headlong          420   and so no doubt he perished when the youth   fell in his hand he must have graspd we think 53   his shepherds staff for on that pillar of rock   it had been caught mid way and there for years 54   it hungand mouldered there                                425                                   the priest here ended   the stranger would have thanked him but he felt   a gushing from his heart that took away   the power of speech both left the spot in silence 55   and leonard when they reached the churchyard gate          430   as the priest lifted up the latch turned round   and looking at the grave he said my brother   the vicar did not hear the words and now   he pointed towards his dwellingplace entreating 56   that leonard would partake his homely fare                   435   the other thanked him with an earnest 57 voice   but added that the evening being calm   he would pursue his journey so they parted    it was not long ere leonard reached a grove   that overhung the road he there stopped short               440   and sitting down beneath the trees reviewed   all that the priest had said his early years   were with himhis long absence cherished hopes 58   and thoughts which had been his an hour before   all pressed on him with such a weight that now              445   this vale where he had been so happy seemed   a place in which he could not bear to live   so he relinquished all his purposes   he travelled back 59 to egremont and thence   that night he wrote a letter to the priest 60             450   reminding him of what had passed between them   and adding with a hope to be forgiven   that it was from the weakness of his heart   he had not dared to tell him who he was   this done he went on shipboard and is now                   455   a seaman a

coleridges criticism of these lines in a note to chapter xviii of biographia literaria vol ii p 83 of the edition of 1817ed    this poem illustrates the way in which wordsworths imagination worked upon a minimum of fact idealizing a simple story and adding                                 the gleam   the light that never was on sea or land   the consecration and the poets dream  it is the only poem of his referring to ennerdale but perhaps the chief association with that dale to those who visit it after becoming acquainted with this poem will be the fact that the brothers ewbank were supposed to have spent their youth under the shadow of the pillar and leonard to have had this conversation on his return from sea with the venerable priest of ennerdale the district is described with all that local accuracy which wordsworth invariably showed in idealization the height whence james ewbank is supposed to have fallen is not the pillarrocka crag somewhat difficult to ascend except by practised climbers and which has only been accessible since mountaineering became an art and a passion to englishmen but if we suppose the conversation with the priest of ennerdale to have taken place at the bridge below the lakeas that is the only place where there is both a hamlet and a churchyardthe precipice will refer to the pillar mountain both are alluded to in the poem the lines    you see yon precipiceit wears the shape   of a vast building made of many crags   and in the midst is one particular rock   that rises like a column from the vale   whence by our shepherds it is called the pillar  are definite enough the great mass of the pillar mountain is first referred to and then the rock which is a characteristic spur halfway up the mountain on its northern side the a√´ry summit crowned with heath however on which the loiterer lay stretched at ease could neither be the top of this rock nor the summit of the mountain not the former because there is no heath on it and it would be impossible for a weary man loitering behind his companions to ascend it to rest not the latter because no one resting on the summit of the mountain could be not unnoticed by his comrades and they would not pass that way over the top of the mountain on their return to ennerdale this is an instance therefore in which precise localization is impossible probably wordsworth did not know either that the pillar rock was bare on the summit or that it had never been ascended in 1800 and he idealised it to suit his imaginative purpose in connection with this poem a remark he made to the hon mr justice coleridge may be recalled    he said there was some foundation in fact however slight for every   poem he had written of a narrative kind  the brothers was   founded on a young shepherd in his sleep having fallen down a crag   his staff remaining suspended midway  see the memoirs of wordsworth by the late bishop of lincoln vol ii p 305 it should be added that the character of leonard ewbank was drawn in large part from that of the poets brother johned                                               the seven sisters or the solitude of binnorie a   composed 1800 bpublished 1807   the story

unusual strength his mind was keen   intense and frugal apt for all affairs                          45   and in his shepherds calling he was prompt   and watchful more than ordinary men   hence had he learned 6 the meaning of all winds   of blasts of every tone and oftentimes   when others heeded not he heard the south                         50   make subterraneous music like the noise   of bagpipers on distant highland hills   the shepherd at such warning of his flock   bethought him and he to himself would say   the winds are now devising work for me                          55   and

injury done to sickle flail or scythe   or other implement of house or field    down from the ceiling by the chimneys edge                     110   that 13 in our ancient uncouth country style   with huge and black projection overbrowed 14   large space beneath as duly as the light   of day grew dim the housewife hung a lamp   an aged utensil which had performed                              115   service beyond all others of its kind   early at evening did it burnand late   surviving comrade of uncounted hours   which going by from year to year had found   and left the couple neither gay perhaps                           120   nor cheerful yet with objects and with hopes   living a life of eager industry   and now when luke had reached his 15 eighteenth year   there by the light of this old lamp they sate   father and son while far 16 into the night                     125   the housewife plied her own peculiar work   making the cottage through the silent hours   murmur as with the sound of summer flies b   17 this 18 light was famous in its neighbourhood   and was a public symbol of the life                               130   that 19 thrifty pair had lived for as it chanced   their cottage on a plot of rising ground   stood single with large prospect north and south   high into easedale up to dunmailraise   and westward to the village near the lake                        135   and from this constant light so regular   and so far seen the house itself by all   who dwelt within the limits of the vale   both old and young was named the evening star      thus living on through such a length of years                  140   the shepherd if he loved himself must needs   have loved his helpmate but to michaels heart   this son of his old age was yet more dear   less from instinctive tenderness 20 the same   fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all21          145   than 22 that a child more than all other gifts   that earth can offer to declining man 23   brings hope with it and forwardlooking thoughts   and stirrings of inquietude when they   by tendency of nature needs must fail                            150   24 exceeding was the love he bare to him   his heart and his hearts joy for oftentimes   old michael while he was a babe in arms   had done him female service not alone   for pastime 25 and delight as is the use                       155   of fathers but with patient mind enforced   to acts of tenderness and he had rocked   his cradle as with a womans gentle hand 26   and in a later time ere yet the boy   had put on boys attire did michael love                        160   albeit of a stern unbending mind   to have the youngone in his sight when he   wrought in the field or on his shepherds stool   sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched   under the large old oak that near his door                       165   stood single and from matchless depth of shade 27   chosen for the shearers covert from the sun   thence in our rustic dialect was called   the clipping tree c a name which yet it bears   there while they two were sitting in the shade                  170   with others round them earnest all and blithe   would michael exercise his heart with looks   of fond correction and reproof bestowed   upon the child if he disturbed the sheep   by catching at their legs or with his shouts                     175   scared them while they lay still beneath the shears    and when by heavens good grace the boy grew up   a healthy lad and carried in his cheek   two steady roses that were five years old   then michael from a winter coppice cut                            180   with his own hand a sapling which he hooped   with iron making it throughout in all   due requisites a perfect shepherds staff   and gave it to the boy wherewith equipt   he as a watchman oftentimes was placed                            185   at gate or gap to stem or turn the flock   and to his office prematurely called   there stood the urchin as you will divine   something between a hindrance and a help   and for this cause not always i believe                         190   receiving from his father hire of praise   though nought was left undone which staff or voice   or looks or threatening gestures could perform    but soon as luke full ten years old could stand   against the mountain blasts and to the heights                  200   not fearing toil nor length of weary ways   he with his father daily went and they   were as companions why should i relate   that objects which the shepherd loved before   were dearer now that from the boy there came                     205   feelings and emanationsthings which were   light to the sun and music to the wind   and that the old mans heart seemed born again    thus in his fathers sight the boy grew up   and now when he had reached his eighteenth year                 210   he was his comfort and his daily hope d    while in this sort the simple household lived 28   from day to day to michaels ear there came   distressful tidings long before the time   of which i speak the shepherd had been bound                     215   in surety for his brothers son a man   of an industrious life and ample means   but unforeseen misfortunes suddenly   had prest upon him and old michael now   was summoned to discharge the forfeiture                         220   a grievous penalty but little less   than half his substance this unlookedfor claim   at the first hearing for a moment took   more hope out of his life than he supposed   that any old man ever could have lost                            225   as soon as he had armed himself with strength   to look his trouble in the face it seemed   the shepherds sole resource to sell at once 29   a portion of his patrimonial fields   such was his first resolve he thought again                     230   and his heart failed him isabel said he   two evenings after he had heard the news   i have been toiling more than seventy years   and in the open sunshine of gods love   have we all lived yet if these fields of ours                    235   should pass into a strangers hand i think   that i could not lie quiet in my grave   our lot is a hard lot the sun himself 30   has scarcely been more diligent than i   and i have lived to be a fool at last                             240   to my own family an evil man   that was and made an evil choice if he   were false to us and if he were not false   there are ten thousand to whom loss like this   had been no sorrow i forgive himbut                           245   twere better to be dumb than to talk thus    when i began my purpose was to speak   of remedies and of a cheerful hope   our luke shall leave us isabel the land   shall not go from us and it shall be free                       250   he shall possess it free as is the wind   that passes over it we have thou knowst   another kinsmanhe will be our friend   in this distress he is a prosperous man   thriving in tradeand luke to him shall go                      255   and with his kinsmans help and his own thrift   he quickly will repair this loss and then   he may return to us 31 if here he stay   what can be done where every one is poor   what can be gained                                              260                        at this the old man paused   and isabel sat silent for her mind   was busy looking back into past times   theres richard bateman thought she to herself e   he was a parishboyat the churchdoor                           265   they made a gathering for him shillings pence   and halfpennies wherewith the neighbours bought   a basket which they filled with pedlars wares   and with this basket on his arm the lad   went up to london found a master there                          270   who out of many chose the trusty boy   to go and overlook his merchandise   beyond the seas where he grew wondrous rich   and left estates and monies to the poor   and at his birthplace built a chapel floored                   275   with marble which he sent from foreign lands   these thoughts and many others of like sort   passed quickly through the mind of isabel   and her face brightened the old man was glad   and thus resumedwell isabel this scheme                     280   these two days has been meat and drink to me   far more than we have lost is left us yet we have enoughi wish indeed that i   were youngerbut this hope is a good hope   make ready lukes best garments of the best                      285   buy for him more and let us send him forth   tomorrow or the next day or tonight if he could 32 go the boy should go tonight    here michael ceased and to the fields went forth   with a light heart f the housewife for five days               290   was restless morn and night and all day long   wrought on with her best fingers to prepare   things needful for the journey of her son   but isabel was glad when sunday came   to stop her in her work for when she lay                        295   by michaels side she through the last two nights 33   heard him how he was troubled in his sleep   and when they rose at morning she could see   that all his hopes were gone that day at noon   she said to luke while they two by themselves                    300   were sitting at the door thou must not go   we have no other child but thee to lose   none to rememberdo not go away   for if thou leave thy father he will die   the youth 34 made answer with a jocund voice                   305   and isabel when she had told her fears   recovered heart that evening her best fare   did she bring forth and all together sat   like happy people round a christmas fire    with daylight 35 isabel resumed her work                       310   and all the ensuing week the house appeared   as cheerful as a grove in spring at length   the expected letter from their kinsman came   with kind assurances that he would do   his utmost for the welfare of the boy                            315   to which requests were added that forthwith   he might be sent to him ten times or more   the letter was read over isabel   went forth to show it to the neighbours round   nor was there at that time on english land                        320   a prouder heart than lukes when isabel   had to her house returned the old man said   he shall depart tomorrow to this word   the housewife answered talking much of things   which if at such short notice he should go                      325   would surely be forgotten but at length   she gave consent and michael was at ease    near the tumultuous brook of greenhead ghyll   in that deep valley michael had designed   to build a sheepfold g and before he heard                   330   the tidings of his melancholy loss   for this same purpose he had gathered up   a heap of stones which by the streamlets edge 36   lay thrown together ready for the work   with luke that evening thitherward he walked                     335   and soon as they had reached the place he stopped   and thus the old man spake to himmy son   tomorrow thou wilt leave me with full heart   i look upon thee for thou art the same   that wert a promise to me ere thy birth                          340   and all thy life hast been my daily joy   i will relate to thee some little part   of our two histories twill do thee good   when thou art from me even if i should touch   on things 37 thou canst not know ofafter thou                345   first camst into the worldas oft befals 38   to newborn infantsthou didst sleep away   two days and blessings from thy fathers tongue   then fell upon thee day by day passed on   and still i loved thee with increasing love                      350   never to living ear came sweeter sounds   than when i heard thee by our own fireside   first uttering without words a natural tune   while 39 thou a feeding babe didst in thy joy   sing at thy mothers breast month followed month                355   and in the open fields my life was passed   and on 40 the mountains else i think that thou   hadst been brought up upon thy fathers knees   but we were playmates luke among these hills   as well thou knowest in us the old and young                     360   have played together nor with me didst thou   lack any pleasure which a boy can know   luke had a manly heart but at these words   he sobbed aloud the old man grasped his hand   and said nay do not take it soi see                          365   that these are things of which i need not speak even to the utmost i have been to thee   a kind and a good father and herein   i but repay a gift which i myself   received at others hands for though now old                    370   beyond the common life of man i still   remember them who loved me in my youth   both of them sleep together here they lived   as all their forefathers had done and when   at length their time was come they were not loth                 375   to give their bodies to the family mould   i wished that thou shouldst live the life they lived   but tis a long time to look back my son   and see so little gain from threescore years 41   these fields were burthened when they came to me                 380   till i was forty years of age not more   than half of my inheritance was mine   i toiled and toiled god blessed me in my work   and till these three weeks past the land was free it looks as if it never could endure                            385   another master heaven forgive me luke   if i judge ill for thee but it seems good   that thou shouldst go    at this the old man paused   then pointing to the stones near which they stood               390   thus after a short silence he resumed   this was a work for us and now my son   it is a work for me but lay one stone   here lay it for me luke with thine own hands   42 nay boy be of good hopewe both may live                 395   to see a better day at eightyfour   i still am strong and hale 43do thou thy part   i will do minei will begin again   with many tasks that were resigned to thee   up to the heights and in among the storms                       400   will i without thee go again and do   all works which i was wont to do alone   before i knew thy faceheaven bless thee boy   thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast   with many hopes it should be soyesyes405   i knew that thou couldst never have a wish   to leave me luke thou hast been bound to me   only by links of love when thou art gone   what will be left to usbut i forget   my purposes lay now the cornerstone                            410   as i requested and hereafter luke   when thou art gone away should evil men   be thy companions think of me my son   and of this moment hither turn thy thoughts   and god will strengthen thee amid all fear                       415   and all temptation luke i pray that thou   mayst bear in mind the life thy fathers lived 44   who being innocent did for that cause   bestir them in good deeds now fare thee well   when thou returnst thou in this place wilt see                  420   a work which is not here a covenant   twill be between us but whatever fate   befal thee i shall love thee to the last   and bear thy memory with me to the grave    the shepherd ended here and luke stooped down                   425   and as his father had requested laid   the first stone of the sheepfold at the sight   the old mans grief broke from him to his heart   he pressed his son he kiss√®d him and wept   and to the house together they returned                          430 hushed was that house in peace or seeming peace 45   ere the night fellwith morrows dawn the boy 46   began his journey and when he had reached   the public way he put on a bold face   and all the neighbours as he passed their doors                 435   came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers   that followed him till he was out of sight    a good report did from their kinsman come   of luke and his well doing and the boy   wrote loving letters full of wondrous news                      440   which as the housewife phrased it were throughout   the prettiest letters that were ever seen   both parents read them with rejoicing hearts   so many months passed on and once again   the shepherd went about his daily work                            445   with confident and cheerful thoughts and now   sometimes when he could find a leisure hour   he to that valley took his way and there   wrought at the sheepfold meantime luke began   to slacken in his duty and at length                           450   he in the dissolute city gave himself   to evil courses ignominy and shame   fell on him so that he was driven at last   to seek a hidingplace beyond the seas    there is a comfort in the strength of love                       455   twill make a thing endurable which else   would overset the brain or break the heart 47   i have conversed with more than one who well   remember the old man and what he was   years after he had heard this heavy news                         460   his bodily frame had been from youth to age   of an unusual strength among the rocks   he went and still looked up to sun and cloud 48   and listened to the wind and as before   performed all kinds of labour for his sheep                      465   and for the land his small inheritance   and to that hollow dell from time to time   did he repair to build the fold of which   his flock had need tis not forgotten yet   the pity which was then in every heart                            470   for the old manand tis believed by all   that many and many a day he thither went   and never lifted up a single stone    there by the sheepfold sometimes was he seen   sitting alone or with his faithful dog 49                     475   then old beside him lying at his feet   the length of full seven years from time to time   he at the building of this sheepfold wrought   and left the work unfinished when he died   three years or little more did isabel                           480   survive her husband at her death the estate   was sold and went into a

  footnote g it may be proper to inform some readers that a sheepfold in these mountains is an unroofed building of stone walls with different divisions it is generally placed by the side of a brook for the convenience of washing the sheep but it is also useful as a shelter for them and as a place to drive them into to enable the shepherds conveniently to single out one or more for any particular purposew w 1800    from the fenwick note it will be seen that michaels sheepfold in greenhead ghyll existedat least the remains of itin 1843 its site however is now very difficult to identify there is a sheepfold above boon beck which one passes immediately on entering the common going up greenhead ghyll it is now finished and used when required there are remains of walling much higher up the ghyll but these are probably the work of miners formerly engaged there michaels cottage had been destroyed when the poem was written in 1800 it stood where the coachhouse and stables of the hollins now stand but one who visits greenhead ghyll and wishes to realize michael in his old ageas described in this poemshould ascend the ghyll till it almost reaches the top of fairfield where the old man during eighty years      had learned the meaning of all winds   of blasts of every tone  and where he          had been alone   amid the heart of many thousand mists   that came to him and left him on the heights  by so doing he will be better able to realize the spirit of the poem than by trying to identify the site either of the unfinished sheepfold or of the house named the evening star what wordsworth said to the hon mr justice coleridge in reference to the brothers has been quoted in the note to that poem p 203 on the same occasion he remarked in reference to michael    michael was founded on the son of an old couple having become   dissolute and run away from his parents and on an old shepherd   having been seven years in building up a sheepfold in a solitary   valley  memoirs

say with certainty that the entry under dec 9 refers to michael but if it does it is evident that wordsworth wrought continuously at this poem for nearly two months  on april 9 1801 wordsworth wrote to thomas poole    in writing it michael i had your character often before my   eyes and sometimes thought that i was delineating such a man as you   yourself would have been under the same circumstances  the following is part of a letter written by wordsworth to charles james fox in 1802 and sent with a copy of lyrical ballads    in the two poems the brothers and michael i have attempted to   draw a picture of the domestic affections as i know they exist   amongst a class of men who are now almost confined to the north of   england they are small independent proprietors of land here called   statesmen men of respectable education who daily labour on their   own little properties the domestic affections will always be strong   amongst men who live in a country not crowded with population if   these men are placed above poverty but if they are proprietors of   small estates which have descended to them from their ancestors the   power which these affections will acquire amongst such men is   inconceivable by those who have only had an opportunity of observing   hired labourers farmers and the manufacturing poor their little   tract of land serves as a kind of permanent rallying point for their   domestic feelings as a tablet on which they are written which makes   them objects of memory in a thousand instances when they would   otherwise be forgotten it is a fountain fitted to the nature of   social man from which supplies of affection as pure as his heart was   intended for are daily drawn this class of men is rapidly   disappearing the two poems that i have mentioned were written with   a view to show that men who do not wear fine clothes can feel deeply   pectus enim est quod disertos facit et vis mentis ideoque imperitis   quoque si modo sint aliquo affectu concitati verba non desunt the   poems are faithful copies from nature and i hope whatever effect they   may have upon you you will at least be able to perceive that they may   excite profitable sympathies in many kind and good hearts and may in   some small degree enlarge our feelings of reverence for our species   and our knowledge of human nature by showing that our best qualities   are possessed by men whom we are too apt to consider not with   reference to the points in which they resemble us but to those in   which they manifestly differ from us see correspondence

  wordsworths modernisations of chaucer were all written in 1801 two of them were from the canterbury tales but his version of one of thesethe manciples talehas never been printed of the three poems which were published the firstthe prioress talewas included in the edition of 1820 the troilus and cressida and the cuckoo and the nightingale were included in the poems of early and late years 1842 but they had been published the year before in a small volume entitled the poems of geoffrey chaucer modernised london 1841 a volume to which elizabeth barrett leigh hunt r h home thomas powell and others contributed wordsworth wrote thus of the project to mr powell in an unpublished and undated letter written probably in 1840    i am glad that you enter so warmly into the chaucerian project and   that mr l hunt is disposed to give his valuable aid to it for   myself i cannot do more than i offered to place at your disposal   the prioress tale already published the cuckoo and the   nightingale the manciples tale and i rather think but i cannot   just now find it a small portion of the troilus and cressida you   ask my opinion about that poem speaking from a recollection only of   many years past i should say it would be found too long and probably   tedious the knights tale is also very long but though dryden has   executed it in his own way observe with great spirit and harmony he   has suffered so much of the simplicity and with that of the beauty   and occasional pathos of the original to escape that i should be   pleased to hear that a new version was to be attempted upon my   principle by some competent person it would delight me to read every   part of chaucer over againfor i reverence and admire him above   measurewith a view to your work but my eyes will not permit me to   do so who will undertake the prologue to the canterbury tales for   your publication that is indispensable and i fear it will prove very   difficult it is written as you know in the couplet measure and   therefore i have nothing to say upon its metre but in respect to the   poems in stanza neither in the prioress tale nor in the cuckoo   and nightingale have i kept to the rule of the original as to the   form and number and position of the rhymes thinking it enough if i   kept the same number of lines in each stanza and this is i think   all that is necessary and all that can be done without sacrificing   the substance of sense too often to the mere form of sound  in a subsequent letter to professor henry reed of philadelphia dated rydal mount january 13th 1841 wordsworth said    so great is my admiration of chaucers genius and so profound my   reverence for him as an instrument in the hands of providence for   spreading the light of literature through his native land that   notwithstanding the defects and faults in this publication   referring i presume to the volume the poems of geoffrey chaucer   modernised i am glad of it as a means of making many acquainted   with the original who would otherwise be ignorant of everything about   him but his name  ed                                               the prioress tale   translated 1801 apublished

and instant understanding of the author so much however is the language altered since chaucers time especially in pronunciation that much was to be removed and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible the ancient accent has been retained in a few conjunctions such as also and alway from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity would be admitted by persons of taste to have a graceful accordance with the subjectw w 1820  the fierce bigotry of the prioress forms a fine back ground for her tenderhearted sympathies with the mother and child and the mode in which the story is told amply atones for the extravagance of the miraclew w added in 1827  in the editions of 1820 and 1827 the prioress tale followed the white doe of rylstone in 1832 it followed the inscriptions and in 1836 it was included among the poems founded on the affections in 1845 it found its appropriate place in the selections from chaucer moderniseded       i       o lord our lord how

fleshly woman they did know    xx      now this poor widow waiteth all that night             135           after her little child and he came not           for which by earliest glimpse of morning light           with face all pale with dread and busy thought           she at the school and elsewhere him hath sought           until thus far she learned that he had been            140           in the jews street and there he last was seen    xxi     with mothers pity in her breast enclosed           she goeth as she were half out of her mind           to every place wherein she hath supposed           by likelihood her little son to find                   145           and ever on christs mother meek and kind           she cried till to the jewry she was brought           and him among the accurs√®d jews she sought    xxii    she asketh and she piteously doth pray           to every jew that dwelleth in that place                150           to tell her if her child had passed that way           they all saidnay but jesu of his grace           gave to her thought that in a little space           she for her son in that same spot did cry           where he was cast into a pit hard by                   155    xxiii   o thou great god that dost perform thy laud           by mouths of innocents lo here thy might           this gem of chastity this emerald           and eke of martyrdom this ruby bright           there where with mangled throat he lay upright        160           the alma redemptoris gan to sing           so loud that with his voice the place did ring    xxiv    the christian folk that through the jewry went           come to the spot in wonder at the thing           and hastily they for the provost sent                  165           immediately he came not tarrying           and praiseth christ that is our heavenly king           and eke his mother honour of mankind           which done he bade that they the jews should bind    xxv     this child with piteous lamentation then               170           was taken up singing his song alw√†y           and with procession great and pomp of men           to the next abbey him they bare away           his mother swooning by the body 2 lay           and scarcely could the people that were near            175           remove this second rachel from the bier    xxvi    torment and shameful death to every one           this provost doth for those bad jews prepare           that of this murder wist and that anon           such wickedness his judgments cannot spare             180           who will do evil evil shall he bear           them therefore with wild horses did he draw           and after that he hung them by the law    xxvii   upon his bier this innocent doth lie           before the altar while the mass doth last              185           the abbot with his convents company           then sped themselves to bury him full fast           and when they holy water on him cast           yet spake this child when sprinkled was the water           and sang o alma redemptoris mater                   190    xxviii  this abbot for he was a holy man           as all monks are or surely ought to be 3           in supplication to the child began           thus saying o dear child i summon thee           in virtue of the holy trinity                           195           tell me the cause why thou dost sing this hymn           since that thy throat is cut as it doth seem    xxix    my throat is cut unto the bone i trow           said this young child and by the law of kind           i should have died yea many hours ago                 200           but jesus christ as in the books ye find           will that his glory last and be in mind           and for the worship of his mother dear           yet may i sing o alma loud and clear    xxx     this well of mercy jesus mother sweet              205           after my knowledge i have loved alw√†y           and in the hour when i my death did meet           to me she came and thus to me did say           thou in thy dying sing this holy lay           as ye have heard and soon as i had sung                210           methought she laid a grain upon my tongue    xxxi    wherefore i sing nor can from song refrain           in honour of that blissful maiden free           till from my tongue offtaken is the grain           and after that thus said she unto me                   215           my little child then will i come for thee           soon as the grain from off thy tongue they take           be not dismayed i will not thee forsake    xxxii   this holy monk this abbothim mean i           touched then his tongue and took away the grain       220           and he gave up the ghost full peacefully           and when the abbot had this wonder seen           his salt tears trickled down like showers of rain           and on his face he dropped upon the ground           and still he lay as if he had been bound               225    xxxiii  eke the whole convent on the pavement lay           weeping and praising jesus mother dear           and after that they rose and took their way           and lifted up this martyr from the bier           and in a tomb of precious marble clear                  230           enclosed his uncorrupted body sweetf           whereer

remembrance doth bring            all kinds of pleasure mixd with sorrowing            and longing of sweet thoughts that ever long              30    vii      and of that longing heaviness doth come            whence oft great sickness grows of heart and home            sick are they all for lack of their desire            and thus in may their hearts are set on fire            so that they burn forth in great martyrdom                35    viii     in sooth i speak from feeling what though now            old am i and to genial pleasure slow            yet have i felt of sickness through the may            both hot and cold and heartaches every day            how hard alas to bear i only know                      40    ix       such shaking doth the fever in me keep            through all this may that i have little sleep            and also tis not likely unto me            that any living heart should sleepy be            in which loves dart its fiery point doth steep           45    x        but tossing lately on a sleepless bed            i of a token thought which lovers heed            how among them it was a common tale            that it was good to hear the nightingale            ere the vile cuckoos note be utter√®d                     50    xi       and then i thought anon as it was day            i gladly would go somewhere to essay            if i perchance a nightingale might hear            for yet had i heard none of all that year            and it was then the third night of the may                55    xii      and soon as i a glimpse of day espied            no longer would i in my bed abide            but straightway to a wood that was hard by            forth did i go alone and fearlessly            and held the pathway down by a brookside                 60    xiii     till to a lawn i came all white and green            i in so fair a one had never been            the ground was green with daisy powdered over            tall were the flowers the grove a lofty cover            all green and white and nothing else was seen c        65    xiv      there sate i down among the fair fresh flowers            and saw the birds come tripping from their bowers            where they had rested them all night and they            who were so joyful at the light of day            began to honour may with all their powers                 70    xv       well did they know that service all by rote            and there was many and many a lovely note            some singing loud as if they had complained            some with their notes another manner feigned            and some did sing all out with the full throat            75    xvi      they pruned themselves and made themselves right gay            dancing and leaping light upon the spray            and ever two and two together were            the same as they had chosen for the year            upon saint valentines returning day                      80    xvii     meanwhile the stream whose bank i sate upon            was making such a noise as it ran on            accordant to the sweet birds harmony            methought that it was the best melody            which ever to mans ear a passage won                     85    xviii    and for delight but how i never wot            i in a slumber and a swoon was caught            not all asleep and yet not waking wholly            and as i lay the cuckoo bird unholy            broke silence or i heard him in my thought               90    xix      and that was right upon a tree fast by            and who was then ill satisfied but i            now god quoth i that died upon the rood            from thee and thy base throat keep all thats good            full little joy have i now of thy cry                     95    xx       and as i with the cuckoo thus gan chide            in the next bush that was me fast beside            i heard the lusty nightingale so sing            that her clear voice made a loud rioting            echoing through all the green wood wide d              100    xxi      ah good sweet nightingale for my hearts cheer            hence hast thou stayed a little while too long            for we have had 2 the sorry cuckoo here            and she hath been before thee with her song            evil light on her she hath done me wrong                105    xxii     but hear you now a wondrous thing i pray            as long as in that swooningfit i lay            methought i wist right well what these birds meant            and had good knowing both of their intent            and of their speech and all that they would say         110    xxiii    the nightingale thus in my hearing spake            good cuckoo seek some other bush or brake            and prithee let us that can sing dwell here            for every wight eschews thy song to hear            such uncouth singing verily dost thou make               115    xxiv     what quoth she then what ist that ails thee now            it seems to me i sing as well as thou            for mines a song that is both true and plain            although i cannot quaver so in vain            as thou dost in thy throat i wot not how                120    xxv      all men may understanding have of me            but nightingale so may they not of thee            for thou hast many a foolish and quaint cry            thou sayst osee osee then how may i            have knowledge i thee pray what this may be            125    xxvi     ah fool quoth she wist thou not what it is            oft as i say osee osee i wis            then mean i that i should be wondrous fain            that shamefully they one and all were slain            whoever against love mean aught amiss                    130    xxvii    and also would i that they all were dead            who do not think in love their life to lead            for who is both the god of love to obey            is only fit to die i dare well say            and for that cause osee i cry take heed                 135    xxviii   ay quoth the cuckoo that is a quaint law            that all must love or die but i withdraw            and take my leave of all such company            for mine intent it neither is to die            nor ever while i live loves yoke to draw                140    xxix     for lovers of all folk that be alive            the most disquiet have and least do thrive            most feeling have of sorrow 3 woe and care            and the least welfare cometh to their share            what need is there against the truth to strive           145    xxx      what quoth she thou art all out of thy mind            that in thy churlishness a cause canst find            to speak of loves true servants in this mood            for in this world no service is so good            to every wight that gentle is of kind                    150    xxxi     for thereof comes all goodness and all worth            all gentiless 4 and honour thence come forth            thence worship comes content and true hearts pleasure            and fullassured trust joy without measure            and jollity fresh cheerfulness and mirth               155    xxxii    and bounty lowliness and courtesy            and seemliness and faithful company            and dread of shame that will not do amiss            for he that faithfully loves servant is            rather than be disgraced would chuse to die             160    xxxiii   and that the very truth it is which i            now sayin such belief ill live and die            and cuckoo do thou so by my advice            then quoth she let me never hope for bliss            if with that counsel i do eer comply                    165    xxxiv    good nightingale thou speakest wondrous fair            yet for all that the truth is found elsewhere            for love in young folk is but rage i wis            and love in old folk a great dotage is            who most it useth him twill most impair                170    xxxv     for thereof come all contraries to gladness            thence sickness comes and overwhelming sadness            mistrust and jealousy despite debate            dishonour shame envy importunate            pride anger mischief poverty and madness             175    xxxvi    loving is aye an office of despair            and one thing is therein which is not fair            for whoso gets of love a little bliss            unless it alway stay with him i wis            he may full soon go with an old mans hair               180    xxxvii   and therefore nightingale do thou keep nigh            for trust me well in spite of thy quaint cry            if long time from thy mate thou be or far            thoult be as others that forsaken are            then shall thou raise a clamour as do i                  185    xxxviii  fie quoth she on thy name bird ill beseen            the god of love afflict thee with all teen            for thou art worse than mad a thousand fold            for many a one hath virtues manifold            who had been nought if love had never been              190    xxxix    for evermore his servants love amendeth            and he from every blemish them defendeth            and maketh them to burn as in a fire            in loyalty and worshipful desire            and when it likes him joy enough them sendeth          195    xl       thou nightingale the cuckoo said be still            for love no reason hath but his own will            for to th untrue he oft gives ease and joy            true lovers doth so bitterly annoy            he lets them perish through that grievous ill            200    xli      with such a master would i never be e            for he in sooth is blind

 xlii     then of the nightingale did i take note            how from her inmost heart a sigh she brought            and said alas that ever i was born            not one word have i now i am so forlorn            and with that word she into tears burst out             210    xliii    alas alas my very heart will break            quoth she to hear this churlish bird thus speak            of love and of his holy services            now god of love thou help me in some wise            that vengeance on this cuckoo i may wreak                215    xliv     and so methought i started up anon            and to the brook i ran and got a stone            which at the cuckoo hardily i cast            and he for dread did fly away full fast            and glad in sooth was i when he was gone               220    xlv      and as he flew the cuckoo ever and aye            kept crying farewellfarewell popinjay            as if in scornful mockery of me            and on i hunted him from tree to tree            till he was far all out of sight away                  225    xlvi     then straightway came the nightingale to me            and said forsooth my friend do i thank thee            that thou wert near to rescue me and now            unto the god of love i make a vow            that all this may i will thy songstress be               230    xlvii    well satisfied i thanked her and she said            by this mishap no longer be dismayed            though thou the cuckoo heard ere thou heardst me            yet if i live it shall amended be            when next may comes if i am not afraid                  235    xlviii   and one thing will i counsel thee also            the cuckoo trust not thou nor his loves saw            all that she said is an outrageous lie            nay nothing shall me bring thereto quoth i            for love and it hath done me mighty woe                 240    xlix     yea hath it use quoth she this medicine            this maytime every day before thou dine            go look on the fresh daisy then say i            although for pain thou mayst be like to die            thou wilt be eased and less wilt droop and pine         245    l        and mind always that thou be good and true            and i will sing one song of many new            for love of thee as loud as i may cry            and then did she begin this song full high            beshrew all them that are in love untrue               250    li       and soon as she had sung it to the end            now farewell quoth she for i hence must wend            and god of love that can right well and may            send unto thee as mickle joy this day            as ever he to lover yet did send                         255    lii      thus takes the nightingale her leave of me            i pray to god with her always to be            and joy of love to send her evermore            and shield us from the cuckoo and her lore            for there is not so false a bird as she                  260    liii     forth then she flew the gentle nightingale            to all the birds that lodged within that dale            and gathered each and all into one place            and them besought to hear her doleful case            and thus it was that she began her tale                  265    liv      the cuckootis not well that i should hide            how she and i did each the other chide            and without ceasing since it was daylight            and now i pray you all to do me right            of that false bird whom love can not abide               270    lv       then spake one bird and full assent all gave            this matter asketh counsel good as grave            for birds we areall here together brought

cresida                              5   for since we yet may have no other feast   let us behold her palace at the least    and therewithal to cover his intent   a cause he found into the town to go

spot he rideth up and down   and everything to his rememberance   came as he rode by places of the town                          45   where he had felt such perfect pleasure once   lo yonder saw i mine own lady dance   and in that temple she with her bright eyes   my lady dear first bound me captivewise    and yonder with joysmitten heart have i                       50   heard my own cresids

      55   that hers unto the death my heart i hold    and at the corner of that selfsame house   heard i my most beloved lady dear   so womanly with voice melodious   singing so well so goodly and so clear                      60   that in my soul methinks i yet do hear   the blissful sound and in that very place   my lady first me took unto her grace    o blissful god of love then thus he cried

 o would the blissful god now for his joy                      90   i might her see again coming to troy    and up to yonder hill was i her guide   alas and there i took of her my leave   yonder i saw her to her father ride   for very grief of which my heart shall cleave95   and hither home i came when it was eve   and here i dwell an outcast from all joy   and shall unless i see her soon in troy

who in the way passed by   had of him ruth and fancied that they said   i am right sorry troilus will die   and thus a day or two drove wearily                          110   as ye have heard such

few                115   somewhat his woeful heart to make more light   and when he was removed from all mens sight   with a soft night voice 5 he of his lady dear   that absent was gan sing as ye may

i sat with him at   intervals all the morning and took down his stanzas after tea i read   w the account i had written of the little boy belonging to the tall   woman and an unlucky thing it was for he could not escape from those   very words and so he could not write the poem he left it unfinished   and went tired to bed in our walk from rydal he had got warmed with   the subject and had half cast the poem    sunday morning march 14william had slept badly he got up at 9   oclock but before he rose he had finished the beggar boy  the following is the account written in her journal on tuesday may 23 1800    a very tall woman tall much beyond the measure of tall women called   at the door she had on a very long brown cloak and a very white cap   without bonnet her face was brown but it had plainly once been fair   she led a little barefooted child about two years old by the hand and   said her husband who was a tinker was gone before with the other   children i gave her a piece of bread afterwards on my road to   ambleside beside the bridge at rydal i saw her husband sitting at   the roadside his two asses standing beside him and the two young   children at play upon the grass the man did not beg i passed on and   about a quarter of a mile farther i saw two boys before me one about   ten the other about eight years old at play chasing a butterfly   they were wild figures not very ragged but without shoes and   stockings the hat of the elder was wreathed round with yellow   flowers the younger whose hat was only a rimless crown had stuck it   round with laurel leaves they continued at play till i drew very   near and then they addressed me with the begging cant and the whining   voice of sorrow i said i served your mother this morning the boys   were so like the woman who had called at our door that i could not be   mistaken o says the elder you could not serve my mother for   shes dead and my fathers in at the next town hes a potter i   persisted in my assertion and that i would give them nothing says   the elder come lets away and away they flew like lightning they   had however sauntered so long in their road that they did not reach   ambleside before me and i saw them go up to mathew harrisons house   with their wallet upon the elders shoulder and creeping with a   beggars complaining foot on my return through ambleside i met in   the street the mother driving her asses in the two panniers of one   of which were the two little children whom she was chiding and   threatening with a wand with which she used to drive on her asses   while the little things hung in wantonness over the panniers edge   the woman had told me in the morning that she was of scotland which   her accent fully proved and that she had lived i think at

stayed   for ever when i returned i found william writing a poem descriptive   of the sights and sounds we saw and heard there was the gentle   flowing of the stream the glittering lively lake green fields   without a living creature to be seen on them behind us a flat   pasture with fortytwo cattle feeding to our left the road leading   to the hamlet no smoke there the sun shone on the bare roofs the   people were at work ploughing harrowing and sowing lasses working   a dog barking now and then cocks crowing birds twittering the snow   in patches at the top of the highest hills yellow

kirkstone was very interesting the   becks among the rocks were all alive william shewed me the little   mossy streamlet which he had before loved when he saw its bright   green track in the snow the view above ambleside very beautiful   there we sate and looked down on the green vale we watched the crows   at a little distance from us become white as silver as they flew in   the sunshine and when

description of the minstrel and wordsworths account of himself in this poem it is somewhat curious that dorothy wordsworth writing to miss pollard from forncett in 1793 quotes the line from the minstrel book i stanza 22    in truth he was a strange and wayward wight  and adds    that verse of beatties minstrel always reminds me of him and   indeed the whole character of edwin resembles much what william was   when i first knew him after leaving halifax  mr t hutchinson called the attention of professor dowden to the same resemblance between the two pictures with lines 35 36 compare in shelleys adonais stanza xxxi    and his own thoughts along that rugged way   pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey  ed   there can now be no doubt that in the first four of these stanzas wordsworth refers to himself and that in the last four he refers to coleridge for a time it was uncertain whether in the earlier stanzas he had coleridge or himself in view and whether in the later ones some one else was or was not described de quincey quoting as he often did in random fashion mixes up extracts from each set of the stanzas and applies them both to coleridge and dorothy wordsworth in her journal gives apparent though only apparent sanction to a reverse order of allusion by writing of the stanzas about c and himself her brother the following are her references to the poem in that journal    9th may 1802after tea he w wrote two stanzas in the manner of   thomsons castle of indolence and was tired out    10th maywilliam still at work though it is past ten oclock    william did not sleep till three oclock    11th maywilliam finished the stanzas about c and himself he did   not go out today  he completely finished his poem he went to bed   at twelve oclock  from these extracts two things are evident    1 who the persons are described in the stanzas and    2 the immense labour bestowed upon the poem  in the memoirs of wordsworth by the late bishop of lincoln there is a passage vol ii chap li p 309 amongst the personal reminiscences 1836 in which the hon mr justice coleridge virtually decides the question of the identity of the two persons referred to in his record of a conversation with the poet it is as follows    october 10thi have passed a great many hours today with   wordsworth in his home i stumbled on him with proof sheets before   him he read me nearly all the sweet stanzas written in his copy of   the castle of indolence describing himself and my uncle and he and   mrs w both assured me the description of the latter at that time was   perfectly accurate and he was almost as a great boy in feelings and   had all the tricks and fancies there described mrs w seemed to look   back on him and those times with the fondest affection  i think the neighbouring height referred to is the height of white moss common behind the firgrove where wordsworth was often heard murmuring out his verses booing as the country folks said and the      driving full in view   at midday when the sun was shining bright  aptly describes his habits as recorded in his sisters journal and elsewhere the withered flower the creature pale and wan are significant of those terrible reactions of spirit which followed his joyous hours of insight and inspiration stanzas iv to vii of resolution and independence p 314 in which wordsworth undoubtedly described himself may be compared with stanza iii of this poem the lines    down would he sit and without strength or power   look at the common grass from hour to hour  are aptly illustrated by such passages in his sisters journal as the following of 29th april 1802    we went to johns grove sate a while at first afterwards william   lay and i lay in the trench under the fencehe with his eyes   closed and listening to the waterfalls and the birds there was no   one waterfall above anotherit was a kind of water in the airthe   voice of the air we were unseen by one another  again april 23rd    coleridge and i pushed on before we left william sitting on the   stones feasting with silence  and this recalls the first verse of expostulation and reply written at alfoxden in 1798    why william on that old grey stone   thus for the length of half a day   why william sit you thus alone   and dream your time away  the retreat where appletrees in blossom made a bower and where he so often slept himself away was evidently the same as that described in the poem the green linnet    beneath these fruittree boughs that shed   their snow white blossoms on my head  on the other hand the lowhung lip and profound forehead of the other the noticeable man with large grey eyes mark him out as s t c the rapt one of the godlike forehead described in the extempore effusion upon the death of james hogg the description noisy he was and gamesome as a boy is verified by what the poet and his wife said to mr justice coleridge in 1836 in addition mr hutchinson of kimbolton tells me he often heard his father say that coleridge was uproarious in his mirth  matthew arnold wrote me an interesting letter some years ago about these stanzas from which i make the following extract    when one looks uneasily at a poem it is easy to fidget oneself   further and neither the wordsworth nor the coleridge of our common   notions seem to be exactly hit off in the stanzas still i believe   that the first described is wordsworth and that the second described   is coleridge i have myself heard wordsworth speak of his prolonged   exhausting wanderings among the hills then miss fenwicks notes show   that coleridge is certainly one of the two personages of the poem and   there are points in the description of the second man which suit him   very well the profound forehead is a touch akin to the godlike   forehead in the mention of coleridge in a later poem    i have a sort of recollection of having heard something about the   inventions rare and coleridge is certain to have dabbled at one   time or other in natural philosophy  in 1796 coleridge wrote to his friend cottle from nether stowey      i should not think of devoting less than 20 years to an epic   poem ten to collect materials and warm my mind with universal   science i would be a tolerable mathematician i would thoroughly know   mechanics hydrostatics optics and astronomy botany metallurgy   fossilism chemistry geology anatomy medicinethen the mind of   manthen the minds of menin all travels voyages and histories   so i would spend ten yearsthe next five to the composition of the   poemand the last five to the correction of it so would i write   haply not unhearing of the divine and rightly whispering voice etc  mr t hutchinson dublin writes in the athenaeum dec 15 1894    i take it for granted these lines were written not only on the   flyleaf of wordsworths copy of the castle of indolence but also   by way of supplement to that poem i e as an addendum to the   descriptive list of the denizens of the castle given in stanzas   lviilxix of canto i that in short they are meant to be read as   though they were an afterthought of james thomsons their author   therefore has rightly imparted to them the curiously blended flavour   of romantic melancholy and slippered mirth of dreamlike vagueness   and smiling hyperbole which forms the distinctive mark of thomsons   poem and thus the poet and the philosopherfriend of wordsworths   stanzas like thomsons companion sketches of the splenetic solitary   the bard more fat than bard beseems and the little round fat   oily man of god are neither more nor less than gentle caricatures  it has been suggested by coleridges grandson that wordsworth was describing s t c in all the stanzas of this poem that he drew two separate pictures of him in the first four stanzas a realistic character portrait and in the last four a companion picture figuring the outward semblance of coleridge but embodying characteristics drawn from a third person so that we have a fancy sketch mixed up with a real one i cannot agree with this  the evidence against it is    1 dorothy wordsworths journal   2 the poets and his wifes remarks to mr justice coleridge   3 the fact that wordsworth was not in the habit of passing from   realism into artistic composition except where he distinctly   indicated it as in the case of the hawkshead schoolmaster in the

the beginning of the poem while crossing over barton fell from mr clarksons at the foot of ullswater towards askham the image of the hare i then observed on the ridge of the fellif  this poem was known in the wordsworth household as the leechgatherer although it never received that name in print an entry in dorothy wordsworths journal of friday 3rd october 1800 may preface what she wrote in 1802 about the composition of the poem    when william and i returned from accompanying jones we met an old   man almost double he had on a coat thrown over his shoulders above   his waistcoat and coat under this he carried a bundle and had an   apron on and a nightcap his face was interesting he had dark eyes   and a long nose john who afterwards met him at wytheburn took him   for a jew he was of scotch parents but had been born in the army he   had had a wife and a good woman and it pleased god to bless him   with ten children all these were dead but one of whom he had not   heard for many years a sailor his trade was to gather leeches but   now leeches were scarce and he had not strength for it he lived by   begging and was making his way to carlisle where he would buy a few   books to sell he said leeches were very scarce partly owing to this   dry season but many years they had been scarce he supposed it was   owing to their being much sought after that they did not breed fast   and were of slow growth leeches were formerly 2s 6d the 100 now   they were 30s he had been hurt in driving a cart his leg broken his   body driven over his skull fractured he felt no pain till he   recovered from his first insensibility it was late in the evening   when the light was just going away  it is most likely that this walk of william and dorothy wordsworth accompanying jones was on the day of joness departure from dove cottage viz 26th september  the journal continues    tuesday 4th may 1802though william went to bed nervous and jaded   in the extreme he rose refreshed i wrote out the leechgatherer   for him which he had begun the night before and of which he wrote   several stanzas in bed this morning    they started to walk up the raise to wytheburn    it was very hot we rested several times by the way read and   repeated the leechgatherer    friday 7th maywilliam had slept uncommonly well so feeling   himself strong he fell to work at the leechgatherer he wrote hard   at it till dinner time then he gave over tired to deathhe had   finished the poem    sunday morning 9th maywilliam worked at the leechgatherer   almost incessantly from morning till teatime i copied the   leechgatherer and other poems for coleridge i was oppressed and   sick at heart for he wearied himself to death    sunday 4th july william finished the leechgatherer today    monday 5th julyi copied out the leechgatherer for coleridge   and for us  from these extracts it is clear that dorothy wordsworth considered the poem as finished on the 7th of may and on the 9th she sent a copy to coleridge but that it was not till the 4th of july that it was really finished and then a second copy was forwarded to coleridge it is impossible to say from which of the two mss sent to him coleridge transcribed the copy which he forwarded to sir george beaumont from that copy of a copy which is now amongst the beaumont mss at coleorton the various readings given on coleridges authority in the notes to the poem were obtained some years ago  the fenwick note to the poem illustrates wordsworths habit of blending in one description details which were originally separate both as to time and place the scenery and the incidents of the poem are alike composite as he tells us that he met the leechgatherer a few hundred yards from dove cottage the lonely place with its pool bare to the eye of heaven at once suggests white moss common and its small tarn but he adds that in the opening stanzas of the poem he is describing a state of feeling he was in when crossing the fells at the foot of ullswater to askam and that the image of the hare running races in her mirth with the glittering mist accompanying her was observed by him not on white moss common but in one of the ridges of moor divock to h c robinson he said of the leechgatherer sept 10 1816 that he gave to his poetic character powers of mind which his original did not possess robinsons diary etc vol ii p

  runs with her all the way wherever she doth run    iii      i was a traveller then upon the moor                      15            i saw the hare that raced about with joy            i heard the woods and distant waters roar            or heard them not as happy as a boy            the pleasant season did my heart employ            my old remembrances went from me wholly                   20

sadnessand blind thoughts i knew not nor could name    v        i heard the skylark warbling 2 in the sky            and i bethought me of the playful hare                    30            even such a happy child of earth am i            even as these blissful 3 creatures do i fare            far from the world i walk and from all care            but there may come another day to me

       yet it befel that in this 9 lonely place            when i with these untoward thoughts had striven            beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven 10            i saw 11 a man before me unawares                       55            the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs            12    ix       as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie            couched on the bald top of an eminence            wonder to all who 13 do the same espy            by what means it could thither come and whence           60            so that it seems a thing endued with sense            like a seabeast crawled forth that 14 on a shelf            of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself    x        such seemed this man not all alive nor dead            nor all asleepin his extreme old age                    65            his body was bent double feet and head            coming together in lifes pilgrimage 15            as if some dire constraint of pain or rage            of sickness felt by him in times long past            a more than human weight upon his frame 16 had cast     70    xi       himself he propped limbs body and pale face 17            upon a long grey staff of shaven wood            and still as i drew near with gentle pace            upon the margin of that moorish flood 18            motionless as a cloud the old man stood                   75            that heareth not the loud winds when they call            and moveth all together if it move 19 at all            20     xii      at length himself unsettling he the pond            stirred with his staff and fixedly did look            upon the muddy water which he conned                     80            as if he had been reading in a book            and now a strangers privilege i took 21            and drawing to his side to him did say            this morning gives us promise of a glorious day    xiii     a gentle answer did the old man make                      85            in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew            and him with further words i thus bespake            what occupation do you there pursue 22            this is a lonesome place for one like 23 you            ere he replied a flash of mild surprise                   90            broke from the sable orbs of his yetvivid eyes 24 b    xiv      his words came feebly from a feeble chest            but 25 each in solemn order followed each            with something of a lofty 26 utterance drest            choice word 27 and measured phrase above 27 the reach 95            of ordinary men a stately speech            such as grave livers do in scotland use            religious men who give to god and man their dues    xv       he told that to these waters he had come 28            to gather leeches being old and poor                    100            employment hazardous and wearisome            and he had many hardships to endure 29            from pond to pond he roamed from moor to moor            housing with gods good help by choice or chance            and in this way he gained an honest maintenance          105    xvi      the old man still stood talking by my side            but now 30 his voice to me was like a stream            scarce heard nor word from word could i divide            and the whole body of the man did seem            like one whom i had met with in a dream                  110            or like a man from some far region sent            to give me human strength by apt admonishment 31    xvii     my former thoughts returned the fear that kills            and 32 hope that is unwilling to be fed            cold pain and labour and all fleshly ills             115            and mighty poets in their misery dead perplexed and longing to be comforted 33            my question eagerly did i renew            how is it that you live and what is it you do 34    xviii    he with a smile did then his words repeat                120            and said that gathering leeches far and wide            he travelled stirring thus about his feet            the waters of the pools where they abide 35            once i could meet with them on every side            but they have dwindled long by slow decay                125            yet still i persevere and find them where i may 36    xix      while he was talking thus the lonely place            the old mans shape and speechall troubled me            in my minds eye i seemed to see him pace            about the weary moors continually                        130            wandering about alone and silently            while i these thoughts within myself pursued            he having made a pause the same discourse renewed    xx       and soon 37 with this he other matter blended            cheerfully uttered with demeanour kind                  135            but stately in the main and when he ended 38            i could have laughed myself to scorn to find            in that decrepit man so firm a mind            god said i be my help and stay secure            ill think of the leechgatherer on the lonely moor     140

importance that you should   have had pleasure in contemplating the fortitude independence   persevering spirit and the general moral dignity of this old mans   character again i will explain to you in prose my feelings in   writing that poem i describe myself as having been exalted to   the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature   and then as depressed even in the midst of those beautiful objects   to the lowest dejection and despair a young poet in the midst of the   happiness of nature is described as overwhelmed by the thoughts of the   miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest of all men viz   poets i think of this till i am so deeply impressed with it that i   consider the manner in which i was rescued from my dejection and   despair almost as an interposition of providence a person reading the   poem with feelings like mine will have been awed and controlled   expecting something spiritual or supernatural what is brought   forward a lonely

with perfect confidence but this i can confidently affirm   that though i believe god has given me a strong imagination i cannot   conceive a figure more impressive than that of an old man like this

upon   him you speak of his speech as tedious every thing is tedious when   one does not read with the feelings of the author the thorn is   tedious to hundreds and so is the idiot boy to hundreds it is in   the character of the old man to tell his story which an impatient   reader must feel tedious but good heavens such a figure in such a   place a pious selfrespecting miserably infirm and

following record of the journey is preserved in his sisters journal    july 30 aleft london between five and six oclock of the morning   outside the dover coach a beautiful morning the city st pauls   with the rivera multitude of little boats made a beautiful sight as   we crossed westminster bridge the houses not overhung by their   clouds of smoke and were hung out endlessly yet the sun shone so   brightly with such a pure light that there was something like the   purity of one of natures own grand spectacles  this sonnet underwent no change in successive editions  in illustration of it an anecdote of the late bishop of st davids may be given as reported by lord coleridge    in the great debate on the abolition of the irish establishment in   1869 the bishop of st davids dr thirlwall had made a very   remarkable speech and had been kept till past daybreak in the house   of lords before the division was over and he was able to walk home   he was then an old man and in failing health some time after he was   asked whether he had not run some risk to his health and whether he   did not feel much exhausted yes he said perhaps so but i was   more than repaid by walking out upon westminster bridge after the   division seeing london in the morning light as wordsworth saw it and   repeating to myself his noble sonnet as i walked home  this anecdote was told to the wordsworth society at its meeting on the 3rd of may 1882 after a letter had been read by the secretary from mr robert spence watson recording the following similar experience     as confirming the perfect truth of wordsworths description of   the external aspects of a scene and the way in which he reached its   inmost soul i may tell you what happened to me and may have happened   to many others many years ago i think it was in 1859 i chanced to   be passing in a pained and depressed state of mind occasioned by the   death of a friend over waterloo bridge at halfpast three on a lovely   june morning it was broad daylight and i was alone never when alone   in the remotest recesses of the alps with nothing around me but the   mountains or upon the plains of africa alone with the wonderful   glory of the southern night have i seen anything to approach the   solemnitythe soothing solemnityof the city sleeping under the   early sun      earth has not any thing to show more fair    how simply yet how perfectly wordsworth has interpreted it it was   a happy thing for us that the dover coach left at so untimely an hour   it was this sonnet i think that first opened my eyes to wordsworths   greatness as a poet perhaps nothing that he has written shows more   strikingly the vast sympathy which is his peculiar dower  ed  footnote a this is an error of date saturday the day of

from windybrow keswick in 1794 when staying there with her brother and says    what inclined me to think that the poem was written earlier than 1805   was that it anticipates dorothys marriage and this would more   naturally be present as a probable event in w ws mind in 1794 or   thereabouts than in 1805 after dorothy had dedicated her life to her   brother to the exclusion of all wish to make a home of her own by   marriage the expression healthy as a shepherd boy is also more   applicable to a girl of twentytwo than to a woman of thirtythree do   you think it possible that the poem may have been written in 1794 and   not published till later when its application would be less evident   to the family circle  dorothy wordsworths letter will be quoted in full in a later volume but the following extract from it may be given now    i cannot pass unnoticed that part of your letter in which you speak   of my rambling about the country on foot so far from considering   this as a matter for condemnation i rather thought it would have given   my friends pleasure that i had courage to make use of the strength   with which nature has endowed me when it not only procured me   infinitely more pleasure than i should have received from sitting in a   postchaise but was also the means of saving me at least thirty   shillings  i do not think the date of composition can be so early as 1794 what may be called internal or structural evidence is against it wordsworth never could have written these two poems till after his settlement at dove cottage besides in 1794 he could have no knowledge of a possible nest in a green dale a harbour and a hold while at that time his sister had certainly no cottage home i believe they were written after he took up his residence at townend the date being uncertain and that they refer to his sister and not to his wife it has been suggested by mr ernest coleridge see the athen√¶um oct 21 1893 that they refer to mary hutchinson but there is no evidence of wordsworth taking long country walks with her before their marriage or that she was nymphlike fleet and strong that she loved to roam the moorland in weather rough and bleak or that she hunted waterfalls the reference to his sister is confirmed by the omission of the delightful second stanza of the poem in the last edition revised by the poet that of 1849 when she was a confirmed invalid at rydal mount those smiles to earth unknown had then ceased for ever the reason why wordsworth erased so delightful and wonderful a stanza is to me only explicable on the supposition that it was his sister he referred to she who had accompanied him in former days in so many of his long walks in the country his wife never did this she had not the physical strength to do it and if she had been the person referred to wordsworth would hardly in 1845 have erased such a description of her as occurs in the stanza written in 1802 when she was still so vigorous besides mary wordsworth was in no sense a child of nature as dorothy was while the testimony of the wordsworth household is explicit that it was to his sister and not to his wife that the poet referred i find no difficulty in the allusion made in the second poem to dorothy being yet possibly a wife and friend nor to the fact that it was originally addressed to a beautiful young lady neither dorothy nor mary wordsworth were physically beautiful according to our highest standards although the poet addressed the latter as a phantom of delight and as a lovely apparition it is quite true that it was mary wordsworths old age that was serene and bright while dorothys was the very reverse but the poets anticipation of the future was written when his sister was young and was by far the stronger of the twoed

written till some time after the tour was finished the green linnet and yewtrees were written in 1803 and some sonnets were composed in the month of october but on the whole 1803 was not a fruitful

are still standing but the spread of that at lorton is much diminished by mutilation i will here mention that a little way up the hill on the road leading from rosthwaite to stonethwaite in borrowdale lay the trunk of a yewtree which appeared as you approached so vast was its diameter like the entrance of a cave and not a small one calculating upon what i have observed of the slow growth of this tree in rocky situations and of its durability i have often thought that the one i am describing must have been as old as the christian era the tree lay in the line of a fence great masses of its ruins were strewn about and some had been rolled down the hillside and lay near the road at the bottom as you approached the tree you were struck with the number of shrubs and young plants ashes etc which had found a bed upon the decayed trunk and grew to no inconsiderable height forming as it were a part of the hedgerow in no part of england or of europe have i ever seen a yewtree at all approaching this in magnitude as it must have stood by the bye hutton the old guide of keswick had been so impressed with the remains of this tree that he used gravely to tell strangers that there could be no doubt of its having been in existence before the floodif  one of the poems of the imaginationed       there is a yewtree pride of lorton vale   which to this day stands single in the midst

of whinfell hall cockermouth wrote to me of it in may 1880    the tree in outline expanded towards the root considerably then at   about two feet from the ground the trunk began to separate into huge   limbs spreading in all directions i once measured this trunk at its   least circumference and found it 23 feet 10 inches for the last 50   or 60 years the branches have been gradually dying on the s e side   and about 25 years ago a strong s e gale coming with accumulated   force down hope gill andowing to the tree being so open on that   sidetaking it laterally at a disadvantage wrenched off one of the   great side branches down to the ground carrying away nearly a third   of the tree this event led to farther peril for the second portion   having been sold to a cabinetmaker at whitehaven for ¬£15 this gave   the impression that the wood was very valuable owing to the celebrity   of the tree and a local woodmonger bought the remainder two men   worked half a day to grub it up but a cockermouth medical gentleman   hearing what was going on made representations to the owner and it   ended in the woodmen sparing the remainder of the tree which was not   much the worse for what had been done many large dead branches have   also been cut off and now we have to regret that the pride of lorton   vale shorn of its ancient dignity is but a ruin much more   venerable than picturesque  the fraternal four of borrowdale are certainly worthier still of note the trunk described in the fenwick note as on the road between rosthwaite and stonethwaite has disappeared long ago but the solemn and capacious grove existed till 1883 in its integrity the description in the poem is realistic throughout while the visible scene suggests    an ideal grove in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet and   sleep and offer worship to the destiny that abides above them while   the mountain flood as if from another world makes music to which   they dimly listen  stopford a brooke in theology in

grand assemblage every one who   has felt the power of wordsworths poetryand especially those who   had visited the seathwaite valley and read the yewtrees under the   shade of that once solemn and capacious grove before 1884must   have felt as if they had lost a personal friend when they heard that   the grove was gone the great gale of december 11 1883 smote it   fiercely uprooting one of the trees and blowing the others to   ribbands the following is mr rawnsleys account of the disaster      last week the gale that ravaged england did the lake country much     harm we could spare many of the larch plantations and could hear     with a sigh of the fall of the giant scotch firs opposite the     little scafell inn at rosthwaite and that watendlath had lost its     pines but who could spare those ancient yews the great         fraternal four of borrowdale       joined in one solemn and capacious grove       huge trunks and each particular trunk a growth       of intertwisted fibres serpentine       upcoiling and inveterately convolved      for beneath their pillared shade since wordsworth wrote his poem     that yewtree grove has suggested to many a wanderer up borrowdale     and visitant to the natural temple        an ideal grove in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet and       sleep and offer worship to the destiny that abides above them       while the mountain

destroyed      have been ruthlessly overthrown one has been uprooted bodily all     the leaders and branches of the others have been wrenched from the     main trunk and the three still standing are bare poles and broken     wreckage until one visits the spot one can have no conception of     the wholesale destruction that the hurricane has wrought until he     looks on the huge rosyhearted branches he cannot guess the     tremendous force with which the tornado had fallen upon that sable     roof of boughs      for tornado or whirlwind it must needs have been the yews grew     under the eastern flank of the hill called base brown the gale     raged from the westward one could hardly believe it possible that     the trees could have been touched by it for the barrier hill on     which they grewand under whose shelter they have seen centuries     of stormgoes straight upwards betwixt them and the west it was     only realizable when standing amid the wreckage and looking across     the valley it was seen that a larch plantation had been entirely     levelled and evidently by a wind that was coming from the east and     directly toward the yewtrees on enquiring at seathwaite farm one     found that all the slates blown from the roof of that building on     the west side had been whirled up clean over the roof and we can     only surmise that the winds rushing from the west and northwest     and meeting the bastions of glaramara and the styhead slopes were     whirled round in the culdesac of the valley and moved with     churning motion back from east to west over the seathwaite farm and     so in straight line across the beck and up the slope to the     yewtree cluster with what a wrenching and with what violence     these trees were in a moment shattered only

here little like a vale it   is so broad with irregular hills rising up on each side in outline   resembling the oldfashioned valances of a bed there is a great deal   of arable land the corn ripe trees here and thereplantations   clumps coppices a newness in everything so much of the gorse and   broom rooted out that you wonder why it is not all gone and yet there   seems to be almost as much gorse and broom as corn and they grow one   among another you know not how crossed the nith the vale becomes   narrow and very pleasant cornfields green hills clay cottages the   rivers bed rocky with woody banks left the nith about a mile and a   half and reached brownhill a lonely inn where we slept the view   from the windows was pleasing though some travellers might have been   disposed to quarrel with it for its general nakedness yet there was   abundance of corn it is an open countryopen yet all over hills at   a little distance were many cottages among trees that looked very   pretty brownhill is about seven or eight miles from ellisland i   fancied to myself while i was sitting in the parlour that burns   might have caroused there for most likely his rounds extended so far   and this thought gave a melancholy interest to the smoky walls  on dec 23 1839 wordsworth wrote to professor henry reed philadelphia    the other day i chanced to be looking over a ms poem belonging to   the year 1803 though not actually composed till many years   afterwards it was suggested by visiting the neighbourhood of   dumfries in which burns had resided and where he died it concluded   thus      sweet mercy to the gates of heaven etc    i instantly added the other day      but why to him confine the prayer etc    the more i reflect upon this the more i feel justified in attaching   comparatively small importance to any literary monument that i may be   enabled to leave behind it is well however i am convinced that men   think otherwise in the earlier part of their lives  it may be mentioned that in his note to the poems chiefly of early and late years 1842 wordsworth does not quote from the text of his sisters journalwhich was first published in 1875but from some other copy

red and green were the   distinguishable colours we hastened to get ourselves ready as soon as   we saw the party approach but had longer to wait than we expected   the lake being wider than it appears to be as they drew near we could   distinguish men in tartan plaids women in scarlet cloaks and green   umbrellas by the halfdozen the landing was as pretty a sight as ever   i saw the bay which had been so quiet two days before was all in   motion with small waves while the swollen waterfall roared in our   ears the boat came steadily up being pressed almost to the waters   edge by the weight of its cargo perhaps twenty people landed one   after another it did not rain much but the women held up their   umbrellas they were dressed in all the colours of the rainbow and   with their scarlet cardinals the tartan plaids of the men and scotch   bonnets made a gay appearance there was a joyous bustle surrounding   the boat which even imparted something of the same character to the   waterfall in its tumult and the restless grey waves the young men   laughed and shouted the lasses laughed and the elder folks seemed to   be in a bustle to be away i remember well with what haste the   mistress of the house where we were ran up to seek after her child   and seeing us how anxiously and kindly she inquired how we had fared   if we had had a good fire had been well waited upon etc all this in   three minutesfor the boatman had another party to bring from the   other side and hurried us off    the hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and mr   macfarlanes gave us very favourable impressions on this our first   entrance into the highlands and at this day the innocent merriment of   the girls with their kindness to us and the beautiful face and   figure of the elder

rough and sounds are wild   and everything unreconciled  but his characterization of the placea glen the charm of which is little knownin the stillness of an autumn afternoon is as true to nature as

commanded a   view to the top of ita very sweet scene a green valley not very   narrow with a few scattered trees and huts almost invisible in a   misty green of afternoon light at this hamlet we crossed a bridge   and the road led us down the glen which had become exceedingly   narrow and so continued to the end the hills on both sides heathy   and rocky very steep but continuous the rock not single or   overhanging not scooped into caverns or sounding with torrents   there are no trees no houses no traces of cultivation not one   outstanding object it is truly a solitude the road even making it   appear still more so the bottom of the valley is mostly smooth and   level the brook not noisy everything is simple and undisturbed and   while we passed through it the whole place was shady cool clear and   solemn at the end of the long valley we ascended a hill to a great   height and reached the top when the sun on the point of setting   shed a soft yellow light upon every eminence the prospect was very   extensive over hollows and plains no towns and few houses   visiblea prospect extensive as it was in harmony with the secluded   dell and fixing its own peculiar

wilkinsons tour to the   highlands was shown in manuscript to his friends soon after his   returnthat he was not only willing to show it but even to allow it   to be copied though reluctant to publish itthat there was   sufficient intimacy between him and the wordsworths to account for his   showing or lending the manuscript to them especially as they had   travelled over much of the same ground

ascended halfway up the hill directed by the man i   took a nearer footpath and at the top came in view of a most   impressive scene a ruined castle on an island almost in the middle of   the last compartment of the lake backed by a mountain cove down   which came a roaring stream the castle occupied every foot of the   island that was visible to us appearing to rise out of the water   mists rested upon the mountain side with spots of sunshine between   there was a mild desolation in the low grounds a solemn grandeur in   the mountains and the castle was wild yet stately not dismantled of   its turrets nor the walls broken down though completely in ruin   after having stood some minutes i joined william on the highroad and   both wishing to stay longer near this place we requested the man to   drive his little boy on to dalmally about two miles further and   leave the car at the inn he told us the ruin was called kilchurn   castle that it belonged to lord breadalbane and had been built by   one of the ladies of that family for her defence during her lords   absence at the crusades for which purpose she levied a tax of seven   years rent upon her tenants he said that from that side of the lake   it did not appear in very dry weather to stand upon an island but   that it was possible to go over to it without being wetshod we were   very lucky in seeing it after a great flood for its enchanting effect   was chiefly owing to its situation in the lake a decayed palace   rising out of the plain of waters i have called it a palace for such   feeling it gave me though having been built as a place of defence a   castle or fortress we turned again and reascended the hill and sate   a long time in the middle of it looking on the castle and the huge   mountain cove opposite

old manw w 1807   in dorothy wordsworths recollections of the scotch tour the following occurs    august 27 1803we mentioned rob roy and the eyes of all   glistened even the lady of the house who was very diffident and no   great talker exclaimed he was a good man rob roy he had been dead   only about eighty years had lived in the next farm which belonged to   him and there his bones were laid he was a famous swordsman having   an arm much longer than other men he had a greater command with his   sword as a proof of the length of his arm they told us that he could   garter his tartan stockings below the knee without stooping and added   a dozen different stories of single combats which he had fought all   in perfect good humour merely to prove his prowess i daresay they   had stories of this kind which would hardly have been exhausted in the   long evenings of a whole december week rob roy being as famous here   as even robin hood was in the forest of sherwood he also robbed   from

with little hope of finding them at home   having seen a large company at work in a hayfield whom we   conjectured to be his whole household as it proved except a   servantmaid who answered our enquiries we had sent the ferryman   forward from the head of the glen to bring the boat round from the   place where he left it to the other side of the lake passed the same   farmhouse we had such good reason to remember and went up to the   buryingground that stood so sweetly near the waterside the ferryman   had told us that rob roys grave was there so we could not pass on   without going up to the spot there were several tombstones but the   inscriptions were either wornout or unintelligible to us and the   place choked up with nettles and brambles you will remember the   description i have given of the spot i have nothing here to add   except the following poem which it suggested to william  rob roy was buried at the kirkton of balquhidder near the outlet of loch voil in perthshire there are three sculptured stones in the rude burialplace of the macgregors at the eastern end of the old church the one with the long claymore marks the restingplace of rob roys wife the one opposite on the other side is the tomb of his eldest son and the central stone more elaborately carved marks the grave of the hero himselfed                                               sonnet composed

written swans in the plural the scene when i saw   it with its still and dim lake under the dusky hills was one of   utter loneliness there was one swan and one only stemming the   water and the pathetic loneliness of the region gave importance to   the one companion of that swan its own white image in the water it   was for that reason that i recorded the swan and the shadow had there   been many swans and many shadows they would have implied nothing as   regards the character of the place and i should have said nothing   about them  see his essays chiefly on poetry vol ii p 277

you to compare the   ideal with the real stream  wordsworth had asked him if he could suggest any name more true to the place than burnmill in the line the sweets of burnmill meadow scott replied    we have broadmeadow upon yarrow which with the addition of green or   fair or any other epithet of one syllable will give truth to the   locality and supply the place of burnmill meadow which we have

temptation a   confined barren prospect from the window    at clovenford being so near to the yarrow we could not but think of   the possibility of going thither but came to the conclusion of   reserving the pleasure for some future time in consequence of which   after our return william wrote the poem which i shall here   transcribe  from dorothy wordsworths recollections of a tour made in

only   seventeen those parts of the house which we were to occupy were neat   and clean she showed me every corner and before i had been ten   minutes in the house opened her very drawers that i might see what a   stock of linen she had then asked how long we should stay and said   she wished we were come for three months she was a most remarkable   person the alacrity with which she ran upstairs when we rung the   bell and guessed at and strove to prevent our wants was surprising   she had a quick eye and keen strong features and a joyousness in her   motions like what used to be in old molly when she was particularly   elated i found afterwards that she had been subject to fits of   dejection and illhealth we then conjectured that her overflowing   gaiety and strength might in part be attributed to the same cause as   her former dejection her husband was deaf and infirm and sate in a   chair with scarcely the power to move a limban affecting contrast   the old woman said they had been a very hardworking pair they had   wrought like slaves at their tradeher husband had been a currier   and she told me how they had portioned off their daughters with money   and each a feather bed and that in their old age they had laid out   the little they could spare in building and furnishing that house and   she added with pride that she had lived in her youth in the family of   lady egerton who was no high lady and now was in the habit of coming   to her house whenever she was at jedburgh and a hundred other things   for when she once began with lady egerton she did not know how

wanted   anything and to wish us goodnight on all occasions her manners were   governed by the same spirit there was no withdrawing ones attention   from her we were so much interested that william

bower     or woman man or child                                  20    and yet he neither drooped nor pined   nor had a melancholy mind   for god took pity on the boy   and was his friend and gave him joy     of which we nothing know                                 25    his mother too no doubt above   her other children him did love   for was she here or was she there   she thought of him with constant care     and more than mothers love                              30    and proud she was of heart when clad   in crimson stockings tartan plaid   and bonnet with a feather gay   to kirk he on the sabbath day     went hand in hand with her                               35    a dog too had he not for need   but one to play with and to feed   which would 5 have led him if bereft   of company or friends and left     without a better guide                                   40    and then the bagpipes he could blow   and thus from house to house would go   and all were pleased to hear and see   for none made sweeter melody     than did the poor blind boy                              45    yet he had many a restless dream   both when he heard the eagles scream   and when he heard the torrents roar   and heard the water beat the shore     near which their cottage stood                           50    beside a lake their cottage stood   not small like ours a peaceful flood   but one of mighty size and strange   that rough or smooth is full of change     and stirring in its bed                                  55    for to this lake by night and day   the great seawater finds its way   through long long windings of the hills   and drinks up all the pretty b rills     and rivers large and strong c                          60    then hurries back the road it came   returns on errand still the same   this did it when the earth was new   and this for evermore will do     as long as earth shall last                              65    and with the coming of the tide   come boats and ships that safely 6 ride   between the woods and lofty rocks   and to the shepherds with their flocks   bring tales of distant lands                               70    and of those tales whateer they were   the blind boy always had his share   whether of mighty towns or vales   with warmer suns and softer gales       or wonders of the deep                                 75    yet more it pleased him more it stirred   when from the waterside he heard   the shouting and the jolly cheers   the bustle of the mariners       in stillness or in storm                               80    but what do his desires avail   for he must never handle sail   nor mount the mast nor row nor float   in sailors ship or fishers boat       upon the rocking waves                                 85    his mother often thought and said   what sin would be upon her head   if she should suffer this my son   whateer you do leave this undone       the danger is so great                                90    thus lived he by lochlevens side   still sounding with the sounding tide   and heard the billows leap and dance   without a shadow of mischance       till he was ten years old                              95    when one day and now mark me well   ye 7 soon shall know how this befell   he in a vessel of his own   on the swift flood is hurrying down       down to the mighty sea 8                            100    in such a vessel never more   may human creature leave the shore 9   if this or that way he should stir   woe to the poor blind mariner     for death will be his doom                              105   10   but say what bears himye have seen   the indians bow his arrows keen   rare beasts and birds with plumage bright   gifts which for wonder or delight     are brought in ships from far 11                      110    d such gifts had those seafaring men   spread round that haven in the glen   each hut perchance might have its own   and to the boy they all were known      he knew and prized them all                            115    the rarest was a turtleshell   which he poor child had studied well   a shell of ample size and light   as the pearly car of amphitrite     that sportive dolphins drew 12                        120    and as a coracle that braves   on vagas breast the fretful waves   this shell upon the deep would swim   and gaily lift its fearless brim     above the tossing surge 13                            125    and this the little blind boy knew   and he a story strange yet true   had heard how in a shell like this   an english boy o thought of bliss     had stoutly launched from shore                         130    launched from the margin of a bay   among the indian isles where lay   his fathers ship and had sailed far   to join that gallant ship of war     in his delightful shell                                 135    our highland boy oft visited   the house that 14 held this prize and led   by choice or chance did thither come   one day when no one was at home     and found the door unbarred                             140    while there he sate alone and blind   that story flashed upon his mind   a bold thought roused him and he took   the shell from out its secret nook      and bore it on his head 15                           145    he launched his vesseland in pride   of spirit from lochlevens side   stepped into ithis thoughts all free   as the light breezes that with glee      sang through the adventurers hair 16                150    a while he stood upon his feet   he felt the motiontook his seat   still better pleased as more and more   the tide retreated from the shore      and sucked and sucked him in 17                     155    and there he is in face of heaven   how rapidly the child is driven   the fourth part of a mile i ween   he thus had gone ere he was seen      by any human eye                                       160    but when he was first seen oh me   what shrieking and what misery   for many saw among the rest   his mother she who loved him best     she saw her poor blind boy                              165    but for the child the sightless boy   it is the triumph of his joy   the bravest traveller in balloon   mounting as if to reach the moon     was never half so blessed                               170    and let him let him go his way   alone and innocent and gay   for if good angels love to wait   on the forlorn unfortunate     this child will take no harm                            175    but now the passionate lament   which from the crowd on shore was sent   the cries which broke from old and young   in gaelic or the english tongue     are stifledall is still                               180    and quickly with a silent crew   a boat is ready to pursue   and from the shore their course they take   and swiftly down the running lake     they follow the blind boy                               185    but soon they move with softer pace   so have ye seen the fowler chase   on grasmeres clear unruffled breast   a youngling of the wildducks nest     with deftlylifted oar                                  190    or as the wily sailors crept   to seize while on the deep it slept   the hapless creature which did dwell   erewhile within the dancing shell     they steal upon their prey 18                         195    with sound the least that can be made   they follow more and more afraid   more cautious as they draw more near   but in his darkness he can hear     and guesses their intent                                200    leighaleighahe then cried out   leighaleighawith eager shout 19   thus did he cry and thus did pray   and what he meant was keep away     and leave me to myself e                             205    alas and when he felt their hands   youve often heard 20 of magic wands   that with a motion overthrow   a palace of the proudest show     or melt it into air                                     210    so all his dreamsthat inward light   with which his soul had shone so bright   all vanishedtwas a heartfelt cross   to him a heavy bitter loss     as he had ever known                                    215    but hark a gratulating voice   with which the very hills rejoice   tis from the crowd who tremblingly   have 21 watched the event and now can see     that he is safe at last                                 220    and then when he was brought to land   full sure they were a happy band   which gathering round did on the banks   of that great water give god thanks     and welcomed the poor child                             225    and in the general joy of heart   the blind boys little dog took part   he leapt about and oft did kiss   his masters hands in sign of bliss     with sound like lamentation                             230    but most of all his mother dear   she who had fainted with her fear   rejoiced when waking she espies   the child when she can trust her eyes     and touches the blind boy                               235    she led him home and wept amain   when he was in the house again   tears flowed in torrents from her eyes   she kissed himhow could she chastise 22     she was too happy far                                   240    thus after he had fondly braved   the perilous deep the boy was saved   and though his fancies had been wild   yet he was pleased and reconciled     to live in peace on shore                               245    and in the lonely highland dell   still do they keep the turtleshell   and long the story will repeat   of the blind boys adventurous feat     and how he was preserved 23                           250                                        variants on the text  variant 1  1827    weve       1807   variant 2

wordsworth sent him this stanza of the poem and asked    could you furnish me by application to any of your gaelic friends a   phrase in that language which could take its place in the following   verse of eight syllables and have the following meaning  he adds    the above is part of a little poem which i have written on a highland   story told me by an eyewitness   this is the nearest clue we have to the date of the composition of the poemed    it is recorded in dampiers voyages that a boy the son of a captain of a man of war seated himself in a turtleshell and floated in it from the shore to his fathers ship which lay at anchor at the distance of half a mile upon the suggestion of a friend i have substituted such a shell for that less elegant vessel in which my blind voyager did actually intrust himself to the dangerous current of loch levin as was related to me by an eyewitnessw w 1815  this note varies slightly in later editions  the loch leven referred to is a sealoch in argyllshire into which the tidal water flows with some force from loch linnhe at ballachulish              by night and day   the great seawater finds its way   through long long windings of the hills  the friend referred to in the note of 1815 who urged wordsworth to give his blind voyager a shell instead of a washingtub to sail in was coleridge the original tale of the tub was not more unfortunate than the lines in praise of wilkinsons spade and several of wordsworths friends notably charles lamb and barren field objected to the change lamb wrote to wordsworth in 1815    i am afraid lest that substitution of a shell a flat falsification   of the history for the household implement as it stood at first was   a kind of tub thrown out to the beast i e the reviewer or   rather thrown out for him the tub was a good honest tub in its place   and nothing could fairly be said against it you say you made the   alteration for the friendly reader but the malicious will take it   to himself  the letters of charles lamb edited by alfred ainger vol i p 283 wordsworth could not be induced to undo his work and go back to his own original although he evidently agreed with what lamb had said as is seen in a letter to barren field oct 24 1828ed                                               october 1803   composed october 1803published 1807   included among the sonnets dedicated to

grander seen from below near the rivers bed everybody knows   that this pass is famous in military history when we were travelling   in scotland an invasion was hourly looked for and one could not but   think with some regret of the times when from the now depopulated   highlands forty or fifty thousand men might have been poured down for   the defence of the country under such leaders as the marquis of   montrose or the brave man who had so distinguished himself upon the   ground where we were standing i will transcribe a sonnet suggested to   william by this place and written in oct 1803
