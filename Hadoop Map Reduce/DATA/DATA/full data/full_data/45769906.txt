45769906	how he lied to her husband   by george bernard shaw     preface  like many other works of mine this playlet is a piece doccasion in 1905 it happened that mr arnold daly who was then playing the part of napoleon in the man of destiny in new york found that whilst the play was too long to take a secondary place in the evenings performance it was too short to suffice by itself i therefore took advantage of four days continuous rain during a holiday in the north of scotland to write how he lied to her husband for mr daly in his hands it served its turn very effectively  i print it here as a sample of what can be done with even the most hackneyed stage framework by filling it in with an observed touch of actual humanity instead of with doctrinaire romanticism nothing in the theatre is staler than the situation of husband wife and lover or the fun of knockabout farce i have taken both and got an original play out of them as anybody else can if only he will look about him for his material instead of plagiarizing othello and the thousand plays that have proceeded on othellos romantic assumptions and false point of honor  a further experiment made by mr arnold daly with this play is worth recording in 1905 mr daly produced mrs warrens profession in new york the press of that city instantly raised a cry that such persons as mrs warren are ordure and should not be mentioned in the presence of decent people this hideous repudiation of humanity and social conscience so took possession of the new york journalists that the few among them who kept their feet morally and intellectually could do nothing to check the epidemic of foul language gross suggestion and raving obscenity of word and thought that broke out the writers abandoned all selfrestraint under the impression that they were upholding virtue instead of outraging it they infected each other with their hysteria until they were for all practical purposes indecently mad they finally forced the police to arrest mr daly and his company and led the magistrate to express his loathing of the duty thus forced upon him of reading an unmentionable and abominable play of course the convulsion soon exhausted itself the magistrate naturally somewhat impatient when he found that what he had to read was a strenuously ethical play forming part of a book which had been in circulation unchallenged for eight years and had been received without protest by the whole london and new york press gave the journalists a piece of his mind as to their moral taste in plays by consent he passed the case on to a higher court which declared that the play was not immoral acquitted mr daly and made an end of the attempt to use the law to declare living women to be ordure and thus enforce silence as to the farreaching fact that you cannot cheapen women in the market for industrial purposes without cheapening them for other purposes as well i hope mrs warrens profession will be played everywhere in season and out of season until mrs warren has bitten that fact into the public conscience and shamed the newspapers which support a tariff to keep up the price of every american commodity except american manhood and womanhood  unfortunately mr daly had already suffered the usual fate of those who direct public attention to the profits of the sweater or the pleasures of the voluptuary he was morally lynched side by side with me months elapsed before the decision of the courts vindicated him and even then since his vindication implied the condemnation of the press which was by that time sober again and ashamed of its orgy his triumph received a rather sulky and grudging publicity in the meantime he had hardly been able to approach an american city including even those cities which had heaped applause on him as the defender of hearth and home when he produced candida without having to face articles discussing whether mothers could allow their daughters to attend such plays as you never can tell written by the infamous author of mrs warrens profession and acted by the monster who produced it what made this harder to bear was that though no fact is better established in theatrical business than the financial disastrousness of moral discredit the journalists who had done all the mischief kept paying vice the homage of assuming that it is enormously popular and lucrative and that i and mr daly being exploiters of vice must therefore be making colossal fortunes out of the abuse heaped on us and had in fact provoked it and welcomed it with that express object ignorance of real life could hardly go further  one consequence was that mr daly could not have kept his financial engagements or maintained his hold on the public had he not accepted engagements to appear for a season in the vaudeville theatres the american equivalent of our music halls where he played how he lied to her husband comparatively unhampered by the press censorship of the theatre or by that sophistication of the audience through press suggestion from which i suffer more perhaps than any other author vaudeville authors are fortunately unknown the audiences see what the play contains and what the actor can do not what the papers have told them to expect success under such circumstances had a value both for mr daly and myself which did something to console us for the very unsavory mobbing which the new york press organized for us and which was not the less disgusting because we suffered in a good cause and in the very best company  mr daly having weathered the storm can perhaps shake his soul free of it as he heads for fresh successes with younger authors but i have certain sensitive places in my soul i do not like that word ordure apply it to my work and i can afford to smile since the world on the whole will smile with me but to apply it to the woman in the street whose spirit is of one substance with our own and her body no less holy to look your women folk in the face afterwards and not go out and hang yourself that is not on the list of pardonable sins  postscript since the above was written news has arrived from america that a leading new york newspaper which was among the most abusively clamorous for the suppression of mrs warrens profession has just been fined heavily for deriving part of its revenue from advertisements of mrs warrens houses  many people have been puzzled by the fact that whilst stage entertainments which are frankly meant to act on the spectators as aphrodisiacs are everywhere tolerated plays which have an almost horrifyingly contrary effect are fiercely attacked by persons and papers notoriously indifferent to public morals on all other occasions the explanation is very simple the profits of mrs warrens profession are shared not only by mrs warren and sir george crofts but by the landlords of their houses the newspapers which advertize them the restaurants which cater for them and in short all the trades to which they are good customers not to mention the public officials and representatives whom they silence by complicity corruption or blackmail add to these the employers who profit by cheap female labor and the shareholders whose dividends depend on it you find such people everywhere even on the judicial bench and in the highest places in church and state and you get a large and powerful class with a strong pecuniary incentive to protect mrs warrens profession and a correspondingly strong incentive to conceal from their own consciences no less than from the world the real sources of their gain these are the people who declare that it is feminine vice and not poverty that drives women to the streets as if vicious women with independent incomes ever went there these are the people who indulgent or indifferent to aphrodisiac plays raise the moral hue and cry against performances of mrs warrens profession and drag actresses to the police court to be insulted bullied and threatened for fulfilling their engagements for please observe that the judicial decision in new york state in favor of the play does not end the matter in kansas city for instance the municipality finding itself restrained by the courts from preventing the performance fell back on a local byelaw against indecency to evade the constitution of the united states they summoned the actress who impersonated mrs warren to the police court and offered her and her colleagues the alternative of leaving the city or being prosecuted under this byelaw  now nothing is more possible than that the city councillors who suddenly displayed such concern for the morals of the theatre were either mrs warrens landlords or employers of women at starvation wages or restaurant keepers or newspaper proprietors or in some other more or less direct way sharers of the profits of her trade no doubt it is equally possible that they were simply stupid men who thought that indecency consists not in evil but in mentioning it i have however been myself a member of a municipal council and have not found municipal councillors quite so simple and inexperienced as this at all events i do not propose to give the kansas councillors the benefit of the doubt i therefore advise the public at large which will finally decide the matter to keep a vigilant eye on gentlemen who will stand anything at the theatre except a performance of mrs warrens profession and who assert in the same breath that a the play is too loathsome to be bearable by civilized people and b that unless its performance is prohibited the whole town will throng to see it they may be merely excited and foolish but i am bound to warn the public that it is equally likely that they may be collected and knavish  at all events to prohibit the play is to protect the evil which the play exposes and in view of that fact i see no reason for assuming that the prohibitionists are disinterested moralists and that the author the managers and the performers who depend for their livelihood on their personal reputations and not on rents advertisements or dividends are grossly inferior to them in moral sense and public responsibility  it is true that in mrs warrens profession society and not any individual is the villain of the piece but it does not follow that the people who take offence at it are all champions of society their credentials cannot be too carefully examined     how he lied to her husband  it is eight oclock in the evening the curtains are drawn and the lamps lighted in the drawing room of her flat in cromwell road her lover a beautiful youth of eighteen in evening dress and cape with a bunch of flowers and an opera hat in his hands comes in alone the door is near the corner and as he appears in the doorway he has the fireplace on the nearest wall to his right and the grand piano along the opposite wall to his left near the fireplace a small ornamental table has on it a hand mirror a fan a pair of long white gloves and a little white woollen cloud to wrap a womans head in on the other side of the room near the piano is a broad square softly upholstered stool the room is furnished in the most approved south kensington fashion that is it is as like a show room as possible and is intended to demonstrate the racial position and spending powers of its owners and not in the least to make them comfortable  he is be it repeated a very beautiful youth moving as in a dream walking as on air he puts his flowers down carefully on the table beside the fan takes off his cape and as there is no room on the table for it takes it to the piano puts his hat on the cape crosses to the hearth looks at his watch puts it up again notices the things on the table lights up as if he saw heaven opening before him goes to the table and takes the cloud in both hands nestling his nose into its softness and kissing it kisses the gloves one after another kisses the fan gasps a long shuddering sigh of ecstasy sits down on the stool and presses his hands to his eyes to shut out reality and dream a little takes his hands down and shakes his head with a little smile of rebuke for his folly catches sight of a speck of dust on his shoes and hastily and carefully brushes it off with his handkerchief rises and takes the hand mirror from the table to make sure of his tie with the gravest anxiety and is looking at his watch again when she comes in much flustered as she is dressed for the theatre has spoilt petted ways and wears many diamonds she has an air of being a young and beautiful woman but as a matter of hard fact she is dress and pretensions apart a very ordinary south kensington female of about 37 hopelessly inferior in physical and spiritual distinction to the beautiful youth who hastily puts down the mirror as she enters  he kissing her hand at last  she henry something dreadful has happened  he whats the matter  she i have lost your poems  he they were unworthy of you i will write you some more  she no thank you never any more poems for me oh how could i have been so mad so rash so imprudent  he thank heaven for your madness your rashness your imprudence  she impatiently oh be sensible henry cant you see what a terrible thing this is for me suppose anybody finds these poems what will they think  he they will think that a man once loved a woman more devotedly than ever man loved woman before but they will not know what man it was  she what good is that to me if everybody will know what woman it was  he but how will they know  she how will they know why my name is all over them my silly unhappy name oh if i had only been christened mary jane or gladys muriel or beatrice or francesca or guinevere or something quite common but aurora aurora im the only aurora in london and everybody knows it i believe im the only aurora in the world and its so horribly easy to rhyme to it oh henry why didnt you try to restrain your feelings a little in common consideration for me why didnt you write with some little reserve  he write poems to you with reserve you ask me that  she with perfunctory tenderness yes dear of course it was very nice of you and i know it was my own fault as much as yours i ought to have noticed that your verses ought never to have been addressed to a married woman  he ah how i wish they had been addressed to an unmarried woman how i wish they had  she indeed you have no right to wish anything of the sort they are quite unfit for anybody but a married woman thats just the difficulty what will my sistersinlaw think of them  he painfully jarred have you got sistersinlaw  she yes of course i have do you suppose i am an angel  he biting his lips i do heaven help me i door i didor he almost chokes a sob  she softening and putting her hand caressingly on his shoulder listen to me dear its very nice of you to live with me in a dream and to love me and so on but i cant help my husband having disagreeable relatives can i  he brightening up ah of course they are your husbands relatives i forgot that forgive me aurora he takes her hand from his shoulder and kisses it she sits down on the stool he remains near the table with his back to it smiling fatuously down at her  she the fact is teddys got nothing but relatives he has eight sisters and six halfsisters and ever so many brothersbut i dont mind his brothers now if you only knew the least little thing about the world henry youd know that in a large family though the sisters quarrel with one another like mad all the time yet let one of the brothers marry and they all turn on their unfortunate sisterinlaw and devote the rest of their lives with perfect unanimity to persuading him that his wife is unworthy of him they can do it to her very face without her knowing it because there are always a lot of stupid low family jokes that nobody understands but themselves half the time you cant tell what theyre talking about it just drives you wild there ought to be a law against a mans sister ever entering his house after hes married im as certain as that im sitting here that georgina stole those poems out of my workbox  he she will not understand them i think  she oh wont she shell understand them only too well shell understand more harm than ever was in them nasty vulgarminded cat  he going to her oh dont dont think of people in that way dont think of her at all he takes her hand and sits down on the carpet at her feet aurora do you remember the evening when i sat here at your feet and read you those poems for the first time  she i shouldnt have let you i see that now when i think of georgina sitting there at teddys feet and reading them to him for the first time i feel i shall just go distracted  he yes you are right it will be a profanation  she oh i dont care about the profanation but what will teddy think what will he do suddenly throwing his head away from her knee you dont seem to think a bit about teddy she jumps up more and more agitated  he supine on the floor for she has thrown him off his balance to me teddy is nothing and georgina less than nothing  she youll soon find out how much less than nothing she is if you think a woman cant do any harm because shes only a scandalmongering dowdy ragbag youre greatly mistaken she flounces about the room he gets up slowly and dusts his hands suddenly she runs to him and throws herself into his arms henry help me find a way out of this for me and ill bless you as long as you live oh how wretched i am she sobs on his breast  he and oh how happy i am  she whisking herself abruptly away dont be selfish  he humbly yes i deserve that i think if i were going to the stake with you i should still be so happy with you that i could hardly feel your danger more than my own  she relenting and patting his hand fondly oh you are a dear darling boy henry but throwing his hand away fretfully youre no use i want somebody to tell me what to do  he with quiet conviction your heart will tell you at the right time i have thought deeply over this and i know what we two must do sooner or later  she no henry i will do nothing improper nothing dishonorable she sits down plump on the stool and looks inflexible  he if you did you would no longer be aurora our course is perfectly simple perfectly straightforward perfectly stainless and true we love one another i am not ashamed of that i am ready to go out and proclaim it to all london as simply as i will declare it to your husband when you seeas you soon will seethat this is the only way honorable enough for your feet to tread let us go out together to our own house this evening without concealment and without shame remember we owe something to your husband we are his guests here he is an honorable man he has been kind to us he has perhaps loved you as well as his prosaic nature and his sordid commercial environment permitted we owe it to him in all honor not to let him learn the truth from the lips of a scandalmonger let us go to him now quietly hand in hand bid him farewell and walk out of the house without concealment and subterfuge freely and honestly in full honor and selfrespect  she staring at him and where shall we go to  he we shall not depart by a hairs breadth from the ordinary natural current of our lives we were going to the theatre when the loss of the poems compelled us to take action at once we shall go to the theatre still but we shall leave your diamonds here for we cannot afford diamonds and do not need them  she fretfully i have told you already that i hate diamonds only teddy insists on hanging me all over with them you need not preach simplicity to me  he i never thought of doing so dearest i know that these trivialities are nothing to you what was i sayingoh yes instead of coming back here from the theatre you will come with me to my homenow and henceforth our homeand in due course of time when you are divorced we shall go through whatever idle legal ceremony you may desire i attach no importance to the law my love was not created in me by the law nor can it be bound or loosed by it that is simple enough and sweet enough is it not he takes the flower from the table here are flowers for you i have the tickets we will ask your husband to lend us the carriage to show that there is no malice no grudge between us come  she spiritlessly taking the flowers without looking at them and temporizing teddy isnt in yet  he well let us take that calmly let us go to the theatre as if nothing had happened and tell him when we come back now or three hours hence today or tomorrow what does it matter provided all is done in honor without shame or fear  she what did you get tickets for lohengrin  he i tried but lohengrin was sold out for tonight he takes out two court theatre tickets  she then what did you get  he can you ask me what is there besides lohengrin that we two could endure except candida  she springing up candida no i wont go to it again henry tossing the flower on the piano it is that play that has done all the mischief im very sorry i ever saw it it ought to be stopped  he amazed aurora  she yes i mean it  he that divinest love poem the poem that gave us courage to speak to one another that revealed to us what we really felt for one another that  she just so it put a lot of stuff into my head that i should never have dreamt of for myself i imagined myself just like candida  he catching her hands and looking earnestly at her you were right you are like candida  she snatching her hands away oh stuff and i thought you were just like eugene looking critically at him now that i come to look at you you are rather like him too she throws herself discontentedly into the nearest seat which happens to be the bench at the piano he goes to her  he very earnestly aurora if candida had loved eugene she would have gone out into the night with him without a moments hesitation  she with equal earnestness henry do you know whats wanting in that play  he there is nothing wanting in it  she yes there is theres a georgina wanting in it if georgina had been there to make trouble that play would have been a truetolife tragedy now ill tell you something about it that i have never told you before  he what is that  she i took teddy to it i thought it would do him good and so it would if i could only have kept him awake georgina came too and you should have heard the way she went on about it she said it was downright immoral and that she knew the sort of woman that encourages boys to sit on the hearthrug and make love to her she was just preparing teddys mind to poison it about me  he let us be just to georgina dearest  she let her deserve it first just to georgina indeed  he she really sees the world in that way that is her punishment  she how can it be her punishment when she likes it itll be my punishment when she brings that budget of poems to teddy i wish youd have some sense and sympathize with my position a little  he going away from the piano and beginning to walk about rather testily my dear i really dont care about georgina or about teddy all these squabbles belong to a plane on which i am as you say no use i have counted the cost and i do not fear the consequences after all what is there to fear where is the difficulty what can georgina do what can your husband do what can anybody do  she do you mean to say that you propose that we should walk right bang up to teddy and tell him were going away together  he yes what can be simpler  she and do you think for a moment hed stand it like that halfbaked clergyman in the play hed just kill you  he coming to a sudden stop and speaking with considerable confidence you dont understand these things my darling how could you in one respect i am unlike the poet in the play i have followed the greek ideal and not neglected the culture of my body your husband would make a tolerable secondrate heavy weight if he were in training and ten years younger as it is he could if strung up to a great effort by a burst of passion give a good account of himself for perhaps fifteen seconds but i am active enough to keep out of his reach for fifteen seconds and after that i should be simply all over him  she rising and coming to him in consternation what do you mean by all over him  he gently dont ask me dearest at all events i swear to you that you need not be anxious about me  she and what about teddy do you mean to tell me that you are going to beat teddy before my face like a brutal prizefighter  he all this alarm is needless dearest believe me nothing will happen your husband knows that i am capable of defending myself under such circumstances nothing ever does happen and of course i shall do nothing the man who once loved you is sacred to me  she suspiciously doesnt he love me still has he told you anything  he no no he takes her tenderly in his arms dearest dearest how agitated you are how unlike yourself all these worries belong to the lower plane come up with me to the higher one the heights the solitudes the soul world  she avoiding his gaze no stop its no use mr apjohn  he recoiling mr apjohn  she excuse me i meant henry of course  he how could you even think of me as mr apjohn i never think of you as mrs bompas it is always cand i mean aurora aurora auro  she yes yes thats all very well mr apjohn he is about to interrupt again but she wont have it no its no use ive suddenly begun to think of you as mr apjohn and its ridiculous to go on calling you henry i thought you were only a boy a child a dreamer i thought you would be too much afraid to do anything and now you want to beat teddy and to break up my home and disgrace me and make a horrible scandal in the papers its cruel unmanly cowardly  he with grave wonder are you afraid  she oh of course im afraid so would you be if you had any common sense she goes to the hearth turning her back to him and puts one tapping foot on the fender  he watching her with great gravity perfect love casteth out fear that is why i am not afraid mrs bompas you do not love me  she turning to him with a gasp of relief oh thank you thank you you really can be very nice henry  he why do you thank me  she coming prettily to him from the fireplace for calling me mrs bompas again i feel now that you are going to be reasonable and behave like a gentleman he drops on the stool covers his face with his hand and groans whats the matter  he once or twice in my life i have dreamed that i was exquisitely happy and blessed but oh the misgiving at the first stir of consciousness the stab of reality the prison walls of the bedroom the bitter bitter disappointment of waking and this time oh this time i thought i was awake  she listen to me henry we really havent time for all that sort of flapdoodle now he starts to his feet as if she had pulled a trigger and straightened him by the release of a powerful spring and goes past her with set teeth to the little table oh take care you nearly hit me in the chin with the top of your head  he with fierce politeness i beg your pardon what is it you want me to do i am at your service i am ready to behave like a gentleman if you will be kind enough to explain exactly how  she a little frightened thank you henry i was sure you would youre not angry with me are you  he go on go on quickly give me something to think about or i willi willhe suddenly snatches up her fan and it about to break it in his clenched fists  she running forward and catching at the fan with loud lamentation dont break my fanno dont he slowly relaxes his grip of it as she draws it anxiously out of his hands no really thats a stupid trick i dont like that youve no right to do that she opens the fan and finds that the sticks are disconnected oh how could you be so inconsiderate  he i beg your pardon i will buy you a new one  she querulously you will never be able to match it and it was a particular favorite of mine  he shortly then you will have to do without it thats all  she thats not a very nice thing to say after breaking my pet fan i think  he if you knew how near i was to breaking teddys pet wife and presenting him with the pieces you would be thankful that you are alive instead ofofof howling about five shillings worth of ivory damn your fan  she oh dont you dare swear in my presence one would think you were my husband  he again collapsing on the stool this is some horrible dream what has become of you you are not my aurora  she oh well if you come to that what has become of you do you think i would ever have encouraged you if i had known you were such a little devil  he dont drag me downdontdont help me to find the way back to the heights  she kneeling beside him and pleading if you would only be reasonable henry if you would only remember that i am on the brink of ruin and not go on calmly saying its all quite simple  he it seems so to me  she jumping up distractedly if you say that again i shall do something ill be sorry for here we are standing on the edge of a frightful precipice no doubt its quite simple to go over and have done with it but cant you suggest anything more agreeable  he i can suggest nothing now a chill black darkness has fallen i can see nothing but the ruins of our dream he rises with a deep sigh  she cant you well i can i can see georgina rubbing those poems into teddy facing him determinedly and i tell you henry apjohn that you got me into this mess and you must get me out of it again  he polite and hopeless all i can say is that i am entirely at your service what do you wish me to do  she do you know anybody else named aurora  he no  she theres no use in saying no in that frozen pigheaded way you must know some aurora or other somewhere  he you said you were the only aurora in the world and lifting his clasped fists with a sudden return of his emotion oh god you were the only aurora in the world to me he turns away from her hiding his face  she petting him yes yes dear of course its very nice of you and i appreciate it indeed i do but its not reasonable just at present now just listen to me i suppose you know all those poems by heart  he yes by heart raising his head and looking at her with a sudden suspicion dont you  she well i never can remember verses and besides ive been so busy that ive not had time to read them all though i intend to the very first moment i can get i promise you that most faithfully henry but now try and remember very particularly does the name of bompas occur in any of the poems  he indignantly no  she youre quite sure  he of course i am quite sure how could i use such a name in a poem  she well i dont see why not it rhymes to rumpus which seems appropriate enough at present goodness knows however youre a poet and you ought to know  he what does it matternow  she it matters a lot i can tell you if theres nothing about bompas in the poems we can say that they were written to some other aurora and that you showed them to me because my name was aurora too so youve got to invent another aurora for the occasion  he very coldly oh if you wish me to tell a lie  she surely as a man of honoras a gentleman you wouldnt tell the truth would you  he very well you have broken my spirit and desecrated my dreams i will lie and protest and stand on my honor oh i will play the gentleman never fear  she yes put it all on me of course dont be mean henry  he rousing himself with an effort you are quite right mrs bompas i beg your pardon you must excuse my temper i have got growing pains i think  she growing pains  he the process of growing from romantic boyhood into cynical maturity usually takes fifteen years when it is compressed into fifteen minutes the pace is too fast and growing pains are the result  she oh is this a time for cleverness its settled isnt it that youre going to be nice and good and that youll brazen it out to teddy that you have some other aurora  he yes im capable of anything now i should not have told him the truth by halves and now i will not lie by halves ill wallow in the honor of a gentleman  she dearest boy i knew you would ish she rushes to the door and holds it ajar listening breathlessly  he what is it  she white with apprehension its teddy i hear him tapping the new barometer he cant have anything serious on his mind or he wouldnt do that perhaps georgina hasnt said anything she steals back to the hearth try and look as if there was nothing the matter give me my gloves quick he hands them to her she pulls on one hastily and begins buttoning it with ostentatious unconcern go further away from me quick he walks doggedly away from her until the piano prevents his going farther if i button my glove and you were to hum a tune dont you think that  he the tableau would be complete in its guiltiness for heavens sake mrs bompas let that glove alone you look like a pickpocket  her husband comes in a robust thicknecked well groomed city man with a strong chin but a blithering eye and credulous mouth he has a momentous air but shows no sign of displeasure rather the contrary  her husband hallo i thought you two were at the theatre  she i felt anxious about you teddy why didnt you come home to dinner  her husband i got a message from georgina she wanted me to go to her  she poor dear georgina im sorry i havent been able to call on her this last week i hope theres nothing the matter with her  her husband nothing except anxiety for my welfare and yours she steals a terrified look at henry by the way apjohn i should like a word with you this evening if aurora can spare you for a moment  he formally i am at your service  her husband no hurry after the theatre will do  he we have decided not to go  her husband indeed well then shall we adjourn to my snuggery  she you neednt move i shall go and lock up my diamonds since im not going to the theatre give me my things  her husband as he hands her the cloud and the mirror well we shall have more room here  he looking about him and shaking his shoulders loose i think i should prefer plenty of room  her husband so if its not disturbing you rory  she not at all she goes out  when the two men are alone together bompas deliberately takes the poems from his breast pocket looks at them reflectively then looks at henry mutely inviting his attention henry refuses to understand doing his best to look unconcerned  her husband do these manuscripts seem at all familiar to you may i ask  he manuscripts  her husband yes would you like to look at them a little closer he proffers them under henrys nose  he as with a sudden illumination of glad surprise why these are my poems  her husband so i gather  he what a shame mrs bompas has shown them to you you must think me an utter ass i wrote them years ago after reading swinburnes songs before sunrise nothing would do me then but i must reel off a set of songs to the sunrise aurora you know the rosy fingered aurora theyre all about aurora when mrs bompas told me her name was aurora i couldnt resist the temptation to lend them to her to read but i didnt bargain for your unsympathetic eyes  her husband grinning apjohn thats really very ready of you you are cut out for literature and the day will come when rory and i will be proud to have you about the house i have heard far thinner stories from much older men  he with an air of great surprise do you mean to imply that you dont believe me  her husband do you expect me to believe you  he why not i dont understand  her husband come dont underrate your own cleverness apjohn i think you understand pretty well  he i assure you i am quite at a loss can you not be a little more explicit  her husband dont overdo it old chap however i will just be so far explicit as to say that if you think these poems read as if they were addressed not to a live woman but to a shivering cold time of day at which you were never out of bed in your life you hardly do justice to your own literary powerswhich i admire and appreciate mind you as much as any man come own up you wrote those poems to my wife an internal struggle prevents henry from answering of course you did he throws the poems on the table and goes to the hearthrug where he plants himself solidly chuckling a little and waiting for the next move  he formally and carefully mr bompas i pledge you my word you are mistaken i need not tell you that mrs bompas is a lady of stainless honor who has never cast an unworthy thought on me the fact that she has shown you my poems  her husband thats not a fact i came by them without her knowledge she didnt show them to me  he does not that prove their perfect innocence she would have shown them to you at once if she had taken your quite unfounded view of them  her husband shaken apjohn play fair dont abuse your intellectual gifts do you really mean that i am making a fool of myself  he earnestly believe me you are i assure you on my honor as a gentleman that i have never had the slightest feeling for mrs bompas beyond the ordinary esteem and regard of a pleasant acquaintance  her husband shortly showing ill humor for the first time oh indeed he leaves his hearth and begins to approach henry slowly looking him up and down with growing resentment  he hastening to improve the impression made by his mendacity i should never have dreamt of writing poems to her the thing is absurd  her husband reddening ominously why is it absurd  he shrugging his shoulders well it happens that i do not admire mrs bompasin that way  her husband breaking out in henrys face let me tell you that mrs bompas has been admired by better men than you you soapy headed little puppy you  he much taken aback there is no need to insult me like this i assure you on my honor as a  her husband too angry to tolerate a reply and boring henry more and more towards the piano you dont admire mrs bompas you would never dream of writing poems to mrs bompas my wifes not good enough for you isnt she fiercely who are you pray that you should be so jolly superior  he mr bompas i can make allowances for your jealousy  her husband jealousy do you suppose im jealous of you no nor of ten like you but if you think ill stand here and let you insult my wife in her own house youre mistaken  he very uncomfortable with his back against the piano and teddy standing over him threateningly how can i convince you be reasonable i tell you my relations with mrs bompas are relations of perfect coldnessof indifference  her husband scornfully say it again say it again youre proud of it arent you yah youre not worth kicking  henry suddenly executes the feat known to pugilists as dipping and changes sides with teddy who it now between henry and the piano  he look here im not going to stand this  her husband oh you have some blood in your body after all good job  he this is ridiculous i assure you mrs bompas is quite  her husband what is mrs bompas to you id like to know ill tell you what mrs bompas is shes the smartest woman in the smartest set in south kensington and the handsomest and the cleverest and the most fetching to experienced men who know a good thing when they see it whatever she may be to conceited pennyalining puppies who think nothing good enough for them its admitted by the best people and not to know it argues yourself unknown three of our first actormanagers have offered her a hundred a week if shed go on the stage when they start a repertory theatre and i think they know what theyre about as well as you the only member of the present cabinet that you might call a handsome man has neglected the business of the country to dance with her though he dont belong to our set as a regular thing one of the first professional poets in bedford park wrote a sonnet to her worth all your amateur trash at ascot last season the eldest son of a duke excused himself from calling on me on the ground that his feelings for mrs bompas were not consistent with his duty to me as host and it did him honor and me too but with gathering fury she isnt good enough for you it seems you regard her with coldness with indifference and you have the cool cheek to tell me so to my face for two pins id flatten your nose in to teach you manners introducing a fine woman to you is casting pearls before swine yelling at him before swine dye hear  he with a deplorable lack of polish you call me a swine again and ill land you one on the chin thatll make your head sing for a week  her husband exploding what  he charges at henry with bulllike fury henry places himself on guard in the manner of a well taught boxer and gets away smartly but unfortunately forgets the stool which is just behind him he falls backwards over it unintentionally pushing it against the shins of bompas who falls forward over it mrs bompas with a scream rushes into the room between the sprawling champions and sits down on the floor in order to get her right arm round her husbands neck  she you shant teddy you shant you will be killed he is a prizefighter  her husband vengefully ill prizefight him he struggles vainly to free himself from her embrace  she henry dont let him fight you promise me that you wont  he ruefully i have got a most frightful bump on the back of my head he tries to rise  she reaching out her left hand to seize his coat tail and pulling him down again whilst keeping fast hold of teddy with the other hand not until you have promised not until you both have promised teddy tries to rise she pulls him back again teddy you promise dont you yes yes be good you promise  her husband i wont unless he takes it back  she he will he does you take it back henryyes

up now wont you shake hands and be good  he recklessly i shall do nothing of the sort i have steeped myself in lies for your sake and the only reward i get is a lump on the back of my head the size of an apple now i will go back to the straight path  she henry for heavens sake  he its no use your husband is a fool and a brute  her husband whats that you say  he i say you are a fool and a brute and if youll step outside with me ill say it again teddy begins to take off his coat for combat those poems were written to your wife every word of them and to nobody else the scowl clears away from bompass countenance radiant he replaces his coat i wrote them because i loved her i thought her the most beautiful woman in the world and i told her so over and over again i adored her do you hear i told her that you were a sordid commercial chump utterly unworthy of her and so you are  her husband so gratified he can hardly believe his ears you dont mean it  he yes i do mean it and a lot more too i asked mrs bompas to walk out of the house with meto leave youto get divorced from you and marry me i begged and implored her to do it this very night it was her refusal that ended everything between us looking very disparagingly at him what she can see in you goodness only knows  her husband beaming with remorse my dear chap why didnt you say so before i apologize come dont bear malice shake hands make him shake hands rory  she for my sake henry after all hes my husband forgive him take his hand henry dazed lets her take his hand and place it in teddys  her husband shaking it
