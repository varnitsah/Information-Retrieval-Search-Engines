88607802	my young alcides  a faded photograph   by  charlotte m yonge     preface   ideas have a tyrannous power of insisting on being worked out even when one fears they may be leading in a track already worthily preoccupied  but the hercules myth did not seem to me to be like one of the fairy tales that we have seen so gracefully and quaintly modernised and at the risk of seeming to travestie the farnese statue in a shootingcoat and wideawake i could not help going on as the notion grew deeper and more engrossing  for whether the origin of the myth be or be not founded on solar phenomena the yearning greek mind formed on it an unconscious allegory of the course of the victor of whom the sun rejoicing as a giant to run his course is another type like samson of old since the facts of nature and of history are divine parables  and as each ones conquest is in the track of his leader the only true conqueror so hercules in spite of all the grotesque adjuncts that the lower inventions of the heathen hung round him is a far closer likeness of manhoodas indeed the proverbial use of some of his tasks testifiesand of repentant man conquering himself  the great crime after which his life was a bondage of expiation the choice between virtue and vice the slain passion the hundredheaded sin for ever cropping up again the winning of the sacred emblem of puritythen the subduing of greed the cleansing of longneglected uncleanness the silencing of foul tongues the remarkable contest with the creature which had become a foe because after being devoted for sacrifice it was spared the obtaining the girdle of strength the recovery of the spoil from the threefold enemy the gaining of the fruit of life immediately followed by the victory over the hellhound of death and lastly the attainment of immortalityall seem no fortuitous imagination but one of those when thoughts beyond their thoughts to those old bards were given  i have not followed all these meanings for this is not an allegory but a mere distant following rather of the spirit than the letter of the old greek tale of the twelve tasks  neither have i adhered to every incident of hercules life and the most touching and beautiful of allthe rescue of alcestis would hardly bear to come in merely as an episode in this weak and presumptuous endeavour to show that the halfdivine patient conqueror is not merely a classic invention but that he and his labours belong in some form or other to all times and all surroundings                                                  c m yonge nov 8 1875     contents

one of the children brought me a photograph album long ago finished and closed and showed me a faded and blurred figure over which there had been a little dispute  was it hercules with club and lionskin or was it a gentleman i had known  ah me how soon a mans place knoweth him no more  what fresh recollections that majestic form awoke in methe massive features with the steadfast eye and low square brow curled over with short rings of hair the mouth that through the thick short beard still invited trust and reliance even while there was a look of fire and determination that inspired dread  the thing seemed to us hideous and absurd when it was taken by miss horsman  i hated it and hid it away as a caricature  but now those pale vanishing tints bring the very presence before me and before the remembrance can become equally obscure in my own mind let me record for others the years that i spent with my young alcides as he now stands before me in memory  our family history is a strange one  i lucy alison never even saw my twin brothersnor indeed knew of their existenceduring my childhood  i had one brother a year younger than myself and as long as he lived he was treated as the eldest son and neither he nor i ever dreamed that my father had had a first wife and two sons  he was a feeble broken man who seemed to my young fancy so old that in after times it was always a shock to me to read on his tablet percy alison aged fiftyseven and i was but seven years old when he died under the final blow of the loss of my little brother percy from measles  the dear old placehouse with five gables on the garden front black timbered and with white plaster between and oh such flowers in the gardenwas left to my mother for her life and she was a great deal younger than my father so we went on living there and it was only when i was almost a woman that i came to the knowledge that the property would never be mine but would go in the male line to the son of one of my disinherited convict brothers  the story as my mother knew it was this their names were ambrose and eustace there was very little interval between their births and there had been some confusion between them during the first few hours of their lives so that the question of seniority was never entirely clear though ambrose was so completely the leader and master that he was always looked upon as the elder  in their early youth they were led away by a man of polish extraction though a british subject one count prometesky who had thrown himself into every revolutionary movement on the continent had fought under kosciusko in poland joined the carbonari in italy and at last escaped with health damaged by a wound to teach languages and military drawing in england and unhappily to spread his principles among his pupils during the excitement connected with the reform bill under his teaching my poor brothers became such democrats that they actually married the two daughters of a man from cumberland named lewthwayte whom lord erymanth had turned out of one of his farms for his insolence and radicalism and not long after they were engaged in the agricultural riots drilling the peasants making inflammatory speeches and doing all they could to bring on a revolution  dreadful harm was done on the erymanth estate and the farm from which lewthwayte had been expelled suffered especially the whole of the ricks and buildings being burnt down though the family of the occupant was saved partly by prometeskys exertions  when the troops came both he and my brothers were taken with arms in their hands they were tried by the special commission and sentenced to death  lewthwayte and his son were actually hung but there was great interest made for ambrose and eustace and in consideration of their early youth they were not twentytwo their sentence was commuted to transportation for life and so was prometeskys because he was half a foreigner and because he was proved to have saved life  my father would not see them again but he offered their wives a passage out to join them and wanted to have had their two babies left with him but the two young women refused to part with them and it was after that that he married again meaning to cast them off for ever though as long as their time of servitude lasted he sent the wives an allowance and as soon as his sons could hold property he gave them a handsome sum with which to set themselves up in a large farm in the bush  and when little percy died he wanted again to have his eldest grandson sent home to him and was very much wounded by the refusal which came only just before his death  his will had left the estate to the grandson as the right heir  everyone looked on it as a bad prospect but no one thought of the convict boy as in the immediate future as my mother was still quite a young woman  but when i was just threeandtwenty an attack of diphtheria broke out my mother and i both caught it and alas i alone recovered the illness was very long with me partly from my desolateness and grief for tender as my kind old servants were and good as were my friends and neighbours they could only make me feel what they were not  our old lawyer mr prosser had written to my nephew for we knew that both the poor brothers were dead but he assured me that i might safely stay on at the old place for it would be eight months before his letter could be answered and the heir could not come for a long time after  i was very glad to linger on for i clung to the home and looked at every bush and flower blossoming for the last time almost as if i were dying and leaving them to a sort of fiend  my mothers old friends lady diana tracy and lord erymanth her brother used to bemoan with me the coming of this lad born of a plebeian mother bred up in a penal colony and no doubt uneducated except in its coarsest vices  lord erymanth told at endless length all the advice he had given my father in vain and bewailed the sense of justice that had bequeathed the property to such a male heir as could not fail to be a scourge to the country  everyone had some story to tell of ambroses fiery speeches and insubordinate actions viewing eustace as not so bad because his mere satelliteand what must not their sons be  the only person who had any feeling of pity or affection for them was old miss woolmer  she was the daughter of a former clergyman of mycening the little town which is almost at our parkgates  she was always confined to the house by rheumaticgout  she had grown up with my brothers  i sometimes wondered if she had not had a little tenderness for one of them but i believe it was almost eldersisterly she told me much in their excuse  my father had never been the fond indulgent father to them that i remembered him but a strict stern authority when he was at home and when he was absent leaving them far too much to their own devices while prometesky was a very attractive person brilliant accomplished full of fire and of faith in his theories of universal benevolence and emancipation  she thought if the times had not been such as to bring them into action ambrose would have outgrown and modified all that was dangerous in his theories and that they would have remained mere talk the ebullition of his form of knighterrantry for it was generous indignation and ardour that chiefly led him astray and eustace was always his double but there were some incidents at the time which roused him to fury  lewthwayte was a cumberland man who had inherited the stock and the last years of a lease of a farm on lord erymanths property he had done a good deal for it and expended money on the understanding that he should have the lease renewed but he was a man of bold independent northern tongue and gave great offence to his lordship who was used to be listened to with a sort of feudal deference  he was of the fierce old norse blood and his daughters were tall fair magnificent young women not at all uneducated nor vulgar and it was the finding that my brothers were becoming intimate at his farm that made lord erymanth refuse to renew the lease and turn the family out so harshly and with as little notice as possible  the cruelty as they thought it was miss woolmer said most illjudged and precipitated the very thing that was dreaded  the youths rushed into the marriage with the daughters and cast in their lot with all that could overturn the existing order of things but miss woolmer did not believe they had had anything to do with the rickburning or machinebreaking  all that was taken out of their hands by more brutal ignorant demagogues  they were mere visionaries and enthusiasts according to her and she said the two wives were very noblelooking highspirited young women  she had gone to see them several times when their husbands were in prison and had been much struck with alice ambroses wife who held up most bravely though dorothy poor thing was prostrated and indeed her child was born in the height of the distress when his father had just been tried for his life and sentenced to death  it was their birth and education that caused them to be treated so severely besides there was no doubt of their having harangued the people and stirred them up and they were seen as well as prometesky at the fire at what had been lewthwaytes farm at least so it was declared by men who turned kings evidence and the proof to the contrary broke down because it depended on the wives whose evidence was not admissible indeed thatas the law then stoodwas not the question  those who had raised the storm were responsible for all that was done in it and it was very barely that their lives were spared  that was the comfort miss woolmer gave  no one else could see any at all except a few old women in the parish who spoke tenderly of poor mr ambrose and mr eustace but then they had sons or brothers who had been out with the rioters and after these twentysix years no one remembered the outrages and terrors of the time with anything but horror and the coming of the wild lad from the bush was looked on as the end of all comfort  i meant as soon as i heard he was on the way to leave arghouse make visits among friends and decide on my future home for alas there was no one who wanted me  i was quite alone in the world my mothers cousins were not near and i hardly knew them and my only relations were the bushrangers as lady diana tracy called them  she was sister to lord erymanth and widow to an irish gentleman and had settled in the next parish to us with her children on the death of her husband  her little daughter viola had been spending the day with me and it was a lovely spring evening when we sat on the lawn wondering whether i should ever care for anything so much as for those long shadows from the fir woods upon the sloping field with the long grass rippling in the wind and the border of primroses round the edge of the wood  we heard wheels and thought it was the carriage come for viola much too soon when out ran one of the maids crying oh miss alison he is come  theres ever so many of them  i believe we caught hold of one another in our fright and were almost surprised when outstripping lame old richardson as he announced mr alison there came only three persons  they were the two tallest men i had ever seen and a little girl of eight years old  i found my hand in a very large one and with the words are you my aunt lucy  i was as it were gathered up and kissed  the voice somehow carried a comfortable feeling in the kindness of its power and depth and though it was a mouth bristly with yellow bristles such as had never touched me before the honest friendly eyes gave me an indescribable feeling of belonging to somebody and of having ceased to be alone in the world  here is eustace he said and little dora putting the child forward as she backed against him most unwilling to let me kiss her and i did not know i had another aunt  no i said starting between for what would lady dianas feelings have been if viola had carried home an australian kiss  this is miss tracy  violas carriage was now actually coming and as i went into the house with her she held me whispering to me to come home at once with her but i told her i could not leave them in that way and they were really my nephews  you are not afraid she said  what do you think he could do to me i asked laughing  he is so big said viola  i never saw any one so big but i think he is like coeur de lion  ah  we both shrieked for a most uncanny monster was rearing up in front of us hopping about the hall as far as was allowed by the chain that fastened it to the leg of a table  mr alison brought it maam said richardson in a tone of disgust and horror  will you have the carriage out miss alison and go down to the wyvern  shuh you brute  he shant hurt you my dear ladies ill stand between  we had recovered our senses however enough to see that it was only a harmless kangaroo and dora came running out followed by harold caressing the beast calling it poor nanny and asking where he should shut it up for the night  i suggested an outhouse and we conducted the creature thither in procession hearing by the way that the kangaroos mother had been shot and that the animal itself then very young and no bigger than a cat had taken harolds open shirt front for her pouch and leaped into his bosom and that it had been brought up to its present stature tame at boola boola  viola went with us fed the kangaroo and was so much interested and delighted that she could hardly go away eustace making her a most elaborate and rather absurd bow being evidently much impressed by the carriage and liveried servants who were waiting for her  like the governors lady he said  and i know for ive been to a ball at government house  he plainly cared much more for appearances than did harold  he was not so tall much slighter with darker hair rather too shiny and a neatly turned up moustache a gorgeous tie and watch chain a brilliant breast pin a more brilliant ring and a general air that made me conclude that he regarded himself as a sydney beau  but harold in his loose rough grey suit was very different  his height was extraordinary his breadth of chest and shoulder equally gigantic though well proportioned and with a look of easy strength and as viola had said his head was very much what one knows as the lion hearts not marochettis trim carpet knight but vertues rugged portrait from the monument at fontevrand  there was the same massive breadth of feature large yet not heavy being relieved by the exceeding keenness and quickness of the light but very blue eyes which seemed to see everywhere round in a moment as men do in wild countries  the short thick yellow curly beard and moustache veiled the lower part of the face but the general expression when still was decidedly a sad one though a word or a trick of doras would call up a smile all over the browned cheeks and bright eyes  his form and colouring must have come from the cumberland statesman but people said his voice and expression had much of his father in them and no one could think him ungentlemanly though he was not like any english gentleman  he wore no gaieties like eustace the handkerchief loosely knotted round his neck sailor fashion was plain black and he had a gold ring on his little finger  dora had the same yellow curly hair in tight frizzly rings all over her head like a boys a light complexion and blue eyes in a round pugnosed face and she hung so entirely on harold that i never doubted that she was his sister till as we were sitting down to eat i said cant you come a little way from your brother  eustace gave his odd little giggle and said there dora  im not his sisterim his wife  there and eustace giggled again and ordered her away but i saw harolds brow knit with pain and as she began to reiterate her assertion and resist eustace he gently sat her down on the chair near at hand and silently made her understand that she was to stay there but eustace rather teasingly said  aunt lucy will teach you manners dora  she is my sister and we have brought her home to send her to school  i wont go to school said dora harold would not  you wont get away like him returned eustace in the same tone  yes i shall  ill lick all the girls she returned clenching a pair of red mottled fists that looked very capable  for shame dora said the low voice  harold did said she looking up at me triumphantly he beat all the boys and had to come back again to boola boola  i longed to understand more but i was ashamed to betray my ignorance of my near relations for i did not even know whether their mothers were alive but i saw that if i only listened eustace would soon tell everything  he had a runaway chin and his mouth had a look at times that made me doubt whether there were not some slight want in his intellect or at least weakness of character  however i was relieved from the fear of the vice with which the neighbourhood had threatened us for neither of them would touch wine or beer but begged for tea and drank oceans of it  we had not long finished when richardson brought me a note from lady diana tracy saying she had sent the carriage for me that i might at once take refuge from this unforeseen invasion  i felt it out of all possibility that i should thus run away and yet i knew i owed an apology for harolds finding me and the old servants in possession so i began to say that my old friend had sent the carriage for mei had been taken by surprise their journey one of the first across the isthmus had been so much quicker than i had expected or i should have left the house free for them  why asked harold  and when i answered that the place was his and i had no business there he did not seem to see it  it is your home he said you have always lived here  i began explaining that this was no reason at all but he would not hear of my going away and declared that it was i who belonged to the place so that i confessed that i should be very thankful to stay a little while  not only a little while he said it is your home as much as ever and the best thing in the world for us  yes yes responded eustace we kept on wondering what aunt lucy would be like and never thought she could be such a nice young lady  not realising that your aunt is younger than yourselves i said  no said eustace the old folk never would talk of homemy father did not like it you seeand aunt alice had moved off to new zealand so that we could not go and talk about it to her  mr smith has got a school in auckland you know  i did not know but i found that a year or two after the death of my brother ambrose his widow had become the second wife of the master of a boardingschool at sydney and that it was there that harold at ten years old had fought all the boys including the stepchildren and had been so audacious and uncontrollable that she had been forced to return him to his uncle and aunt in the bush  eustace had been with the smiths at sydney until her move to auckland he had even been presented and had been to a ball at government house and thus was viewed as the polished member of the family though if he had come as master i should never have been drawn as i was by harolds free kindly simplicity into writing my thanks to lady diana and saying that i could not leave my nephews so abruptly especially as they had brought a little sister  it was gratifying to see that harold was uneasy till the note was sent off and the carriage dismissed you are not going he said as persuasively as if he were speaking to dora and i strove to make a wise and prudent answer about remaining for the next few days and settling the rest when he had made his plans  then i proposed to take dora up to bed but though manifestly very weary the child refused and when her brother tried to order her she ran between harolds knees and there tossed her head and glared at me he lifted her on his lap and she drew his arm round her in defence eustace said he spoilt her but he still held her and as she dropped asleep against his breast eustace related almost in a tone of complaint that she had cared for no one else ever since the time she had been lost in the bush and harold had found her after three days in the last stage of exhaustion since which time she had had neither eyes ears nor allegiance for any other creature but that she must be taught something and made into a lady  harold gazed down on her with his strange soft melancholy smile somehow seeming to vex eustace who accused him of not caring how rough and uncultivated she was nor himself either  we leave the polish to you said harold  why yes said eustace simpering my uncle smith gave me the first advantages in sydney and everyone knew my father was a gentleman  harold bit the hair that hung over his lip and i guessed what i afterwards found to be the truth that his stepfather was no small trial to him being in fact an unprosperous tutor and hangeron on some noblemans family finally sent out by his patrons in despair to keep school in sydney  poor ambrose had died of lockjaw from a cut from an axe very soon after his emancipation just as his energy was getting the farm into order and making things look well with the family and after a year or two alice deceived by the mans air and manners and hoping to secure education for her son had married and the effect had been that while harold was provoked into fierce insubordination eustace became imbued with a tufthunting spirit a great contrast to what might have been expected from his antecedents  i cannot tell whether i found this out the first evening or only gradually discovered it with much besides  i only remember that when at last harold carried dora upstairs fast asleep and my maid colman and i had undressed her and put her into a little bed in a room opening out of mine i went to rest feeling rejoiced that the suspense was over and i knew the worst  i felt rather as if i had a magnificent wild beast in the house and yet there was a wonderful attraction partly from the drawing of kindred blood and partly from the strength and sweetness of harolds own face and auntlike i could not help feeling proud of having such a grand creature belonging to me though there might be a little dread of what he would do next  in the morning all seemed like a dream for dora had vanished leaving no trace but her black bag but while i was dressing a tremendous cackling among my bantams caused me to look out when i beheld them scurrying right and left at sight of the kangaroo leaping after the three strangers and my cat on the top of the garden wall on tiptoe with arched back bristling tail and glassy eyes viewing the beast as the vengeful apotheosis of all the rats and mice she had slaughtered in her time  from the stairs i heard dora scouting her brothers orders to tidy herself for breakfast adding that harry never did to which he merely replied i shall now  come  there was a sound of hoisting that gave me warning rather fortunately for he came striding upstairs with that great wellgrown girl of eight perched on his shoulder as if she had been a baby and would have run me down if i had not avoided into the nook on the landing  all that day and the next those three were out i never saw them but at meals when they came in full of eager questions and comments on their discoveries in farming and other matters  these were the early bright days of spring and they were out till after dark only returning to eat and go to bed  i found the fascination of harolds presence was on all the servants and dependents except perhaps our bailiff bullock who disliked him from the first  all the others declared that they had no doubt about staying on now that they saw what the young squire really was  it made a great impression on them that when in some farmyard arrangements there was a moments danger of a faggot pile falling he put his shoulder against it and propped the whole weight without effort  his manhood strength and knowledge of work delighted them and they declared already that he would be a good friend to the poor  i confess that here lay what alarmed me  he was always given to few words but i could see that he was shocked at the contrast between our poor and the australian settlers where food and space were plenty and the wages high  i was somewhat hurt at his way of viewing what had always seemed to me perfection at least all that could be reasonably expected for the poorour pet school our old women our civil dependents in tidy cottages our picturesque lodges and i did not half like his trenchant questions which seemed to imply censure on all that i had hitherto thought unquestionable and perhaps i told him somewhat impatiently that when he had been a little longer here he would understand our ways and fall naturally into them  thats just what i dont want he said  not want i exclaimed  yes i want to see clearly before i get used to things  and as perhaps i seemed to wonder at this way of beginning he opened a little and said it is my father  he told me that if ever i came here i was to mind and do his work  what kind of work i asked anxiously  doing what he meant to have done returned harold for the poor he said i should find out about it  you must have been too young to understand much of what he meant then i said  did he not regret anything  yes he said he had begun at the wrong end when they were not ripe for it and that the failure had ruined him for trying again  then he did see things differently at last i said hoping to find that the sentiments i had always heard condemned had not been perpetuated  oh yes cried eustace  they were just brutes you know that nobody could do any good to and were only bent on destroying and had no gratitude nor sense and that was the ruin of him and of my father too  they were ignorant and easily maddened said harold gravely he did not know how little they could be controlled  i must find out the true state of things  prometesky said i must read it up  prometesky i cried in despair  oh harold you have not been influenced by that old firebrand  he taught me almost all i know was the answer still much to my dismay but i showed harold to the library and directed him to some old books of my fathers which i fancied might enlighten him on the subjects on which he needed information though i feared they might be rather out of date and whenever he was not out of doors he was reading them sometimes running his fingers through his yellow hair or pulling his beard and growling to himself when he was puzzled or met with what he did not like  eustaces favourite study meanwhile was burkes peerage and his questions nearly drove me wild by their absurdity and dora rolled on the floor with my spitz dog for she loathed the doll i gave her and made me more afraid of her than of either of the others  harold was all might and gentleness eustace viewed me as a glass of fashion and directory of english life and manners but i saw they both looked to me not only to make their home but to tame their little wild cat of a child and that was enough to make her hate and distrust me moreover she had a gleam of jealousy not far from fierce in her wild blue eyes if she saw harold turn affectionately to me and she always protested sullenly against the next week when i was to begin her education  she could only read words of four letters and could not or would not work a stitch  harold had done all her mending  on the second day i passed by the open door of his room and saw him at work on a great rectangular rent in her frock  i could not help stopping to suggest that colman or i might save him that trouble whereupon dora slammed the door in my face  harold opened it again at once saying you ought to beg aunt lucys pardon and when no apology could be extracted from her and with thanks he handed over the little dress to me she gave a shriek of anger she hardly ever shed tears and snatched it from me again  well well said harold patting her curly head ill finish this time but not again dora  next time aunt lucy will be so good as to see to it  after old bettys eyes grew bad we had to do our own needling  i confess it was a wonderful performancequite as neat as colman could have made it and i suspect that harold did not refrain from producing needle and thread from his fat miscellaneous pocketbook and repairing her many disasters before they reached the domestic eye for there was a chronic feud between dora and colman and the attempts of the latter to make the child more like a young lady were passionately repelled though she would better endure those of a rough little underhousemaid whose civilisation was i suppose not quite so far removed from her own  on sunday she and harold disappeared as soon as breakfast was over and only eustace remained spruce beyond all imagination and giving himself childlike credit for not being with them but when at church i cant say much for his behaviour  he stared unblushingly whispered remarks and inquiries could not find the places in his book and appeared incapable of kneeling  our little church at arghouse was then a chapelry with merely sunday morning service by a curate from mycening and the congregation a village one to the disgust of eustace who had expected to review his neighbours and thought his getup thrown away  no one at all to see he observed with discontent over our luncheon harold and dora having returned from roaming over kalydon moor  i go to afternoon service at mycening harold i said  will not you come with me  there will be somebody there asked eustace to which i replied in the affirmative but with some protest against his view of the object and inviting the others again but dora defiantly answered that harold was going to swing her on the ash tree  you ought to appear at church harry said eustace  it is expected of an english squire  you see everybody and everybody sees you  well then go said harold  and wont you i entreated  ive promised to swing dora he answered strolling out of the room much to my concern and though eustace did accompany me it was so evidently for the sake of staring that there was little comfort in that and it was only by very severe looks that i could keep him from asking everyones name  i hoped to make every one understand that he was not the squire but no one came across us as we went out of church and i had to reply to his torrent of inquiries all the way home  it was a wet evening and we all stayed in the house  harold brought in one of his political economy studies from the library and i tried to wile dora to look at the pictures in a curious big old dutch scripture history the sunday delight of our youth  eustace came too as if he wanted the amusement and yet was ashamed to take it when he exclaimed i say harry isnt this the book father used to tell us aboutthat they used to look over  harold came and stood towering above us with his hands in his pockets but when we came to the temptation of eve dora broke out into an exclamation that excited my curiosity too much not to be pursued though it was hardly edifying  was that such a snake as harold killed  i have killed a good many snakes he answered  yes but i meant the ones you killed when you were a little tiny boy  i dont remember he said as if to stop the subject hating as he always did to talk about himself  no i know you dont said dora but it is quite true isnt it eustace  hardly true that harold ever was a little tiny boy i could not help saying  no he never was little said eustace  but it is quite true about the snakes  i seem to remember it now and ive often heard my mother and my aunt alice tell of it  it was at the first place where we were in new south wales  i came running out screaming i believei was old enough to know the dangerand when they went in there was harry sitting on the floor holding a snake tight by the neck and enjoying its contortions like a new toy  of course said harold if it were poisonous which i doubt the danger would have been when i let go  my mother quietly bade me hold him tight which i suppose i had just sense enough to do and in another moment she had snatched up the billhook they had been cutting wood with and had his head off  she had the pluck  i could but gasp with horror and ask how old he was  about two that was clear to their minds from the place where it happened which harold could not recollect though eustace could  but harold you surely are the eldest i said  oh no i am six months the eldest said eustace proud of his advantage  we were to hear more of that byandby  monday afternoon brought mr prosser who was closeted with harold while eustace and i devoted our faculties to pacifying dora under her exclusion and preventing her from climbing up to the windowsill to gaze into the library from without  she scorned submission to either of us so eustace kept guard by lying on the grass below and i coaxed her by gathering primroses sowing seeds and using all inducements i could think of but my resources were nearly exhausted when harolds head appeared at the window and he called eustace lucy here  we came at once dora before us  come in said harold admitting us at the glass door  it is all a mistake  i am not the man  it is eustace  eu i wish you joy old chap  mr prosser was at the table with a great will lying spread out on it i am afraid mr alison is right miss alison he said  the property is bequeathed to the eldest of the late mr alisons grandsons born here not specifying by which father  if i had copied the terms of the will i might have prevented disappointment but i had no conception of what he tells me  but ambrose was harolds father i exclaimed in bewilderment and he was the eldest  the seniority was not considered as certain said mr prosser and therefore the late mr alison left the property to the eldest child born at home  let us at least have an englishborn heir i remember he said to me  and that is just what i am not said harold  i cannot understand  i have heard miss woolmer talk of poor ambroses beautiful child several months older than eustaces and his name was harold  yes said harold but that one died on the voyage out an hour or two before i was born  he was harold stanislas  i have no second name  and i always was the eldest reiterated eustace hardly yet understanding what it involved  all the needful documents had been preserved and brought home  there was the extract from the captains log recording the burial at sea of harold stanislas alison aged fifteen months and the certificate of baptism by a colonial clergyman of harold son of ambrose and alice alison while eustace was entered in the northchester register having been born in lodgings as mr prosser well recollected while his poor young father lay under sentence of death  it burst on him at last  do you mean that i have got it and not you  thats about it said harold  never mind eu it will all come to the same thing in the end  you have none of it  not an acre  it all goes together but dont look at me in that way theres boola boola you know  youre not going back there to leave me exclaimed eustace with a real sound of dismay laying hold of his arm  not just yet at any rate said harold  no no nor at all reiterated eustace and then satisfied by the absence of contradiction which did in fact mean a good deal from the silent harold he began to discover his own accession of dignity then it all belongs to me  i am master  i am squireeustace alison esquire of arghouse  how well it sounds  doesnt it harry doesnt it lucy  uncle smith always said i was the one cut out for high life besides ive been presented and have been to a ball at government house  i saw that mr prosser was a little overcome with amusement and i wanted to make my retreat and carry off dora but she had perched on her favourite postharolds kneeand i was also needed to witness eustaces signatures as well as on some matters connected with my own property  so i stayed and saw that he did indeed seem lost without his cousins help  neither knew anything about business of this kind but harold readily understood what made eustace so confused that he was quite helpless without harolds explanations and rather rough directions what he was to do  how like themselves their writing was eustaces neat and clerkly but weak and illegible and harolds as distinct and almost as large as a schoolboys copy but with squareturned joints and strength of limb unlike any boys writing  the dressingbell broke up the council and harold snatched up his hat to rush out and stretch his legs but i could not help detaining him to say  oh harry i am so sorry  why he said  what does it leave you harry  half the capital stock farm twelve thousand sheep and a tidy sum in the sydney bank said harold readily  then i am afraid we shall lose you  that depends  i shall set eustace in the way of doing what our fathers meant and theres prometeskyi shall not go till i have done his business  i hardly knew what this meant and could not keep harold whose long legs were eager for a rush in the fresh air and the next person i met was eustace  aunt lucy he said that old fellow says you are going away  you cant be  i answered truly enough that i had not thought what to do and he persisted that i had promised to stay  but that was with harry i said  i dont see why you should not stay as much with me he said im your nephew all the same and dora is your niece and she must be made a proper sister for me who have been c  i dont know that this form of invitation was exactly the thing that would have kept me but i had a general feeling that to leave these young men and my old home would be utter banishment that there was nothing i so cared for as seeing how they got on and that it was worth anything to me to be wanted anywhere and by anyone so i gave eustace to understand that i meant to stay  i rather wished harold to have pressed me but i believe the dear good fellow honestly thought everyone must prefer eustace to himself and it was good to see the pat he gave his cousins shoulder when that young gentleman nothing loath exultingly settled down in the masters place  before long i found out what harold meant about prometeskys business for we had scarcely begun dinner before he began to consult mr prosser about the ways and means of obtaining a pardon for prometesky  this considerably startled mr prosser  some cabinets he said were very lenient to past political offences but prometesky seemed to him to have exceeded all bounds of mercy  you never knew the true facts then said harold  i know the facts that satisfied the jury  you never saw my fathers statement  no mr prosser had been elsewhere and had not been employed in my brothers trial he had only inherited the connection with our family affairs when the matter had passed into comparative oblivion  my brothers had never ceased to affirm that he had only started for the farm that had been lewthwaytes on hearing that an attack was to be made on it in hopes of preventing it and that the witness borne against him on the trial by a fellow who had turned kings evidence had been false but they had been unheeded or rather prometesky was regarded as the most truly mischievous of all as perhaps he really had been since he had certainly drawn them into the affair and his life had barely been saved in consideration of his having rescued a child from the fire at great personal peril  ambrose had written again and again about him to my father but as soon as the name occurred the letter had been torn up  on their liberation from actual servitude they had sent up their statement to the government of new south wales but in the meantime prometesky had fared much worse than they had  they had been placed in hands where their education superiority and good conduct had gained them trust and respect and they had quickly obtained a remission of the severer part of their sentence and become their own masters indeed if ambrose had lived he would soon have risen to eminence in the colony  but prometesky had fallen to the lot of a harsh rude master who hated him as a foreigner and treated him in a manner that roused the proud spirit of the noble  the master had sworn that the convict had threatened his life and years of working in chains on the roads had been the consequence  it was no time for entertaining a petition on his account and before the expiration of this additional sentence ambrose was dead  by that time eustace now a rich and prosperous man would gladly have taken his old tutor to his home but prometesky was still too proud and all that he would do was to build a little hut under a rock on the boola boola grounds where he lived upon the proceeds of such joiners and watchmakers work as was needed by the settlers on a large area when things were much rougher than even when my nephews came home  no one cared for education enough to make his gifts available in that direction except as concerned harold who had in fact learnt of him almost all he knew in an irregular voluntary sort of fashion and who loved him heartily  his health was failing now and to bring him home was one of harolds prime objects since london advice might yet restore him  harold had made one attempt in his cause at sydney sending in a copy of his fathers dying statement also signed by his uncle but though he was told that it had been received he had no encouragement to hope it would be forwarded and had been told that to apply direct to the secretary of state backed by persons from our own neighbourhood would be the best chance and on this he consulted mr prosser but without meeting much sympathy  mr prosser said many peoples minds had changed with regard to english or irish demagogues and that the alison brothers themselves might very probably have been pardoned but everyone was tired of poles and popular tradition viewed prometesky as the ogre of the past  mr prosser did not seem as if he would even very willingly assist in the drawing up in due form a petition in the poles favour and declared that without some influential person to introduce it it would be perfectly useless  eustace turned round with there you see harold nothing can be done  i do not see that said harold in his quiet way  you do not mean to do anything  yes i do  but whatwhat  what can you do  i do not yet know  you see it is of no use  we shall only get into a scrape with all the gentlemen of the county  never mind now eustace said harold briefly  but i knew the expression of his face by this time quite well enough to be certain that nothing would make him abandon the cause of his fathers old friend and that his silence was full of the strongest determination i think it fascinated me and though in my cooler senses i reverted to my old notion of prometesky as a dangerous firebrand i could not help feeling for and with the youth whose soul was set on delivering his friend from exile  my turn came the next morning before mr prosser went away  he had much to say against my making arghouse my home telling me that i had a full independence and could live where i pleased but that i knew already and had decided on the amount i ought to pay towards the housekeeping  then he wanted me to understand how the young men were looked upon and the dread all the neighbourhood had of them  i said i had shared this dread but on better acquaintance i found it quite undeserved and this being the case it was incumbent on their only relation to stand by them and not shun them as if they had brought the leprosy  this he allowed calling it a generous feeling if they were worthy of it  but what greatly amazed me was his rejoicing that eustace had proved to be the heir since nothing was known against him and when the other young man was gone there was hope that any little distrusts might be allayed and that he might ultimately take his place in the county  the other young man  why should there be any distrust of harold  i grew hot and indignant and insisted on knowing what was meant but mr prosser declared that he knew nothing only there were vague reports which made him rejoice that mr harold alison was not called to be the manager of the property and would make him question whether a young lady would find it expedient to be long an inmate of the same house  what reports could he mean  noi could get no more out of him he was too cautious to commit himself and seemed to be satisfied by observing that if i changed my mind i could at any time leave my nephews  her nephews i heard him mutter to himself yes her nephews no one has any right to object and she can but judge for herselftheres no harm done  i shall always believe however that he set on my friends to remonstrate for letters began coming in in all the senses of the imperative mood commanding and entreating me to leave arghouse there was one such as only lord erymanth could write  he was an old man and never could make short work of anything  they say that his chief political value was to be set on when anyone was wanted to speak against time  i know he was very dreadful at all the platforms in the county but he was very good and conscientious and everyone looked up to him as a sort of father of the country  but oh that letter  such a battery of heavy arguments against my unprecedented step in taking up my residence with these unfortunate young men who though they had not themselves openly transgressed the law of the land yet were the offspring of unhallowed unions with the children of a felon  i cannot go through it all but it hinted that besides their origin there was some terrible stain on harold and that society could not admit them so that if i persisted in casting in my lot with them i should share the ban  indeed he would have thought my own good sense and love of decorum would have taught me that the abode of two such youths would be no fit place for the daughter of such respected parents and there was a good deal more that i could not understand about interceding with his sister and her overlooking my offence in consideration of my inexperience and impulsiveness  on my first impulse i wrote to thank my old friend but to say i could see no harm in an aunts being with her nephews and that i was sure he had only to know them to lay aside all doubts of their being thorough gentlemen and associates for anybody  my little niece required my care and i should stay and give it to her till some other arrangement was made  if lady diana were displeased with me i was very sorry but i could see no reason for it  when i looked over the old earls letter before closing mine some expressions wound out of the mist that made me uncomfortable especially when i recollected that though it was a week since their arrival no one had attempted to call but mr crosse the vicar of mycening a very good man in the pulpit as the servants said and active in the parish but underbred and no companion  our neighbourhood was what is called very clannish  there were two families the horsmans and the stympsons who seemed to make up all the society  the sons either had the good livings or had retired from their professions into cottages round and about and the first question after any party was how many of each  the outsiders not decidedly of inferior rank were almost driven into making a little cliqueif so it might be calledof their own and hanging together the more closely lord erymanth of course predominated but he was a widower of many years standing and his heir lived in a distant county  his sister lady diana had been married to an irish mr tracy who had been murdered after a few years by his tenants upon which she had come with her three children to live at arked house i never could guess how she came to marry an irish landlord and i always thought she must have exasperated his people  she was viewed as the perfection of a lady bountiful and pattern of excellence but i confess that i always thought of her when i heard of the devout and honourable women who were stirred up against st paul  she was a person who was admired more than she was liked and who was greatly praised and honoured but somehow did not proportionably endear herself on closer acquaintance doing a great deal of good but all to large masses rather than individuals  however all the neighbourhood had a pride in her and it was a distinction to be considered a fit companion for diana and viola tracy  i never cared for di who was her mother over again and used to set us to rights with all her might but she had married early a very rich manand viola and i had always been exceedingly fond of one another so that i could not bear to be cut off from her however i might be disposed to defy her mother  the upshot of my perplexities was that i set off to mycening to lay them before miss woolmer another of the few belonging to neither clan to know what all this meant as well as to be interested in my nephews  mycening is one of the prettiest country towns i know at least it was twenty years ago  there is a very wide street unpaved but with a broad smooth gravelled way slightly sloping down towards the little clean stoneedged gutters that border the carriage road along the centre which is planted on each side with limes cut into arches the houses are of all sorts some old timbered gableended ones with projecting upper stories like our own others of the handsome old queen anne type with big sash windows and others quite modern  some have their gardens in front some stand flush with the road and the better sort are mixed with the shops and cottages  miss woolmer lived in a tiny low one close to the road where from her upstairs floor she saw all that came and went and intellectual woman as she certainly was she thoroughly enjoyed watching her neighbours as by judiciouslyarranged lookingglasses she could do all up and down the street  i believe she had been a pretty woman though on a small scale and now she had bright eyes and a very sweet bright look though in complexion she had faded into the worn pallor that belongs to permanent ill health  she dressed nicely and if she had been well might at her age scarcely above forty have been as much a young lady as philippa horsman but i fancy the great crush of her life had taken away her girlhood and left her no spring of constitution to resist illness so that she had sunk into a regular crippled invalid before i could remember though her mind was full of activity  you are come to tell me about them my dear was her greeting ive seen them  no i dont mean that they have been to see me youll bring them some day wont you  im sure ambroses boy would come to see a sick woman  i watched one of them yesterday pick up old mollys oranges for her in the street when her basket got upset by a cart and he then paid her for them and gave them among the children round  it did my heart good id not seen such a sight since the boys were sent away  harold would do anything kind i said or to see an old friend of his father  the worst of it is that there seem to be so few who wish to see him or can even forgive me for staying with him  i showed her lord erymanths letter and told her of the others asking her what it meant  oh as to lady diana she said there is no doubt about that  she was greatly offended at your having sent away her carriage and not having taken her advice and she goes about saying she is disappointed in you  for my mothers sake and my little viola and auld lang syne besides i was much hurt and defended myself in a tone of pique which made miss woolmer smile and say she was far from blaming me but that she thought i ought to count the cost of my remaining at arghouse  and then she told me that the whole county was up in arms against the new comers not only from old association of their name with revolutionary notions but because the old miss stympsons of lake side who had connections in new south wales had set it abroad that the poor boys were ruffians companions of the doubledyed villain prometesky and that harold in especial was a marked man who had caused the death of his own wife in a frenzy of intoxication  at this i fairly laughed  harold at his age who never touched liquor and had lived a sort of hermit life in the bush to be saddled with a wife only to have destroyed her  the story contradicted itself by its own absurdity and those two miss stympsons were wellknown scandalmongers  miss woolmer never believed a story of theirs without sifting but she had been in a manner commissioned to let me know that society was determined not to accept eustace and harold alison and was irate at my doing so mothers declared that they should be very sorry to give poor lucy alison up but that they could not have their children brought into contact with young men little better than convicts and whom they would besides call my cousins instead of my nephews  i began to suspect it i said when nobody left cards but mr lawless and peter parsons  and that is the society they are to be left to  but i shall not leave them i cried  why should i to please miss stympson and lord erymanth  i shall stand by my own brothers sons against all the world  and if they be worthy lucy your doing so is the best chance of their weathering the storm  see is not that one of them  the grandlooking giant one who moves like a king of men  he is ambroses son is he not  what a pity he is not the squire  harold was in effect issuing from the toyshop carrying an immense kite on his arm like a shield while dora frisked round in admiration and a train of humbler admirers flocked in the rear  i hurried down into the street to tell harold of my old friends wish to see them and he followed me at once with that manner which was not courtesy because without being polished it was so much more dora was much displeased being ardent on the kites tail and followed with sullen looks while harold had to stoop low to get into the room and brushed the low ceiling with his curly hair as he stood upright miss woolmer gazing up to the very top of him  i think she was rather disappointed that he had not taken more after his father and she told him that he was like his uncle lewthwayte looking keenly to see whether he shrunk from the comparison to a man who had died a felons death but he merely answered so i have been told  then she asked for his mother and he briefly replied that she was well and in new zealand  there was an attempt at noticing dora to which she responded like the wild opossum that she was and her fidgeting carried the day  harold only made answer to one or two more observations and then could not but take leave promising on the entreaty of the old lady to come and see her again  i outstayed them being curious to hear her opinion  a superb being she said with a long breath theres the easy strength of a greek demigod in every tread  he seems to me more like thor in nifelheim i said being no doubt half a viking to begin with  they are all the same as people tell us now she said smiling any way he looks as if he was a waif from the heroic age  but my dear did not i hear him call you lucy  they generally do  i would not let them  cling to your auntship it explains your being with them  a grand creature  i feel like the people who had had a visit from the gods of old  and you understand how impossible it would be to run away i said  she smiled but added lucy my dear that looked very like a weddingring  i could not think it possible  why he was scarcely fiveandtwenty and yet the suggestion haunted me whenever my eyes fell on his countenance in repose and noted the habitual sadness of expression which certainly did not match with the fine open face that seemed fitted to express the joy of strength  it came on me too when at the lodge a child who had been left alone too long and had fallen into an unmitigated agony of screaming harry had actually instead of fleeing from the sound gone in taken the screamer in his arms and so hushed and pacified it that on the mothers return she found it at perfect rest  one would think the gentleman was a father himself maam she had said to me and thereupon harold had coloured and turned hastily aside so that the woman fancied she had offended him and apologised so that he had been forced to look back again and say never mind and no harm done with a half laugh which as it now struck me had a ring of pain in it and was not merely the laugh of a shy young man under an impossible imputation  true i knew he was not a religious man but to believe actual ill of him seemed to me impossible  he had set himself to survey the arghouse estate so as to see how those dying wishes of his father could best be carried out and he was making himself thoroughly acquainted with every man woman child and building to the intense jealousy of bullock who had been agent all through my mothers time and had it all his own way  he could not think why mr harold should be always hovering about the farms and cottages sometimes using his own ready colonial hand to repair deficiencies and sometimes his purse and making the people take fancies into their heads that were never there before and which would make mr alison lose hundreds a year if they were attended to and as mr alison always did attend to his cousin and gave orders accordingly the muchaggrieved bullock had no choice but in delaying their execution and demonstrating their impracticability whereas of course harold did not believe in impossibilities  it was quite true as he had once said that though he could not bring about improvements as readily as if he had been landlord yet he could get at the people much better and learn their own point of view of what was good for them  they were beginning to idolise him for indeed there was a fascination about him which no one could resist  i sometimes wondered what it was considering that he was so slow of speech and had so little sunshine of mirth about him  i never did enforce my title of aunt in spite of miss woolmers advice  it sounded too ridiculous and would have hindered the sisterly feeling that held us together  eustace was restless and vexed at not being called upon and anxious to show himself on any occasion and i was almost equally anxious to keep him back out of reach of mortification  both he and harold went to london on business leaving dora with me  the charge was less severe than i expected  my first attempts at teaching her had been frustrated by her scorn of me and by harolds baffling indulgence but one day when they had been visiting one of the farms the children had been made to exhibit their acquirements which were quite sufficient to manifest doras ignorance  eustace had long declared that if she would not learn of me she must either have a governess or go to school and i knew she was fit for neither harold i believe now enforced the threat and when he went away left her a black silk necktie to be hemmed for him and a toy book with flaming illustrations with an assurance that on her reading it to him on his return depended his giving her a toy steamengine  dora knew that harold kept his word even with her  i think she had a great mind to get no ones assistance but the kitchenmaids but this friendship was abruptly terminated by doras arraying the kangaroo in sarahs best bonnet and cloak and launching it upon a stolen interview between her and her sweetheart  the screams brought all the house together and as the hero was an undesirable party who had been forbidden the house sarah viewed it as treachery on miss doras part and sulked enough to alienate her  dora could make out more to herself in a book than she could read aloud and one day i saw her spelling over the table of degrees of marriage in a great folio prayerbook which she had taken down in quest of pictures  some time later in the day she said lucy are you harrys fathers sister and when i said yes she added with a look of discovery a man cannot marry his fathers sister  it was no time to protest against the marriage of first cousins  i was glad enough that from that time the strange child laid aside her jealousy of me and that thenceforth her resistance was simply the repugnance of a wild creature to be taught and tamed  ultimately she let me into the recesses of that passionate heart and as i think loved me better than anybody else except harold but even so at an infinite distance from that which seemed the chief part of her whole being     chapter ii  the lion of neme heath   the work was done  the sixteen pages of largetype story book were stumbled through and there was a triumphant exhibition when the cousins came homeeustace delighted harold halfstifled by london insisting on walking home from the station to stretch his legs and going all the way round over kalydon moor for a whiff of air  if we had not had a few moors and heaths where he could breathe i dont know whether he could have stayed in england and as for london the din the dinginess the squalor of houses and people sat like a weight on his heart  they told me a great deal had been done for england  it is just nothing he said and hardly anything else that whole evening while eustace accoutred pointdevice by a london tailor poured forth volumes of what he had seen and done  mr prosser made up a dinner party for them and had taken them to an evening party or twoat least eustace for after the first harold had declined and had spent his time in wandering about london by gaslight and standing on the bridges or trying how far it was on each side to green fields and how much misery lay between  eustace had evidently been made much of and had enjoyed himself greatly  it grieved me that his first entrance into society should be under no better auspices than those of the family solicitor but he did not yet perceive this and was much elated  i flatter myself it was rather a success was the phrase he had brought home apropos to everything he had worn or done from his tie to his shoebuckles he told me the price of everything all the discussions with his tradesmen and all the gazes fixed on him with such simplicity that i could not help caring and there sat harold in his corner apparently asleep but his eye now and then showing that he was thinking deeply  lucy he said as we bade one another goodnight is nothing being done  about what i asked  for all that wretchedness  oh yes there are all sorts of attempts and i told him of model cottages ragged schools and the like and promised to find him the accounts but he gave one of his low growls as if this were but a mockery of the direful need  he had got his statement of prometeskys case properly drawn up and had sent up a copy but in vain and had again been told that some influential person must push it to give it any chance  mr prossers acquaintance lay in no such line or at least were most unlikely to promote the pardon of an old incendiary  what will you do i asked  must you give it up  never  i will make a way at last  meantime he was necessary to eustace in accomplishing all the details of taking possession  horses were wanted by both used to riding as they had always been and there was an oldfashioned fair on neme heath just beyond mycening rather famous for its good show of horses where there was a chance of finding even so rare an article as a hunter up to harolds weight also a pony for dora  an excellent show of wild beasts was also there  harold had been on the heath when it was being arranged in the earliest morning hours and had fraternised with the keepers and came home loquacious far more than usual on the wonders he had seen  i remember that instead of being disappointed in the size of the lions and tigers he dwelt with special admiration on their supple and terrible strength of spine and paw  he wanted to take dora at once to the menagerie but i represented the inexpedience of their taking her about with them to the horsefair afterwards and made eustace perceive that it would not do for miss alison and as harold backed my authority she did not look like thunder for more than ten minutes when she found we were to drive to neme heath and that she was to go home with me after seeing the animals  eustace was uncertain about his dignity and hesitated about not caring and not intending and not liking me to go alone but made up his mind that since he had to be at the fair he would drive us  so we had out the barouche and eustace held the reins with infinite elation while harold endured the interior to reconcile dora to it and was as much diverted as she was at the humours of the scene exclaiming at every stall of gilt gingerbread every seesaw and merrygoround that lined the suburbs of mycening and i strongly suspect meditating a private expedition to partake of their delights harold was thoroughly the great child nature meant him for while poor eustace sat aloft enfolded in his dignity not daring to look right or left or utter a word of surprise lest he should compromise himself in the eyes of the coachman by his side  the fair was upon the heath out to which the new part of the town was stretching itself and long streets of white booths extended themselves in their regular order  we drove on noiselessly over the muchtrodden turf until we were checked by the backward rush of a frightened crowd and breathless voices called out to eustace stop sir turn for heavens sake  the lion  hes loose  turning was impossible for the crowd was rushing back on us blocking us up and eustace dropped the reins turning round with a cry of harry harry i see him  take us away  harold sprang on the back seat as the coachman jumped down to run to the horses heads  he saw over the peoples heads and after that glance made one bound out of the carriage  i saw then what i shall never forget across the wide open space round which the principal shows were arranged and which was now entirely bare of people  on the other side between the shafts of a waggon too low for him to creep under lay the great yellow lion waving the tufted end of his tail as a cat does when otherwise still showing the glassy glare of his eyes now and then growling with a horrible display of fangs and holding between those huge paws a senseless boy as a sort of hostage from all the lanes between the booths the people were looking in terror ready for a rush on the beasts least movement shrieking calls to someone to save the boy fetch a gun bring the keeper c  that moment with the great thick carriagerug on his arm harold darted forward knocking down a gun which some foolish person had brought from a shootinggallery and shouting dont  it will only make him kill the boy he gathered himself up for a rush while i believe we all called to him to stop i am sure of eustaces harry dont  what shall i do  before the words were spoken harold had darted to the side of the terrible creature and with a bound vaulted across its neck as it lay dealing it a tremendous blow over the nose with that sledgehammer fist and throwing the rug over its head  horrible roaring growls like snarling thunder were heard for a second or two and one man dashed out of the frightened throng rifle in hand just in time to receive the child whom harold flung to him snatched from the lions grasp and again we saw a wrestling struggling heaving mass harry still uppermost pinning the beast down with his weight and the mighty strength against which it struggled furiously  having got free of the boy his one ally was again aiming his rifle at the lions ear when two keepers with nets and an iron bar came on the scene one shouting not to shoot and the other holding up the bar and using some word of command at which the lion cowered and crouched  the people broke into a loud cheer after their breathless silence and it roused the already halfsubdued lion  there was another fierce and desperate struggle lasting only a moment and ended by the report of the rifle  in fact the whole passed almost like a flash of lightning from the moment of our first halt till the crowd closed in so that i could only see one bare yellow head towering above the hats and finally cleaving a way towards us closely followed by dermot tracy carrying the rifle and almost beside himself with enthusiasm and excitement lucyis it you  what he is your cousin  i never saw anything like it  he mastered it alone quite alone  and then we heard harry bidding those around not touch him and dora screamed with dismay and i saw he had wrapped both hands in his handkerchief  to my frightened question whether he was hurt he answered only my hands but i fancy the brute has done for some of my fingers  if those fellows could but have held their tongues  he climbed into the carriage to rid himself of the crowd who were offering all sorts of aid commiseration and advice and dermot begged to come too in case he should be faint which made harry smile though he was in much pain frowning and biting his lip while the coachman took the reins and turned us round amid the deafening cheers of the people for eustace was quite unnerved and dora broke into sobs as she saw the blood soaking through the handkerchiefsall that we could contribute  he called her a little goose and said it was nothing but the great drops stood on his brow he panted and moved restlessly as if sitting still were unbearable and he could hardly help stamping out the bottom of the carriage  he shouted to eustace to let him walk but dermot showed him how he would thus have the crowd about him in a moment  it was the last struggle that had done the mischief when the lion startled by the shout of the crowd had turned on him again and there had been a most narrow escape of a dying bite such as would probably have crushed his hand itself beyond all remedy and as it was one could not but fear he was dreadfully hurt when the pain came in accesses of violence several times in the short distance to dr kingstons door  no dr kingston was not at home nor would be in for some time but while we were thinking what to do a young man came hastily up saying i am dr kingstons partner can i do anything  harold sprang out on this forbidding eustace to follow him but permitting dermot and mrs kingston an old acquaintance of mine came and invited us all to her drawingroom lamenting greatly her husbands absence and hoping that mr yolland his new partner would be able to supply his place  the young man had very high testimonials and an excellent education  she was evidently exercised between her own distrust of the assistant and fear of disparaging him  seeing how much shaken we were she sent for wine and i was surprised to see eustace take some almost furtively but his little sister though still sobbing glared out from behind the knuckles she was rubbing into her eyes and exclaimed eustace i shall tell harry  hold your tongue said eustace petulantly harry has nothing to do with it  mrs kingston looked amazed  i set to work to talk them both down and must have given a very wild nervous account of the disaster at last dermot opened the door for harry who came in looking very pale with one hand entirely covered and in a sling the other bound up all but the thumb and forefinger  to our anxious inquiries he replied that the pain was much better now and he should soon be all right and then on being further pressed admitted that the little finger had been so much crushed that it had been taken off from the first joint the other three fingers had been broken and were in splints and the right hand was only torn and scratched  mrs kingston exclaimed at this that mr yolland should have waited for the doctor to venture on such an operation but both dermot and harold assured her that he could not have waited and also that it could not have been more skilfully done both of which assurances she must have heard with doubts as to the competence of the judges and she much regretted that she could not promise a visit from her doctor that evening as he was likely to be detained all night  dermot came downstairs with us and we found mr yolland waiting at the door to extract a final promise that harold would go to bed at once on coming home  it seemed that he had laughed at the recommendation so that the young surgeon felt bound to enforce it before all of us adding that it was a kind of hurt that no one could safely neglect there was something in his frank brusque manner that pleased harold and he promised with half a smile thanking the doctor hastily as he did so while dermot tracy whispered to me good luck getting him twice as ready as the old one and then vehemently shaking all our hands to make up for harolds not being fit to touch he promised to come and see him on the morrow  the moment we were all in the carriageeustace still too much shaken to drive homehis first question was who that was  mr tracy i answered and eustace added i thought you called him dermont  dermotdermot tracy  i have known him all our lives  i saw he was a gentleman by his boots quoth eustace with deliberation holding out his own foot as a standard  i saw they were london made  how fortunate that you had not on your sydney ones i could not help saying in mischief  i took care of that was the complacent answer  i told richardson to take them all away  i dont think harold saw the fun  they had neither of them any humour even harold was much too simple and serious  eustace next treated us to a piece of his wellconned manual and demonstrated that dermot st glear tracy esquire of killy marey county cavan ireland was grandson to an english peer great grandson to an irish peer and nephew to the existing edward st glear 6th earl of erymanth  and a very fashionable young man he went on distinguished in the sporting world  an excellent good fellow with plenty of pluck said harold warmly is he not brother to the pretty little girl who was with you when we came  i answered as briefly as i could i did not want to talk of the tracys my heart was very sore about them and i was almost relieved when dora broke in with a grave accusing tone harry eustace drank a glass of wine and i said i would tell you  eustace has no reason to prevent him was harolds quiet answer  and really i think in my position it is ridiculous you see eustace began stammering but was wearily cut short by harold with as you please  eustace could never be silent long and broke forth again harold your ring  by way of answer harold with his available thumb and finger showed the ring for a moment from his waistcoat pocket  instantly dora sprang at it snatched it from his finger before he was aware and with all her might flung it into the river for we were crossing the bridge  there was strength in that thumb and finger to give her a sharp fierce shake and the low voice that said dora was like the lions growl  its megs ring and i hate her she cried  for shame dorothy  the child burst into a flood of tears and sobbed piteously but it was some minutes before he would relent and look towards her eustace scolded her for making such a noise and vexing harold when he was hurt but that only made her cry the more  i told her to say she was sorry and perhaps harold would forgive her but she shook her head violently at this  harold relented unable to bear the sight of distress  dont tease her he said shortly to us both  hush dora theres an end of it  this seemed to be an amnesty for she leant against his knee again  dora how could you i said when we were out of the carriage and the two young men had gone upstairs together  it was megs ring and i hate her answered dora with the fierce wild gleam in her eyes  you should not hate anyone was of course my answer  but shes dead said dora triumphantly as a little tigress  so much the worse it is to hate her  who was she  his wife said dora  i durst not ask the child any more questions  eustace who is meg  i could not but ask that question as we sat teteatete after dinner dora having gone to carry harold some fruit and being sure to stay with him as long as he permitted  eustace looked round with a startled cautious eye as if afraid of being overheard and said as dora had done his wife  not alive  oh nothank goodness  at his age  he was but twenty when he married her  a bad business  i knew it could not be otherwise  she was a storekeepers daughter  then i learnt in eustaces incoherent style the sad story i understood better afterwards  this miserable marriage had been the outcome of the desolate state of the family after the loss of all the higher spirits of the elder generation  for the first few years after my brothers had won their liberation and could hold property they had been very happy and the foundations of their prosperity at boola boola had been laid had ambrose lived he would no doubt have become a leading man in the colony where he had heartily embraced his lot and shaped his career  poor eustace was however meant by nature for a quiet refined english gentleman living in his affections  he would never have transgressed ordinary bounds save for his brothers overmastering influence  he drooped from the time of ambroses untimely death suffered much from the loss of several children and gradually became a prey to heart complaint  but his wife was full of sense and energy and ambroses plans were efficiently carried on so that all went well till alices marriage and a year or two later on dorothys death in giving birth to her little girl no woman was left at the farm but a rough though kindhearted old convict who did her best for the motherless child  harold then sixteen and master of his fathers half of the property was already its chief manager  he was of course utterly unrestrained doing all kinds of daring and desperate things in the exuberance of his growing strength and though kind to his feeble uncle under no authority and a thorough young barbarian of the woods the foremost of all the young men in every kind of exploit as marksman rider hunter and whatnot and wanting also to be foremost in the good graces of meg cree the handsome daughter of the keeper of the wayside store on the road to sydney where young stockfarmers were wont to meet with the price of their wool fresh in their hands  it was the rendezvous for all that was collectively done in the district and many were the orgies and revelries in which harold had shared when a mere boy in all but strength and stature and ungovernable in proportion to the growing forces within him  of course she accepted him with his grand physical advantages and his good property  there was rivalry enough to excite him her beauty was sufficient to fire his boyish fancy and opposition only maddened his headstrong will  a loud boisterous selfwilled boy with already strength courage and power beyond those of most grown men his inclination light and unformed as the attachments of his age usually are was so backed that he succeeded where failure would have been a blessing  my poor brother eustace what must not harolds marriage have been to him  into the common home hitherto peaceful if mournful was brought this coarse violent uneducated woman jealous of him and his family unmeasured in rudeness contemning all the refinements to which he clung and which even then were second nature to the youths boasting over him for being a convict whereas her father was a free settler and furious at any act of kindness or respect to him from her husband  she must have had a sort of animal jealousy for the birth of her first child rendered her so savagely intolerant of poor doras fondness for harold that the offer of a clergymans wife to take charge of the little girl was thankfully accepted by her father though it separated him from his darling by more than fifty miles  the womans plan seemed to be to persecute the two eustaces out of her house since she could not persuade harold that it was not as much theirs as his own  they clung on as weak men do for want of energy to make a change and eustace said his father would never complain but harold never guessed how much she made him suffer home had become a wretched place to all and harold was more alienated from it making long expeditions staying out as long and as late as he could whenever business or pleasure called him away and becoming alas more headlong and reckless in the pursuit of amusement  there were fierce hot words when he came home and though a tender respect for his uncle was the one thing in which he never failed the whole grand creature was being wrecked and ruined by the wild courses to which home misery was driving him  after about three years of this kind of life meg much against his will went to her fathers station for the birth of her second child lingered in the congenial atmosphere there far longer than was necessary after her recovery and roused harolds jealousy to a violent pitch by her demeanour towards a fellow of her own rank whom she probably would have married but for harolds unfortunate advantages and whom she now most perilously preferred  the jollification after the poor childs longdeferred christening ended in furious language on both sides meg insisting that she would not go home while the old man remained at boola boola harold swearing that she should come at once and finally forcing her into his buggy silencing by sheer terror her parents endeavours to keep them at least till morning rather than drive in his halfintoxicated condition across the uncleared country in the moonlight  in the early morning harold stood at their door dazed and bleeding with his eldest child crushed and moaning in his arms  almost without a word he gave it to the grandmother and then guided the men at hand striding on silently before them to the precipitous bank of a deep gulley some twelve miles off  in the bottom lay the carriage broken to pieces and beside it where harold had dragged them out meg and her baby both quite deadwhere he had driven headlong down in the darkness  the sun was burning hot when they brought her back in the cart harold walking behind with the little one in his arms and when he had laid it down at home the elder one waited till he took it  it was a fine boy of two years old the thing he loved best in the world but with a broken spine there was no hope for it and for a whole day and night he held it pacing the room and calling it speaking to and noticing no one else and touching no food only slaking his thirst with the liquor that stood at hand until the poor little thing died in convulsions  unhappily he had scarcely laid it down beside its mother and brother when he saw his rival in the outer room of the store and with one deadly imprecation and a face which eustace could not think of without horror challenged him to fight and in a second or two had struck him down with a fractured skull  but the deed was done in undoubted brain fever  that was quite established and for ten days after he was desperately ill and in the wildest delirium probably from some injury to the head in the fall aggravated by all that followed  neiher magistrate nor doctor was called in but prometesky came to their help and when he grew calmer brought him home where his strength rallied but his mind was for some time astray  for weeks he alternated between moods of speechless apathy and hours of frenzy which from his great strength must have been fatal to someone if he had not always known his gentle feeble old uncle and obeyed his entreaties even when prometesky lost power with him  in this remote part of the country no one interfered the crees whose presence maddened him were afraid to approach and only prometesky sustained the hopes of the two eustaces by his conviction that this was not permanent insanity but a passing effect of the injury and they weathered that dreadful time till the frantic fits ceased and there was only the dull silent stoniness of look and manner lasting on after his health had entirely returned and he had begun mechanically to attend to the farm and stock and give orders to the men  the final cure was the message that dora was lost in the bush harold had the keen sagacity of a black fellow and he followed up the track with his unwearied strength until on the third day he found her revived her with the food he had brought with him and carried her home  there was only just nourishment enough to support her and he took none himself so that when he laid her down beside her father he was so spent that after a mouthful or two he slept for twenty hours without moving as he had never rested since the accident and when he woke and dora ran up and stroked his face it was the first time he had been seen to smile  ever since he had been himself again though changed from the boy of exuberant spirits and the youth of ungovernable inclinations into a grave silent man happier apparently in doras vehement affection than in anything else and at any rate solaced and soothed by the childs fondness and dependence upon him this was two years ago and no token of mental malady had since shown itself  my poor brother eustace  my heart yearned to have been able to comfort him  his tender nature had been all along the victim of others and he was entirely shattered by these last miseries an old man when little more than forty and with heart disease so much accelerated by distress and agitation that he did not live a month after doras adventure but at least he had the comfort of seeing harolds restoration and being able to commit the other two to his charge being no doubt aware that his son was at the best a poor weak being and that harolds nature would rise under responsibility which would call out its generosity  harold had never touched liquor since the day of his childs death nor spoken of it but when his dying uncle begged him to watch over his young cousins he took up the bible that lay on the bed and unsolicited took a solemn oath to taste nothing of the kind for the rest of his life  afterwards the three had lived on together at boola boola  then had come the tidings of the inheritance supposed to be harolds and with the relief of one glad to make a new beginning to have a work to do and leave old things behind he had taken both the others with him  so it was true  my noblelooking harold had those dark lines in his spectrum  wild ungovernable strength had whirled him in mere boyhood at the beck of his passions and when most men are entering freshly upon life he was already saddened and sobered by sin and suffering the stories whispered of him were more than true  i remember i cried over them as i sat alone that evening  eustace had not told all with the extenuations that i discovered gradually some even then by crossquestioning and much by the tuition of that sisterly affection that had gone out from me to harold and fastened on him as the one who to me represented family ties  i never thought of breaking with him  no if i had been told he might be insane that very night it would have bound me to him the more  and when i went to bid him goodnight and take away dora and saw the massive features in their stillness light up into a goodnatured smile of thanks at my inquiries i could believe it all the less  he was lying cornerwise across the bed with a stool beyond for his feet to rest on and laughed a little as he said he always had to contrive thus he never found a bed long enough and our merriment over this seemed to render what eustace had told me even more incongruous in one so scrupulously gentle  that gentleness was perhaps reactionary in one who had had such lessons in keeping back his strength  he had evidently come forth a changed man  but that vow of hiswas it the binding of a worse lion than that he had fought with today  yet could such things be done in the might of a merely human will  and what token was there of the higher aid being invoked  my poor harold  i could only pray for him  alas did he pray for himself  i was waked in early morning by doras vociferous despair at the disappearance of her big patient and then eustaces peremptory fretful tone was heard silencing her by explaining that harolds hurts had become so painful that he had walked off to mycening to have the bandages loosened  indeed when we met at breakfast eustace seemed to think himself injured by the interruption of his slumbers by harolds coming to him for assistance in putting on his clothes and stared at my dismay at his having permitted such an exertion  before long however we saw an unmistakable doctors gig approaching and from it emerged harold and mr yolland  i saw now that he was a sturdy hardworkinglooking young man of seven or eight and twenty with sandy hair and an honest open weatherbeaten face  he had a rather abrupt manner but much more gentlemanlike than that of the usual style of young union doctors who are divided between fine words and affectation and sawbones roughness  he said he had come in to enforce on us what he could not get his patient to believethat it was madness to take such liberties with himself while such serious wounds were so fresh and certainly harold did not seem to suppose a two mile walk more of an exertion than a turn on the terrace indeed but for mr yolland he would have set off again after breakfast for the interrupted quest of horses at the fair this however was forbidden with a hint about even the strongest constitution not being able to defy tetanus  this made us all look grave and submission being promised the young doctor took his leave saying he would come in the evening and dress the hands again for the night  why did you go to that fellow asked eustace  it is the old doctor who attends gentlemen he is only the partner  he is good enough for me said harold  i was right glad to meet him  then it appeared that as harold was striding into town half distracted with the pain of his hands in the sunrise of that april morning he had had the good fortune to meet mr yolland just coming from the cottage where the poor little boy lay who had been injured by the lion the fright and shock had nearly killed the mother and the young doctor had been up all night trying to save her while on the floor in a drunken sleep lay the father a navvy who had expended the money lavished on the child by the spectators of the accident in a revel at the public house  if any were left it was all in the brutes pocket and the only hope of peace was when he should have drunk it up  eustace went off to the fair to look at horses harold impressing on him to do nothing final in haste and i could see that while proud of doing anything on his own account he was almost afraid of the venture alone  tired by his sleepless night and morning walk harold when we went into the hall for doras lessons lay down on the white bearskin let us build a pile of cushions for his head and thanked us with thats nice  i suppose he had never been waited on before he smiled with such a grateful look almost of surprise  have i not said that ours was a black oakpanelled hall with a wide fireplace a gallery and oriel window matted and so fitted up as to be a pleasant resort for summer days  our lessons took place there because i had found that my old schoolroom out of sight and sound of everything was such an intolerable prison to my little wild bush girl that she really could not learn there since her very limited attention could only be secured under the certainty that harold did not leave the house without her  he bade her let him hear how well she could read but he was very soon fast asleep and i was persuading her that the multiplication table could not disturb his slumbers when at the sound of horses feet she darted from my side like an arrow from a bow to the open front door and there waved her hand in command calling to the rider in a hushed voice he is asleep  i followed expecting to see eustace but the rider was instead dermot tracy who in unfeigned alarm asked if he were seriously ill and when i laughed and explained he gave his horse to the groom and came quietly enough to satisfy dora into the hall with us  there he stood transfixed gazing at the great sleeping figure with a passion of enthusiasm in his darkgrey eyes  glorious he said splendid fellow  worthy of the deed lucy  it was the most plucky thing i ever saw  you distinguished yourself too i said  i  why i had a rifle  i galloped down to grices for mine at the first when i saw the menagerie people were cowed  whats that to going at him alone and mastering him too as he had done before those idiots thought proper to yell  being talked about of course awoke harold his eyes opened and he answered for himself greeting dermot heartily  only then did we understand the full history of what had happened  the liontamer whose part it was to exhibit the liberty he could take with the animals was ill and his assistant after much bravado as to his equal power had felt his courage quail and tried to renew it with drink thus he was in no state to perceive that he had only shotto the bolt of the door of the cage and his behaviour had so irritated the beast that after so dealing with him that he lay in a most dangerous state he had dashed out at the door in rage and terror and after seizing the hindmost of the flying crowd had lain down between the shafts of the waggon as we had seen him  the keepers had lost their heads in the panic and no one durst go near him  the liontamer had to be called from his bed in lodgings in the town and only came on the scene just as dermots rifle had finished the struggle  the master had quite seen the necessity but was in great despair at the loss of so valuable an animal  ill share in making it good to him said harold  you  you are the last to do so  if you had only been let alone the beast would have been captured unhurt  no no  i settled all that as it was i who meddled in the matter when i believe you could have settled him yourself  i dont know that said harold  i was glad enough to see your rifle at his ear  but i should like to have his skin if they would sell it  dermot explained that he had been bargaining for the skin and hoped mr alison would accept it from him but here harolds resolution won the day much as dermot evidently longed to lay the trophy at his feet poor dermot i could see heroworship growing in his eyes as they talked about horses endlessly as men can and do talk of them and diligent inquiries elicited from harold what things he had done with the unbroken animal in australia  i went off the scene at once but when i returned to luncheon they were at it still  and eustaces return with two steeds for harolds judgment renewed the subject with double vigour  dermot gave his counsel and did not leave arghouse without reiterating an invitation to the cousins to come tomorrow to his cottage at biston to be introduced to his stables let doctors say what they might and eustace was in raptures at the distinguished acquaintance he fancied he had made for himself  he had learnt something of mr tracys sporting renown and saw himself introduced to all the hunting world of the county not to say of england  it gave me a great deal to consider knowing as i did full well that poor dermots acquaintance was not likely to bring him into favour with society even if it were not dangerous in itself  and my poor mother would not have been delighted at my day a thing i had totally forgotten in the pleasantness of having someone to talk to for it was six weeks since i had spoken to anyone beyond the family except miss woolmer  besides it was dermot  and that was enough to move me in itself  i think i have said that his father was an irish landlord who was shot at his own halldoor in his childrens infancy  lady diana brought them back to her old neighbourhood and there reigned over one of her brothers villages with the greatest respect and admiration from all and viewed as a pattern matron widow and parent  my mother was i fancy a little bit afraid of her and never entirely at ease with her i know i was not but she was so particular about her children that it was a great distinction to be allowed to be intimate with them and my mother was proud of my being their licensed playfellow when horsmans and stympsons were held aloof  but even in those days when i heard the little tracys spoken of as pattern children i used to have an odd feeling of what it was to be behind the scenes and know how much of their fame rested on di  i gloried in the knowledge how much more charming the other two were than anyone guessed who thought them models of propriety  in truth dermot did not keep that reputation much longer than his petticoats  ere long he was a pickle of the first order equalling the sublime naughtiness of holiday house and was continually being sent home by private tutors who could not manage him  all the time i had a secret conviction that if he had been my own mothers son she could have managed him and he would never have even wished to do what she disapproved but lady diana had no sympathy or warmth in her and while she loved her children she fretted them and never thawed nor unbent and when she called in her brothers support dermots nerves were driven frantic by the long harangues and his relief was in antics which of course redoubled his offence  after he had put crackers into his uncles boots peppered the coachmans wig inserted a live toad in the centre of a fortification of clear jelly at a great luncheon and had one christmas painted the two stone wild boars that guard the iron gates of erymanth castle into startling resemblance of the porkers as displayed in butchers shops with a little tin pail at the snout of each labelling each sevenpencehapenny per pound his uncle had little more hope of him  dreading his fathers fate for him lady diana put him into the guards to prevent him from living in ireland and there he fell into all the usual temptations of his kind so that everybody came to look on him as a black sheep and all the time i knew that if any one had taken him in the right way he might have been kept out of it  why there was one talk that he and i had at a picnic on kalydon moor which showed me how hopeless he was of ever really pleasing or satisfying his mother without being what he could never be like his uncle in his youth and how knowing that i cared really might make a difference to him  but mamma and lady diana were both very much vexed about that talk mamma was angry with me and when dermot in a poetical game a little after sent me some verseswell with a little more blarney and tenderness than the case requiredthere was a real uproar about them  di showed them to her mother who apologised in her lofty way for my having been insulted  oh how angry it did make me and mamma absolutely cried about it  it seems foolish to say so but if they would have let us alone i could have done something towards inducing him to keep straight whereas the way he was treated by his mother and di only made him worse  poor mamma i dont wonder at her when even his own mother and uncle would not stand up for him but i knew whenever we met afterwards at ball or party that it was pain and grief to her for me to speak a word to him and that she thought me wrong to exchange anything beyond bare civility  he was vexed too and did not try and we heard worse and worse of him especially when he went over to his place in ireland  then came the crimean war and all the chances of showing what i knew he really was but at the alma he was wounded not very dangerously but just touching his lungs and after a long illness in london the doctors said he must not go back to sebastopol for to serve in the trenches would be certain death to him  he wanted to go back all the same and had an instinct that it would be better for him but his mother and uncle prevented him and made him sell out and after that when he had nothing to dooh theres no need to think of it  in the course of this last year he had taken the shooting of kalydon moor and a house with it with immense stables which one of the horsmans had made for his hunters and had ruined himself and died he had not quarrelled with his motherindeed nobody could quarrel with dermotand he used to go over to see her but he would not live at home and since he had been at biston i had never once met him till i saw him run up to attack the lion the only man in all the fair except harold who had courage to do so  i could not help my heart bounding at the thought and afterwards enjoying the talk with him that i could not help  but then it made me feel undutiful to my dear mother and then there was the further difficulty to be faced it would have been all very well to live with my nephews if we had been in a desert island but i could not expect them not to make friends of their own and if mine chose to drop me how would it be for me at my age all alone in the house  harold was forced to confess that he had done too much that first day his hand was inflamed and pain and weariness forbade all thought of spending a long day from home and besides there arrived letters by the mornings post which left grave lines on his brow  so eustace drove off alone a good deal elated at such an expedition and i took harold to my own little sittingroom so despised by dora for the convenience of bathing the flesh wounds on the right hand which though really the least injured was a much greater torment than the broken fingers and had allowed him very little sleep  it was the first time he had been in the room and on the chimneypiece stood open a miniaturecase containing a portrait by thorburn of my little brother percy in loose brown holland  harold started as he came in and exclaimed where did that come from  i told him and he exclaimed shut it up please and sat down with his back to it resigning his hand to me and thanking me warmly when the fomentation brought some relief and when i asked if i could do any more for him he seemed undecided extracted some letters from his pocket with his twofifths of a hand and sent dora to his room for his writingcase i offered to write anything for him but he said let me try and then endeavoured but he found that not only did the effort hurt him unbearably but that he could not guide the pen for more than a word or two so he consented to make use of me saying however dora it is no use your staying in you had better go out  dora of course wanted to stay but i devised that she should go under the escort of one of the maids to carry some broth to the wounded boy an expedition which would last her some time and which harold enforced with all his might as a personal favour till she complied  thank you said harold you see this must be done at once or we shall have them coming over here  he gave me the sheet he had begun with dear mother and went on dictating  it was not at all after julius caesars fashion of dictating  he sat with his eyes on his own letter and uttered one brief but ponderous sentence after another each complete in all its parts and quite unhesitating though slowly uttered  i gathered it up wrote it down said well and waited for more in silence till after i had looked at him once or twice to see whether he were asleep or in a reverie another such sentence followed and i began to know him very much better  after saying my hands have been lamed for a few days and my aunt is so good as to write for me he went on to say in forcible and not very affectionate terms that smith must not think of coming home eustace could do nothing for him there but as long as the family remained at nelson their allowance should be increased by one hundred pounds a year  i filled up an order which he signed on a sydney bank for the first quarter  it must not be more he said as he told me the sum or they will be taking their passage with it  no more i asked when he prepared to conclude this short letter  no  smith reads all her letters  that is very hard on you  she meant to do well for me but it was a great mistake  if smith comes home to prey upon eustace it will be a bad business  but he has no claim on eustace whatever he may think he has on you  he is more likely to come now  he knows he can get nothing out of me then as i looked at the order he added beyond my mothers rights  poor mother  i found that the schoolmaster had been induced to marry alice alison in the expectation that her share in the proceeds of boola boola would be much larger than it proved to be  he had fawned on the two eustaces and obtained all he could from the elder but going too far at last had been detected by the sydney bank in what amounted to an embezzlement  prosecution was waived and he was assisted to leave australia and make a fresh start in new zealand whence he had never ceased to endeavour to gain whatever he could from boola boola he could twist eustace round his finger and harold though loathing and despising him would do anything for his mother but was resolved for eustaces sake to keep them at a distance as could only be done by never allowing them a sufficient sum at once to obtain a passage home and he knew the habits of smith and his sons too well to expect them to save it  in fact the letter before him which he ended by giving me to read had been written by the poor woman at her husbands dictation in the belief that harold was the heir to demand their passagemoney from him and that there was a sad little postscript put in afterwards unknown to her tyrant  my boy dont do it  it will be much better for you not and brave woman as she was she added no entreaty that his refusal might be softened  i asked if she had had any more children  no happily was harolds answer  if i might only wring that fellows neck i could take care of her  in fact i should think when he wanted to come within harolds grasp he hardly knew what he asked  this finished it appeared that harold wanted to have a letter finished to prometesky which he had begun some days before  this astonished me more both by the questions prometesky had been asking and the answers harold was returning as to the state of the country and the condition of the people  they did much to relieve my mind of the fears i had sometimes entertained of harolds being a ferocious demagogue incited thereto by his friend  who would have thought there was so much depth in his brain  he ended by saying eustace takes kindly to his new position and is gone today to see mr tracy nephew to lord erymanth but who does not appear disposed to carry on the same hostility to us  i exclaimed at his having said nothing of the lion either to his mother or his friend and asked leave to add it which he did not refuse though saying there was no use in it and that he wanted me to do one thing more for himnamely to write to his agent in sydney an order which he signed for the transmission of some money to england  he had learnt from mr yolland that morning that the dragons head and some adjoining houses at mycening were for sale and that the purchaser could have immediate possession  what are you going to do with it  shut it up  you cant do much good by shutting up one publichouse  eustace will do the same with those on his property  i am very much afraid your crusade will not succeed unless you can put something better into peoples minds  i shall see about that he answered thinking i believe that i was going to suggest religion from all mention of which he shrank as if it touched a wound  smith talked of religion he once said with a shudder  besides he was a creature in the superabundance of all human faculties to whom their exercise seemed for a time allsufficient and the dark shade of horror and remorse in the depths of his heart made him unwilling to look back or think  at any rate he silenced me on that head but thinking perhaps that he had been unkindly blunt he resumed there is no risk for eustace in this acquaintance  in spite of the pang that smote me i felt that this was the only time i might have for that word of warning which seemed incumbent on me  i do not think there is danger in his going today but it does seem right to tell you that poor dermot tracy is said to be very extravagant and to lead a wild life  and harold though i have known him all my life i have been thinking that it will not do for me to be here if this should become a resort of the set of people he has made friends of  harold answered in his steady grave way i see  but lucy i suppose none of them have been so bad as i have beenrather as if he were wondering over the matter  but you belong to me i answered and i saw a look of real pleasure meet my smile  i wish i knew what was best for eustace he said after a few more moments thought  is it doing him harm for me to be here  i could go back to new south wales at once only in some ways i dont think the old fellow could get on without me till he is more used to it all and in safe hands  i had no hesitation in answering that eustace would be much worse off without his cousin and that the treatment we were receiving was chiefly on account of the fathers of both not personal to harold  then you think it would not help him for me to leave him  i think he is far more likely to live it down with you to help him  but lucy are you being given up by all your friends for our sakes we did not know it meant that when we asked you to stay with us  no more did i  but dont be uneasy about that harold dear  dont you think ones own flesh and blood is more than all such friends  i should not have thought two fellows like us could have been worth much to you said harold gravely pondering  that pretty little thing who was with you the night we came she has never been here again  dont you miss her  it is not her fault i said  besides nothing is like the tie of blood  i shall never forget the look that was in harolds eyes  i was standing over him putting some fresh warm water on his hand  he put back his head and looked up earnestly in my face as if to see whether i meant it then said we are very thankful to you for thinking so  i could not help bending and touching his forehead with my lips  his eyes glistened and twinkled but he said nothing for a little space and then it was if any one like you had been out there  i dont think i ever had a compliment that gave me more pleasure for there was somehow an infinite sense of meaning in whatever harold said however short it might be as if his words had as much force in them as his muscles  after a good deal more of silent sponging and some knitting of his brows either from thought or from pain he said then as i understand you cast in your lot with us and give us the blessing of your presence and care of poor little dora to help to set eustace in his proper place in society  i see then that it is your due that we should bring no one here of whom you do not fully approve  it is not only a matter of approval i explained  there are many with whom i could freely associate in general society or if i had any lady with me whom i ought not to have constantly here with only you two  england is different from the bush he answered and meditated for ten minutes more for no doubt it was the australian practice to offer free quarters to all comers without mrs grundy who had hardly yet had her free passage  my heart smote me lest i were acting unkindly for her sake but then surely i was saving my allegiance to my dead mother and while i was still thinking it over harold said  you are more to us than any one could be eustace shall see the thing rightly and while you are good enough to make this our home i promise you that no one shall be invited here but as you like  it was a bold promise especially as it turned out that eustace had been making large invitations to the arghouse fishing to dermot tracy and some officer friends whom he had found at biston and who seemed to have made themselves very pleasant  i bade harold never mind about that sort of invitation as it need not affect dora or me since we could keep out of the way of it being unconcerned with gentlemens parties  miss woolmer said i had done right and gave us a general invitation to spend the evening with her if eustace wished to entertain his friends though she hinted dont be too ready to leave the coast clear  remember that you are a wholesome check     chapter iii  the dragons head   harolds right hand healed quickly and was free in a few days but the left had to be kept for some time in a sling and be daily attended to though he heeded it but little walking miles to look at horses and to try them for he could manage them perfectly with one hand and in this way he saw a good deal of dermot tracy who exerted himself to find a horse to carry the mighty frame  the catastrophe at the fair had gained him two friends entirely unlike one anotherdermot who thenceforward viewed him with unvarying heroworship and accepted eustace as his appendage and george yolland the very reverse of all dermots highbred form of irishism and careless easy selfindulgence  a roughhewn rugged young man intensely in earnest and therefore neither popular nor successful was that young partner of dr kingston had harold been squire the resignation of the patient into his hands would have been less facile but as a mere australian visitor he was no prize and might follow his own taste if he preferred the practitioner to whom club cottage and union patients were abandoned  by him harold was let into those secrets of the lower stratum of society he had longed to understand  attention to the poor boy who had been torn by the lion brought him into the great village of workmens huts that had risen up round the hydriot clay works on the lerne  these had been set up by a company about eighteen years before much against all our wills  with lord erymanth at our head we had opposed with all our might the breaking up of the beautiful moorland that ran right down into mycening and the defilement of our pure and rapid lerne but modern progress had been too strong for us  huge brick inclosures with unpleasant smoky chimneys had arisen and around them a whole colony of bare ugly little houses filled with squalid women and children little the better for the mens wages when they were high and now that the company was in a languishing state miserable beyond description  we county people had simply viewed ourselves as the injured parties by this importation bemoaned the ugliness of the erections were furious at the interruptions to our country walks prophesied the total collapse of the company and never suspected that we had any duties towards the potters  the works were lingering on only just not perishing the wages that the men did get such as they were went in drink the town in that quarter was really unsafe in the evening and the most ardent hope of all the neighbourhood was that the total ruin constantly expected would lead to the migration of all the wretched population  mr yolland who attended most of their sicknesses used to tell fearful things of the misery vice and hardness and did acts of almost heroic kindness among them which did not seem consistent with what to my grief and dismay was reported of this chosen companion of haroldthat physical science had conducted him into materialism the chief comfort i had was that miss woolmer liked him and opened her house to him  she was one of the largehearted women who can see the good through the evil and was interested by contact with all phases of thought and moreover the lad should not be lost for want of the entree to something like a home because the upper crust of mycening considered him as only dr kingstons partner and the kingstons themselves had the sort of sense that he was too much for them which makes a spider dislike to have a bluebottle in his web  she was interested too rather sadly in the crusade without the cross that the two young men were trying to undertake against the wretchedness of those potters  it was much in their favour that the landlord who was also the owner of the dragons head was invited to join a brother in america without loss of time and was ready to sell and give immediate possession so that harry actually owned it in a fortnight from first hearing of the offer having of course given a heavy price for it  the evening it came into his possession he went down and standing at the door tried to explain why he had closed it and why he could not bear to see its frequenters spending their wages on degrading themselves and making their homes miserable  in no mood for a temperance harangue the men drowned or would have drowned aught but his short incisive sentences in clamours for their beer and one big bully pushed forward to attack him  his left hand was still in the sling but with the other he caught hold of the fellow by the collar and swung him over the side of the stone steps as helpless as a puppy dog shaking him till his teeth chattered ere setting him on his feet if you wish for any more he said well have it out as soon as this hand is well  that made them cheer him and the fellow slunk away while harold having gained a hearing told them that he meant to make the former dragons head a place where they might smoke read the papers play games and have any refreshment such as coffee tea or gingerbeer at which they hissed and only one or two observed i am sure you wishes us well sir  it was a goodsized house and he meant to put in a steady couple to keep it giving up two upper rooms to make a laboratory for mr yolland whose soul was much set on experiments for which his lodgings gave him no space but the very day when harold opened his coffeerooms as he went down the street an original dragons head and a genuine dragons head grinned defiance at him in the full glory of teeth fiery breath and gilded scales on the other side of the way  i believe they had been beershops before but be that as it may they devoured quite as many as their predecessor and though newspapers and draughtboards lay all about the place they attracted only two clients  and the intended closing of all the beerhouses on the arghouse property except the timehonoured blue boar on the village green seemed likely to have the same effect for the notices to their holders grimly resisted by bullock seemed only to cause dozens of householders to represent the absolute need of such houses whenever they did not belong to us  to destroy one is to produce two sighed harold  theres nothing to be done but to strike at the root i said  whats that said harold  mans evil propensities i said  humph said harold  if i could manage the works now  they say the shares are to be had for an old song  oh harry dont have anything to do with them i entreated  they have ruined every creature who has meddled with them and done unmitigated mischief  harold made no answer but the next day he was greatly stimulated by a letter from prometesky part of which he read to me in its perfect english yet foreign idiom  i long to hear of the field of combat we had to quit because one party was too stolid the other too ardent  i see it all before me with the two new champions freshly girded for the strife but a peaceful strife my friend  let our experience be at least profitable to you and let it be a peaceful contention of emulation such as is alone suited to that insular nation which finds its strongest stimulus in domestic comfort and wealth  apropos has some one pursued a small discovery of mine that had i not been a stranger of a proscribed nation and had not your english earl and the esquires been hostile to all save the hereditary plough might have found employment for thousands and prevented the history of your fathers and of myself that bed of argillaceous deposit around the course of your lerne which i found to be of the same quality as the porcelain clay of meissen does it still merely bear a few scanty blades of corn or is its value appreciated and is it occupying hundreds of those who starved and were discontented to the great surprise of their respectable landlords  i wonder whether a few little figures that i modelled in the clay for specimens and baked in my hostesss oven are still in existence  the forms of clay were there  alas  i asked in vain of your english magnates for the fire from heaven to animate the earth or rather i would have brought it and i suffered  it was amusing to see how much delighted honest harold was with this letter and how much honoured he seemed by his dear old prometesky having spent so much time and thought upon writing to him  it fired him with doubled ardour to investigate the hydriot company and he could hardly wait till a reasonable hour the next day  then he took eustace down with him and returned quite talkative for him with the discoveries he had made from one of the oldest workmen who had become disabled from the damp of working in the clay  the company had been set up by a clever speculating young attorney but the old man remembered that that there foreign gentleman the same as was sent to foreign parts with the poor young squires was always apuddling about in it and they did say as how he tried to get my lord and squire horsman and squire stympson to see to setting up summut there but they wasnt never for speriments and there was no more talk of it not till that there young crabbe got hold they say of some little images as he had made and never rested till he had got up the company and begun the works having drawn in by his enthusiasm half the tradesmen and a few of the gentlemen of the place  three years of success then came a bad manager young crabbe struggled in vain to set things right broke down and died of the struggle and ever since the unhappy affair had lingered on starving its workmen and just keeping alive by making common garden pots and pans and draintiles  most people who could had sold out of it thanking the limited liabilities for its doing them no further harm and the small remnant only hung on because no one could be found to give them even the absurdly small amount that was still said to be the value of their shares  that they would find now harold had fallen in with young yolland who had been singing the old song first of prometesky then of crabbe and had made him listen to it  five pounds would now buy a share that used to be worth a hundred and that with thanks from the seller that he got anything from what had long ceased to pay the ghost of a dividend  and loose cash was not scarce with harold he was able to buy up an amount which perfectly terrified me and made me augur that the hydriot would swallow all boola boola and more too and as to mr yollands promises of improvements no one after past experience could believe in them  now harold you know nothing of all this intricate business and as to these chemical agencies i am sure you know nothing about them  i shall learn  you will only be taken in i went on in my character as good aunt and utterly ruined  no matter if i am  only please at least dont drag in eustace and arghouse  eustace will only have five shares standing in his name to enable him to be chairman  five too many  harold  i cannot see why you involve yourself in all this  you are well off  you dont care for these foolish hopes of gain  i cant see things go so stupidly to wrack  the truth was that he saw in it a continuation of prometeskys work and his fathers so expostulations were vain  he had been thoroughly bitten and was the more excited at finding that dermot and viola tracy were both shareholders  their father had been a believer in crabbe and had taken a good many shares and these had been divided between them at his death  they could not be sold till they were of age and by the time dermot was twentyone no one would buy them and now when they were recalled to his mind he would gladly have made harold a present of them but harold would not even buy them he declared that he wanted dermots vote as a shareholder to help in the majority and in fact the effective male shareholders on the spot were only just sufficient to furnish directors  mr yolland bought two shares that he might have a voice eustace was voted into the chair and the minority was left to consist of the greatlysoured representative of the original crabbe and one other tradesman who held on for the sake as it seemed of maintaining adherence to the red pots and pans as at any rate risking nothing  of course i hated and dreaded it all and it was only by that power which made it so hard to say nay to harold that he got me down to look at the very lair of the hydriot company  it was a melancholy place the buildings were so much larger and the apparatus so much more elaborate than there was any use for and there were so few workmen and those so unhealthy and sinisterlooking  i remember the great red central chimney with underground furnaces all round which opened like the fiery graves where dante placed the bad popes and how dreadfully afraid i was that dora would tumble into one of them so that i was glad to see her held fast by the fascination of the neversuperseded potter and his wheel fashioning the clay while mr yolland discoursed and harold muttered assents to some wonderful scheme that was to economise fuelthe rock on which this furnace had split  it has been explained to me over and over again and i never did more than understand it for one moment and if i did recollect all about it like a scientific dialogue nobody would thank me for putting it in here so it will be enough to say that it sounded to me very bewildering and horribly dangerous not so much to the body as to the pocket and i thought the hydriot bade fair to devour boola boola and harold if not arghouse and eustace into the bargain  they meant to have a staffordshire man down to act as foreman and put things on a better footing  ill write to my brother to send one said mr yolland  hes a curate in the potteries has a wonderful turn for this sort of thing  have you a brother a clergyman i said rather surprised and to fill up harolds silence  yes my brother ben  its his first curacy and his two years are all but up  i dont know if he will stay on  hes a right down jolly good fellow is ben and i wish he would come down here  neither of us echoed the wish  harold had no turn for clergymen after the specimen of mr smith and mr yolland though i could specify nothing against him but that he was rough and easy had offended me by joining us when i wanted harold all to myself besides was he not deluding my nephews into this horrid hydriot company of which they would be the certain victims  the staffordshire man came and the former workmen looked very bitter on him  after a meeting in which the minority made many vehement objections eustace addressed the workmen in the yardsthat is to say he thought he did but harold and mr yolland made his meaning more apparent  a venture in finer workmanship imitating etruscan ware was to be made and if successful would much increase trade and profits and a rise in wages was offered to such as could undertake the workmanship  moreover it was held out to them that they might become the purchasers of shares or half shares at the market price and thus have an interest in the concern whereat they sneered as at some new dodge of the company for taking them in  it did not seem to me that much was done save making harry pore over books and accounts and run his hands through his hair till his thick curls stood up in all directions  and miss woolmer herself was sorry  she remembered the old storynay she had one of prometeskys own figures modelled in terra cotta defective of course as a work of art but with that fire that genius can breathe into the imperfect  she believed it had been meant for the hope of poland  alas the very name reminded one of the old word for despair wanhope  but harold admired it greatly and both he and george yolland seemed to find inspiration in it  but one summer evening when the young men were walking up and down the garden smoking we heard something that caused us to look round for a thundercloud though none could be seen in the clear sky and some quarter of an hour after richardson hurried out to us with the tidings i beg your pardon sir but there is a person come up to say there has been an explosion at the hydriot works  impossible said harold  theres nothing to explode  i beg your pardon sir but it is mr yolland they say has blowed himself up with his experiments and all the old dragons head in lerne street and he is buried under the ruins  it is all one mass of ruin sir and he under it  harold rushed off without further word or query and eustace after him and i had almost to fight to hold back dora and should hardly have succeeded if the two had not disappeared so swiftly that she could not hope to come up with them  i let her put on her things and come down with me to the lodgegate to watch  i was afraid to go any farther and there we waited without even the relief of a report till we had heard the great clock strike quarter after quarter and were expecting it to strike eleven when steps came near at last and eustace opened the gate we threw ourselves upon him and he cried out with surprise then said he is alive  who harold  harold  nonsense  what should be the matter with harold  but he is going to stay with himyolland i meanfor the night  it was all his confounded experiments  it was very well that i went downnothing was being done without a head to direct but they always know what to be at when i come among them  no one there knew the cause of the accident except that it had taken place in mr yollands laboratory where he had been trying experiments  the house itself had been violently shattered and those nearest had suffered considerably  happily it stood in a yard of its own so that none adjoined it and though the fronts of the two opposite dragons heads had broken windows and torn doors no person within them had been more than stunned and bruised  but the former dragons head itself had become a mere pile of stones bricks and timbers  the old couple in charge had happily been out and stood in dismay over the heap which harold and a few of the men were trying to remove in the dismal search for mr yolland and the boy he employed to assist him  the boy was found first fearfully burnt about the face and hands but protected from being crushed by the boards which had fallen slantwise over him  and under another beam which guarded his head but rested on his leg lay young yolland  harolds strength had raised the beam and he was drawn out  he revived as the night air blew on his face looked up as harold lifted him said i have it and fainted the next moment  they had taken him to his lodgings where dr kingston had set the broken leg and bound the damaged rib but could not yet pronounce on the other injuries and harold had taken on himself the watch for the night  the explanation that we all held by was that the damage was caused by an officious act of the assistant who perceiving that it was growing dark fired a match and began to light the gas at the critical moment of the experiment by which the means of obtaining the utmost heat at the smallest expense of fuel was to be attained it was one of those senseless acts that no one would have thought of forbidding and though the boy on recovering his senses owned that the last thing he remembered was getting the matches and mr yolland shouting to stop him there were many who never would believe anything but that it was blundering of his and that he was a dangerous and mischievous person to have in the town  harold came home for a little while just as we were having breakfast to bring a report that his patient had had a much quieter night than he expected and to say that he had telegraphed for the brother and wanted eustace to meet him at the station  the landlady was sitting with the patient now and harold had come home for ice strawberries and above all to ask for help in nursing for the landlady could not and would not do much  i mentioned a motherly woman as perhaps likely to be useful but harold said i could do best with dora  he had so far learnt that it was not the bush as not to expect me to offer and was quite unprepared for the fire that eustace and i opened on him as to the impossibility of his request  miss alison my sister as eustace said going down to a little common general practitioner to wait on him while i confined myself to it wont do at all harold and promised to hunt up the woman and to send her to his aid  but when i had seen her arranged my housekeeping affairs and called dora to lessons she was nowhere to be found  then she has gone after harold indignantly exclaimed eustace  it is too bad  i declare i will put a stop to it  to have my sister demeaning herself to put herself in such a situation for a little union doctor  i laughed and observed that no great harm was done with so small a person only i could not think what use harold could make of her at which eustace was no less surprised for a girl of eight or nine was of no small value in the bush and he said dora had been most helpful in the care of her father  but his dignity was so much outraged that he talked big of going to bring her homeonly he did not go  i was a little wounded at harold having taken her in the face of my opposition but i found that that had not been the case for eustace had walked to the lodge with him and she had rushed after and joined him after he was in the town  and at luncheon eustace fell on me with entreaties that i would come with him and help him meet this parson whom he seemed to dread unreasonably as in fact he always did shrink from doing anything alone when he could get a helper  i thought this would be at least as queer as doras nursing of the other brother but it seemed so hard for the poor man coming down in his anxiety to be met by eustace either in his vague or his supercilious mood that i consented at last so that he might have someone of common sense and walked down with him  we could not doubt which was the right passenger when a young clergyman almost as roughlooking as his brother and as much bearded but black where he was yellow sprang out of a secondclass with anxious looks  it was i who said at one breath there he is speak to him eustace  mr yollandhe is betterhe will do well  thankthank you and the hat was pushed back with a long breath then as he only had a little black bag to look after we all walked together to the lodgings while the poor man looked bewildered and unrealising under eustaces incoherent history of the accidenta far more conjectural and confused story than it became afterwards  i waited till harold came down with dora and to my how could you and eustaces more severe and angry blame she replied he wanted me so of course i went  harold said not a word in defence of her or of himself but when i asked whether she had been of any use he said smiling affectionately at her wasnt she  then we went and looked at the shattered houses and harold showed us where he had drawn out his poor friend answering the aggrieved owners opposite that there would be an inquiry and means would be found for compensation  and when i said it is a bad beginning for the hydriot plans he answered i dont know that and stood looking at the ruins of his dragons head in a sort of brown study till we grew impatient and dragged him home     chapter iv  the wrath of diana   harold did not like clergymen  smith was a clergyman he said with an expressive look and while george yolland had his brother and the nurse i had sent he merely made daily inquiries and sometimes sat an hour with his friend  mr crosses curate had kindred in staffordshire and offered to exchange a couple of sundays with mr benjamin yolland and this resulted in the visitor being discovered to have a fine voice and a great power of preaching and as he was just leaving his present parish this ended in mr crosse begging him to remain permanently not much to harolds gratification but the two brothers were all left of their family and different as their opinions were they were all in all to each other  the agreement with mr crosse would hardly have been made had the brothers known all that was coming  george yolland was in a strange stupefied state for the first day or two owing it was thought to the effects of the gas but he revived into the irritable state of crankiness which could not submit in prudent patience to dr kingstons dicta but argued and insisted on his own treatment of himself and his own theory of the accident till he as good as told the doctor that he was an old woman  whether it were in consequence or not i dont know but as soon as dr kingston could persuade himself that a shock would do no harm he wrote a polite letter explaining that the unfortunate occurrence from which mr yolland was suffering had so destroyed the confidence of his patients that he felt it due to them to take steps to dissolve the partnership  perhaps it was no wonder  such things were told and believed that those who had never yet been attended by george yolland believed him a wild and destructive theorist  miss avice stympson asked miss woolmer how she could sleep in her bed when she knew he was in the town and the most astonishing stories of his practice were current of which i think the mildest was that he had pulled out all a poor girls teeth for the sake of selling them to a london dentist and that when in a state of intoxication he had cut off a mans hand because he had a splinter in his finger  however the effect was that harold summoned a special meeting of the shareholders the same being nearly identical with the directors of the hydriot company and these contrived to get george yolland esquire appointed chemist and manager of the works with a salary of 70 pounds per annum to be increased by a percentage on the sales crabbe objected vehemently but was in the minority  the greater number were thoroughly believers in the discovery made on that unlucky night or else were led away by that force of harolds which was almost as irresistible by mind as by matter  but the tidings were received with horror by the town  three nervous old ladies who lived near the lerne gave notice to quit and many declared that it was an indictable offence  small as the salary was it was more than young yolland was clearing by his connection with dr kingston and as he would have to spare himself during the next few months and could not without danger undertake the exertions of a wide field of union practice the offer was quite worth his acceptance  moreover he had the enthusiasm of a practical chemist and would willingly have starved to see his invention carried out so he received the appointment with the gruff gratitude that best suited harold and he and his brother were to have rooms in the late dragons head so soon as it should have been rebuilt on improved principles with a workmans hall below and a great court for the children to play in by day and the lads in the evening  of the clerical yolland we saw and heard very little  harold was much relieved to find that even before his brother could move beyond the sofa he was always out all day for though he had never spoken a word that sounded official harold had an irrational antipathy to his black attire  nor did i hear him preach except by accident for arghouse chapelry was in the beat of the other curate and in the afternoon when i went to mycening old church he had persuaded mr crosse to let him begin what was then a great innovationa childrens service with open doors in the national schoolroom miss woolmer advised me to try the effect of this upon dora whose sundays were a constant perplexity and reproach to me since she always ran away into the plantations or went with harold to see the horses and if we did succeed in dragging her to church there behaved in the most unedifying manner  i dont like the principle of cutting religion down for children said my old friend  they ought to be taught to think it a favour to be admitted to grownup peoples services and learn to follow them instead of having everything made to please them  it is the sugarplum system and so i told mr ben but he says you must catch wild heathens with sugar and as i am afraid your poor child is not much better you had better try the experiment  i did try it and the metrical litany and the hymns happily took doras fancy so that she submitted to accompany me whenever harold was to sit with george yolland and would not take her  one afternoon when i was not well i was going to send her with colman and harold coming in upon her tempest of resistance and trying to hush it she declared that she would only go if he did and to my amazement he yielded and she led him off in her chains  he made no comment but on the next sunday i found him pocketing an immense parcel of sweets  he walked into the town with us and when i expected him to turn off to his friends lodging he said lucy if you prefer the old church ill take dora to the school  i like the little monkeys  he went and he went again and again towering among the pigmies in the great room kneeling when they knelt adding his deep bass to the curates in their songs responding with them picking up the sleepy and fretful to sit on his knee during the little discourse and the catechising and then outside the door solacing himself and them with a grand distribution of gingerbread and all other dainty cakes especially presenting solid plum buns and even mutton pies where there were pinched looks and pale faces  it was delightful i have been told to see him sitting on the low wall with as many children as possible scrambling over him or sometimes standing up holding a prize above his head to be scrambled for by the lesser urchins  it had the effect of rendering this a highly popular service and the curate was wise enough not to interfere with this anomalous conclusion to the service but to perceive that it might both bless him that gave and those that took  in the early part of the autumn one of the little members of the congregation died and was buried just after the school service harold did not know of it or i do not think he would have been present for he shrank from whatever renewed the terrible agony of that dark time in australia  but the devotions in the school were full of the thought the metrical litany was one specially adapted to the occasion so was the brief address which dwelt vividly in what some might have called too realising a strain upon the glories and the joys of innocents in paradise  and above all the hymns had been chosen with special purpose to tell of those who            for ever and for ever           are clad in robes of white  i knew nothing of all this but when i came home from my own church and went to my own sittingroom i was startled to find harold there leaning over the table with that miniature of little percy which two months before he had bidden me shut up open before him and the tears streaming down his face  in great confusion he muttered i beg your pardon and fled away dashing his handkerchief over his face  i asked dora about it but she would tell nothing i believe she was half ashamed half jealous but it came round through miss woolmer how throughout the address harold had sat with his eyes fixed on the preacher and one tear after another gathering in his eyes  and when the concluding hymn was sungone specially on the joys of paradisehe leant his forehead against the wall and could hardly suppress his sobs  when all was over he handed his bag of sweets to one of the sundayschool teachers muttering give them and strode home  from that time i believe there never was a day that he did not come to my sittingroom to gaze at little percy  he chose the time when i was least likely to be there and i knew it well enough to take care that the coast should be left clear for him  i do believe that illtaught and unheeding as the poor dear fellow had been that service was the first thing that had borne in upon him any sense that his children were actually existing and in joy and bliss and that when he had once thus hearkened to the idea that load of anguish which made him wince at the least recollection of them was taken off  it was not his nature to speak in the freshness of emotion and after a time there was a seal upon his feelings but there was an intermediate period when he sometimes came for sympathy but that was so new a thing to him that he did not quite know how to seek it  it was the next sunday evening that i came into my room at a time i did not expect him to be there just as it was getting dark that he seemed to feel some explanation due  this picture he said it is so like my poor little chap  then he asked me how old percy had been when it was taken and then i found myself listening as he leant against the mantelpiece to a minute description of poor little ambrose all the words he could say his baby plays and his ways of welcoming and clinging to his father even to the very last when he moaned if anyone tried to take him out of harolds arms  it seemed as though the dark shadow and the keen sting had somehow been taken away by the assurance that the child might be thought of full of enjoyment and certainly from that time the peculiar sadness of harolds countenance diminished  it was always grave but the air of oppression went away  i said something about meeting the child again to which harold replied you will may be  and you harold  and as he shook his head and said something about good people i added it would break my heart to think you would not  that made him half smile in his strange sad way and say thank you lucy then add but its no use thinking about it im not that sort  but you are but you are harold i remember crying out with tears god has made you to be nobler and greater and better than any of us if you only would  too late he said  after all i have been and all i have done  too late  harrywith a whole lifetime before you to do god real strong service in  it wont ever cancel that  i tried to tell him what had cancelled all but perhaps i did not do it well enough for he did not seem to enter into it  it was a terrible disadvantage in all this that i had been so lightly taught i had been a fairly good girl i believe and my dear mother had her sweet quiet devotional habits but religion had always sat as it were outside my daily life  i should have talked of performing my religious duties as if they were a sort of toll or custom to be paid to god not as if ones whole life ought to be one religious duty that sudden loss which left me alone in the world made me as it were realise who and what my heavenly father was to me and i had in my loneliness thought more of these things and was learning more every day as i taught dora but it was dreadfully shallow untried knowledge and unfortunately i was the only person to whom harold would talk  mr smiths having been a clergyman had given him a distaste and mistrust of all clergy nor do i think he was quite kindly treated by those around us for they held aloof and treated him as a formidable stranger with an unknown ill repute whose very efforts in the cause of good were untrustworthy  i thought of that mighty man of israel whom god had endowed with strength to save his people and how all was made of little avail because his heart was not whole with god and his doings were selfpleasing and fitful  oh that it might not be thus with my harold might not that little child who had for a moment opened the gates to him yet draw him upwards where naught else would have availed  as to talking to me he did it very seldom but he had a fashion of lingering to hear me teach dora and i found that if he were absent he always made her tell him what she had learnt nor did he shun the meeting me over percys picture in my sittingroom in the twilight sunday hour  now and then he asked me to find him some passage in the bible which had struck him in the brief instruction to the children at the service but what was going on in his mind was entirely out of my reach or scope but that great strength and alertness and keen vivid interest in the world around still made the present everything to him i think his powerfulness and habit of doing impossible things made the thought of prayer and dependencenay even of redemptionmore alien to him as if weakness were involved in it and though to a certain extent he had with prometesky beside him made his choice between virtue and vice beside his uncles deathbed yet it was as yet but the stoic virtue of the old polish patriot that he had embraced  and yet he was not the stoic  he had far more of the little child the christian model in his simplicity his truth his tender heart and that grand modesty of character which though natural is the step to christian humility  how one longed for the voice to say to him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour  and so time went on and we were still in solitude  people came and went had their season in london and returned but it made no difference to us  dermot tracy shot grouse came home and shot partridges and eustace and harold shared their sport with him though harold found it dull cramped work and thought english gentlemen in sad lack of amusement to call that sport  lady diana and viola went to the seaside and came back and what would have been so much to me once was nothing now  pheasant shooting had begun and i had much ado to prevent dora from joining the shooting parties not only when her brother and cousin were alone but when they were going to meet mr tracy and some of the officers to whom he had introduced them  on one of these october days when i was trying to satisfy my discontented dora by a game at ball upon the steps to my extreme astonishment i beheld a white pony led by harold and seated on the same pony no other than my dear little friend unseen for four months viola tracy  i rushed thinking some accident had happened but harold called out in a tone of exultation here she is  now you are to keep her an hour and she held out her arms with lucy lucy dear old lucy and jumped down into mine  but viola your mother  i could not help it she said with a laughing light in her eyes no indeed i could not  i was riding along the lane by lade wood on my white palfrey when in the great dark glade there stood one two three great men with guns and when one took hold of the damsels bridle and told her to come with him what could she do  i think i said something feeble about harold how could you but he first shook his head and led off the pony to the stable observing ill come for you in an hour and dora rushing after him  and when i would have declared that it was very wrong and that lady diana would be very angry the child stopped my mouth with never mind ive got my darling lucy for an hour and i cant have it spoilt  have i never described my viola  she was not tall but she had a way of looking so and she was not pretty yet she always looked prettier than the prettiest person i ever saw  it was partly the way in which she held her head and long neck just like a deer especially when she was surprised and looked out of those great dark eyes whose colour was like that of the lakes of which each drop is clear and limpid and yet when you look down into the water it is of a wonderful clear deep grey  those eyes were her most remarkable feature her hair was light her face went off suddenly into rather too short a chin her cheeks wanted fulness and were generally rather pale  so people said but plump cheeks would have spoilt my violas air of a wild halftamed fawn and lessened the wonderful play of her lips which used often to express far more than ever came out of them in words  lady diana had done her utmost to suppress demonstrativeness but unless she could have made those eyes less transparent the corners of that mouth less flexible and hindered the colour from mantling in those cheeks she could not have kept violas feelings from being patent to all who knew her  and now the child was really lovely with the sweet carnation in her cheeks and eyes dancing with the fear and pretence at alarm and the delight of a stolen interview with me  forth stepped the giant  fee fo fum said she took me by the bridle and said why havent you been to see my aunt lucy  i must not she said  and i say you must he answered  do you know she is wearying to see you  then i fancy how violas tears would swim in her eyes as she said its not me its mamma  and he answered now it is not you but i that is taking you to see her  should auld acquaintance be forgot was whistled out of the wood and the whistle viola knew quite well enough to disarm me when i came to the argument what was to become of her if she let such things be done with her and she had quite enough of dermots composition in her to delight in a little bit of naughtiness that wasnt too bad and when once she had resigned herself into the hands of her captor she enjoyed it and twittered like a little bird and i believe harold really did it just as he would have caught a rare bird or wild fawn to please me  then you were not frightened i said  frightened  no  it was such fun  besides we heard how he mastered the lion to save that poor little boy and how he has looked after him ever since and is going to bind him apprentice  oh mind you show me his skinthe lions i mean  dont be tiresome lucy and how he goes on after the childrens service with the dear little things  i should think him the last person to be afraid of  i wish your mother saw it so  viola put on a comically wise look and shook her head as she said you didnt go the right way to work  if you had come back in the carriage and consulted her and said it was a missionyes a missionfor you to stand with a lily in your hand and reform your two bushranger nephews and that you wanted her consent and advice then she would have let you go back and be good aunt and whatnot oh i wish you had lucy  that was the way dermot managed about getting the lodge at biston  he says he could consult her into going out hunting  for shame viola  o fie  o vi said i according to an old formula of reproof  really i wanted to tell you  it might not be too late if you took to consulting her now and i cant bear being shut up from you everything is grown so stupid  when one goes to a gardenparty there are nothing but horsmans and stympsons and they all get into sets of themselves and each other and now and then coalesce especially the stympsons to pity poor miss alison wonder at her not taking mammas advice and say how horrid it is of her to live with her cousins ive corrected that so often that i take about with me the word nephews written in large text to confute them and ive actually taught cocky to say nephews arent cousins  dermot is the only rational person in the neighbourhood  im always trying to get him to tell me about you but he says he cant come up here much without giving a handle to the harpies  i had scarcely said how good it was in dermot when he sauntered in there you are vi im come to your rescue you know he said in his lazy way and disposed himself on the bearskin as we sat on the sofa i tried again to utter a protest  oh dermot it was all your doing  thats rather too bad  as if i could control your domestic liontamer  you abetted him  you could have prevented him  such being your wish  i am thinking of your mother  eh viola is the meeting worth the reckoning  you should not teach her your own bad ways said i resisting her embrace  come we had better be off dermot she said pouting we did not come here to be scolded  i thought you did not come of your own free will at all i said and then i found i had hurt her and i had to explain that it was the disobedience that troubled me whereupon they both argued seriously that people were not bound to submit to a cruel and unreasonable prejudice which had set the country in arms against us monstrous dermot said that two fellows should suffer for their fathers sins and such fellows and you too for not being unnatural to your own flesh and blood  but that does not make it right for viola to disobey her mother  and how is it to be lucy asked viola  are we always to go on in this dreadful way  by this time eustace could no longer be withheld from paying his respects to the lady guest and harold and dora came with him bringing the kangaroo for which viola had entreated and she also made him fetch the lionskin which had been dressed and lined and made into a beautiful carriagerug and to dora she owed the exhibition of the great scar across harolds left palm which though now no inconvenience he would carry through life  it was but for a moment for as soon as he perceived that dora meant anything more than her usual play with his fingers he coloured and thrust his hand into his pocket  we all walked through the grounds with viola and when we parted she hung about my neck and assured me that now she had seen me she should not grieve half so much and let mamma say what she would she could not be sorry and i had no time to fight over the battle of the sorrow being for wrongdoing not for reproof for the pony would bear no more last words  eustace had behaved all along with much politeness in fact he was always seen to most advantage with strangers for his manners had some training and a little constraint was good for him by repressing some of his sayings  his first remark when the brother and sister were out of hearing was a very sweet lively young lady  i never saw her surpassed in sydney  i should think not said harold  well you know i have been presented and have been to a ball at government house  theres an air a tournure about her such as uncle smith says belongs to the real aristocracy and you saw she was quite at her ease with me  we understand each other in the higher orders dont be afraid lucy we shall yet bring back your friend to you  im glad she is gone said dora true to her jealousy  i like dermot hes got some sense in him but shes not half so nice and pretty as lucy  at which we all laughed for i had never had any attempt at beauty except i believe good hair and teeth and a habit of looking goodhumoured  shes a tiptopper pronounced eustace and no wonder considering who she is  has she been presented lucy  though she had not yet had that inestimable advantage eustace showed himself so much struck with her that when next harold found himself alone with me he built a very remarkable castle in the airnamely a wedding between eustace and viola tracy  if i saw him with such happiness as that said harold it would be all right  i should have no fears at all for him  dont you think it might be lucy  i dont think you took the way to recommend the family to lady diana i said laughing  i had not thought of it then said harold im always doing something wrong  i wonder if i had better go back and keep out of his way  he guessed what i should answer i believe for i was sure that eustace would fail without harold and i told him that his cousin must not be left to himself till he had a good wife  to which harold replied are all english ladies like that  he had an odd sort of answer the next day when we were all riding together and met another riding partynamely the head of the horsman family and his two sisters who had been on the continent when my nephews arrived  mamma did not like them and we had never been great friends but they hailed me quite demonstratively with their eager ringing voices lucy  lucy alison  so glad to see you  here we are again  introduce us pray  so i did  mr horsman miss hippolyta and miss philippa horsmanbaby jack hippo and pippa as they were commonly termedand we all rode together as long as we were on the roman road while they conveyed rather loudly information about the dolomites  they were five or six years older than i and the recollection of childish tyranny and compulsion still made me a little afraid of them they excelled in all kinds of sports in which we younger ones had not had nearly so much practice and did not much concern themselves whether the sport were masculine or feminine to the distress of the quiet elder halfsister who stayed at home like a hen with ducklings to manage  they spoke of calling and while i could not help being grateful i knew how fallen my poor mother would think me to welcome the notice of pippa and hippo  most enthusiastic was the latter as she rode behind with me looking at the proportions of harry and his horse some little way on before with dora on one side and pippa rattling on the other  splendid  splendiferous  more than i was prepared for though i heard all about the lionand that he has been a regular stunner in australiaeh lucy just like a hero of whytemelvilles eh  i dont think so  and to complete it all what has he been doing to little viola tracy oh what fun  carrying her off bodily to see you wasnt it lady diana is in such a rage as never wassays dermot is never to be trusted with his sister again and wont let her go beyond the garden without her  oh the fun of it  i would have gone anywhere to see old lady dis face     chapter v  the capture in the snow   i do not recollect anything happening for a good while  our chief event was the perfect success of mr yollands concentrated fuel which did not blow up anything or anybody and the production of some lovely etruscan vases and tiles for which i copied the designs out of a book i happily discovered in the library  they were sent up to the porcelain shops in london and orders began to come in to the great exultation of harold and co an exultation which i could not help partaking even while it seemed to me to be plunging him deeper and deeper in the dangerous speculation  we put the vases into a shop in the town and wondered they did not sell but happily people at a distance were kinder and native genius was discovered in a youth who soon made beautiful designs  but i do not think the revived activity of the unpopular pottery did us at that time any good with our neighbours  harold and eustace sent in their subscriptions to the hunt and were not refused but there were rumours that some of the stympsons had threatened to withdraw  i had half a mind to ride with them to the meet but i could not tell who would cut me and i knew the mortification would be so keen to them that i could not tell how they would behave and i was afraid eustaces pride in his scarlet coat might be as manifest to others as to us and make me blush for him  so i kept dora and myself at home  i found that by the management of dermot tracy and his friends the slight had been less apparent than had been intended when all the other gentlemen had been asked in to mr stympsons to breakfast and they had been left out with the farmers dermot had so resented this that he had declined going into the house and ridden to the village inn with them  to my surprise eustace chose to go on hunting because it asserted his rights and showed he did not care and besides the hard riding was almost a necessity to both the young men and the foling hounds beyond biston were less exclusive and they were welcomed there  i believe their horsemanship extorted admiration from the whole field and that they were gathering acquaintance though not among those who were most desirable  the hunting that was esteemed hard exercise here was nothing to them  they felt cramped and confined even when they had had the longest runs and disdained the inclosures they were forced to respect  i really dont know what harold would have done but for kalydon moor where he had a range without inclosures of some twelve miles  i think he rushed up there almost every day and thus kept himself in health and able to endure the confinement of our civilised life  a very hard winter set in unusually early and with a great deal of snow in december  it was a great novelty to our australians and was not much relished by eustace who did not enjoy the snowballing and snow fortification in which harold and dora revelled in front of the house all the forenoon  after luncheon when the snowstorm had come on too thickly for dora to go out again harold insisted on going to see how the world looked from the moor  i entreated him not to go far telling him how easy it was to lose the way when all outlines were changed in a way that would baffle even a black fellow but he listened with a smile took a plaid and a cap and sallied forth  i played at shuttlecock for a good while with dora and then at billiards with eustace and when evening had closed darkly in and the whole outside world was blotted out with the flakes and their mist i began to grow a little anxious  the hall was draughty but there was a huge wood fire in it and it seemed the best place to watch in so there we sat together and eustace abused the climate and i told storiesdismal ones i fearabout sheep and shepherds dogs and snowdrifts to the tune of that peculiar howl that the wind always makes when the blast is snowladen and dinner time came and i could not make up my mind to go and dress so as to be out of reach ofi dont know what i expected to happen  certainly what did happen was far from anything i had pictured to myself  battling with the elements and plunging in the snow and seeing whenever it slackened so strange and new a world was a sort of sport to harold and he strode on making his goal the highest point of the moor whence if it cleared a little he would be able to see to a vast distance  he was curious too to look down into the railway cutting this was a sort of twig from a branch of the main line chiefly due to lord erymanth who after fighting off the railway from all points adjacent to his estate had found it so inconvenient to be without a station within reasonable distance that a single line had at last been made from mycening for the benefit of the places in this direction but not many trains ran on it for it was not much frequented  harold came to the brow of the cutting and there beheld the funnel of a locomotive engine locomotive no more but firmly embedded in the snowdrift into which it had run with a poor little train of three or four carriages behind it already half buried  not a person was to be seen as harold scrambled and slid down the descent and lighted on the top of one of the carriages for as it proved the engineer stoker and two or three passengers had left the train an hour before and were struggling along the line to the nearest station  harold got down on the farther side which was free of snow and looked into all the carriages  no one was there till in a firstclass one he beheld an old gentleman well wrapped up indeed but numb stiff and dazed with the sleep out of which he was roused  tickets eh he said and he dreamily held one out to harold and tried to get up but he stumbled and hardly seemed to understand when harold told him it was not the station but that they had run into the snowdrift he only muttered something about being met staggered forward and fell into harolds arms  there was a carriagebag on the seat but harold looked in vain there for a flask  the poor old man was hardly sensible  ours was the nearest house and harold saw that the only chance for the poor old gentlemans life was to carry him home at once  even for him it was no small effort for his burthen was a sturdy man with the solidity of years and nearly helpless save that the warmth of harolds body did give him just life and instinct to hold on and let himself be bound to him with the long plaid so as least to impede his movements but only one possessed of harolds almost giant strength could have thus clambered the cutting at the nearest point to arghouse and plodded through the snow  the only wonder is that they were not both lost  their track was marked as long as that snow lasted by mighty holes  it was at about a quarterpast seven that all the dogs barked a fumbling was heard at the door and a muffled voice let me in  then in stumbled a heap of snow panting and amid spitzs frantic barks we saw it was harold bent nearly double by the figure tied to him  he sank on his knee so as to place his burthen on the great couch gasping untie me and as i undid the knot he rose to his feet panting heavily and in spite of the cold bathed in perspiration  get something hot for him directly he said falling back into an armchair while we broke out in exclamations  whowhere did you find him  some poor old beggar  not too near the firecall richardsonhot brandyandwaterbed  hes some poor old beggar and such outcries for a moment or two till harold recovering himself in a second explained snowed up in the train  here lucy eustace rub his hands  dora ask richardson for something hot  are you better now sir beginning to pull off the boots that he might rub his feet but this measure roused the traveller who resisted crying out dont dont my good man ill reward you handsomely im a justice of the peace  thick and stifled as it was the voice was familiar  i looked again and screamed out lord erymanth is it you  that roused him and as i took hold of both hands and bent over him he looked up dazzled and muttering lucy lucy alison  arghouse how came i here and then as the hot cordial came at last in the hand of richardson who had once been in his service he swallowed it and then leant back and gazed at me as i went on rubbing his hands  thank you my dear  is it you  i thought i was snowed up and i have never signed that codicil about little viola or i could die easily  it is not such a severe mode after all  but youre not dying youre only dreaming  you are at arghouse harold here found you and brought you to us  and then we agreed that he had better be put to bed at once in eustaces room as there was already a fire there and any other would take long in being warmed  harold and eustace got him upstairs between them and richardson followed while i looked out with dismay at the drifting snow and wondered how to send either for a doctor or for lady diana in case of need  he had been a childless widower for many years and had no one nearer belonging to him  dora expressed her amazement that i did not go to help but i knew this would have shocked him dreadfully and i only sent colman to see whether she could be of any use  harold came out first and on his way to get rid of his snowsoaked garments paused to tell me that the old gentleman had pretty well come round and was being fed with hot soup and wine while he seemed half asleep  he is not frostbitten added harold but if he is likely to want the doctor id better go on to mycening at once before i change my things  but i knew lord erymanth to be a hale strong man of his years little given to doctors and as i heard he had said no no when eustace proposed to send for one i was glad to negative the proposal from a man already wet through and tiredwell just a little  our patient dropped asleep almost as soon as he had had his meal in the very middle of a ceremonious speech of thanks which sent eustace down to dinner more than ever sure that there was nothing like the aristocracy who all understood one another and we left richardson to watch over him and sleep in the dressingroom in case of such a catastrophe as a rheumatic waking in the night  we were standing about the fire in the hall our usual morning waitingplace before breakfast and had just received richardsons report that his lordship had had a good night seemed none the worse and would presently appear but that he desired we would not wait breakfast when there was a hasty ring at the door and no sooner was it opened than dermot tracy battered and worn in a souwester sprinkled with snow and with boots up to his thighs burst into the hall  alison you there  all right i want you shaking hands in an agitated way all round and speaking very fast with much emotion i want you to come and search for my poor uncle  he was certainly in the train from mycening that ran into a drift  men went to get help couldnt get back for three hours  he wasnt therenever arrived at home   my mother is in a dreadful state  hogg is setting all the men to dig at the erymanth end  ive got a lot to begin in the kalydon cutting but youll come alison youll be worth a dozen of them  he might be alive still you see  thank you dermot i am happy to say that such is the case said a voice from the oak staircase and down it was slowly proceeding lord erymanth as trim and portly and well brushedup as if he had arrived behind his two longtailed bays  dermot with his eyes full of tears which he was squeezing and winking away and his rapid broken voice had seen and heard nothing in our faces or exclamations to prepare him  he started violently and sprang forward meeting lord erymanth at the foot of the stairs and wringing both his handsnay i almost thought he would have kissed him as he broke out into some incoherent cry of scarcelybelieving joy which perhaps surprised and touched the old man there there dermot my boy your solicitude isis honourable to you but restrainrestrain it my dear boywe are not alone  and he advanced a little rheumatically to us holding out his hand with morning greetings  i must send to my mother  joe is here with the sleigh said dermot uncle how did you come here he added as reflection only made his amazement profounder  it is true as you said just now that mr harold alison is equal to a dozen men  i owe my preservation under providence to him said lord erymanth who though not a small man had to look far up as harold stood towering above us all  my most earnest acknowledgments are due to him he added solemnly holding out his hand  i might have expected that ejaculated dermot while harold took the offered hand with a smile and a mutter in his beard of i am very glad  ill just send a line to satisfy my mother said dermot taking a pen from the inkstand on the halltable  joes here with the sleigh and we must telegraph to george st glear  lord erymanth repeated the name in some amazement for he was not particularly fond of his heir  hogg telegraphed to him this morning and as the uncle observed somewhat premature he went on poor hogg was beside himself he came to arked at ten oclock last night to look for you and luckily i was there so weve been hallooing half the night along the line and then getting men together in readiness for the search as soon as it was light  i must be off to stop them at once  i came in to get the alisons helpnever dreamt of such a thing as finding you here  and after all i dont understandhow did you come  i cannot give you a detailed account said his lordship  mr harold alison roused me from a drowsiness which might soon very probably have been fatal and brought me here  i have no very distinct recollection of the mode and i fear i must have been a somewhat helpless and encumbering burthen  dora put in her oar  harry can carry anything she said he brought you in so nicely on his backjust as i used to ride  on his back  yes said dora who was fond of mr tracy and glad to impart her information on his back with his boots sticking out on each side so funnily  lord erymanth endeavoured to swallow the information suavely by the help of a classical precedent and said with a gracious smile then i perceive we must have played the part of aeneas and anchises but before he had got so far the idea had been quite too much for dermot who cried out pickaback  with his boots sticking out on both sides  thank you dora  oh my uncle pickaback and went off in an increasing uncontrollable roar of laughter while harold with a great tug to his moustache observed apologetically to lord erymanth it was the only way i could do it which speech had the effect of so prolonging poor dermots mirth that all the good effect of the feeling he had previously displayed for his uncle was lost and lord erymanth observed in his most dry and solemn manner there are some people who can see nothing but food for senseless ridicule in the dangers of their friends  my dear lord erymanth i said almost wild do just consider dermot has been up all night and has had nothing to eat and is immensely relieved to find you all safe  he cant be expected to quite know what he is about when he is so shaken  come to breakfast and we shall all be better  that might be a very sufficient excuse for you or for viola my dear lucy returned lord erymanth taking however the arm i offered young ladies may be very amiably hysterical but a young man in my day who had not trifled away his manliness would be ashamed of such an excuse  there was a certain truth in what he said  dermot was not then so strong nor had he the selfcommand he would have had if his life had been more regular but he must always have had a much more sensitive and emotional nature than his uncle could ever understand the reproach however sobered him in a moment and he followed us gravely into the diningroom without uttering a word for the next quarter of an hour neither did harold who was genuinely vexed at having made the old man feel himself ridiculous and was sorry for the displeasure with his friend  nobody did say much except eustace who was delighted at having to play host to such distinguished guests and lord erymanth himself who was so gracious and sententious as quite to restore dermots usual self by the time breakfast was over and he saw his servant bringing back his sleigh in which he offered to convey his uncle either home or to arked  but it was still fitfully snowing and lord erymanth was evidently not without touches of rheumatism which made him lend a willing ear to our entreaties to him not to expose himself  harold then undertook to go in search of his portmanteau either to the scene of the catastrophe or the hall  my dear sir i could not think of exposing you to a repetition of such inclement weather as you have already encountered  i am well supplied here my young friendi think i may use the term considering that two generations ago at least a mutual friendship existed between the houses which however obscured for a timehumhumhummay be said still to exist towards my dear friends very amiable young daughter and although i may have regretted as hasty and premature a decision that as her oldest and most experiencedi may say paternalfriend i ventured to questionyou will excuse my plain speaking i am always accustomed to utter my sentiments freelyyet on better acquaintancebrought about as it was in a manner which however peculiar and i may say unpleasantcannot do otherwise than command my perpetual gratitudei am induced to revoke a verdict uttered perhaps rather with a view to the antecedents than to the individuals and to express a hope that the ancient family ties may again assert themselves and that i may again address as such mr alison of arghouse  that speech absolutely cleared the field of harold and dermot both one strode the other backed to the door dermot hastily said goodbye then uncle i shall look you up tomorrow but i must go and stop george st glear and harold made no further ceremony but departed under his cover  probably richardson had spoken a word or two in our favour to his former master for when lord erymanth was relieved from his nephews trying presence he was most gracious and his harangues much as they had once fretted me had now a familiar sound as proving that we were no longer at the back of the north wind while eustace listened with rapt attention both to the long words and to anything coming from one whose name was enrolled in his favourite volume who likewise discovered in him likenesses to generations past of alisons and seemed ready to admit him to all the privileges for which he had been six months pining  at the first opportunity lord erymanth began to me my dear lucy it is a confession that to some natures may seem humiliating but i have so sedulously cultivated candour for my whole term of existence that i hope i may flatter myself that i am not a novice in the great art of retracting a conclusion arrived at under premises which though probable have proved to be illusory  i therefore freely confess that i have allowed probability to weigh too much with me in my estimation of these young men  i almost jumped for joy as i cried out that i knew he would think so when he came to know them  yes i am grateful to the accident that has given me the opportunity of judging for myself quoth lord erymanth and with a magnanimity which i was then too inexperienced to perceive he added i can better estimate the motives which made you decide on fixing your residence with your nephews and i have no reluctance in declaring them natural and praiseworthy  i showed my satisfaction in my old friends forgiveness but he still went on still my dear you must allow me to represent that your residence here though it is selfinnocent exposes you to unpleasant complications  i cannot think it well that a young lady of your age should live entirely with two youths without female society and be constantly associating with such friends as they may collect round them  i remember now how the unshed tears burnt in my eyes as i said the female society had left me to myself and begged to know with whom i had associated  in return i heard something that filled me with indignation about his nephew dermot tracy not being exactly the companion for an unchaperoned young lady far less his sporting friends or that young man who had been dr kingstons partner  he was very sorry for me as he saw my cheeks flaming but he felt it right that i should be aware  i told him how i had guarded myselfnever once come across the sportsmen and only seen mr yolland professionally when he showed me how to dress harolds hand besides the time when he went over the pottery with us  nay dermot himself had only twice come into my companyonce about his sister and once to inquire after harold after the adventure with the lion  there i found i had alluded to what made lord erymanth doubly convinced that i must be blinded my sight must be amiably obscured as to the unfitnesshe might say the impropriety of such companions for me  he regretted all the more where his nephew was concerned but it was due to me to warn to admonish me of the true facts of the case  i did not see how i could want any admonition of the true facts i had seen with my own eyes  he was intensely astonished and did not know how to believe that i had actually seen the lion overpowered whereupon i begged to know what he had heard  he was very unwilling to tell me but it came out at last that dermot and haroldbeing he feared in an improperly excited conditionhad insisted on going to the den with the keeper and had irritated the animal by wanton mischief and he was convinced that this could not have taken place in my presence  i was indignant beyond measure  had not dermot told him the true story  he shook his head and was much concerned at having to say so but he had so entirely ceased to put any confidence in dermots statements that he preferred not listening to them  and i knew it was vain to try to show him the difference between deliberate falsehood which was abhorrent to dermot and the exaggerations and mystifications to which his uncles solemnity always prompted him  i appealed to the county paper but he had been abroad at the time and had moreover been told that the facts had been hushed up  happily he had some trust in my veracity and let me prove my perfect alibi for harold as well as for dermot  when i represented how those two were the only men among some hundreds who had shown either courage or coolness he granted it with the words true true  of course of course  thats the way good blood shows itself hereditary qualities are sure to manifest themselves  then he let me exonerate harold from the charge of intemperance pointing out that not even after the injury and operation nor after yesterdays cold and fatigue had he touched any liquor but i dont think the notion of teetotalism was gratifying even when i called it a private individual vow  nor could i make out whether his australian life was known and i was afraid to speak of it lest i should be betraying what need never be mentioned  of violas adventure to my surprise her uncle did not make much but he had heard of that from the fountainhead unpolluted by stympson gossip and moreover lady diana had been so disproportionately angry as to produce a reaction in him  viola was his darling and he had taken her part when he had found that she knew her brother was at hand  he allowed too that she might fairly be inspired with confidence by the voice and countenance of her captor whom he seemed to view as a goodnatured giant  but even this was an advance on the prizefighter as lady diana and the stympsons called him  it was an amusing thing to hear the old earl moralising on the fortunate conjunction of circumstances which had brought the property contrary to all expectation to the most suitable individual  much did i long for harold to return and show what he was but only his lordships servant letters and portmanteau came on an improvised sleigh  he had an immense political county and benevolent correspondence and was busied with it all the rest of the day eustace hovered about reverentially and obligingly and secured the good opinion which had been already partly gained by the statement of the police at the quarter sessions whence lord erymanth had been returning that they never had had so few cases from the hydriot potteries as during this last quarter  who could be complimented upon this happy state of things save the chairman  and who could appropriate the compliment more readily or with greater delight  even i felt that it would be cruel high treason to demonstrate which was the mere chess king  poor eustace  harold had infected me enough with care for him to like to see him in such glory though somewhat restless as to the appearances of this first state dinner of ours and at harolds absence but happily the wellknown step was in the hall before our guest came downstairs and eustace dashed out to superintend the toilette that was to be as worthy of meeting with an earl as nature and garments would permit  fit to be seen i heard harold growl of course i do when i dine with lucy and this is only an old man  eustace and richardson had disinterred and brushed up harolds only black suit ordered as mourning for his wife and never worn but at his uncles funeral but three years expansion of chest and shoulder had made it pinion him so as to lessen the air of perfect ease which without being what is called grace was goodly to look upon  eustaces studs were in his shirt and the unnatural shine on his tawny hair too plainly revealed the perfumeries that crowded the young squires dressingtable  with the purest intentions of kindness eustace had done his best to disguise a demigod as a lout  we had a diner a la russe to satisfy eustaces aspirations as to the suitable  i had been seeking resources for it all the afternoon and building up erections with richardson and colman and when poor harold who had been out in the snow with nothing to eat since breakfast beheld it he exclaimed lucy why did you not tell me i could have gone over to mycening and brought you home a leg of mutton  dont expose what a cub you are muttered the despairing eustace it is a deena a la roos  i thought the russians ate blubber observed harold somewhat unfeelingly though i dont think he saw the joke but i managed to reassure him sotto voce as to there being something solid in the background  he was really ravenous and it was a little comedy to see the despairing contempt with which he regarded the dainty little mouthfuls that the cook viewed with triumph and eustace in equal misery at his savage appetite while lord erymanth far too real a gentleman to be shocked at a mans eating when he was hungry was quite insensible of the byplay until harold reduced to extremity at sight of one delicate shaving of turkeys breast burst out i say richardson i must have some food  cut me its leg please at once  harry faintly groaned eustace while lord erymanth observed ah there is no such receipt for an appetite as shooting in the snow i remember when a turkeys leg would have been nothing to me after being out duckshooting in kalydon bog  have you been there today there would be good sport  no said harold contented at last with the great leg which seemed in the same proportion to him as a chickens to other men  i have been getting sheep out of the snow  i elicited from him that he had in making his way to erymanth heard the barking of a dog and found that a shepherd and his flock had taken refuge in a hollow of the moor which had partly protected them from the snow but whence they could not escape  the shepherd a drover who did not know the locality had tried with morning light to find his way to help but spent and exhausted would soon have perished had not harold been attracted by the dog  after dragging him to the nearest farm harold left the man to be restored by food and fire while performing his own commission at the castle and then returned to spend the remainder of the daylight hours in helping to extricate the sheep and convey them to the farmyard so that only five had been lost  an excellent not to say a noble manner of spending a winters day quoth the earl  i am a sheep farmer myself was the reply  lord erymanth really wanted to draw him out and began to ask about australian stockfarming but harolds slowness of speech left eustace to reply to everything and when once the rage of hunger was appeased the harangues in a warm room after twenty miles walk in the snow and the carrying some hundreds of sheep one by one in his arms produced certain nods and snores which were no favourable contrast with eustaces rapt attention  for honestly eustace thought these speeches the finest things he had ever heard and though he seldom presumed to understand them he listened earnestly and even imitated them in a sort of disjointed way now lord erymanth if one could manage to follow him was always coherent  his sentences would parse and went on uniform principlesnamely the repeating every phrase in finer words with all possible qualifications whereas eustace never accomplished more than catching up some sonorous period but as his manners were at their best when he was overawed and nine months in england had so far improved his taste that he did not once refer to his presentation at government house he made such an excellent impression that lord erymanth announced that he was going to give a ball to introduce his niece miss tracy on her seventeenth birthday in january and invited us all thereto  eustaces ecstacy was unbounded  he tried to wake harold to share it but only produced some murmurs about halfinch bullets only when the goodnight came did harold rouse up and then of course he was wide awake and while eustace was escorting the distinguished guest to his apartment we stood over the hall fire enjoying his delight and the prospect of his being righted with the county  and you will have your friends again lucy added harold  yes i dont suppose lady diana will hold out against him  he will prepare the way  and said eustace coming downstairs it is absolutely necessary that you go and be measured for a dress suit harry  i will certainly never get into this again he said with a thwarted sigh its all i can do to help splitting it down the back you must get it off as you got it on  not here entreated eustace alarmed at his gesture  remember the servant  oh harold if you could but be more the gentleman  why cannot you take example by me instead of overthrowing all the advantageous impressions that suchsuch a service has created  i really think theres nothing he would not do for me  dont you think so lucy  could he do anything for prometesky asked harold  he could more than anyone i said but i dont know if he would  ill see about that  now harold cried eustace in dismay dont spoil everything by offending him  just suppose he should not send us the invitation  no great harm done  eustace was incoherent in his wrath and horror and harold too much used to his childish  selfishness to feel the annoyance answered i am not you  but if you offend him  never fear eu ill take care you dont fare the worse  and as he lighted his candle he added to poor eustaces discomfiture by the shocking utterance under his beard  you are welcome to him for me if you can stand such an old bore     chapter vi  ogdens buildings   when i came downstairs the next morning i found lord erymanth at the hall window watching the advance of a great waggon of coal which had stuck fast in the snow half way up the hill on which the house stood harold a much more comfortable figure in his natural costume than he had been when made up by eustace was truly putting his shoulder to the wheel with a great lever so that every effort aided the struggling horses and brought the whole nearer to its destination  a grand exhibition of strength said his lordship as the waggon was at last over its difficulties and harold disappeared with it into the backyard a magnificent physical development  i never before saw extraordinary height with proportionate size and strength  i asked if he had ever seen anyone as tall  i have seen one or two men who looked equally tall but they stooped and were not wellproportioned whereas your nephew has a wonderfully fine natural carriage  what is his measure he added turning to eustace  well really my lord i cannot tell mine is six feet two and fivesixteenths and i much prefer it to anything so out of the way as his poor fellow  the danger that he would go on to repeat his tailors verdict that it was distinguished without being excessive was averted by harolds entrance and dora interrupted the greetings by the query to her cousin how high he really stood but he could not tell and when she unfraternally pressed to know whether it was not nice to be so much taller than eustace he replied not on board ship and then he gave the intelligence that it seemed about to thaw  lord erymanth said that if so he should try to make his way to mycening and he then paid his renewed compliments on the freedom of the calendar at the quarter sessions from the usual proportion of evils at mycening  he understood that mr alison was making most praiseworthy efforts to impede the fatal habits of intoxication that were only too prevalent  i shall close five beerhouses at christmas said eustace  i look on it as my duty as landlord and man of property  quite right  i am glad you see the matter in its right light beershops were a wellmeaning experiment started some twenty years ago  i well remember the debate c  harold tried with all his might to listen though i saw his chest heave with many a suppressed yawn and his hand under his beard tweaking it hard but substance could be sifted out of what lord erymanth said for he had real experience and his own parish was in admirable order  where there was no power of expulsion as he said there would always be some degraded beings whose sole amusement was intoxication but good dwellinghouses capable of being made cheerful gardens innocent recreations and instruction had he could testify from experience no small effect in preventing such habits from being formed in the younger population backed as he was sure good old man that he need not tell his young friends by an active and efficient clergyman who would place the motives for good conduct on the truest and highest footing without which all reformation would only be surface work  i was glad harold should hear this from the lips of a layman but i am afraid he shirked it as a bit of prosing and went back to the cottages  they are in a shameful state he said  they are to be improved exclaimed eustace eagerly  as i told bullock i am quite determined that mine shall be a model parish  i am ready to make any sacrifices to do my duty as a landlord though bullock says that no outlay on cottages ever pays and that the test of their being habitable is their being let and that the people are so ungrateful that they do not deserve to have anything done for them  you are not led away by such selfish arguments said lord erymanth  no assuredly not said eustace decidedly though i do wish harold would not disagree so much with bullock  he is a very civil man and much in earnest in promoting my interests  thats not all put in harold  and i cant bear bullock i said  our interest has been always his cry whenever the least thing has been proposed for the cottage people and i know how much worse he let things get than we ever supposed  on which lord erymanth spoke out his distinct advice to get rid of bullock telling us how he had been a servants orphan whom my father had intended to apprentice but being placed with our old bailiff for a time had made himself necessary and ingratiated himself with my father so as to succeed to the situation and it had been the universal belief ever since my mothers widowhood that he had taken advantage of her seclusion and want of knowledge of business to deal harshly by the tenants especially the poor and to feather his own nest  it was only what harold had already found out for himself but it disposed of his scruples about old adherents and it was well for eustace to hear it from such oracular lips as might neutralise the effect of bullocks flattery for it had become quite plain to my opened eyes that he was trying to gain the squires ear and was very jealous of harold  i knew too that to listen to his advice was the way to lord erymanths heart and rejoiced to hear harold begging for the names of recent books on drainage and consulting our friend upon the means of dealing with a certain small farm in a tiny inclosed valley on an outlying part of the property where the yard and outhouses were in a permanent state of horrors but interference was alike resented by bullock and the farmer though the wife and family were piteous spectacles of ague and rheumatism and low fever smouldered every autumn in the hamlet  very sound advice was given and accepted with pertinent questions such as i thought must convince anyone of harolds superiority when he must needs produce a long blue envelope and beg lord erymanth to look at it and tell him how to get it presented to the secretary of state  it was graciously received but no sooner did the name of stanislas prometesky strike the earls eyes than he exclaimed that rascally old demagogue  the author of all the mischief  it was the greatest error and weakness not to have had him executed  you have not seen my fathers statement  statement sir  i read statements till i was sick of them absolutely disgusted with their reiteration and what could they say but that he was a pole   a pole the word uttered with infinite loathing  as if the very name were not a sufficient conviction of whatever is seditious and treasonable only that people are sentimental about it forsooth  certainly it was droll to suspect sentiment in the great broad giant who indignantly made reply the poles have been infamously treated  no more than they deserved said lord erymanth startled for once into brevity  a nation who could never govern themselves decently and since they have been broken up as they richly deserved though i do not justify the mannerever since i say have been acting the incendiary in every country where they have set foot  i would as soon hear of an infernal machine in the country as a pole  poles deserve justice as well as other men said harold perhaps the more doggedly because eustace laid a restraining hand on his arm  do you mean to tell me sir that every man has not received justice at the tribunal of this country exclaimed lord erymanth  perhaps he recollected that he was speaking to the son of a convict for there was a moments pause into which i launched myself  dear lord erymanth i said we all know that my poor brothers did offend against the laws and were sentenced according to them  they said so themselves and that they were mistaken did they not harold  harold bent his head  and owing to whom demanded lord elymanth  i never thought of blaming those two poor lads as i did that fellow who led them astray i did all i could to save their lives if they were alive this moment i would wish nothing better than to bring them home but as to asking me to forward a petition in favour of the hoary old rebel that perverted them i should think it a crime  but i said if you would only read this you would see that what they wanted to explain was that the man who turned kings evidence did not show how count prometesky tried to withhold them  count indeed  just like all women  all those poles are counts all thaddeuses of warsaw  thats hard i said  i only called him count because it would have shocked you if i had given him no prefix  will you not see what poor ambrose wanted to say for him  ah said lord erymanth after a pause in which he had really glanced over the paper  poor boys  it goes to my heart to think what fine fellows were lost there but compassion for them cannot soften me towards the man who practised on their generous unsuspecting youth  i am quite aware that prometesky saved life at the fire and his punishment was commuted on that account contrary to my judgment for it is a wellknown axiom that the author of a riot is responsible for all the outrages committed in it and it is undeniable that the whole insurrection was his work  i am quite aware that the man had amiable even fascinating qualities and great enthusiasm but here lay the great danger and seduction to young minds and though i can perfectly understand the warm sympathy and generous sentiment that actuates my young friends and though i much regret the being obliged to deny the first request of one to whom i may say i owe my life i must distinctly refuse to take any part in relieving count stanislas prometesky from the penalty he has incurred  harolds countenance had become very gloomy during this peroration he made no attempt at reply but gathered up his papers and gnawing his fringe of moustache walked out of  the room while eustace provoked me by volunteering explanations that prometesky was no friend of his only of harolds  his lordship declared himself satisfied provided no dangerous opinions had been imbibed and truly eustace might honestly acquit himself of having any opinions at all  that afternoon he drove lord erymanth to mycening whence the railway was now open  harold could nowhere be found and kind messages were left for him for which he was scarcely grateful when he came in late in the evening calling lord erymanth intolerably vindictive to bear malice for fiveandtwenty years  i could not get him to see that it was entirely judicial indignation and desire for the good of the country not in the least personal feeling but harold had not yet the perception of the legislative sentiment that actuates men of station in england  his strong inclination was not to go near the old man or his house again but this was no small distress to eustace who in spite of all his vaunting dreaded new scenes without a protector and i set myself to persuade him that it was due to his cousin not to hide himself and avoid society so as to give a colour to evil report  it might be best to separate myself from him altogether and go back on this eustace cried out with horror and dismay and harold answered never fear old chap im not going yet  not till i have seen you in good hands  and youll accept the invitation said eustace taking up one of the coroneted notes that invited us each for two nights to the castle  very well  and youll come up to town and have a proper suit  as you please  eustace went off to the library to find some crested paper and envelopes worthy to bear the acceptance and harold stood musing  a good agent and a good wife would set him on his feet to go alone he said  meantime he cannot do without you  not in some ways  and even this acquaintance is your achievement not his  such as it is  i pointed out that though lord erymanth refused to assist prometesky his introduction might lead to those who might do so while isolation was a sort of helplessness  to this he agreed saying i must free him before i go back  and do you really want to go back said i fearing he was growing restless  his face worked and he said when i feel like a stone round eustaces neck  why should you feel so  you are a lever to lift him  am i  the longer i live with you the more true it seems to me that i had no business to come into a world with such people in it as you and miss tracy  eustace came back fidgeting to get a pen mended an operation beyond him but patiently performed by the stronger fingers  we said no more but i had had a glimpse which made me hope that the pilgrim was beginning to feel the burthen on his back  not that he had much time for thought  he was out all day looking after the potteries where orders were coming in fast and workmen increasing and likewise toiling in the fields at ogdens farm making measurements and experiments on the substrata and the waterfall on which to base his plans for drainage according to the books lord erymanth had lent him  after the second day he came home halflaughing  farmer ogden had warned him off and refused to listen to any explanation though he must have known whom he was expellingyes like a very village hampden he had thrust the unwelcome surveyor out at his gate with such a trembling testy rheumatic arm that harold had felt obliged to obey it  eustace angered at the treatment of his cousin volunteered to come and tell the ass ogden to mind what he was about and harold added if you would come lucy you might help to make his wife understand  i came as i was desired where i had never been before for we had always rested in the belief that the alfy valley was a nasty damp unhealthy place with something always about and had contented ourselves with sending broth to the cottages whenever we heard of any unusual amount of disease  if we had ever been there  we rode the two miles as i do not think dora and i would ever have floundered through the mud and torrents that ran down the lanes  it was just as if the farm had been built in the lower circle and the cottages in malebolge itself where the poor little alfy so pure when it started from kalydon moor brought down to them all the leakage of that farmyard  oh that yard i never beheld imagined or made my way through the like though there was a little causeway near the boundary wall where it was possible to creep along on the stones rousing up a sleeping pig or a dreamy donkey here and there and barked at in volleys by dogs stationed on all the higher islets in the unsavoury lake  if dora had not been a colonial child and if i could have feared for myself with harold by my side i dont think we should ever have arrived but farmer ogden and his son came out and a man and boy or two and when eustace was recognised they made what way they could for us and we were landed at last in a scrupulously clean kitchen with peat fire and a limeash floor where alas we were not suffered to remain but were taken into a horrid little parlour with a newlylighted smoking fire a big bible and a ploughingcup  mrs ogden was a dissenter so we had really no acquaintance and poor thing had long been unable to go anywhere she was a pale trembling creature most neat and clean but with the dreadful sallow complexion given by perpetual ague  she was very civil and gave us cake and wine to the former of which dora did ample justice but oh the impracticability of those people  the men had it all out of doors but when i tried my eloquence on mrs ogden i found her firmly persuaded not only that her own ill health and the sickness in the hamlet were the will of the lord but in her religious fatalism that it was absolutely profane to think that cleansing and drainage would amend them and she adduced texts which poor uninstructed i was unable to answer even while i knew they were a perversion and provoked as i was i felt that her meek patience and resignation might be higher virtues than any to which i had yet attained  her husband who i should explain was but one remove above a smockfrock farmer took a different line  he had unsavoury proverbs in which he put deep faith  muck was the mother of money and also muck was the farmers nosegay  he viewed it as an absolute effeminacy to object to its odorous savours and as to the poor people they were an ungrateful lot and had a great deal too much done for them the small farmers usual creed  mr alison could do as he liked of course but his lease had five years yet to run and he would not consent to pay no more rent not for what he didnt ask for nor didnt want and mr bullock didnt approve ofthat he would not not if mr alison took the law of him  his landlord do it at his own expense  that made him look knowing he was evidently certain that it was a trick for raising the rent at the end of the lease if not before upon him whose fathers had been tenants of alfy vale even before the alisons came to arghouse and with the rude obstinacy of his race he was as uncivil to harold as he durst in eustaces presence  he had no mind to have his fields cut up just to sell the young gentlemans drainpipes as wouldnt go off at them potteries  well but all this stuff would be doing much more good upon your fields than here eustace said  ii really must insist on this farmyard being cleansed  youll not find that in the covenant sir said the farmer with a grin  but father began the son a more intelligentlooking man though with the prevailing sickly tint  hold your tongue phil said ogden  its easy to talk of cleaning out the yard id like to see the gentleman set about it or you either for that matter  would you said harold  then you shall  farmer ogden gaped  i wont have no strange labourers about the place  no more you shall said harold  if your son and i clean out this place with our own hands in the course of a couple of days putting the manure in any field you may appoint will you let the drainage plans be carried out without opposition  it aint a bet said the farmer for my missuss conscience is against bets  no certainly not  nor a trick he said looking from one to another  no  it is to be honest work  i am a farmer and know what work is and have done it too  farmer ogden to a certain extent gave in and we departed  his son held the gate open for us with a keen look at harold full of wonder and inquiry  youll stand by me said harold lingering with him  yes sir said phil ogden but i doubt if we can do it  father says it is a weeks work for five men if you could get them to do it  never fear said harold  well save your mothers life yet against her will and make you all as healthy as if youd been born in new south wales  this was friday and phil had an engagement on the monday so that tuesday was fixed much to eustaces displeasure for he did not like harolds condescending to work which labourers would hardly undertake and besides he would make his hands if not himself absolutely unfit for the entertainment on thursday  on which harold asked if there were no such thing as water  eustace implored him to give it up and send halfadozen unemployed men but to this he answered i should be ashamed  and when we went home he rode on into mycening to see about his equipment he said setting eustace despairing lest he after all meant to avoid the london tailor and to patronise mycening but the equipment turned out to be a great smockfrock  and something very different came home with himnamely a little dainty flowerpot and pan with an etruscan pattern the very best things that had been turned out of the pottery adorned with a design in black and white representing a charming little greek nymph watering her flowers  dont you think lucy miss tracy being a shareholder and it being her birthday the chairman might present this he inquired  i agreed heartily but eustace with a twist of his catswhisker moustache opined that they were scarcely elegant enough for miss tracy and on the monday when he did drag harold up to the tailors he brought down a fragile little bouquet of porcelain violets very parisian and in the latest fashion which he flattered himself was the newest thing extant and a much more appropriate offering  the violets could be made by a pinch below to squirt out perfume  never mind harold i said you can give your flowerpot all the same  you may said harold  why should not you  he shook his head  ive no business he said eustace is chairman  i said no more and i hardly saw harold the two following days for he was gone in the twilight of the january morning and worked as long as light would allow and fortunately the moon was in a favourable quarter and phil to whom the lighter part of the task was allotted confided to his companion that he had been wishing to get father to see things in this light for a long time but he was that slow to move and since harold had been looking about mr bullock had advised him not to give in for it would be sure to end in the raising of his rent and young gentlemen had newfangled notions that only led to expense and nonsense and it was safest in the long run to trust to the agent  however the sight of genuine unflinching toil with nothing of the amateur about it had an eloquence of its own  farmer ogden looked on grimly and ironically for the first two hours having only been surprised into consent in the belief that any man let alone a gentleman must find out the impracticability of the undertaking and be absolutely sickened  then he brought out some bread and cheese and cider and was inclined to be huffy when harold declined the latter and looked satirical when he repaired to wash his hands at the pump before touching the former  when he saw two more hours go by in work of which he could judge his furrowed old brow grew less puckered and he came out again to request mr harold to partake of the midday meal i fancy harolds going up to phils room to make himself respectable for mrs ogdens society was as strange to the farmer as were to the australian the good wifes excuses for making him sit down with the family in the kitchen but i believe that during the meal he showed himself practical farmer enough to win their respect and when he worked harder than ever all the afternoon even till the last moment it was possible to see and came back with the light the next morning he had won his cause above all when the hunt swept by without disturbing the labour  the farmer not only turned in his scanty supply of men to help to finish off the labour and seconded contrivances which the day before he would have scouted but he gave his own bowed back to the work  a pavement of the court which had not seen the day for forty years was brought to light and by a series of drain tiles for which a messenger was dispatched to the pottery streams were conducted from the river to wash these up and at last when harold appeared after eustace had insisted on waiting no longer for dinner he replied to our eager questions yes it is done  and ogden  he thanked me shook hands with me and said i was a man  which we knew meant infinitely more than a gentleman  harold wanted to spend thursday in banking up the pond in the centre of the yard but the idea seemed to drive eustace to distraction such work before going to that sublime region at erymanth  he laid hold of harolds handsshapely hands and with that look of latent strength one sees in some animals but scarred with many a seam and horny within the fingersand compared them with those he had nursed into dainty delicacy of whiteness till harold could not help saying i wouldnt have a ladys fingers  i would not have a clowns said eustace  keep your gloves on harold and do not make them any worse  if you go out to that place today they wont even be as presentable as they are  i shall wash them  wash  as if oceans of eaudecologne would make them fit for society said eustace with infinite disgust only equalled by the faugh with which harold heard of the perfume  in fact eustace was dreadfully afraid the other hunters had seen and recognised those shoulders even under the smockfrock as plainly as he did and he had been wretched about it ever since  you talk of not wanting to do me harm he said and then you go and grub in such work as any decent labourer would despise  so miserable was he that harold who never saw the foolery in eustace that he would have derided in others yielded to him so far as only to give directions to bullock for sending down the materials wanted for the pond and likewise for mending the roof of a cottage where a rheumatic old woman was habitually obliged to sleep under a crazy umbrella     chapter vii  the birds of ill omen   nothing stands out to me more distinctly with its pleasures and pains than the visit to erymanth castlefrom our arrival in the darkthe lighted hallthe servants meeting usthe australians bewilderment at being ushered up to our rooms without a greeting from the hostmy lingering to give a last injunction in eustaces ear now eustace i wont have harolds hair greased and put as little stuff as you can persuade yourself to do on your pockethandkerchieforders i had kept to the last to make them more emphatic then dashing after the housekeeper leaving them to workmy great room where it was a perfect journey from the fire to the toilettablemy black lace dress and the silver ornaments those dear nephews had brought me from londonand in the midst of my hairdoing dear little violas running in to me in one of her ecstacies hugging me to the detriment of colmans fabric and her own and then dancing round and round me in her pretty white cloudy tulle looped up with snowdrops  the one thing that had been wanting to her was that her dear darling delightful lucy should be at her own ballher birthday ball and just as she had despaired it had all come right owing to that glorious old giant of ours and she went off into a series of rapturous little laughs over dermots account of her uncles arrival pickaback  it was of no use to look cautious and sign at colman viola had no notion of restraint and i was thankful when my dress was complete and we were left alone so that i could listen without compunction to the story of lord erymanths arrival at arked house and solemn assurance that he had been most hospitably received and that his own observation and inquiry had convinced him that mr alison was a highly estimable young man in spite of all disadvantages unassuming wellmannered and grateful for good advice  dermot had shown his discernment in making him his friend and lucy had in truth acted with much courage as well as good judgment in remaining with him and that so horrified mamma said viola that she turned me out of the room so i dont know how they fought it out but mamma must have given in at last though she has never said one word to me about it not even that you were all to be here  what a good thing it is to have a brother  i should never have known but for dermot  and do you know he says that my uncles pet is the cousin after allthe deferential fool of a cousin he says  hush hush viola  i didnt say soit was dermot said the naughty child with a little arch pout he says it is just like my uncle to be taken with a little worship fromwell he is your nephew lucy so i will be politer than dermot who does rage because he says mr alison has not even sense to see that he is dressed in his cousins plumes  he is very fond of harold viola and they both of them do it in simplicity harold does the things for eustace and never even sees that the credit is taken from him  it is what he does it for  then he is a regular stupid old jolly giant said viola oh lucy what delicious thing is this  it was the little flowerpot in which i had planted a spray of lemonscented verbena which viola had long coveted  i explained how harold had presided over it as an offering from the hydriot company to its youngest shareholder and her delight was extreme  she said she would keep it for ever in her own room it was just what she wanted the prettiest thing she had hadso kind of him but those great grand giants never thought anything too little for them  and then she went into one of her despairs  she had prepared a number of christmas presents for the people about the castle to whom she had always been like the child of the house and her maid had forgotten to bring the box she had packed nor was there any means of getting them unless she could persuade her brother to send early the next morning  is dermot staying here  oh yesall night and nobody else except ourselves and piggy poor piggy he moves about in more awful awe of my uncle than everand so stiff  i am always expecting to see him bristle  there came a message that my lady was ready and was asking for miss tracy to go down with her  viola fluttered away and i waited till they should have had time to descend before making my own appearance finding all the rooms in the cleared state incidental to ball preparationsall the chairs and tables shrunk up to the walls and even the drawingroom where the chaperons were to sit looking some degrees more desolate than the drawingroom of a ladyless house generally does look  full in the midst of an immense blue damask sofa sat lady diana in grey brocade  she was rather a small woman in reality but dignity made a great deal more of her  eustace with a splendid red camellia in his coat was standing by her blushing and she was graciously permitting the presentation of the squirting violet  since it was a birthday and it was a kind attention c but i could see that she did not much like it and viola sitting on the end of the sofa with her eyes downcast was very evidently much less delighted than encumbered with the fragile china thing  lord erymanth met me and led me up to his sister who gave me a cold kiss and we had a little commonplace talk during which i could see viola spring up to harold who was standing beside her brother and the colour rising in his bronzed face at her eager acknowledgments of the flowerpot after which she applied herself to begging her brother to let his horse and groom go over early the next morning for the christmas gifts she had left behind but dermot did not seem propitious not liking to trust the man he had with him with the precious jack olantern over hills slippery with frost and viola as one properly instructed in the precariousness of equine knees subsided disappointed while i had leisure to look up at the two gentlemen standing there and i must say that harold looked one of natures nobles even beside dermot and dermot a fine manly fellow even beside harold though only reaching to his shoulder  i was the greatest stranger and went in to the diningroom with his lordship which spared me the sight of eustaces supreme satisfaction in presenting his arm to lady diana after she had carefully paired off viola with her cousin piggyie pigou st glear the eldest son of the heirpresumptive a stiff shy youth in the erymanth atmosphere whatever he might be out of it and not at all happy with viola who was wont to tease and laugh at him  it was a savetrouble dinner as informal as the st glear nature and servants permitted  lord erymanth carved and took care that harold should not starve and he was evidently trying to turn the talk into such a direction as to show his sister what his guests were but eustaces tongue was of course the ready one and answered glibly about closed beershops projected cottages and the complete drainage of the alfynay that as to bullock and ogden hearing reason he had only to go over in person and the thing was done the farmyard was actually set to rights and no difficulty at all was made as to the further improvements now that the landlord had once shown himself concerned  that was all that was wanting  and the funny part of it was that he actually believed it  dermot could not help saying to harold didnt i see you applying a few practical arguments  harold made a sign with his head with a deprecatory twinkle in his eye recollecting how infra dig eustace thought his exploit  the party was too small for more than one conversation so that when the earl began to relate his experiences of the difficulties of dealing with farmers and cottagers all had to listen in silence and i saw the misery of restless sleepiness produced by the continuous sound of his voice setting in upon harold and under it i had to leave him on my departure with lady diana and her daughter quaking in my satin shoes at the splendid graciousness i saw in preparation for me but i was kept all the time on the outer surface lady diana did not choose to be intimate enough even to give good advice so that i was very glad when the carriages were heard and the gentlemen joined us harold hastily handing to viola the squirting violets which she had left behind her on the diningtable and which he had carefully concealed from eustace but alas only to have them forgotten again or maybe with a little malice deposited in the keeping of the brazen satyr on the anteroom chimneypiece  dermot had already claimed my first dance causing a strange thrill of pain as i missed the glance which always used to regret without forbidding my becoming his partner  viola was asked in due form by eustace and accepted him with alacrity which he did not know to be due to her desire to escape from piggy  most solicitously did our good old host present eustace to every one and it was curious to watch the demeanour of the different classesthe horsmans mostly cordial hippa and pippa demonstratively so but the stympsons held aloof with the stiffest of bows not one of them but goodnatured captain george stympson would shake hands even with me and miss avice stympson of lake house made as if harold were an object invisible to the naked eye while the kind old earl was doing his best that he should not feel neglected  eustace had learnt dancing for that noted ball at government house but harold had disavowed the possibility  he had only danced once in his life he said when dermot pressed him and that counted for nothing  to me the pain on the bent brow made it plain that it had been at the poor fellows wedding  however he stood watching and when at the end of our quadrille dermot said here lies the hulk of the great harry there was an amused air about him and at the further question come alison what do you think of our big corroborees he deliberately replied i never saw such a pretty sight  and on some leading exclamation from one of us it beats the cockatoos on a cornfield besides one has got to kill them  mr alison looks at our little diversion in the benevolent spirit of the giant whose daughter brought home ploughman oxen and all in her apron for playthings said viola who with eustace had found her way to us but we were all divided again viola being carried off by some grandee eustace having to search for some noble damsel to whom he had been introduced and i falling to the lot of young mr horsman a nice person in himself but unable to surmount the overcrowing of the elder sisters who called him baby jack and publicly ordered him about even at the end of our dance at the sound of hippas authoritative summons he dropped me suddenly and i found myself gravitating towards harold like a sort of chaperon  i was amazed by his observing i think i could do it now  would you try me lucy  after all he was but fiveandtwenty and could hardly look on anything requiring agility or dexterity without attempting it so i consented with a renewal of the sensations i remembered when as a child i had danced with grownup men only with alarm at the responsibility of what dermot called the steerage of the great harry since collision with such momentum as ours might soon be would be serious but i soon found my anxiety groundless he was too well made and elastic to be clumsy and had perfect power over his own weight and strength so that he could dance as lightly and safely as dermot with his irish litheness  do you think i might ask miss tracy he said in return for my compliments  of course why not  when he did ask her reply was oh will you indeed  thank you which naivete actually raised her mothers colour with annoyance but if she had a rod laid up viola did not feel it then she looked radiant and though i dont believe three words passed between the partners that waltz was the glory of the evening to her  she must have made him take her to the tearoom for some ice and there it was that while i was standing with my partner a little way off we heard miss avice stympsons peculiarly penetrating attempt at a whisper observing yes it is melancholy  i thought we were safe here or i never should have brought my dear little birdie what dont you know  theres no doubt of itthe glaze on the pottery is dead mens bones  they have an arrangement with the hospitals in london you understand  i cant think how lord erymanth can be so deceived  but you see the trick was a perfect success  yes the blocking up the railway  a mercy no lives were lost but that would have been nothing to him after the way he has gone on in australiaoh lord erymanth i did not know you were there  and as i could not avoid overhearing you said that old gentleman let me remind you that i regard courtesy to the guest as due respect to the host and that i have good reason to expect that my visitors should have some confidence in my discrimination of the persons i invite them to meet  therewith both he and miss stympson had become aware of the head that was above them all and the crimson that dyed the cheeks and brow while viola trembling with passion and both hands clasped over harolds arm exclaimed in a panting whisper tell them it is a wicked falsehoodtell them it is no such thing  i will speak to your uncle tomorrow  i am obliged to him  everybody heard that and all who had either feeling or manners knew that no more ought to be said  only lord erymanth made his way to harold to say i am very sorry this has happened  harold bent his head with a murmur of thanks and was moving out of the supperroom when dermot hastily laid a hand on him with keep the field harry dont go  im not going  thats right  face it out before the hags  whom shall i introduce youtheres birdie stympsoncome  no no i dont mean to dance again  why not  beard the harpies like a man  dancing would refute them all  would it gravely said harold  nor could he be persuaded save once at his hosts bidding but showed no signs of being abashed or distressed and most of the male stympsons came and spoke to him  the whole broke up at three and we repaired to our rooms conscious that family prayers would take place as the clock struck nine as punctually as if nothing had happened and that our characters depended on our punctuality  viola was in time and so was eustace i sneaked in late and ashamed and the moment the servants had filed out viola sprang to eustace with vehement acknowledgments and it appeared that just before she came down her missing box of gifts had been brought to her room and she was told that mr alison had sent for them  eustace smirked and lady diana apologised for her little daughters giddy exaggerated expressions by which she had given far more trouble than she ever intended  no trouble said eustace  harold always wants to work off his steam  what it was he said viola  yes of course he always does those things said eustace speaking with a tone of proprietorship as if harold had been a splendid selfacting steamengine  i am very glad to have gratified you miss tracy  only he did and not you said viola boldly luckily without being heard by her mother while eustace murmured out rather bewildered it is all the same  viola evidently did not think so when harold came in with beads of wet fringing his whiskers though he had divested himself of the chief evidences of the rivers of muddy lane through which he had walked to arked house full four miles off  violas profuse thanks were crossed by lady dianas curt apologies and as poor piggy who had genuinely overslept himself entered with his apologiespoor fellowin a voice very much as if he was trying to say grumph grumph while he could only say wee wee they were received solemnly by his uncle with the antipodes are a rebuke to you pigou  i am afraid the young men of this hemisphere have no disposition to emulate either such chivalrous attentions or exertions as have been mr harold alisons excuse  when so much was said about it harold probably wished he had let the whole matter alone and was thankful to be allowed to sit down in peace to his wellearned breakfast which was finished before dermot lounged innot waited for by his uncle who offered an exhibition of his modelfarmbuildings machines cattle c  fain would viola and i have gone in the train of the gentlemen but the weather though not bad enough to daunt a tolerably hardy man was too damp for me and we had to sit down to our work in the drawingroom while piggy always happier without his greatuncle meandered about until lady diana ordered off viola to play at billiards with him but kept me for as i perceived the awful moment was come and the only consolation was that it might be an opportunity of pleading harolds cause  with great censure of the stympsons illbreeding and discourtesy to her brother which seemed to affect her far more than the direct injury to harold and strong disclaimers of belief in them still my mothers old friend must inquire into the character of these young men and my position with regard to them  if she had been tender instead of inquisitorial i should have answered far more freely and most likely the air of defiance and defence into which she nettled me had a partisan look but it was impossible not to remember that miss woolmer had always said that however she might censure the scandal of the stympsons they only required to dish it up with sauce piquant to make her enjoy it heartily  and really and truly it did seem as if there was nothing in the whole lives of those poor youths on which those women had not contrived to cast some horrid stain working backwards from the dead mens bones in the pottery dermot had told her they used nothing but live mens bones through imputations on mr george yollands character and the cause of the catastrophe at the dragons head stories of my associating with all the low undesirable friends they picked up at mycening or in the huntingfield and as to the australian part of the history she would hardly mention to me all she had heard even to have it confuted  i was not sure how far she did believe my assurances or thought me deceived when i strenuously denied all evil intent from harold towards his poor wife and explained that he had merely driven over a precipice in the dark and had a brain fever afterwards all i could see was that though not perfectly satisfied or convinced she found that her brother would not allow the separation to be kept up and therefore she resumed her favourite office of adviser  she examined me on the religious habits of my nephews and niece impressing on me that it was for the sake of the latter that my presence at arghouse was excusable but insisting that it was incumbent on me to provide her with an elderly governess both for her sake and my own  i was much afraid of having the governess at once thrust upon me but luckily she did not happen to have one of a chaperon kind of age on her list so she contented herself with much advice on what i was teaching dora so that perhaps i grew restive and was disposed to think it no concern of hers nor did i tell her that much of the direction of doras lessons was with a view to harold but she could not have been wholly displeased since she ended by telling me that mine was a vast opportunity and that the propriety of my residence at arghouse entirely depended on the influence i exerted since any acquiescence in lax and irreligious habits would render my stay hurtful to all parties  she worried me into an inclination to drop all my poor little endeavours since certainly to have tried to follow out all the details of her counsel would have alienated all three at once  never was i more glad than when the luncheonbell put a stop to the conversation and the sun struggling out dispensed me from further endurance and set me free to go with viola to bestow her gifts disposing on the way of the overflow of talk that had been pent up for months past  in the twilight near the lodge of a favourite old nurse of dermots we encountered all the younger gentlemen and not only did viola drag her brother in but harold also to show to whom was owing the arrival of her wonderful teapot cozy  the good woman was just going to make her tea  viola insisted on showing the use of her cozy and making everybody stay to nurses impromptu kettledrum and herself put in the pinches of tea  dermot chaffed all and sundry viola bustled about harold sat on the dresser with his blue eyes gleaming in the firelight with silent amusement and perfect satisfaction the cat sitting on his shoulder and nurse who was firmly persuaded that he had rescued her dear master dermot from the fangs of the lion was delighted to do her best for his entertainment  viola insisted on displaying all the curiositiesthe puzzlecup that could not be used the horrid frog that sprang to your lips in the tankard the rollingpin covered with sentimental poetry and her extraordinary french pictures on the walls  dermot kept us full of merriment and we laughed on till the sound of the dressingbell sent us racing up to the castle in joyous guilt  that kettledrum at the lodge is one of the brightest spots in my memory  we were very merry all the evening in a suppressed way over the piano viola dermot and i singing harold looking on and eustace being left a willing victim to the good counsel lavished by my lord and my lady who advised him nearly out of his senses and into their own best graces  but we had not yet done with the amenities of the stympsons  the mornings post brought letters to lady diana and lord erymanth which were swallowed by the lady with only a flush on her brow but which provoked from the gentleman a sharp interjection  scandalous libellous hags  the rara avis inquired dermot  and in spite of lady dianas warning not now lord erymanth declared avice yes  a bird whose quills are quills of iron dipped in venom and her beak a brazen one distilling  gall on all around i shall inform her that she has made herself liable to an action for libel  a very fit lesson to her  what steps shall i take my lord said eustace with much importance i shall be most happy to be guided by you  it is not you said lord erymanth  oh if it is only he it does not signify so much  certainly not observed dermot  what sinks some floats others  lady diana here succeeded in hushing up the subject harold having said nothing all the time but after we broke up from breakfast i had a private view of lady dianas letter which was spiteful beyond description as far as we were concerned making all manner of accusations on the authority of the australian relations the old stories exaggerated into horrible blackness besides others for which i could by no means account  gambling among the golddiggers horrid frays in victoria and even cattlestealing were so impossible in a man who had always been a rich sheep farmer that i laughed yet they were told by the cousins with strange circumstantiality  then came later talesabout our ways at arghouseall as a warning against permitting any intercourse of the sweet childs which might be abused lady diana was angered and vexed but she was not a woman who rose above the opinion of the world  her daughter di enderby was a friend of birdie stympson and would be shocked and she actually told me that i must perceive that while such things were said it was not possiblefor her own violas saketo keep up the intimacy she would have wished  for my part it seemed to me that in lady dianas position unjust accusations against a poor young girl were the very reason for befriending her openly but her ladyship spoke in a grand authoritative regretful way and habitual submission prevented me from making any protest beyond saying coldly i am very sorry but i cannot give up my nephews  viola was not present  it was supposed to be so shocking that she could know nothing about it but she flew into my room and raged like a little fury at the cruel wickedness of the stympsons in trying to turn everyones friends against them and trumping up stories and mamma giving up as if she believed them  she wished she was dermotshe wished she was uncle erymanthshe wished she was anybody to stand up and do battle with those horrid womenanybody but a poor little girl who must obey orders and be separated from her friends and she cried and made such violent assurances that i had to soothe and silence her and remind her of her first duty c  lord erymanth was a nobler being than his sister and had reached up to clap harold on the shoulder while declaring that these assertions made no difference to him and that he did not care the value of a straw for what avice stympson might say though harold had no defence but his own denial of half the stories and was forced to own that there was truth in some of the others  he was deeply wounded  why cannot the women let us keep our friends he said as i found him in the great hall  it is very hard i said with grief and anger  very hard on the innocent he answered  then i saw he was preparing to set off to walk home twelve miles and remonstrated since lake valley would probably be flooded  i must he said i must work it out with myself whether i do eustace most harm or good by staying here  and off he went with the long swift stride that was his way of walking off vexation  i did not see him again till i was going up to dress when i found him just inside the front door struggling to get off his boots which were perfectly sodden while his whole dress nay even his hair and beard was soaked and drenched so that i taxed him with having been in the water  yes i went in after a dog he said and as he gave a shiver and had just pulled off his second boot i asked no more questions but hunted him upstairs to put on dry clothes without loss of time and when we met at dinner eustace was so full of our doings at the castle and dora of hers with miss woolmer that his bath was entirely driven out of my head  but the next day as i was preparing for my afternoons walk the unwonted sound of our doorbell was heard is our introduction working already thought i little expecting the announcementthe misses stympson  however there were stympsons and stympsons so that even this did not prepare me for being rushed at by all three from lake housetwo aunts and one nieceavice henny and birdie with how is he where is he  he would not take anything  i hope he went to bed and had something hot  is he in the house  no cold i hope  we have brought the poor dear fellow for him to see  he seems in pain today we thought he would see him  at last i got in a question edgeways as to the antecedents as the trio kept on answering one another in chorus poor dear nepyour cousinnephew i meanthe bravest  then it flashed on me  do you mean that it was for your dog that harold went into the water yesterday  oh the bravest most generous the most forgiving  so tenderhanded it must be all a calumny  i wish we had never believed it he could never lift a hand against anyone  we will contradict all rumours report is so scandalous  is he within  harold had been at the hydriot works ever since breakfast but on my first question the chorus struck up again and i might well quail at the story  lake mill you know the place miss alison  indeed i did  the lake otherwise quiet to sluggishness here was fed by the rapid little stream and at the junction was a great mill into which the water was guided by a sharp descent which made it sweep down with tremendous force and as i had seen from the train the river was swelled by the thaw and spread far beyond its banks the millrace i cried in horror  just observe  dear nep has such a passion for the water and birdie thoughtlessly threw a stick some way above the weir  i never shall forget what i felt when i saw him carried along  he struggled with his white paws and moaned to us but we could do nothing and we thought to have seen him dashed to pieces before our eyes when somehow his own struggles i fancyhe is so sagaciousbrought him up in a lot of weeds and stuff against the post of the floodgates and that checked him  but we saw it could not last and his strength was exhausted poor birdie rushed down to beg them to stop the mill but that could never have been done in time and the dear dog was on the point of being sucked in by the ruthless stream moaning and looking appealingly to us for help when behold that superb figure like some divinity descending was with us and with one brief inquiry he was in the water   we called out to him that the current was frightfully strongwe knew a mans life ought not to be perilled but he just smiled took up the great pole that lay near and waded in   i cannot describe the horror of seeing him breasting that stream expecting as we did to see him borne down by it into the wheel  the miller shouted to him that it was madness but he kept his footing like a rock  he reached the place where the poor dog was and the fury of the stream was a little broken by the post took up poor nep and put him over his shoulder  nep was so goodlay like a lambwhile mr alison fought his way back and it was harder still being upwards  the miller and his men came out and cheered thinking at least he would come out spent and want help but no he came out only panting a little put down the dog and when it moaned and seemed hurt he felt it all over so tenderly found its leg was broken took it into the millers kitchen and set it like any surgeon  he would take nothing but a cup of tea whatever they said and would not change his clothesindeed the miller is a small man so i dont see how he couldbut i hope he took no harm  he walked away before we could thank him  but oh dear what a wicked thing scandal is  i will never believe anything report says again  to the end of their days the misses stympson believed that it was the convenient impersonal rumour which had maligned haroldnot themselves  i was just parting with them when harold appeared and they surrounded him with an inextricable confusion of thankshopes that he had not caught cold and entreaties that he would look at his patient whom they had brought on the back seat of the barouche to have his leg examined  harold said that his was selftaught surgery but was assured that the dog would bear it better from him than any one and could not but consent  i noticed however that when he had to touch the great black newfoundland dog a strong shudder ran through his whole frame and he had to put a strong force on himself though he spoke to it kindly and it wagged its tail and showed all the grateful wistful affection of its kind as he attended to it with a tender skill in which his former distaste was lost and the party drove away entreating him to come and renew the treatment on the monday and asking us all to luncheon but not receiving a distinct answer in eustaces absence for he was very tenacious of his rights as master of the house  i was quite touched with the dogs parting caress to his preserver so you have conquered the birds with iron quills i cried triumphantly  who were they asked harold astonished  surely you know them  i never thought of introducing you  you dont mean that they were those women  of course they were  i thought you knew you were performing an act of heroic forgiveness  harolds unfailing politeness towards me hindered him from saying heroic fiddlesticks but he could not suppress a faugh which meant as much and that mortified me considerably  come now harry i said you dont mean that you would not have done it if you had known  i should not have let the poor beast drown because his mistresses were spiteful hags  and there was a look on his face that made me cry out in pain dont harry  dont what  dont be unforgiving  say you forgive them  i cant  i could as soon pardon smith  but you ought to pardon both  it would be generous  it would be christian  i was sorry i had said that for he looked contemptuously and said so they teach you  i call it weakness  oh harry dear harry no  the highest strength  i dont understand that kind of talk he said  you dont know what that smith is to my poor mother  we wont talk of him but indeed the misses stympson are grateful to you and are sorry  wont you go to them on monday  no  i dont like scandalmongers  but you have quite conquered them  what do you mean  if we are the brutes they tell those who would have been our friends we are not less so because i pulled a dog out of the river  the hard look was on his face and to my faint plea the poor dog  the dog will do very well  he went decisively out of the way of further persuasions and when a formal note of invitation arrived he said eustace and i might go but he should not  he had something to do at the potteries and as to the dog the less it was meddled with the better  i know you hate black dogs said eustace i only wonder you ever touched it  harolds brow lowered at this and afterwards i asked eustace to account for the strange dislike  he told me that the dogs at the store had run yelping after the buggy on that fatal drive and this and the melancholy howl of the dingoes had always been supposed to be the cause of the special form of delirious fancy that had haunted harold during the illness followingthat he was pursued and dragged down by a pack of black hounds and that the idea had so far followed him that he still had a sort of alienation from dogs though he subdued it with a high hand  he would still not go with us to lake house for go we did  an invitation was stimulating to eustace and though i much disliked the women i knew we could not afford to reject an advance if we were not to continue out of humanitys reach  so i went and we were made much of in spite of the disappointment  had not mr harold alison been so kind as to come over both sunday and monday morning and see to poor nep in his kennel before they were down oh yes they had heard of it from the stableboy and had charged him to take care the gentleman came in to breakfast but he could not persuade him  such a pity he was too busy to come today  eustace gave learned and elaborate opinions on nep and gained the hearts of the ladies who thenceforth proclaimed that mr alison was a wonderfully finished gentleman considering his opportunities but mr harold was at the best a rough diamond so that once more his conquest had been for eustace rather than for himself  they showed me in selfjustification letters from their relations in melbourne speaking of the notorious harry alison as a huge bearded ruffian and telling horrid stories of his excesses in no measured terms  of course we denied them and represented that some other man must have borne the same name and gratitude made them agree but the imputation lay there ready to revive at any time  and there had been something in the whole affair that had not a happy effect on harold  he was more blunt more gruff less tolerant or ready to be pleased eustaces folly was no longer incapable of provoking him and even his gentleness towards dora and me was with a greater effort and he was plainly in an irritable state of suppressed suffering of mind or temper which only the strong force he put upon himself kept in check  my poor harold would he see that there were moral achievements higher than his physical ones and would he learn that even his strength was not equal to them unaided     chapter viii  bullocks chastisement   the next frosty day dora and i set forth for a visit to the double cottage where on one side dwelt a family with a newlyarrived baby on the other was dame jennings with the dilapidated roof and chimney i was glad to see dora so happily and eagerly interested over the baby as to be more girllike than i had yet seen her though comparing her to what she had been on her arrival she was certainly a good deal softened and tamed  domesticated would really not have been so inappropriate a word in her case as it is in advertisements of companions  we had come to the door only divided from mrs jenningss by a low fence and a few bushes when voices struck on our ears and we saw bullocks big sturdy john bull form planted in a defiant attitude in the gardenpath before the door where the old woman stood courtesying and mingling entreating protestations against an additional sixpence a week on her rent with petitions that at least the chimney might be made sound and the roof watertight  there is no denying that i did stand within the doorway to listen for not only did i not wish to encounter bullock but it seemed quite justifiable to ascertain whether the current whispers of his dealings with the poor were true indeed there was no time to move before he replied with a volley of such abuse as i never heard before or since at her impudence in making such a demand  i was so much shocked that i stood transfixed forgetting even to draw dora away from the sound while the old woman pleaded that mr herod had made the promise and said nothing of increasing her rent probably bullock had been irritated by the works set on foot at ogdens farm for he brought out another torrent of horrid imprecations upon the meddling convict fellow the least intolerable of the names he used and of her for currying favour threatening her with instant expulsion if she uttered a word of complaint or mentioned the increase of her rent and on her hesitation actually lifting his large heavy stick  we both cried out and sprang forward though i scarcely suppose that he would have actually struck her  but much more efficient help was at hand  bullocks broad back was to the gate and he little knew that at the moment he raised his stick harold attracted by his loud railing voice leaped over the gate and with one bound was upon the fellow wresting the stick from his hand and laying it about his shoulders with furious energy  we all screamed out  dora it was suspected bade him go on and give it to him well and perhaps my wrath with the man made me simply shriek but the sense of our presence did whatever we wished check harolds violence so far that he ceased his blows throwing the man from him with such force that he fell prone into the poor dames gooseberrybush and had to pick himself up through numerous scratches just as we had hurried round through the garden  he had regained his feet and was slinking up to the gate as we met him and passionately exclaimed miss alison you have seen this i shall call on you as my witness  dora called out something so vituperative that my energies went in silencing her nor do i think i answered bullock though at least it was a relief to see that having a great souwester over all his other clothes the force of the blows had been so broken that he could not have any really serious injury to complain of  it was not unfortunate however that he was so shaken and battered that he went first to exhibit himself to dr kingstons new partner and obtain a formidable scientific account of his sprains and bruises so that eustace had heard an account of the affray in the first place and dora with a childs innate satisfaction in repeating personalities had not spared the epithets with which bullock had mentioned the fool of a squire the said squire touched to the quick went out invulnerable to his interview declaring that the agent had been rightly served only wishing he had had more and indignantly refusing bullocks offer to abstain from prosecuting mr harold alison on receiving a handsome compensation and a promise never to be interfered with again  eustace repliedtoo much i fear in his own coinwith orders to send in his accounts immediately and to consider himself dismissed from his agency from that hour and then came back to us like a conquering hero exulting in his own magnanimous firmness which had shown he was not to be trifled with  but he did not like it at all when richardson came in trying to look quite impassive and said to harold some one wants to speak to you sir  harold went and returned without a word except you are wanted too lucy and i was not equally silent when i found it was to serve on me an order to appear as witness before the magistrates the next day as to the assault upon bullock  eustace was very much annoyed and said it was disgraceful and that harold was always getting into scrapes and would ruin him with all the county people just as he was beginning to make way with thema petulant kind of ingratitude which we had all learnt to tolerate as old eus way and dora announced that if he was put in prison she should go too  it was only a petty sessions case heard in the justiceroom at mycening and on the way the prisoner was chiefly occupied in assuring the witness that there was nothing to be nervous about and the squire that it would hurt nobody but himself and for his part fine him as they would he would willingly pay twenty times as much to rid the place of bullock  the benchwho sat at the upper end of a tablewere three or four horsmans and stympsons with lord erymanth in the chair par excellence for they all sat on chairs and they gave the like to eustace and me while we waited poor harold having put himself in the custody of a policeman behind the rail which served as bar  when our turn came harold pleaded guilty at once not only for truths sake but as meaning to spare me the interrogation and crabbe who was there on bullocks behalf looked greatly baffled and disappointed but the magistrates did not let it rest there since the amount of the fine of course would depend on the degree of violence c so both mrs jennings and i and the doctor were examined as witnesses  i came first and at first i did not find the inquiries half so alarming as i expected since my neighbours spoke to me quite in a natural way and it was soon clear that my account of the matter was the best possible defence of harold in their eyes  the unpleasant part was when crabbe not only insisted on my declaring on oath that i did not think bullock meant to strike the old woman but on my actually repeating the very words he had said which he probably thought i should flinch from doing but he thereby made it the worse for himself no doubt he and crabbe had reckoned on our general unpopularity and had not judged it so as to discover the reaction that had set in  an endeavour to show that we were acting as spies on the trustworthy old servant in order to undermine him with his master totally failed and at last the heavy fine of one shilling was imposed upon haroldas near an equivalent as possible to dismissing the case altogether  lord erymanth himself observed to eustace that he felt if he might say so to a certain degree implicated since he had advised the dismissal of bullock but scarcely after this fashion however he said he hoped to have eustace among them soon in another capacity and this elevated him immensely  the case had taken wind among the workmen at the potteries and as we came out at their dinnerhour there was a great assemblage loudly cheering alison the poor mans friend  eustace stood smiling and fingering his hat till captain stympson who came out with us hinted as he stood between the two young men that it had better be stopped as soon as possible  one may soon have too much of such things and then eustace turned round on harold and declared it was just his way to bring all the mycening mob after them  whereat harold without further answer observed youll see lucy home then and plunged down among the men who as if nothing had been wanting to give them a fellowfeeling for him but his having been up before the magistrates stretched out hands to shake and as he marched down between a lane of them turned and followed the lofty standard of his head towards their precincts  bullock in great wrath and indignation sent in his accounts that night with a heavy balance due to him from eustace which harold saw strong cause to dispute  but that battle in which of course crabbe was bullocks adviser and did all he could to annoy us was a matter of many months and did not affect our life very closely harold was in effect eustaces agent and being a very good accountant as well as having the confidence of the tenants all was put in good train in that quarter and mr alison was in the way to be respected as an excellent landlord and improver  people were calling on us and we were evidently being taken into our proper place  lady diana no longer withheld her countenance and though she only called on me in state she allowed viola to write plenty of notes to me  but i must go on to that day when harold and eustace were to have a hunting day with the foling hounds and dine afterwards with some of the members of the hunt at the fox hotel at foling a favourite meet they were to sleep at biston and i saw nothing of them the next day till eustace came home alone only just in time for a late dinner and growled out rather crossly that harold had chosen to walk home and not to be waited for  eustace himself was out of sorts and tired eating little and hardly vouchsafing a word except to grumble at us and the food and though we heard harold come in about nine oclock he did not come in but went up to his room  eustace was himself again the next morning but harold was gone out however as since he had been agent he had often been out and busy long before breakfast this would not have been remarkable but that eustace was ill at ease and at last said the fact is lucy he has been screwed again and has not got over it  i was so innocent that only doras passion with her brother revealed to me his meaning and then i was inexpressibly horrified and angry for i did not think harold could have broken his own word or the faith on which i had taken up my abode with them and the disappointment in him embittered i fear by the sense of personal injury was almost unbearable  eustace muttered something in excuse which i could not understand and i thought was only laxity on his part  i told him that if such things were to happen his house was no home for me  and he began come now lucy i say thats hard when twas harold and not me and all those fellows  what fellows  oh malvoisin and nessy horsman you know  i knew they were the evil geniuses of dermots life  lord malvoisin had been his first tempter as boys at their tutors and again in the guards and ernest or nessy horsman was the mauvais sujet of the family who never was heard of without some disgraceful story   and dermot had led my boys among these  all that had brightened life so much to me had suddenly vanished  it was ash wednesday and i am afraid i went through my lenten services in the spirit of the elder son nursing my virtuous indignation and dwelling chiefly on what would become of me if arghouse were to be made uninhabitable as i foresaw  i was ashamed to consult miss woolmer and spent the afternoon in restless attempts to settle to something but feeling as if nothing were worth while not even attending to dora since my faith in harold had given way and he had broken his word and returned to his vice  should i go to church again and spare myself the meeting him at dinner  i was just considering when mr george yolland came limping up the drive and the sight was the first shock to the selfish side of my grief  is anything the matter i asked trying to speak sternly but my heart thumping terribly  noyesnot exactly he said hastily but can you come miss alison  i believe you are the only person who can be of use  then is he ill i asked still coldly not being quite sure whether i ought to forgive  not bodily but his despair over what has taken place is beyond us all  he sits silent over the accounts in his room at the office will talk to none of us  mr alison has triedi haveben and all of us he never looks up but to call for sodawater  if he yields again it will soon be acute dipsomania and then he shrugged his shoulders  but what do you mean  what can i do said i walking on by his side all the time  take him home  give him hope and motive  get him away at any rate before those fellows come  mr tracy was over at mycening this morning and said they talked of coming to sleep at the boar for the meet tomorrow and looking him up  lord malvoisin i asked  and as i walked on mr yolland told me what i had not understood from eustace that there had been an outcry among the more reckless of the foling hunt that so good a fellow should be a teetotaller dermot tracy had been defied into betting upon the resolute abstinence of his heronay perhaps the truth was that these men had felt that their victim was being attracted from their grasp and a satanic instinct made them strive to degrade his idol in his eyes  so advantage was taken of the australians ignorance of the names of liqueurs  perhaps the wine in the soup had already caused some excitement in the headunaccustomed to any stimulant ever since the accident and illness which had rendered it inflammable to a degree no one suspected  when once the first glass was swallowed the dreadful work was easy resolution and judgment were obscured and the old habits and cravings of the days when poor harold had been a hard drinker had been revived in full force  uproarious mirth and wild feats of strength seemed to have been the consequence ending by provoking the interference of the police who had locked up till the morning such of the party as could not escape  happily the stupefied stage had so far set in that harold had made it no worse by offering resistance and dermot had managed to get the matter hushed up by the authorities at foling  this was what he had come to say but harold had been very brief and harsh with him though he was thoroughly angered and disgusted at the conduct of his friends and repeated hotly that he had been treated with treachery such as he could never forgive  so we came to the former dragons head where harold had fitted up a sort of office for himself  mr yolland bade me go up alone and persuade him to come home with me  i was in the greater fright because of the selfishness which had mingled with the mornings indignation but i had just presence of mind enough for an inarticulate prayer through the throbbings of my heart ere knocking and at once entering the room where under a jet of gas harold sat at a desk loaded with papers and ledgers on which he had laid down his head  i went up to him and laid my hand as near his brow as his position would let me  oh how it burnt  he looked up with a face half haggard half sullen with misery and hoarsely said lucy how came you here  i came in to get you to walk home with me  ill get a fly for you  this would be going to the boar the very place to meet these men  oh no please dont  i should like the walk with you  i cant go home yet  i have something to do  i must make up these books  but why  there cant be any haste  yes  i shall put them into yollands hands and go by the next mail  harold  you promised to stay till eustace was in good hands  he laughed harshly  you have learnt what my promise is worth  oh harold dont  you were cheated and betrayed  they took a wicked advantage of you  i knew what i was about he said with the same grim laugh at my folly what is a man worth who has lost his selfcommand  he may regain it i gasped out for his look and manner frightened me dreadfully  he made an inarticulate sound of scorn but seeing perhaps the distress in my face he added more gently no lucy this is really best i am not fit to be with you  i have broken my word of honour and lost all that these months had gained  i should only drag eustace down if i stayed  why  oh why  it was through their deceit  oh harry there is not such harm done that you cannot retrieve  no he said emphatically  understand what you are asking  my safeguard of an unbroken word is gone  the longing for that stuffaccursed though i know itis awakened  nothing but shame at giving way before these poor fellows that i have preached temperance to withholds me at this very moment  but it does withhold you  oh harold  you know you can be strong you know god gives strength if you would only try  i know you say so  because i know it  oh harold try my way  do ask god to give you what you want to stand up against this  if i did it would not undo the past  something else can do that  he did not answer but reached his hat saying something again about time and the fly  i must make another effort  oh harold give up this  do not be so cruel to dora and to me  have you made us love you better than anybody only to go away from us in this dreadful way knowing it is to give yourself up to destruction  do you want to break our hearts  me he said in a dreamy way  you dont really care for me  i  oh harry when you have grown to be my brother when you are all that i have in this world to lean on and help me will you take yourself away  it might be better for you he said  but it will not i said you will stay and go on and god will make your strength perfect to conquer this dreadful thing too  you shall try it then he said and he began to sweep those accounts into a drawer as if he had done with them for the night and as he brought his head within my reach i could not but kiss his forehead as i said thank you my harry  he screwed his lips together with a strange halfsmile very near tears emptied the rest of a bottle of sodawater into a tumbler gulped it down opened the door turned down the gas and came down with me  mr yolland was watching i well knew but he discreetly kept out of sight and we came out into a very cold raw street with the stars twinkling overhead smiling at us with joy i thought and the bells were ringing for evening service  but our dangers were not over  we had just emerged into the main street when a dogcart came dashing up the two cigars in it looming red  it was pulled up  harolds outline could be recognised in any light but i was entirely hidden in his great shadow and a voice called out  halloo alison how do  a chop and claret at the boareh  come along  thank you said harold but i am walking home with miss alison  the two gentlemen bowed and i bowed and oh how i gripped harolds arm as i heard the reply not openly derisive to a lady but with a sneer in the voice oh ah yes  but youll come when youve seen her home  well send on the dogcart for you  no thank you said harold  his voice sounded firm but i felt the thrill all through the arm i clung to  good night  he attempted no excuse but strode oni had to run to keep up with himand they drove on by our side and nessy horsman said a prior engagement eh  and miss alison will not release you  ladies claims are sacred we all know  what possessed me i dont know nor how i did it but it was in the dark and i was wrought up and i answered and yours can scarcely be so  so we will go on harold  a fair hit nessy and there was a laugh and flourish of the whip i was trembling and a dark cloud had drifted up with a bitter blast and the first hailstones were falling  the door of the church was opened for a moment showing bright light from within the bells had ceased  my dear lucy said harold you had better go in here for shelter  not if you leave me  you must come with me i said still dreading that he would leave me in church send a fly and fall a victim at the boar and indeed i was shaking so that he would not withdraw his arm and said soothingly im coming  oh that blessed hailstorm that drove us in  i drew harold into a seat by the door keeping between him and that that he might not escape but i need not have feared  ben yollands voice was just beginning the confession  it had so rarely been heard by harold that repetition had not blunted his ears to the sound and presently i heard a short low sobbing gasp and looked round  harold was on his knees his hands over his face and his breath coming short and thick as those old words spoke out that very dumb inarticulate shame grief and agony that had been swelling and bursting in his heart without utterance or formwe have erred and strayedthere is no health in us  we were far behind everyone elsealmost in the dark  i dont think anyone knew we were there and harold did not stand up throughout the whole service but kept his hands locked over his brow and knelt on perhaps he heard little more from the ringing of those words in his ears for he moved no more nor looked up through prayers or psalms or anything else until the brief ceremony was entirely over and i touched him and then he looked up and his eyes were swimming and streaming with tears  we came to the door as if he was in a dream and there a bitterly cold blast met us though the rain had ceased  i was not clad for a night walk  harold again proposed fetching a carriage from the boar but i cried out against thati would much much rather walk with him  it was fine now  so we went the length of the street and just then down came the blast on us oh such a hurricane bringing another hailstorm on its wings and sweeping along so that i could hardly have stood but for harolds arm and after a minute or two of labouring on he lifted me up in his arms and bore me along as if i had been a baby  oh i remember nothing so comfortable as that sensation after the breathless encounter with the storm  it always comes back to me when i hear the words a man shall be as a hidingplace from the tempest a covert from the wind  he did not set me down till we were at the front door  we were both wet through cold and spent and it was past nine so long as it had taken him to labour on in the tempest  eustace came out grumbling in his petulant way at our absence from dinner  i dont think either of us could bear it just then harold went up to his room without a word i stayed to tell that he had seen me home from church and say a little about the fearful weather and then ran up myself to give orders as mr yolland had advised me that some strong hot coffee should be taken at once to harolds room  i thought it would be besetting him to go and see after him myself but i let dora knock at his door and heard he had gone to bed  to me it was a long night of tossing and halfsleep hearing the wild stormy wind and dreaming of strange things praying all the time that the noble soul might be won for god at last and almost feeling like the icelander during the conversion of his country the struggle between the dark spirits and the white  i had caught a heavy cold and should have stayed in bed had i not been far too anxious and i am glad i did not for i had not been many minutes in my sittingroom before there was a knock at the door and harold came in and what he said was lucy how does one pray  poor boys  their mothers in the revulsion from all that had seemed like a system of bondage had held lightly by their faith and in the cares and troubles of their life had heeded little of their childrens devotions so that the practical heathenism of their home at boola boola had been unrelieved save by eustace the elder when his piety was reckoned as part of his weak gentlemanly refinement the dull hopeless wretchedness was no longer in harolds face but there was a wistful gentle weariness and yet rest in it which was very touching as he came to me with his strange sad question how does one pray  i dont know exactly how i answered it  i hardly could speak for crying as i told him the very same things one tells the little children and tried to find him some book to help but my books no more suited him than my clothes would have done till he said i want what they said in church yesterday  and as we knelt together and i said it the 51st psalm came to my mind and i went through it oh how differently from when i had said it the day before  ah he said at the end thank you  and then he stood and looked at the picture which was as his childs to him turned and said well for him that he is out of all this  presently when i had marked a prayer book for him he said and may i ask that thethe craving i told you of may not come on so intolerably  ask and it shall be given i said  it may not go at once dear harold  temptation does come but only to be conquered and you will conquer now  we went down to breakfast where eustace appeared in full hunting trim but harold in the rough coat and long gaiters that meant farming work and to eustaces invitations to the run he replied by saying he heard that phil ogden had been to ask him about some difficulty in the trenching work and he was going to see to it  so he spent the daylight hours in one of those digging and toiling tasks of his that three daylabourers could not end  i saw him coming home at six oclock clay up to the eyes and having achieved wholesome hunger and wholesome sleepiness  eustace had come in cross  he had been chaffed about harolds shirking and being a dutiful nephew and he did not like it at all he thought harold ought to have come out for his sake and to show they did not care  i do care said harold  and when eustace with his usual taste mentioned that they had laughed at the poor fellow led meekly home by his aunt harold laid a kind hand on mine which spoke more than words  i had reason to think that his struggle lasted some time longer and that the enemy he had reawakened was slow of being laid to rest so that he was for weeks undergoing the dire conflict but he gave as little sign as possible and he certainly conquered  and from that time there certainly was a change  he was not a man without god any longer  he had learnt that he could not keep himself straight and had enough of the childlike nature to believe there was one who could  i dont mean that he came at once to be all i could have wished or figured to myself as a religious man  he went to church on sunday morning now chiefly i do believe for love of the confession which was the one voice for his needs and partly too because i had pressed for that outward token thinking that it would lead him on to more but it generally seemed more weariness than profit and he never could sit still five minutes without falling asleep so that he missed even those sermons of mr ben yollands that i thought must do him good  i tried once when feeling how small my powers were beside his to get him to talk to this same mr yolland whose work among the pottery people he tried to second but he recoiled with a tone half scorn half reserve which showed that he would bear no pressure in that direction only he came to my sittingroom every morning as if kneeling with me a few moments and reading a few short verses were to be his safeguard for the day and sometimes he would ask me a question  much did i long for counsel in dealing with him but i durst seek none except once when something mr ben yolland said about his having expressed strong affection for me made me say if only i were fitter to deal with him the answer was go on as you are doing that is better for him as yet than anything else     chapter ix  the champions belt   after all the fates sent us a chaperon  a letter came addressed to my mother and proved to be from the clergyman of a village in the remotest corner of devonshire where a cousin of my father had once been vicar  his widow the daughter of his predecessor had lived on there but owing to the misdoings of her son and the failure of a bank she was in much distress  all intercourse with the family had dropped since my fathers death but the present vicar casting about for means of helping her had elicited that the arghouse family were the only relations she knew of and had written to ask assistance for her  i will go and see about her said harold  so he shouldered his bag walked into mycening and started in the tender the only place where he could endure railway travelling  four days later came this note                                                thursday  my dear lucysend the carriage to meet mrs alison at 440 on saturday  your affectionate                                                  h a   i handed the note to eustace in amazement but i perceived that he like his cousin thought it quite simple that the home of the head of the family should be a refuge for all its waifs and strays and as i was one myself i felt rebuked  i went to mycening in the carriage and beheld harold emerge from a firstclass extracting therefrom one basket after another two birdcages a bundle an umbrella a parcel a cloak and finally a little panting applecheeked old lady  heres lucy thats right and as both his hands were full he honoured me with a hasty kiss on the forehead  shell take care of you while i get the rest of it  but ohmy dear manmy pussyandand your wadded cloakand ohmy sable muffyour poor papas present i would not lose it for a thousand pounds  i found the muff which could not easily be overlooked for it was as big as a portmanteau and stuffed full of sundries  oh dear yes my dear thank you so it is but the catmy poor pussy  no my dear thats the bantamsvery choice  my poor little henry had them given to him when he was six years oldthe old ones i meanand ive never parted with them  take them all he saidso good but oh dear tit  tit  tittie  he was playing with her just now  has anyone seen a tabby cat  bless me there it goes  so dreadful  it takes ones breath away and all my things  oh where is he  all right said harold  there are your boxes and heres your cat showing a striped head under his coat  now say what you want tonight and ill send for the rest  she looked wildly about uttering an incoherent inventory which harold cut short by handing over articles to the porter according to his own judgment and sweeping her into the carriage returning as i was picking up the odds and ends that had been shed on the way  you have had a considerable charge said i between amusement and dismay  poor old thing comfort her  she never saw a train before and is regularly overset  he put me into the carriage emptied his pockets of the cat and other trifles and vanished in the twilight the old lady gaspingly calling after him and i soothing her by explaining that he always liked walking home to stretch his legs while she hoped i was sure and that it was not want of room  truly a man of his size could not well have been squeezed in with her paraphernalia but i did my best to console the old lady for the absence of her protector and i began at last to learn as best i could from her bewildered and entangled speech how he had arrived taken the whole management of her affairs and insisted on carrying her off but her gratitude was strangely confused with her new railway experiences and her anxieties about her parcels  i felt as if i had drifted a little bit farther from old times when we held our heads rather fastidiously high above odd people  but old mrs samuel alison was a lady as even lady diana allowed but of a kind nearly extinct  she had only visited london and bath once on her wedding tour in the days of stagecoaches there was provincialism in her speech and the little she had ever been taught she had forgotten and she was the most puzzleheaded woman i ever encountered  i do not think she ever realised that it was at harolds own expense that her rent and other little accounts had been paid up nor that eustace was maintaining her  she thought herself only on a long visit and trusted the assurances that harold was settling everything for ever  the l30 income which remained to her out of one of l200 served for her pocketmoney and all else was provided for her without her precisely understanding how nor did she seem equal to the complications of her new home  she knew our history in a certain sort of way but she spoke of one of us to the other as your brother or your sister and the late mr sam always figured as your poor papa we tried at first to correct her but never got her farther than your poor uncle and at last we all acquiesced except eustace who tried explanations with greater perseverance than effect  her excuse always was that harold was so exactly like her poor dear little henry except for his beard that she could almost think she was speaking to him she was somewhat deaf and did not like to avow it which accounted for some of her blunders  one thing she could never understand namely why harold and eustace had never met her poor little henry in australia which she always seemed to think about as big as the isle of wight  he had been last heard of at melbourne and we might tell her a hundred times that she might as well wonder we had not met a man at edinburgh she always recurred to i do so wish you had seen my poor dear little henry till harold arrived at a promise to seek out the said henry who by all appearances was an unmitigated scamp whenever he should return to australia  on the whole her presence was very good for us if only by infusing the element of age  she liked to potter about in the morning attending to her birds and bantams and talking to the gardening men weeding women and all the people in the adjacent hamlet and afterwards the fireside with her knitting and a newspaper sufficed her  not the daily papersthey were far too much for her but the weekly paper from her own town which lasted her till a new one came as she spelled it through and communicated the facts and facetiae as she thought them suited to our capacity  she was a better walker than i and would seldom come out in the carriage for she always caught cold when she did so  a long nap after dinner ended in her resuming her knitting quite contentedly in silence  she wanted no more though she was pleased if any one said a few kindly words to her  nothing could be more inoffensive and she gave us a centre and something needing consideration  i feared dora might be saucy to her but perhaps motherliness was what the wild child needed for she drew towards her and was softened and even submitted to learn to knit for the sake of the mighty labour of making a pair of socks for harold  the respectability her presence gave in our pew and by our hearth was a great comfort to our friends of all degrees  she was a very pretty old lady with dark eyes cheeks still rosy lovely loose waves of short snowy curls and a neat active little figure which looked well in the good black silks in which i contrived to invest her  good old woman she thought us all shockingly full of worldliness little guessing how much gaiety was due to her meek presence among us we even gave dinnerparties in state and what richardson and i underwent from eustace in preparation no tongue can tell nor eustaces complacence in handing down lady diana  the embargo on intercourse with arked house was over before viola was taken to london to be introduced  eustace wanted much to follow them be at the levee and spend the season in town  had he not been presented at government house and was it not due to the queen  dora more practically offered to follow the example of the siberian exile and lay a petition for prometeskys release at her majestys feet but harold uttered his ponderous no alike to both proving in his capacity as agent that eustace had nothing like the amount this year which could enable him to spend two or three months even as a single man in london society  the requisite amount which he had ascertained was startling even had eustace been likely to be frugal nor could this years income justify it in spite of boola boola  the expense of coming into the estate together with all the repairs and improvements had been such that the australian property had been needed to supplement the new  eustace was very angry and disappointed and grumbled vehemently  it was all harrys fault for making him spend hundreds on his own maggots that nobody wanted and nobody cared about and would be the ruin of him  poor bullock would have raised the sum fast enough and thought nothing of it  harry never said how much of his own funds from boola boola had supplemented eustaces outlay he did not even say how much better it was to be a good landlord than a man about town all he did was to growl forth to his spoilt child therell be more forthcoming next year  eustace protested that he did not believe it and harold replied no legacy dutyno stock to purchasehydriots dividend  it did not check the murmur and eustace sulked all the rest of the day indeed this has always seemed to me to have been the first little rift in his adherence to his cousin but at that time his dependence was so absolute and his power of separate action so small that he submitted to the decree even while he grumbled and when he found that lord erymanth viewed it as very undesirable for a young man to come up to london without either home or business or political views took to himself great credit for the wise decision  indeed lord erymanth did invite us all for a fortnight to his great old mansion in piccadilly to see the exhibition and as he solemnly told me to observe enough of our institutions as may prepare my young friends for future life  even dora was asked by special entreaty from viola who undertook to look after herrather too boldly considering that diie mrs enderbywas mistress of violas movements and did not leave her much time to waste upon us  in fact mrs enderby though perfectly civil was evidently hostile to us and tried to keep her sister out of our way as much as she could thickening engagements upon her at which viola made all the comical murmurs her irish blood could prompt but of course in vain eustaces great ambition was to follow her to her parties and lady diana favoured him when she could but harold would have nothing to do with such penances  he never missed a chance of seeing viola come down attired for them but as he once said that was enough for him  he did not want to see her handed about and grimaced at by a lot of fine gentlemen who did not seem to think anything worth the trouble and as to the crowd and the stifling they made him feel ready to strike out and knock everyone down  so much eustace and i elicited in short sentences one day when we were rather foolishly urging on him to let himself be taken with us to an evening party  no he went his own way and took dora with him and i was quite sure that they were safe together and that after his years experience he was to be trusted to know where it was fitting to take her  they saw a good deal that was more entertaining than we could venture on and moreover harold improved his mind considerably in the matters of pottery porcelain and model lodginghouses  dermot was in london too not staying with uncle or sister for both of whom he was much too erratic though he generally presented himself at such times as were fittest for ascertaining our movements for the day when it generally ended in his attaching himself to some of us for harold seemed to have passed an act of oblivion on the doings of that last unhappy meeting and allowed himself to be taken once or twice with eustace into dermots own world but not only was he on his guard there but he could not be roused to interest even where horseflesh was concerned  some one said he was too great a barbarian and so he was his sports and revelries had been on a wilder ruder more violent scale such as made these seem tame  he did not understand mere trifling for amusements sake still less how money could be thrown away for it and for fashion when it was so cruelly wanted by real needs and even dermot was made uncomfortable by his thorough earnestness  it wont do in the village in the nineteenth century said he to me  it is likewho was that old fellow it was said ofa lion stalking about in a sheepfold  sheep said i indignantly  i am afraid some are wolves in sheeps clothing  dermot shrugged his shoulders and said how is one to help oneself if one has been born some two thousand years too late or not in the new halfbaked hemisphere where demigods still walk the earth in their simplicity  i want you not to spoil the demigod when he has walked in among you  i envy him too much to do that said dermot with a sigh  i believe you dermot but dont take him among those who want to do so  thats your faith in your demigod said dermot not able to resist a little teasing but seeing i was really pained he added no lucy ill never take him again to meet malvoisin and nessy horsman in the first place i dont know how he might treat them and in the next i would die sooner than give them another chance even if he would  i thought the men would have been struck with him as i was but no it is not in them to be struck with anyone  all they think of is how to make him like themselves  comus crew said i  oh dermot how can you see it and be one of them  im not happy enough to be an outer barbarian he said and went his way  there was a loan exhibition of curious old objects in plate and jewellery to which lady diana took me and where among other things we found a long belt crusted thickly with scales of gold and with a sort of medal at the clasp  just look here mamma said viola i do believe this is the archery prize  and sure enough on the ticket was belt supposed to be of peruvian workmanship  taken in the spanish armada 1588  champion belt at the northchester archery club  lent by miss hippolyta horsman  lady diana came to look with some interest  she had never had an opportunity of examining it closely before and she now said i am much inclined to believe that this is the belt that used to be an heirloom in the jerfield family and which ought to be in yours lucy  my fathers first wife had been the last of the jerfields and i asked eager questions  lady diana believed that those unhappy young men had made away with all their mothers jewels but she could tell no more as our catastrophe had taken place while she was living at killy marey  her brother she said could tell us more and so he did enough to set eustace on fire  yes the belt had been well known  it was not taken in the armada but in a galleon of the peruvian plunder by an old jerfield who had been one of the race of westward ho heroes  the jerfields had not been prosperous and curious family jewels had been nearly all the portion of the lady who had married my father  the sons had claimed them and they were divided between them and given to the two wives and in the time of distress when far too proud to accept aid from the father as well as rather pleased at mortifying him by disposing of his family treasures alice and dorothy alison had gradually sold them off  and once in the hands of local jewellers it was easy for the belt to pass into becoming the prize held by the winner in the archery club every year  lord erymanth would go with eustace the next morning to identify it but what would be the use of that eustace at first fancied he could claim it but soon he saw that his proposal was viewed as so foolish that he devoured it and talked of giving an equivalent but as lord erymanth observed it would be very difficult to arrange this with an article of family and antiquarian value in the hands of an archery cluban impersonal body  the thing would be to win it said viola  could not some of us  well done little miss tell returned dermot  hippo has won that same belt these four years to my certain knowledge except once when laurie stympson scored two more  ill practise every day wont you lucy  and then between us there will be two chances  i am sure i am very much nattered by miss tracys kindness put in eustace but is the match solely between ladies  no for the last two years after a match between ladies and between gentlemen there had a final one taken place between the two winners male and female in which hippo had hitherto always carried off the glory and the belt  so eustace intimated his full intention of trying for himself endeavouring to be very polite to viola and me but implying that he thought himself a far surer card boasting of his feats as a marksman in the bush until dora broke in why eustace that was harry wasnt it harry  comme a lordinaire muttered dermot  eustace made a little stammering about the thing being so near that no one could tell and dora referred again to harold who put her down with a muttered never mind under his beard  what was to be done with it if it were won  get a facsimile made and an appropriate inscription recommended lord erymanth probably they would take that willingly  but what would you do with it asked harold  you cant wear it  i tell you it is an heirloom quoth eustace  have you no feeling for an heirloom  i am sure it was your mother who sold it away from me  the sight of the belt with lord erymanths lecture on it inflamed eustaces ardour all the more and we made extensive purchases of bows and arrows that is to say eustace and i did for lady diana would not permit viola to join in the contest  she did not like the archery set disapproved of public matches for young ladies and did not choose her daughter to come forward in the cause  i did not fancy the matches either and was certain that my mere home pastime had no chance with hippo and pippa who had studied archery scientifically for years and aimed at being the best lady shots in england but eustace would never have forgiven me if i had not done my best  so we subscribed to the archery club as soon as we went home and eustace would have had me practise with him morning noon and night till i rebelled and declared that if he knocked me up my prowess would be in vain and that i neither could nor would shoot more than an hour and a half a day  his ardour however soon turned into vituperations of the stupid sport  how could mortal man endure it  if it had been pistol or rifleshooting now it would have been tolerable and he should have been sure to excel but a great long senseless useless thing like an arrow was only fit for women or black fellows the string hurt ones fingers tooalways slipping off the tabs  no wonder as you hold it said harold who had just turned aside to watch on his way down to the potteries and came in time to see an arrow fly into the bank a yard from the target  dont you see how lucy takes it  i had already tried to show him but he had pronounced mine to be the ladies way and preferred to act by the light of nature  harry looked asked a question or two took the bow in his own hands and with this way eustace dont you see had an arrow in the outer white  yes said eustace of course stupid thing anybody can do it without any trouble  it is pretty work said harry taking up the third arrow and sending it into the inner white  much too easy for men was eustaces opinion and he continued to despise it until being capable of perseverance of a certain kind and being tutored by harold he began to succeed in occasionally piercing the target upon which his mind changed and he was continually singing the praises of archery in the tone whispered viola of the sparrow who killed cock robin with his bow and arrow  we used to practise for an hour every afternoon and the fascination of the sport gained upon harold so much that he sent for a bow and arrows and shot with us whenever he was not too busy as between the agency and the potteries he often was  he did not join the club nor come to the weekly meetings at northchester with eustace and me until after having seen a little of the shooting there i privately hinted to him that there was not the smallest chance of the champion belt changing hands unless he took up the family cause whereupon rather than that eustace should be disappointed he did ask to be admitted and came once with us to the meeting when to tell the truth he did not shoot as well as usual foras afterwards appearedin riding into northchester he had stopped to help to lift up a great tree that was insecure on its timber waggon and even his hands shook a little from the exertion  besides eustace had discovered that harolds new bow shot better than his and had insisted on changing and harold had not so proved the powers of eustaces as to cure it of its inferiority  eustace really came to shooting so tolerably as to make him look on the sport with complacency and like the people he met there  all this hardly seems worth telling but events we little thought of sprang from those archery practices  for the present we found them a great means of getting acquainted with the neighbours  i bowed now to many more people than ever i had done before and we had come into great favour since the hydriots had astonished the county by announcing a dividend it was only three per cent but that was an immense advance upon nothing and the promise of the future was great the shares had gone up nearly to their original value in the most sanguine days and the workmenbetween prosperity good management the lectureroom at the dragons head and the work among them done by the clerical as well as the secular yollandwere not models by any means but far from the disorderly set they had been  they did take some pride in decent houses and welldressed children and harolds plans for the improvement of their condition were accepted as they never would have been from one whose kindly sympathy and strength of will did not take them as it were captive among those workmen you feel that he is a born king of men said ben yolland  and as bullock had been bailiff as well as agent harry had all the homefarming matters on his hands and attended to them like any farmer so that it was no wonder that he gave little time to the meetings for archery practice which involved the five miles expedition and even to our own domestic practice answering carelessly when eustace scolded him about letting a chance go by and his heedlessness of the honour of the family oh i take a shot or two every morning as i go out to keep my hand in  youll get your arrows spoilt in the dew said eustace  they dont go into the dew said harold  and as he was always out with the lark even dora seldom saw this practice but there were always new holes very near the centre of the target which eustace said proved how true was his own aim  harvest came and in the middle of it the great archery match of the year which was held in the beautiful grounds of mr vernon the member for northchester a little way from the town  i suppose harry may as well go said eustace but he has not practised at all so it will be of little avail  now if i had not grazed my hand i should have scored quite as much as miss horsman last week  it all lies in caring about it  and severe was his lecture to harold against foolishly walking in and making his hand unsteady  yet after all when the carriage came to the door harold was not to be found though his bow and arrows were laid ready with ours to be taken  he endured no other apparatus the inside of his fingers was like leather and he declared that tabs and guard only hampered him  lady diana had yielded to her daughters entreaties and brought her to see the contest though only as a spectator  as i stood shy and far from sanguine among the lady archers i felt out of my natural place and glad she was under her mothers wing she looked so fair and innocent in her delicate blue and white and was free for such sweet ardour in our cause all the prettier and more arch because its demonstrations were kept down with the strong hand of her mother  hippolyta and philippa horsman were in tightlymade shortskirted dresses porkpie hats and strong boots all black picked out with scarlet like hippos own complexion  she was tall with a good active figure and handsome but she had reached the age when the colouring loses its pure incarnadine and becomes hard and fixed and she had a certain likeness to all those creatures whose names are compounded of tiger  but she was a goodnatured being and of late i had begun to understand better her aspirations towards doing and becoming something more than the mere domestic furniture kind of young lady  her aberrations against good taste and reticence were i began to understand misdirected outbreaks of the desire to be up and doing even now as we ladies drew for our turn she was saying half sadly im tired of it all  what good comes of getting this belt over and over again  if it were rifle or pistol shooting it might be of use but one could hardly organise a regiment of volunteers with the long bows when the invasion comes off  wit about the amazonian regiment with the long bow was current all the time we ladies were shooting and eustace was worrying me to such a degree that nervousness made me perform ten degrees worse than usual but that mattered little for hippolyta with another of her cui bono sighs carried off the roman mosaic that was the ladies prize telling pippa that it should be hers when the belt was won  dont be too sure  bosh  theres no one here who can handle a bow but charlie stympson one alison is a spoon and the other is a giant made to be conquered when he shot before his arrows went right over the grounds and stuck into a jackdaws nest on the church tower  i cant think why he came  to make a feather in your cap  what a substantial one  there i escaped to a seat by lady diana where viola could expend her enthusiasm in clutches and squeezes of my hand  eustace was by this time wrought up to such a state that he hardly knew what he was doing and his first arrow wavered and went feebly aside  two or three more shot and then the tall figure came to the front one moment and the cry was gold while violas clap of the hands brought on her a frown from her mother who thought demonstrativeness improper  she had to content herself with pinching my fingers every time one of those shafts went home to the heart of the target and harold stood only too facile princeps while eustace sauntered up to us with the old story about the sun or the damp i forget which only it was something that had spoilt his archery  hippolyta was undaunted  the small target and longer range had thrown out many a competitor before now and her not very lowpitched tone was heard observing that no dumb giant should beat her at her own tools  whatever had been her weariness of her successes before it was gone now and she shot splendidly  never had such shooting been known in the annals of the club and scarcely a word passed as the two went pacing between the two little targets harold with his calm easy movement businesslike but without effort and hippolyta with excitement beginning to tell on her  each time she passed us we saw her step more impetuous the glow on her cheeks deeper and at last that her eyes were full of tears and after that one arrow went into the outer white and the last even into the green while harrys final shot was into that one great confluent hole that the centre of the target had become             heard ye the arrow hurtle through the sky            heard ye the dragon monsters deathful cry  whispered viola mamma wont let me cheer and i must have it out somehow  and as i sprang up and hurried to harold she came with me taking care to cast no look behind for fear of detaining glances and she put out both hands to shake his as he stood with the smile lighting up his face as he saw the pleasure he had given though eustace never came forward unable to rejoice where he had been so palpably and publicly excelled  hippolyta behaved well  she came up holding out her hand and saying well mr alison if one is to fall it is a pleasure to have so mighty a victor  but why did you never let me see before what a palnatoke if i must not say tell i had to deal with  i had no time for the practices said harold puzzled as to who palnatoke was  worse and worse  you dont mean that you shoot like this without practice  lucy taught me a little  well if heavenborn archers come down on one theres nothing for it but submitting  robin hood must prevail said hippolyta as the belt was handed over to harold with a sigh that made him say in excuse i would not have done it but that eustace wanted to have it in his hands for family reasons  then let him look to it i mean to get it again next year  and i say mr alison i have a right to some compensation  all you archers are coming to lunch at therford on thursday if the sun shines to be photographed you know  now you must come to breakfast and bring your lions skin and your bowto be done alone it is all the consolation i ask  make him lucy  bring him  there was no refusing and that was the way the photograph came to be taken  we were reminded by a note after we went home including in the invitation eustace who after being a little sulky had made up his mind that a long range was easier to shoot at than a short one and so that he should have won the prize if he had had the chance and the notion of being photographed was of course delightful to him  in what character shall you take me he asked of miss horsman when we were going out on the lawn and it dawned on him that harry was to be a hercules  oh as adonis of course said hippo  or eurystheus whispered her sister  eustace did not understand and looked pleased saying something about a truly classical get up but harold muttered to me arent they making game of him  they will take care not to vex him i said  but harold could not overlook it and took a dislike to the horsmans on the spot which all hippolytas genuine admiration of him could not overcome  she knew what the work of his eighteen months in england had been and revered him with such enthusiasm for what she called his magnificent manhood and beneficence as was ready on the least encouragement to have become something a good deal warmer but whatever she did served to make her distasteful to him  first she hastily shuffled over eustaces portrait because as she allowed us to hear he would give her no peace till he was disposed of  and then she not only tormented her passive victim a good deal in trying to arrange him as hercules but she forgot the woman in the artist and tried to make him bare his neck and shoulder in a way that made him blush while he uttered his emphatic no no and baby jack supported him by telling her she would only make a prizefighter of him  moreover he would have stood more at ease if the whole of therford had not been overrun with dogs  he scorned to complain and i knew him too well to do so for him but it was a strain on his selfcommand to have them all smelling about his legs and wanting to mumble the lion skin especially hippos great bloodhound kirby as big as a calf who did once make him start by thrusting his long cold nose into his hand hippo laughed but harold could do nothing but force out a smile  and i always saw the disgusted and bored expression most prominently in her performance which at the best could never have given the grandeur of the pose she made him take with the lion skin over his shoulder and the arrows and bow in his hand  he muttered that a rifle would be more rational and that he could hold it better but withdrew the protest when he found that hippo was ready to implore him to teach her to shoot with pistol rifleanything  your brother can show you  youve only to fire at a mark was all that could be got out of him  nor would he be entrapped into a beneficent talk  his great talent for silence served him well and though i told him afterwards that he had not done hippo justicefor she honestly wanted an opening for being usefulhe was not mollified  i dont like tongue was all he further said of her  but whatever hippo was or whatever she did i shall always be grateful to her for that photograph     chapter x  dermots mare   all this time dermot tracy had been from home  he had not come back after the season but had been staying with friends and going to various races in which as usual he had heavy stakes  he persuaded my two nephews to meet him at doncaster where he ran one of the horses bred on his irish estate and afterwards to go and make him a visit at killy marey county kildare where he used to stay about once a year shooting or hunting as the season might be and always looking after his horses and entertaining all the squires and squireens of the neighbourhood and many of the officers from the curragh  the benefit of those visits was very doubtful both as to morals and purses and lord erymanth pointedly said he was sorry when he heard that harold and eustace were of the party  i do not know whether lady diana viewed them as bad companions for her son or her son as a bad companion for them but she was very severe about it and when i thought of the hunt dinner at foling my heart sank even while i was indignant at any notion of distrusting harold and it did indeed seem to me that he had learnt where to look for strength and selfcommand and that he had a real hatred and contempt of evil  yet i should have been more entirely happy about him if he had not still held aloof from all those innermost ordinances of which he somehow did not feel the need or understand the full drift  nor would he bow himself to give to any man the confidence or the influence over him he had given to an incapable girl like me  and if i should have feared for the best brought up most religious of young men in such scenes as i was told were apt to take place at killy marey how could i not be anxious for my nephews but nothing ever turns out as one expects  i was at arked one day and lady diana was telling me of the great rambling house at killy marey and how when she arrived as a bride none of the doors would shut except two that would not open behind one of which lived the family ghost how the paper hung in festoons on the walls and the chairs were of the loveliest primrosecoloured brocade and how the green of the meadows was so wonderful that she was always remembering it was the emerald isle but how hopeless and impossible it was to get anything properly done and how no good could be done where the romish priests had interfered  all the old story of course  in the midst a telegraph paper was brought to her she turned deadly white and bade me open it for she could not  i knew she thought her son had met his fathers fate and expected to astonish her with the tidings that he was coming home by the next steamer or that he had sent some game or the like  alas no the mothers foreboding had been too near the truth  the telegram was from eustace tracy has had a bad horse accident  the doctor wishes for you  there was nothing for it but to speed the mother and daughter on their hurried start to catch the holyhead packet and cross that night  i went home to await in terror and trembling the despatch i might receive and to be enlivened by mrs sam alisons cheering accounts of all the accidents she could recollect  horses are dangerous creatures to meddle with and your poor papa never would let me take the reins when we kept a gigwhich was when he was living you know my dear you never can trust their heels he used to say and it was only last week little cocker was kicked off but that was a donkey and they were using him shamefully c c c  i felt as if a swarm of bees were humming in my ears and walked about to make the suspense more tolerable but i absolutely had no news at all till violas letter came  it was a long one for she could be of no service as yet and to write letters was at once her use and her solace  among the horses which dermots irish agent had been buying for training purposes was a mare own sister to harolds huntera splendid creature of three years old of wonderful beauty power and speed but with the like indomitable temper  she would suffer no living thing to approach her but one little stableboy and her own peculiar cat which slept on her back and took all sorts of liberties with her  her value would be great if she could be trained but the training was the problem  harold who partly from early familiarity partly from the gentleness of fearless strength had a matchless power over horses had made acquaintance with her one evening had been suffered in her box had fed her caressed her cat and led her round the stableyard as a first stage in the conquest of horse by man  in the early morning dermot quite as fearless and unwilling that anyone should do or dare more than himself had gone alone to make the same attempt but no sooner did the mare find him beside her than she seized him by the shoulder with her teeth threw him down and kicked and trampled on him  none of the grooms could succeed in rescuing him and it was only when eustaces cry had summoned harold that grasping the mares halter and forcing her back with his arm of iron he made it possible for eustace and a groom to drag out poor dermots senseless form in a state that at first appeared to be death itself  for several days his condition was so extremely precarious that harold never once left him till his mother arrived and even after that was his most effective nurse  he sent me a message in violas letter that he had not had a moment to write and hoped i had not been too anxious  after this viola wrote every day and told of gradual improvement in her brother and at last how he had been lifted to the sofa and mamma hoped in a fortnight or three weeks he might be able to be taken home by the next post came a note from harold saying he could be spared and was coming home and that very evening he walked into the house and was welcomed by dora with shrieks of ecstatic joy  he said dermot was better but he looked worn and had the indefinable expression of pain which made me sure that something had gone wrong and presently i found out that the bite in the shoulder was a very bad business still causing much suffering but that the most serious matter was that a kick in the side had renewed the damage left by the old alma bullet and that great care would be needed all the winter but harold seemed more reluctant to open his mouth than ever and only by most diligent pumping did mrs alison get out of him what doctors they had called in and whether they had used all the recipes for wounds and bruises that she had entrusted to me to be sent and which had for the most part remained in my blottingbook  the next morning to my grief and distress he did not come to my room but i found he had been up and out long before it was light and he made his appearance at eleven oclock saying he had promised to go and give lord erymanth an account of his nephew and wanted me to come with him to do the talking or he should never stand it if i did not object to the dogcart and daniel orourke immediately we should be there by luncheon time  i objected to nothing that harry drove but all the way to erymanth not ten words passed and those were matters of necessity  i had come to the perception that when he did not want to speak it was better to let him take his own time  lord erymanth was anxious not only about dermots health and his sisters strength and spirits but he wanted to hear what harold thought of the place and of the tone of the country and after our meal when he grew more confidential he elicited short plain answers full of information in short compass and not very palatable  the estate was not going on well  did harold think well of the agent he had been spoilt  how  by calls for supplies were the people attached to dermot  to a certain degree  would it be safe for him to live there  he ought  lord erymanth entirely assented to this and we found that he had all along held that his sister had been in error for not having remained at killy marey and brought up her son to his duties as a landlord whatever the danger though of course she poor thing could hardly be expected to see it in that light  he evidently viewed this absenteeism as the cause of the wreck of dermots youth and those desultory habits of selfindulgence and dissipation which were overcoming that which was good and noble in him and the good old man showed that he blamed himself for what he had conceded to his sister in the first shock of her misfortune  harold had told him of the warm feeling shown by the tenantry when dermot was lying in danger of his life and their rejoicing when he turned the corner and began to recover and he asked anxiously whether all this affection might not awaken a responsive chord and draw him to what was undoubtedly his proper sphere  it will said harold  you think so  and there is little doubt but that your cousins influence at such a critical period may have great effect in turning the scale  harold nodded  more especially as from the intelligence i have received i have little doubt that the connection will be drawn a good deal closer before long said lord erymanth with a benignant smile at us both i suppose we must not begin to congratulate one another yet for i may conclude that nothing had actually taken place when you came away  nothing  when my sister became conscious of the condition of affairs and wrote to consult me i had no hesitation in replying that though violas connections might warrant greater expectations in a worldly point of view yet i thought that there was every reason for promoting an attachment to a gentleman of family equal to her own on one side at least and whose noble exertions during the past two years for the welfare of all concerned with him not only obliterate all recollection of past disadvantages but in every way promise honour and happiness to all connected with him  i was not a little excited but one of the worst fits of restlessness under lord erymanths harangues had come upon harold  he only sat it out by pulling so many hairs out of his beard that they made an audible frizzle in the fire when he brushed them off his knee and stood up saying gruffly you are very good he deserves it  but i must get lucy home in good time  may i go and speak to your coachman  tracy gave me a message for him  harold was off and lord erymanth observed a very fine young man that  it is much to be regretted that he did not employ the advantages he enjoyed at sydney as his cousin eustace did and left himself so rugged and unpolished  you must learn to like him dear lord erymanth i said  he is all a very dear brother could be to me  and allegiance to him kept back every word of that infinite superiority which was never more shown than by the opinion of eustace which his great unselfish devotion continued without the least deceit to impress on most people  lord erymanth rejoiced and we agreed that it was very lucky for me that i preferred harold since i should have had to yield up my possession of eustace  the old gentleman was most kind and genial and much delighted that the old breach with the alisons should be healed and that his niece should make a marriage which he greatly preferred to her sisters and together we sung the praises of our dear viola where we had no difference of opinion  harold only came back when the carriage came round and no sooner had we driven off than i broke outharry i had no notion matters had gone so far  fancy lady diana consulting her brother  it must be very near a crisis  i cant think why you did not stay to see it  because i am a fool  the horse flew on till we were nearly out at the parkgates and a bewildered sense of his meaning was coming before me  you wished it said i rather foolishly  i did  i do  only i dont want to see it  my poor dear harold  pshawthe sound was like a wild beasts and made the horse plungei shall get over it  then presently in a more natural voice i must go out again in the spring  there are things to be looked to at boola boola for both of us  i shall only wait till tracy is well enough to go with me  he  dermot tracy  yes  it will be the best way to break out of the old lines  i can fancy that  oh harold are you going to save him  that will be the most blessed work of all i cried for somehow a feeling like an air of hope and joy came over me  i dont know about that said he in a smothered tone but it was getting dark enough to loose his tongue and when i asked was it his illness that made him wish it he answered it was coming before lucy those horses have done worse for him than that wound in his shoulder  they had almost eaten the very heart out of him  his substance i know they have i said but not his good warm heart  you would say so if you saw the poor wretches on his property said harold  the hovels in the alfy valley were palaces compared with the cabins  such misery i never saw  they say it is better since the famine  what must it have been then  and he thinking only how much his agent could squeeze from them  i could only say he had been bred up in neglect of them and to think them impracticable priestridden traitors and murderers  yes lady diana had said some of this to harold already it was true that they had shot mr tracy but harold had learnt that after a wild reckless spendthrift youth he had become a protestant and a violent orangeman in the hottest days of party strife so that he had incurred a special hatred which as far as harold could see was not extended to the son little as he did for his tenants but show them his careless gracious countenance from time to time  yet peril for the sake of duty would as all saw now have been far better for dermot than the alienation from all such calls in which his mother had brought him up  when her religious influence failed with him there was no other restraint  since he had left the army he had been drawn by those evil geniuses of his deep into speculations in training horses for the turf and his affairs had come into a frightful state of entanglement his venture at doncaster had been unsuccessful and plunged him deeper into his difficulties and then as i came to know harolds absolute startled amazement how any living man could screw and starve men women and children for the sake of horseflesh and his utter contempt for such diversions as he had been shown at the races compared with the pleasure of making human beings happy and improving ones land had opened dermots eyes with very few words  the thought was not new when the danger of death made him look back on those wasted years and resolution began with the dawning of convalescence that if he could only free himself from his entanglementsand terrible complications they werehe would begin a new life worthy of having been given back to him  in many a midnight watch he had spoken of these things and harold had soothed him by a promise to use that accountants head of his in seeing how to free him as soon as he was well enough  biston and the horses would be sold and he could turn his mind to his irish tenants who as he already saw loved him far better than he deserved  he caught eagerly at the idea of going out to australia with harold and it did indeed seem that my bravehearted nephew was effecting a far greater deliverance for him than that from the teeth and hoofs of wicked sheelah  but you will not stay harold  you will come home i said  i mean it he answered  then i dont so much mind said i with infinite relief and he added thinking that i wanted further reassurance that he should never give up trying to get prometeskys pardon and that this was only a journey for supplies and to see his old friend and perhaps to try whether anything could be done about that other unhappy harry i pressed him to promise me that he would return and settle here but though he said he would come back to settling at home he answered that depends and though i could not see i knew he was biting his moustache and guessed poor dear fellow that it depended on how far he should be able to endure the sight of eustace and viola married i saw now that i had been blind not to perceive before that his heart had been going out to viola all this time while he thought he was courting her for eustace and i also had my thoughts about viola which made it no very great surprise to me when in a few days more intelligence came that eustace might be expected at home and he made his appearance in a petulant though still conceited mood that made me suspect his wooing had not been prosperous though i knew nothing till harold told me that he was not out of heart though viola had cut him short and refused to listen to him for her mother said she was a mere child who was taken by surprise and that if he were patient and returned to the charge she would know her own mind better  harold was certainly more exhilarated than he chose to avow to himself on this discovery and the next week came a letter from lady diana and a short note from dermot himself both saying he had not been so well and begging harold to come and assist in the removal since dermot protested that otherwise he could not bear the journey and his mother declared that she should be afraid to think of it for him  violas hitherto constant correspondence had ceased i drew my own auguries but i had to keep them to myself for harold started off the next day in renewed spirits and i had eustace on my hands in a very strange state not choosing or deigning to suppose himself rejected and yet exceedingly angry with all young ladies for their silliness and caprices while he lauded lady diana up to the skies and abused dermot who i think had laughed at him visibly enough to be at least suspected by himself  and oddly enough dora was equally cross and had a fit of untowardness unequalled since the combats at her first arrival till i was almost provoked into acquiescence in eustaces threat of sending her to school  the journey was at last accomplished harold only parted with the tracys at arked house after having helped to carry dermot to the room that had been prepared for him on the groundfloor  i rode over the next afternoon to inquire and was delighted to meet viola close within the gate  we sent away my horse and she drew me into her favourite path while answering my questions that dermot had had a good night and was getting up i should find him in the drawingroom if i waited a little while  she could have me all to herself for mamma was closeted with uncle ery talking over thingsand on some word or sound of mine betraying that i guessed what things it broke out  how could you let him do it lucy  you at least must have known better  my dear how could i have stopped him with all st georges channel between us  well at any rate you might persuade them all to have a little sense and not treat me as if i was one of the elegant females in pride and prejudice who only refuse for fun  is not that enough to drive one frantic lucy  cant you at least persuade the man himself  only one person can do that viola  but i cant  thats the horrid part of it  i cant get rid of it mamma says i am a foolish child  i could tell her of other people more foolish than i am  i can see the difference between sham and reality if they cant  i dont think he means to be sham  i rambled into defence of eustace  means it  no he hasnt the sense  i believe he really thinks it was he who saved dermots life as entirely as mamma does  no  now do they really  of course as they do with everything  its always the page slew the boar the peer had the gloire  its the pages own fault i said  he only wants the peer to have the gloire  and very disagreeable and deceitful it is of him cried viola only he hasnt got a scrap of deceit in him and thats the reason he does it so naturally  no you may tell them that borrowed plumes wont always serve and there are things that cant be done by deputy  and therewith viola perhaps perceiving what she had betrayed turned more crimson than ever and hid her face against me with a sob in her breath and then i was quite sure of what i did not dare to express further than by saying while i caressed her i believe they honestly think it is all the same  but it isnt said viola recovering and trying to talk and laugh off her confusion  i dont think so and poor dermot did not find it so when the wrong one was left to lift him and just ran his great stupid arm into the tenderest place in his side and always stepped on all the boards that creak and upset the table of physic bottles and then said it was harolds way of propping them up  and thats the creature they expect me to believe in  we turned at the moment and saw a handkerchief beckoning to us from the window and going in found dermot established on a couch under it and harold packing him up in rugs a sight that amazed both of us but dermot said yes he treats me like miss stympsons dog you see comes over by stealth when i want him  dermot did look very ill and painworn and his left arm lay useless across him but there was a kind of light about his eyes that i had not seen for a long time as he made harold set a chair for me close to him and he and viola told the adventures of their journey with mirth in their own style and harold stood leaning against the shutter with his look of perfect present content as if basking in sunshine while it lasted  when the mother and uncle came in it was manifestly time for us to convey ourselves away  harold had come on foot from mycening but i was only too glad to walk my pony along the lanes and have his company in the gathering winter twilight  you have spoken to her he said  yes  harold it is of no use  she will never have him  her mother thinks she will  her mother knows what is in viola no more than she knows what is in that star  has dermot never said anything  lady diana made everyone promise not to say a word to him  oh  but lucy what hinders it  theres nothing else in the way is there  i did not speak the word but made a gesture of assent  may i know who it is said harold in a voice of pain  our poor fellow shall never hear  harold said i are you really so ridiculous as to think any girl could care for eustace  while you are by  dont cried harold with a sound as of far more pain than gladness  but why not harry  you asked me  dont light up what i have been struggling to quench ever since i knew it  why i went on  you need not hold back on eustaces account i am quite sure nothing would make her accept him and i am equally convinced  hush lucy he said in a scarcely audible voice  it is profanation remember  but all that is over i said things that happened when you were a mere boy and knew no better do not seem to belong to you now  sometimes they do not he said sadly but  what is repented i began but he interrupted  the fact is not changed  it is not fit that the purest gentlest brightest creature made by heaven should be named in the same day with one stained with bloodaye and deeds i could not speak of to you  i could not keep from crying as i said if i love you the more harry would not she  see here lucy said harry standing still with his hand on my rein you dont know what you do in trying to inflame what i can hardly keep down  the sweet little thing may have a fancy for me because im the biggest fellow she knows and have done a thing or two but what i am she knows less than even you do and would it not be a wicked shame either to gain the tender heart in ignorance or to thrust on it the knowledge and the pain of such a past as mine  and his groan was very heavy so that i cried out  oh harry this is dreadful  do you give up all hope and joy for ever because of what you did as an ungovernable boy left to yourself  we went on for some time in silence then he said in an indescribable tone between wonder disgust and pity and i thought i loved meg cree  you knew no one else i said feeling as if when dora threw away that ring the wild passionate animal man had been exorcised but all the answer i had was another groan as from the burthened breast as if he felt it almost an outrage to one whom he so reverenced to transfer to her the heart that had once beat for meg cree  there was no more speech for a long time during which i feared that i had merely made him unhappy by communicating my conjecture but just as we were reaching our own grounds he said you will say nothing lucy  no indeed  i thought it was all over and for ever he said pausing it ought to have been  but the gates of a new world were opened to me when i saw her and you walking in the garden  if it had only been five or six years sooner  he could not say any more for dora who had been watching here burst on us with cries of welcome and it was long before there was any renewal of the conversation so that i could not tell whether he really persuaded himself that he had no hopes or was waiting to see how matters should turn out  it was never easy to detect expressions of feeling or spirits on his massive face and he could hardly be more silent than usual but it was noticeable that he never fell asleep after his former wont when sitting still  indeed he seldom was still for he had a great deal of business both for the estate and the potteries on his hands and stayed up late at night over them and not only over them for my room was next to his and i heard the regular tramp tramp of his feet and the turn at the end of the room as he walked up and down for at least an hour when the rest of the house were asleep or the closing of the door when he returned from wandering on the moor at night  and in the early morning long before light he always walked or rode over to arked house bestowed on dermots hurts the cares which both had come to look on as essential and stayed with him till the family were nearly ready to appear at their nine oclock breakfast not seeing viola at all unless any special cause led to a meeting later in the day and then his eyes glowed and he would do her devoted unobserved serviceno not unobserved by her whom it made blush and sparkleand utter little words of thanks not so gay as of old but deeper as if for a great honour and delight  and then he would bow his head colour and draw into the background where with folded arms he could watch her  once when dora in her old way claimed to be his wife harold told her with some impatience that she was growing too old for that nonsense  the child looked at him with bent brows and questioning eyes for a moment then turned and fled  an hour later after a long search i found her crouched up in the corner of the kangaroos stall among the straw having cried herself to sleep with her head on the creatures soft back  as soon as dermot was able to bear any strain on mind or attention he gave his keys to harold  all his long and unhappy accumulation of bills and bonds were routed out from their receptacles at biston and brought over by harold to his office where he sorted them and made them intelligible before harassing his friend with the questions he alone could explain  an hour a day was then spent over themhours that cost poor dermot more than he was equal to but his mind was made up as he told me to face anything rather than go on in the old miserable way  it was much that he had learnt to think it miserable  lady diana was not much obliged to harold  she could not think why her patient was so often left out of spirits and with a headache after those visits while he was in a feverish state of anxiety about them that made it worse to put them off than to go through with them and then when she had found out the cause the family pride much disliked letting an outsider into his involvments and she thought their solicitor would have done the thing much better  poor woman it was hard that when she thought illness was bringing her son back to her she found his confidence absorbed by the bushranger whom she never liked nor trusted and his reformation if reformation it were to prove not at all conducted on her views of visible repentance and conversion  dermot was responsive to her awakened tenderness but he was perversely reticent as to whether repentance or expedience prompted him  she required so much religious demonstration that she made him shrink from manifesting his real feelings as humbug and viola knew far more that his repentance was real than she did  those proofs of true repentanceconfession and restitutioni am sure he gave and that most bravely when after weeks of weary and sorrowful work on harolds part and his the whole was sufficiently disentangled to make a lucid statement of his affairs  he made up his mind to make an arrangement with his creditors giving up biston all his horseseverything in fact but killy marey which was entailed on his tracy cousins  and this second year of george yollands management had made the shares in the hydriot company of so much value that the sale of them would complete the clearance of his obligations  the full schedule of his debts without reserve and the estimate of his means of paying them off was then given by dermot to his mother and sent to his uncle who went over them with his solicitor  lady diana writhed under the notion of selling biston  it seemed to her to be the means of keeping her son from the place in ireland which she disliked more than ever and she hoped her brother would advance enough to prevent this from being needful but for this lord erymanth was far too wise  he said as dermot felt that biston had never been anything but an unjustifiable and pernicious luxury and temptation but he did voluntarily since it joined his property propose to purchase it himself and at such a sum as secured the possibility of a real payment of the debts when the other sales should have been effected  and they were carried out  it was well for dermot that as a convalescent in his mothers house he was sheltered from all counter influences such as his easy good nature might not have withstood and under that shelter it was his purpose to abide until the voyage which would take him out of reach for a time and bring him home ready for his fresh start  of course lady diana hated the notion of the voyage and though her brother advised her not to oppose it yet to the last i think she entertained hopes that it would end in harolds going alone  when harold came in and told me that dermot tracys horses english and irish were all sold and named the sum that they had realised my spirits leaped up and i was certain after such a voluntary sacrifice the dear old companion of my childhood would be a joy and exultation to us all instead of a sorrow and a grief     chapter xi  the red valley cattle stealers   in the easter recess our northchester member had his house full and among his guests was one of the most influential men of the day who though not a cabinet minister himself was known to have immense influence with government and in parliament from his great weight and character  eustace and i were invited to meet him also lady diana and her daughter and son who was called well now though far from strong when the gentlemen came out of the diningroom eustace and dermot came up to us the former much excited and saying lucy you must make preparations  they are all coming to luncheon tomorrow at arghouse  ah  yes sir james the great man himself and mr vernon and the general and all the party  i asked them all  sir james has heard of the potteries and of my system and of the reformation i have effected and there being no strikes and no nothing deleteriousundesirable i meanand the mechanics having an interest he wants to see for himselfto inspect personallythat he may name it in parliament in illustration of a scheme he is about to propose  so mr vernon will bring him over to see the hydriot works tomorrow and i have asked them to luncheon  only thinknamed in parliament dont you think now it might lead to a baronetcy tracy  or a peerage quoth naughty viola out of reach of mother or harold my lord hardbake would be a sweet title  i should revive the old honours of the family said eustace not catching the bit of wickedness  calldron of arghouse was an old barony  lord calldron of arghouse  should you object miss tracy  earthen pot or copper kettle  which laughed viola  ah theres miss vernon going to sing  i want to hear her and she jumped up  sit down dermot in my place you are not to stand  she threaded her way to the piano followed by eustace who still viewed himself as her suitor  poor little vi said dermot who by this time was aware of the courtship and regarded it with little favour  she will rub him off more easily among numbers i said as he settled down by me  but is this really so dermot  what is she to be my lady calldron  i am afraid my hopes of that elevation are not high   but as to the luncheon you will really have to slaughter your turkeys and declare war on your surviving cocks and hens  he has been inviting right and left  and tell harold from me that if he votes the thing a bore and keeps out of the way for fear of having to open his mouth hell be doing serious damage  if respect to the future baronetcy makes him get into the background tell him with my compliments the whole thing will be a muddle and ill never speak a good word for him again  then you have been speaking good words  when sir james began to inquire about the hydriots mr alison was called on to answer him and you are aware that except to certain constitutions of intellect as my uncle would say certain animals cannot open their mouths without proclaiming themselves  the most sensible thing he said was the invite to come and see  really he made such mulls with the details that even i had to set him right and that led to sir james talking it out with me when i had the opportunity of mentioning that a certain person not the smallest of mankind had been entirely overlooked  yes i did lucy  i up and told him how our friend came over as heir and when he was done out of it set to work as agent and manager and improvergeneral without a notion of jealousy or anything but being a backbone to this cousin of his and i could not say what besides to all that came in his way but i flatter myself theres one man in the room who has some notion of the difference there is between the greater and the less  harold would not thank you i said  not he  so much the more reason that you should take care he comes to the front  dermot did eustace a little injustice in fancying he wanted to suppress harold  he never did  he was far too well satisfied with his own great personality to think that anyone could interfere with it and having asked everyone in the room ladies and all to the inspection and the luncheon discoursed to me about it all the way home and would almost have made me and all the servants stay up all night to prepare harold who was still up when we came home received the tidings equably only saying he would go down to yolland the first thing in the morning and get things made tidy  and dont bother lucy he added as we went upstairs  well the supplies were contrived and the table laid without anyone being quite distracted  from richardson downwards we all had learnt to take our own way while the master talked and mrs alison was really very happy making delicate biscuits after a receipt of her own things came to a point where i was sure they would finish themselves off more happily without either of us and though one idle female more might not be desirable i thought at least i might prevent harolds effacement and went down to mycening with eustace to receive the guests  sure enough harold was not in the entrance yard nor the superintendents office  mr yolland was there looking grim and bored and on inquiry being made said that mr harold had insisted on his being on the spot but was himself helping the men to clear the space whence it would be easiest to see the action of the machinery  i made a rush after him and found him all over dust dragging a huge crate into a corner and to my entreaty he merely replied pushing back his straw hat i must see to this or we shall have everything smashed  the carriages were coming and i could only pick my way back by the shortest route through stacks of draintiles and columns of gardenpots to eustace who becoming afraid it would seem as if he were keeping shop was squeezing down the fingers of his lefthand glove while impressing on mr yolland and me that everyone must understand he was only there as chairman of the directors  the people came and were conducted round and peeped about and made all sorts of remarks wise and foolish  eustace was somewhat perplexed between the needful attentions to mrs vernon and to sir james who being much more interested in the men than the manufacture was examining mr yolland on their welfare spirit content c and george yolland might be trusted for making mr harold alison the prominent figure in his replies till at last he could say but here is mr harold alison sir james  he can reply better than i  which was not strictly true for george yolland had by far the readiest tongue  but he had managed to catch harold in the great court moving back one of his biggest barrels of heavy ingredients with face some degrees redder and garments some degrees dustier than when i had seen him ten minutes before  it really was not on purpose or from any wish to hide but the place needed clearing there was little time and his strength could not be spared  i am sorry to say that a chattering young lady who stood close to eustace exclaimed dear me what a handsome young foreman making eustace blush to the eyes and say it is my cousinhe is so very eccentricyoull excuse him  sir james meantime had heartily shaken the hand which though begrimed at the moment harold held out to him and plunged into inquiries at once not letting him go again for harold with the intuition that nothing was idly asked and that each observation told answered to the point as no man could do better or in fewer words when the round was over and eustace was prepared with the carriage to drive the grandees the mile up to arghouse sir james returned his thanks but he was going to walk up with mr harold alison who was going to show him his workmens readingroom cottages c  eustace looked about for someone to whom to resign the reins but in vain and we all had to set off my housewifely mind regretting that time and eustace had combined to make the luncheon a hot instead of a cold one  we found the tracys when we arrived at home  dermot was not equal to standing about at the pottery but lady diana had promised to come and help me entertain the party and very kindly she did so during the very trying hungry hour to which we had to submit inasmuch as when sir james at last appeared it turned out that he never ate luncheon and was in perfect ignorance that we were waiting for him  he offered me his arm and we went to the longdeferred luncheon i listened to his great satisfaction with what he had seen and the marvel he thought it and meanwhile i looked for harold and saw him presently come in in exactly that condition of dress as he considered due to me and with the long blue envelope i knew full well in one hand in the other the little figure of the hope of poland which miss woolmer had given him and oh what a gladness there was in his eyes he put them both down beside sir james and then retreated to a side table where dora had been set to entertain a stray schoolboy or two  i longed to hear sir jamess observations but his provoking opposite neighbour began to talk and i got nothing more to myself and i had to spend the next halfhour in showing our grounds to mrs vernon who admired as if she were electioneering and hindered me from knowing what anybody was about till the people had had their cups of coffee and their carriages had come  we three found ourselves in the porch together when eustace had handed in mrs vernon and sir james turning for a last shake of harolds hand said i shall expect you this day week  then with most polite thanks to the master of the house he was driven off while harold beaming down on us exclaimed it is as good as done i am to go up and see the secretary of state about it next week  i had no doubt what it was and cried out joyfully to ask how he had done it  i told him who first discovered the capabilities of the clay and laid the state of the case before him  he was very much touched said it was just such a matter as needed severity at the time but was sure to be pardoned now  pardoned  what do you mean exclaimed eustace  you dont mean that you have not done with that wretched old prometesky yet  i thought at least when you took up sir james all to yourself spoiling the luncheon and keeping everyone waiting you were doing something for the benefit of the family  as harold seemed dumb with amazement i asked what he could possibly have been expected to do for the good of the family and eustace mumbled out something about that supposed calldron barony which seemed to have turned his head and i answered sharply that sir james had nothing at all to do with reviving peerages besides if this one had ever existed it would have been harolds  i had much better have held my tongue  eustace never recovered that allegation  that day too was the very first in which it had been impossible for harold to avoid receiving marked preference and the jealousy hitherto averted by eustaces incredible vanity had begun to awaken moreover that there had been some marked rebuff from viola was also plain for as the arked carriage was seen coming round and i said we must go in to the tracys eustace muttered nasty little stuckup thing catch me making up to her again  it was just as well that harold did not hear having at sight of the carriage gone off to fetch a favourite cup the mending of which he had contrived for viola at the potteries  when we came into the drawingroom i found lady diana and mrs alison with their heads very close together over some samples of welsh wool and dermot lying on the sofa his hands clasped behind his head and his sister hanging over him with her cheeks of the colour that made her beautiful  the two elder ladies closed on eustace directly to congratulate him on the success of his arrangements and dermot jumped up from the sofa while viola caught hold of my hand and we all made for the window which opened on the terrace  tell her said viola to her brother as we stood outside  dermot smiled saying only that sir james thinks he has today seen one of the most remarkable men he ever met in his life  and he has promised to help him to prometeskys pardon i said while viola instead of speaking leaped up and kissed me for joy he is to go to london about it  yes dermot said  sir james wants him to meet some friends who will be glad to pick his brains about new south wales  hallo harry i congratulate you  youve achieved greatness  youve achieved a better thing said viola with her eyes beaming upon him  i hope so he said in an under tone  i am so glad with a whole heart in the four words  thank you he said  this was all that was wanting  the words must have come out in spite of himself for he coloured up to the roots of his hair as they ended  and viola not only coloured too but the moisture sprang into her fawnlike eyes  dermot and i looked at each other both knowing what it meant  that instant lady diana called and dermot the first of all stooped under the window to give his sister time and in the little bustle to which he amiably submitted about wraps and a glass of wine lady diana failed to look at her daughters cheeks and eyes  viola never even thanked harold for the cup which he put into her lap after she was seated beside dermots feet on the back seat of the carriage she only bent her head under her broad hat and there was a clasp of the two hands  i turned to go up to my sittingroom  harold came after me and shut the door  lucy he said may one give thanks for such things  the words of the 107th psalm came to my lips oh that men would therefore praise the lord for his goodness and declare the wonders that he doeth for the children of men  he put his hands over his face and said presently in a smothered voice i had just begun to pray for the old man  i could not say any more for happy tears less for the captive exile than for my own harry  soon he looked up again and said with a smile i shant fight against it any longer  i dont think it is of any use was my answer as if pretending to condole and where another man would have uttered a fervent rhapsody he exclaimed lovely little darling  but after another interval he said i dont mean to speak of it till i come back  and on my question from london  no from boola boola  he had evidently debated the whole matter during his midnight tramps and had made up his mind as he explained that it would be cruel to viola to touch the chord which would disclose her feelings to herself she was a mere child and if her fancy were touched as he scarcely allowed himself to believe it was hard to lay fully before her those dark pages in his history which she must know before she could be allowed to give herself to him  besides her mother and uncle would even if there were nothing else amiss be sure to oppose a match with one who had nothing in england but his cousins agency and a few shares in the potteries and though harold had plenty of wealth at boola boola it was certain that he should not have a moments audience from the elders unless he could show its amount in property in england  if things went well he would buy a piece of neme heath reclaim it and build a house on it or perhaps an estate in ireland near killy marey where the people had gained his heart  till however he could show that he had handsome means in a form tangible to lady diana to express his affection would only be exposing viola to displeasure and persecution  moreover he added his character was not cleared up as much as was even possible  he had told lord erymanth the entire truth and had been believed but it was quite probable that even that truth might divide for ever between him and viola and those other stories of the stympsons both cousins had of course flatly denied but had never been able otherwise to confute  i asked whether it had ever struck him that it was possible that the deeds of henry alison might have been charged on his head  yes he said and he thought that if he could trace this out with dermot as a witness the authorities might be satisfied so far as to take him for what he was instead of for what he had never been  but the perception of the storm of opposition which speaking at present would provoke made me allow that he was as wise as generous in sparing viola till his return since i knew her too well to fear that her heart would be given away in the meantime  still i did hint might not she feel your going away without saying anything  not at all likely said harold  besides she would probably be a happier woman if she forgot all about me  in which of course there was no agreeing but he had made up his mind and it was plain it was the nobler partnay the only honest part since it was plainly of no use to speak openly  i wondered a little that his love was so selfrestrained  it was an intense glow but not an outbreak but i think that having gone through all the whirlwind of tempestuous passion for a mere animal like poor meg made him the more delicately reverent and considerate for the real love of the higher nature which had now developed in him  he said himself that the allowing himself to hope and ceasing to crush his feelings was so great a change as to be happiness enough for him and i guarded carefully against being forced into any promise of silence being quite determined that if i saw viola unhappy or fancying herself forgotten i would whether it could be called wise or foolish give her a hint of the true state of things  nothing was to be said to eustace  he would have the field to himself and it was better that he should convince himself and lady diana that there was no hope for him  harold thought he could safely be commended to george yolland and me for his affairs and his home life and to our surprise he did not seem half so reluctant to part with his cousin as we had expected  he had gone his own way a good deal more this winter and spring as harold seldom had time to hunt and did not often drive out and he had grown much more independent his share of boola boola was likewise to be sold for neither cousin felt any desire to keep up the connection with the country where they had never had a happy home and he gave harold full authority to transact the sale  perhaps we all had shared more or less in doras expectation that harold would come home from london with prometeskys pardon in his pocket though i laughed at her and eustace was furious when we found she thought he was to kneel before the queen present his petition and not only receive the pardon but rise up sir harold alison  it did fall flat when he came back having had very satisfactory interviews but only with the secretaries of state and having been assured that prometesky would be certainly pardoned but that as a matter of form some certificates of conduct and recommendations must be obtained from new south wales before the pardon could be issued  this precipitated harolds departure  dermot was just well enough to be likely to be the better for a voyage and the first week in may was fixed for their setting forth  a great box appeared in my sittingroom where harold began to stow all manner of presents of various descriptions for friends and their children but chiefly for the shepherds families at boola boola and in the midst mrs alison poor thing brought a whole box of beautifullyknitted worsted stockings which she implored harold to carry to her dear henry and he actually let her pack them up and promised that if he ever found henry they should be given  and this little bible said the good old lady maybe he has lost his own  tell him it is his poor papas and i know he will bring it back to me  he shall if i can make him said harold  and harold my dear said mrs alison with her hand on his shoulder as he knelt by his box youll go to see your own poor mamma  harold started and winced  my mother is in new zealand he said  yes my dear said the old lady triumphantly but thats only the other side of the way for i looked in lucys map  and she has a husband added harold between his teeth ignoring what the other side of the way might mean  yes my dear i know he is not a nice man but you are her only one arent you  yes  and i know what that isnot that i ever married anyone but your poor uncle nor ever would not if the new rector had asked me which many expected and even paid their compliments to me on but i always said no no  but youll go and see her my dear and comfort her poor heart which you may depend is longing and craving after you my dear and all the more if her new gentleman isnt quite as he should be  harold could not persuade himself to bring out any answer but ill see about it and when we were alone he said with a sigh if i should be any comfort to her poor heart  i should think there was no doubt of that  i am afraid of committing murder answered harold almost under his breath over the trunk  oh harold  not now  i dont know he said  you have not seen him for ten years  he may be altered as much as you  and for the worse  i could almost say i dare not  theres nothing you dont dare god helping you i said  i shall think  if it is my duty i suppose god will help me hitherto i have thought my rage against the brutes made it worse for her and that i do best for her by keeping out of the way  i think they would respect you now too much to do anything very bad before you  she would fare the worse for it afterwards  i am of mrs alisons opinion that she would be willing for the sake of seeing her son and such a son  harold sighed  but it could not have been so dreadful when eustace lived with them and was so fond of the man  he nattered eustace to curry favour with him and his father  he has sunk much lower  then he lived like a decent clergyman  he has thrown all that off in new zealand and fallen entirely under the dominion of that son  i could wish i had quite throttled that dick when i so nearly did so at school  if you say such things i shall think you ought not to trust yourself there  that is iti am afraid  i have crimes enough already  it was too great a responsibility to persuade him to put himself into temptation even now that he knew what prayer was  i longed to have seen him come yet nearer and taken the means of strengthening and refreshing  but he said i cannot i have not time to make fit preparation  and when i pleaded that i could not bear to think of his encountering danger without fulfilling that to which the promise of everlasting life is attached i struck the wrong key  what he was not ready to do for love he would not do for fear or hurry preparation beyond what his conscience approved that he might have what i was representing as the passport of salvation  whether he were right or wrong i know not even now but it was probably through the error of the very insufficient adviser the poor fellow had chosen in me  it may seem strange but i had never thought of his irreligion as an obstacle with viola for first i knew him to be a sincere learner as far as he went and next her sisters husband had none of the goodness that lady dianas professions would have led one to expect in her chosen soninlaw  we all met and parted at the railwaystation whither viola came with her brother  dora had been only allowed to come upon solemn promises of quietness and at the last our attention was more taken up with her than anyone else for she was very white and shook from head to foot with the effort at selfrestraint not speaking a word but clinging to harold with a tight grip of his hand and when that was not attainable of his coat  fortunately the train was punctual and the ordeal did not last long  harold put in all his goods and dermots and finally he lifted the poor child up in his arms held her close and then as her hands locked convulsively round his neck eustace unclasped them and harold put her down on my lap as i sat down on the bench left a kiss on my brow wrung eustaces hand pressed violas saying ill take care of your brother and then with one final impulse carried the hand to his lips and kissed it before springing into the carriage which was already in motion poor dora was actually faint and never having experienced the feeling before was frightened and gasped out hasnt it killed me lucy  the laugh that was unavoidable did us all good and i sent eustace for some restorative from the refreshmentroom  the child had to be carried to the carriage and was thoroughly out of order for several days  poor little girl we neither of us knew that it was the beginning of her darker days  of harolds doings in australia i can tell less than of those at home he kept his promise dear fellow and wrote regularly  but alas his letters are all gone and i can only speak from memory of them and from what dermot told me  making no stay in sydney they pushed on to boola boola avoiding a halt at crees station but making at once for prometeskys cottage a wonderful hermitage as dermot described it almost entirely the work of the old mans ingenious hands  there he lived like a philosopher of old with the most sternly plain and scanty materials for comforta mat a table and a chair but surrounded by beautiful artistic figures and intricate mathematical diagrams traced on his floor and wall reams of essays and poems where he had tried to work out his thought fragments of machines the toys of his constructive brain among which the travellers found him sitting like a masculine version of albert durers melancholia his laughing jackass adding tones of mockery to the scene perched on the bough looking down as his master below took to pieces some squatters crazy clock  when harolds greeting had aroused him dermot said nothing could be more touching than the meeting with prometesky who looked at him as a father might look at a newlyrecovered son and seemed to lose the joy of the prospect of his own freedom in the pride and exultation of his own boy his ambroses son having achieved it  the beauty of the place enchanted dermot and his first ride round the property made him marvel how man could find it in his heart to give up this free open life of enterprise for the tameness of an old civilised country  but harold smiled and said he had found better things in england  harold found that there were serious losses in the numbers of the sheep of the common stock and that all the neighbouring settlers were making the like complaint  bushranging properly so called had been extinguished by the goldfind in victoria but as my brothers had located themselves as far as possible from inhabited districts boola boola was still on the extreme border of civilisation and there was a long wide mountain valley called the red valley beyond it with long gulleys and ravines branching up in endless ramifications where a gang of runaway shepherds and unsuccessful gold diggers were known to haunt and were almost certainly the robbers  the settlers and mounted police had made some attempts at tracking them out but had always become bewildered in the intricacies of the ravines and the losing ones way in those eucalyptus forests was too awful a danger to be encountered  a fresh raid had taken place the very night before harold arrived at boola boola upon a flock pasturing some way off  the shepherds were badly beaten and then bailed up and a couple of hundred sheep were driven off  now harold had as a lad explored all the recesses of these ravines and was determined to put an end to the gang and when it became known that harold alison was at home and would act as guide a fully sufficient party of squatters shepherds and police rallied for the attack and dermot in great delight found himself about to see a fight in good earnest  a very sufficient guide harold proved himself and they came not to any poetical robbers cavern but within sight of a set of shanties looking like any ordinary station of a low character  there a sudden volley of shot from an ambush poured upon them happily without any serious wounds and a handtohand battle began for the robbers having thus taken the initiative it was hardly needful to display the search warrant with which the party had come armed  and to the amazement of all the gang was headed by a man who seemed the very counterpart of harold not perhaps quite so tall but with much the same complexion and outline though he was somewhat older and had the wild fierce ruffianly aspect of a bushranger  this man was taking deliberate aim at the magistrate who acted as head of the party when harold flung down his own loaded rifle sprang upon him and there was the most tremendous wrestling match that dermot said he could have imagined three times harolds antagonist touched the earth three times he sprang from it again with redoubled vigour until at last harold clasped his arms round him lifted him in the air and dashed him to the ground where he lay senseless  and then to the general amusement harold seemed astonished at his state as he lay prone observing i did not want to hurt him and presently told dermot i believe he is old mrs sam alisons son  and so it proved  he was the henry or harry alison of whose deeds the stympsons had heard  the gang was after all not very extensive two had been shot in the fray one was wounded and one surrendered alison though not dead was perfectly helpless and was carried down the rocky valley on an extemporary litter harold taking his usual share of the labour  the sheep and cattle on whom were recognised the marks of the alisons of boola boola and of sundry of their neighbours were collected to be driven down and reclaimed by their owners and the victory was complete     chapter xii  the golden fruit   while all this was passing on the other side the world eustace fulfilled his wish for a season in london was presented by lord erymanth went to a court ball showed his horses in the park lived at a club and went to ascot and epsom  he fulfilled harolds boast that he might be trusted not to get into mischief for he really had no taste for vice and when left to himself had the suspicious dislike to spending money which is so often found where the intellect is below the average  vanity and selfconsequence were the poor fellows leading foibles and he did not find that they were gratified when among his equals and superiors in station  sensible men could not make him a companion and the more dangerous stamp of men when they could not fleece him turned him into ridicule so that he came home discontented  it was not for my sympathy or company that he came home  he should have had it for i had grown really fond of him and was he not a charge left me by harold  but he did not want me more than as lady of the house when he gave a dinnerparty and after his experiences of club dinners his requirements had become so distracting as to drive our old servants away and me nearly crazy  also he was constantly in a state of discontent with mr yolland about the management of the estate always grumbling about expenses and expecting unreasonable returns and interfering with the improvements harold had set in hand till mr yolland used to come and seek private interviews with me to try to get me to instil the explanations in which he had failed  once or twice i made peace but things grew worse and worse  i heard nothing but petulant abuse of george yolland on one side and on the other i knew he would have thrown up the agency except for harold  when at michaelmas eustace informed him that the estate should no longer go on without a regular responsible agent and that one was engaged who had been recommended by mr horsman i do not know whether he was most hurt or relieved though i could hardly forgive the slight to his cousin far less the reply when i urged the impropriety harold cant expect to domineer over everything he has put me to expense enough already with his fancies  in truth eustace had been resorting all this time to the companionship of the horsmans  hunting during the previous winter had thrown him with them more than we knew and when he found me far more of a champion for harolds rights than he wished and i fear too much less tolerant of his folly and petulance than when his cousin was present to make the best of them by his loyal love he deserted home more and more for therford hall  dora and i were hardly sorry for he was very cross to her and had almost forgotten his deference to me but i certainly was not prepared for the announcement of his engagement to hippolyta horsman  from sheepishness and want of savoir faire he had not even properly withdrawn his suit from viola tracy thus making lady diana and lord erymanth very angry though the damsel herself was delighted  i had ventured to give one little hint of how the land lay with harold and she had glowed with a look of intense gladness as of being confirmed in a happy belief  i dont even now think it was wrong  it might have been imprudent but it made that year of her life full of a calm bright hope and joy that neither she nor i can ever regret  as far as could be guessed hippolytas first and strongest attraction had been towards harold but when it had been met by distaste and disregard she had turned her attention to the squire who could be easily gained by judicious flattery  in those days i could see no excuse for hippolyta and ascribed no motives to her but fortunehunting and despair at being a spinster so long but i have since learnt to think that she had a genuine wish to be in a position of usefulness rather than to continue her aimless life of rattle and excitement and that she had that impulse to take care of eustace and protect him which strongminded women sometimes seem to feel for weak men  the courtship was conducted at archery meetings and afterwards at shooting parties out of my sight and suspicion though the whole neighbourhood was talking of it and miss avice stympson had come to arghouse to inquire about it and impart her great disapproval of hippo long before it was officially announced to me and eustace at the same time kindly invited mrs alison and me to remain where i was till after the wedding  i understood that this had been dictated to him and was an intimation which i scarcely needed that arghouse would be our home no longer  just as i was thinking what proposal to make to mrs alison came harolds letters about his unfortunate australian double  his first letter to the poor old lady merely told her that he had found her son and that he was at sydney laid up by a bad accident received in a fray with the police  his back was hurt but there was no cause to fear danger  he sent his love and harold would write again  viola sent me dermots letter with full particulars but i kept silence through all the mothers agitations of joy and grief  the next mail brought me full details of the skirmish and of what harold had learnt of henry alisons course  it had been a succession of falls lower and lower as with each failure habits of drunkenness and dissipation fastened on him and peculation and dishonesty on that congenial soil grew into ruffianism   expelled from the gold diggings for some act too mean even for that atmosphere he had become the leader of a gang of runaway shepherds in the recesses of the red valley and spread increasing terror there until the attack on him in his stronghold when harolds cousinly embrace really intended to spare his life as well as that of the magistrate had absolutely injured his spine probably for life  he had with great difficulty been carried to sydney and there placed in the hospital instead of the jail since disabled as he was no one wished to prosecute the poor wretch and identification was always a difficulty  harold had been taking daily care of him and had found him in his weak and broken state ready to soften nay to shed tears at the thought of his mother evincing feelings that might be of little service if he had recovered but if he were crippled for life might be the beginning of better things  harold had given him the bible and the stockings and had left him alone with them  the bible was as yet left untouched as if he were afraid of it but he had ever since been turning over and fondling the stockings as though all the love that the poor mother had been knitting into them for years and years apparently in vain were exhaling like the heat and colours stored by the sun in ages past in our coals  harold was wondering over the question whether a man in his state could or ought to be brought to england or whether it could be possible to send his mother out to him when the problem was solved by his falling in with a gentleman whose wife was a confirmed invalid and who was ready to give almost any salary to a motherly ladylike woman beyond danger of marrying who would take care of her and attend to the household  he would even endure the son and lodge him in one of the dependencies of his house which had large grounds looking into beautiful sydney bay provided he could secure such a person  even an escort had been arranged as a brother of the gentleman was in england and about to return with his wife to australia so that i was at once to communicate with them pack her up and consign her to them to mrs alison herself harold wrote with the offer of the situation and a representation of her sons need and longing for her telling her the poor fellows affectionate messages and promising himself to meet her at sydney on her arrival  he must needs await the arrival of prometeskys pardon in answer to the recommendations that had gone by this very mail and which he had had no difficulty in obtaining  the squatters round boola boola would have done anything for the man who had delivered them from the red valley gang and besides there was no one who had been long enough in the country to remember anything adverse to the old hermit mechanist and most of them could hardly believe that he had not come out at his own expense  and at sydney as a visitor highly spoken of by letters from the colonial secretary and in company with an english gentleman connected as was mr tracy harold found himself in a very different sphere from that of the wild young sheepfarmer coming down half for business half for roistering diversion  he emulated eustaces grandeur by appearances at government house and might have made friends with many of the superior families if after putting things in train for the sale of boola boola he had not resolved on spending his waiting time on a journey to new zealand to see his mother  he trusted himself the more from having visited the crees and having found he could keep his temper when they sneered at him as a swell and a teetotallernay even wounded him more deeply by the old mans rejection of his offers of assistance as if he had wanted to buy the family off from denouncing him as having been the death of their daughter  often harold must have felt it well for him that dermot tracy knew the worst beforehandnay that what he learnt in new south wales was mild compared with the stympson version  dermot himself wrote to his uncle the full account of what he had learnt from cree and from prometesky of harolds real errors and what henry alison had confessed of those attributed to him feeling that this was the best mode of clearing the way for those hopes which harold had not concealed from him  dermot was thoroughly happy enchanted with the new world more enthusiastic about his hero than ever and eager to see as much as possible but they renewed their promise to be in sydney in time to greet poor old mrs alison  dear old body what a state she was in between joy and grief love and terror heart and brain  she never wavered in her maternal eagerness to go to poor little henry but what did she not imagine as to botany bay  she began sewing up sovereigns in chamoisleather bags to be dispersed all over her person against the time when she should have to live among the burglars and dora who was desperately offended failed to convince her that she might as well expect robbers at home however the preparations were complete at last and i took her myself to the good people who were to have the charge of her  i had no fears in sending her off since harold was sure to arrange for her maintenance and comfort in case of her situation not being a success and though i had learnt to love her and lost in her my chaperon i was glad to be so far unencumbered and to be freed from the fear that eustace and hippolyta might do something harshly inconsiderate by her in their selfish blindness to all save themselves  hippolytas fortune was in a complicated state which made her settlements long in being made out and as eustace did not wish to turn me out till the wedding i had time to wait to ascertain what harold would like me to do  i hoped that dora was so inconvenient an appendage that i should be allowed to keep her but i found that hippolyta had designs on hersaying truly enough that she could neither write nor spell and knew not a word of any language  poor lucy alison what could be expected of her  so dora was to go to the married cousins in london who by thus taking her in would be enabled to have a superior governess for their own tribe  poor dora how fiercely she showed her love for me all those weeks of reprieve and how hard i laboured to impress upon her that her intended system of defiance to the whole horsman family was not by any means such a proof of affection as either harry or i should relish  more letters from our travellers from new zealand turned our attention from our own troubles  they had reached dunedin and there found harolds letter to announce his coming waiting at the postoffice the smith family had left the place and mr smith only came or sent from time to time when harolds regular letters containing remittances were due  by inquiry they were traced to the goldfields and thither harold and dermot repaired through curious experiences and recognitions of old army and london friends of dermots now diggers or mounted police  save for one of these gentlemen much better educated than harold but now far rougher looking they would never have found the house where parson smith a title that most supposed to be entirely unfounded made a greater profit by selling the necessaries of life to the diggers than did his son by golddigging and washing  poor alice the stately farmhouse beauty of thirty years ago was a stooping haggard brokendown wrecknot a slattern but an overworked drudge with a face fitter for seventy than for fifty years old and a ghastly look of longcontinued sickness  her husband was out and she sat propped up in a chair behind the board that served for a counter still attending to the shop and thus it was that her son beheld her when he stooped under the low doorway with the one word mother  dermot had waited outside but harold called him in the next moment he will mind the shop mother  ill carry you to your bed  you are not fit to be here a moment  and dermot found himself selling tobacco tin cups and knives to very roughlooking customers some of whom spoke in as refined a voice as he could do and only asked what green chum the parson could have picked up instead of the sickly missus  alice smith was indeed far gone in illness the effect of exposure drudgery and hard usage  perhaps her husband might have had mercy on her but they were both cowed by the pitiless brute of a stepson whose only view was to goad her into driving their profitable traffic to her last gasp  but there was no outbreak between them and harold the fathers nature was to cringe and fawn and the son estimated those thews and muscles too well to gratify his hatred by open provocation and was only surly and dogged keeping himself almost entirely out of the way  alice wanted nothing but to look at her sonher beautiful boy her harry come back to her at last and kind and tender to her and loving as he had never been since his baby days but he would have moved heaven and earth to obtain comforts and attendance for her dermot rode a fabulous distance and brought back a doctor for a fabulous fee and loaded his horse with pillows and medicaments but the doctor could only declare that she had a fatal disease of long standing and must die though care and comfort might a little while prolong her life  it was welcome news to poor alice provided she might only die while her boy was still with her shutting out all that had so long made her life one grounddown course of hopeless wretchedness  smiths most profitable form of employment was carrying dinners out to the men at work and for an hour or two at noon the little store was entirely free from customers  the day after the doctors visit dermot came in at this time to speak to harold and as soon as alice knew of his presence there was a mere partition of slab between her bed and the shop she eagerly and nervously bade him stay and keep watch that no one should come near to see or hear  then when certain that she was alone with her son she produced from hidingplaces about her person what appeared to be three balls of worstedher eyes gleaming and her whole person starting at every sound  she laid her skeleton fingers over them with a start of terror as harold puzzled at first would have unwound one but made him weigh them parted the covering with her nail and showed for one instant a yellow gleam  each held a nugget of unusual size  her urgency and her terror were excessive till they were out of sight in his pockets though he protested that this was but to satisfy her for the moment he could not keep them  she laid her head so close to his that she could whisper and told him they were not meant for him  they were payment for the l200 of which her husband had defrauded the elder eustace and which had been a heavy weight ever since on her highspirited pride  by one of the strange chances that often befell in the early days of the goldfields she going to draw water at a little stream soon after her first arrival had seen these lying close together in the bed of the shallow rivuletthree lumps of gold formed by a freak of nature into the likeness of the golden pippins her father used to be so proud of and the gathering of which had been the crisis of the courtship of the two handsome lads from arghouse  with the secretiveness that tyranny had taught her alice hid her treasure and with the inborn honest pride which had under smiths dominion cost her so much suffering she swore to herself that they should go to eustace to wipe out the fraud against his father  she had sought opportunities ever since and believed that she should have to send for some man in authority when she was dying and no one could gainsay her and commit them to him little guessing that it was in her own sons hands that she should place them  as little did she reckon on what harold chose to do  he said that for him to conceal them and take them away without her husbands knowledge would be mere robbery but that he would show them to smith and sign a receipt for them for eustace alison in payment of the sum of l200 due from james smith to his father  mr tracy and his friend the policeman should be witnesses and the nuggets themselves should be placed in charge of the police when their weight and value would be ascertained and any overplus returned to smith  the poor woman trembled exceedinglydermot heard the rustling as he stood outside and he also heard harolds voice soothing her and assuring her that she should not be left to the revenge of young dick smith no she feared not that she was past the dread of dick for herself but not for harold  he laughed and said that they durst not touch him  for his mothers relief and for dermots safety he however waited to say anything till the assistance of the gentleman of the police force had been secured so that there might be no delay to allow dick smith to gather his fellows for revenge or recovery of the gold  and with these precautions all went well  harold in the grave authoritative way that had grown on him reminded mr smith of a heavy debt due to his uncle and when the wretched man began half to deny and half to entreat in the same breath harold said that he had received from his mother a deposit in payment thereof and that he had prepared a receipt which he requested mr smith to see him sign in presence of the two witnesses now waiting  smiths resentment and disappointment at the sight of the treasure his wife had hidden from him were unspeakable  he was not an outwardly passionate man and he was in mortal fear not only of the giant who seemed to fill up all his little room but also of anything that could compromise him with the police  so he suppressed his passion aware that resistance would bring out stories that could not bear the light harold signed and the golden apples were carried away to the office where mr smith was invited to come the next day and see them weighed  that night harold kept watch over his mother and dermot who was thought to be at his friends shanty kept watch near the door but dick smith hating harolds presence had gone on an excursion lasting some days and before his father went in quest of him in the morning harold had a proposal readynamely to continue to pay smith what he already allowed his mother with an addition provided he were allowed to take her with him to dunedin and if possible home  smith haggled lamented and pretended to hesitate but accepted the terms at last and then showed considerable haste in setting the party off on their journey before his son should come home fearing perhaps some deadly deed if dick should discover what a prey the poor woman had concealed from him while she was within his reach and as the worth of the apples was estimated at about twenty pounds beyond the debt harold paid this to him at once and they left him in the meek plausible tearful stage of intoxication piteously taking leave of his wife as if she were the very darling of his heart and making fine speeches about his resolution to consign her to her son for the sake of her health so contemptible had the poor creature become that harold found it easier to pity than to hate him  besides harold had little thought then to spare from the eager filial and maternal affection that had been in abeyance all the years since poor alices unhappy marriage  for a little while the mother and son were all in all to each other  the muchenduring woman used to neglected physical suffering bore the journey apparently well when watched over and guarded with a tender kindness recalling that of the husband of her youth and harold wrote to me from dunedin full of hope and gladness aware that his mother could never be well again but trusting that we might yet give her such peace and rest as she had never yet tasted  again came bitter vexation in eustaces way of receiving the intelligence  i hope he does not mean to bring her here  it would be so extremely inconvenientnot a widow even  it would just confirm all the scandals i have surmounted  i thought she had been almost as much a mother to you as your own  oh that was when i was at school and they were paid for it besides what a deceitful fellow smith was and how he defrauded me  and how she has restored it  i hope harold will not go and get those nuggets changed into specie they would make splendid ornamentsso distingue with such a story attached to them  i could only again tell myself that my first impression had been right and that he must be underwitted to be so absolutely impervious to gratitude  how harold must have bolstered him up to make him so tolerable as he had been  he need not have feared  alices improvement was but a last flash of the expiring flame  she grew worse the very day after harold wrote to me and did not live three weeks after he brought her into the town though surrounded by such cares as she had never known before she died they said more from being worn out than from the disease she had done nothing her whole lifetime but toil for others and if unselfishness and silent slavery can be religion in a woman poor alice had it  but  harold once asked her the saddest question that perhaps a son could ask mother why did you never teach me to say my prayers  she stared at him with her great sunken uncomplaining eyes and said i hadnt time and as he gave some involuntary groan she said you see we never got religion not dorothy and me while we were girls and when our troubles came im sure wed no time for such things as that when your father lay adying he did say alice take care the boy gets to know his god better than we have done but you were a great big boy by that time and i thought i would take care you was taught by marrying a parson and a schoolmaster but there i ought to have remembered there was none so hard on us as the parsons  nor would she see a clergyman  she had had enough of that sort she said with the only petulance she ever showed to harold when he pressed it  she did not object to his reading to her some of those passages in the bible and prayerbook which had become most dear to him but she seemed rather to view it as one of the wonderful performances of her boya part of his having become as good an english gentleman as ever his poor father was and able to hold up his head with any of them she was too ill to be argued with she said she trusted in god whatever she meant by that and so she died holding harolds hand as long as her fingers could clasp and gazing at him as long as her eyes could see  he wrote to me all out of his overflowing heart as he could never have spoken by word of mouth on his voyage between new zealand and australia and on his arrival there finding our letters just before the mail went out he added the characteristic line to the one he had written to eustace all right old chap i wish you joy and to me he wrote that since i asked what he wished he thought i had better take a house by the year in or near mycening and see how things would turn out  he hoped i should keep dora  we need not write again for he should leave sydney before our letters could arrive  i found a little house called mount eaton on the neme heath side of mycening with a green field between it and the town and the heath stretching out beyond where harold might rush out and shake his mane instead of feeling cribbed and confined  it wanted a great deal of painting and papering which i set in hand at once but of course it was a more lingering business than i expected  all the furniture and books that had belonged to my own mother had been left to me and it had been settled by the valuation when i knew little about it what these were and all that remained was to face eustaces disgust at finding how many of the best things it comprised  hippolyta showed to advantage there  i believe she was rather glad to get rid of them and to have the opportunity of getting newer and more fashionable ones but at any rate she did it with a good grace and made me welcome not only to my own property but to remain at arghouse till my new abode should be habitable which i hoped would be a day or two after the wedding  the great grievance was however that i had put myself and dora into mourning feeling it very sad that this last of the four exiles should be the only one of whose death i even knew  eustace thought the whole connection ought to be forgotten and that whatever i might choose to do it was intolerable that his sister the present miss alison of arghouse should put on mourning for the wife of a disgraced fellow a runaway parson turned sharper  i am afraid i was not as patient or tolerant as i ought to have been and it ended in the time of reprieve being put an end to and dora being carried off by the horsmans to her new schoolroom in london her resistance and the hometruths she told her brother only making him the more inexorable  poor little girl  i do not like to think of the day i put her into hippolytas hands     chapter xiii  the bloodhound   it was a broiling evening in early june very beautiful but so hot that i dreaded the fatigue and all the adjuncts of the morrows wedding when i was to be a bridesmaid and should see my poor little dora again  i was alone for eustace was sleeping at therford vicarage but i had not time for sentiment over the old home and old gardens  i was turning out the old indian cabinets which were none of mine though they had always been called so and putting into cotton wool and paper all my treasures there ready for transport when a shadow fell on me from the open window  i looked up and there stood harold  oh how unlike it was from the way in which we had met three years before as bewildered strangers  i do not think that sister could ever have met brother with more entire feeling that home and trust and staff and stay were come back to her than when i found harolds arm round me his head bending down to me  i was off my own mind  when our greeting was over harold turned and said here he is  i saw a finelooking old man with a certain majesty of air that one could not define  he was pale wrinkled and had deep furrows of suffering on cheek and brow but his dark eyes under a shaggy white penthouse were full of keen fire and even ardour  his bald forehead was very fine and his mouthfully visible for he was closely shavenhad an ineffable melancholy sweetness about it so that the wonderful power of leading all with whom he came in contact was no longer a mystery to me for fierce patriot and desperate republican as he might have been nothing could destroy the inborn noble and instinctively i bent to him with respect as i took his hand in welcome  after the hasty inquiries wheres dora  wheres eustace wheres dermot tracy had been answered and i had learnt that this last had gone on to london where his family were harold hurried out to see about sending for the luggage and prometesky turning to me almost took my breath away by saying madam i revere you  you have done for the youth so dear to me what i could never have done and have transformed him from a noble savage to that far higher beingthe christian hero  i did not take this magnificent compliment as if i had been of the courtly continental blood of him who made it it made me hot and sheepish yet even now i still feel warm at the heart when i remember it for i know he really meant it little as i deserved it for the truth was what i faltered out it was all in him  it was all in him  that is true but it needed to be evoked so as not to be any longer stifled and perverted by the vehemence of his physical nature  when he left me after the great catastrophe which changed him from the mere exaggerated child gratifying every passion with violence i knew it depended on what hands he would fall into whether the spiritual or the animal would have the mastery  madam it was into your hands that he fell and i thank god for it even more than for the deliverance that my dear pupil has gained for me  he had tears in his eyes as he took my hand and kissed it and very much overpowered i was  i had somewhat dreaded finding him a freethinker but there was something in both speeches that consoled me and he afterwards said to me madam in our youth intellectual catholics are apt to reject what our reason will not accept  we love not authority  in age we gain sympathy with authority and experience has taught us that there can be a wisdom surpassing our own  we have proved for ourselves that love cannot live without faith  and harold told me on the evening of their return with much concern that the old man had made up his mind that so soon as his health should be sufficiently restored he would make retreat among the monks of la trappe experimentally and should probably take the vows i dont see that his pardon has done much good he said and did not greatly accept my representation of the marvellous difference it must make to a roman catholic to be no longer isolated from the offices of religion  he had made up his mind to come into sydney to die but he was too poor to have lived anywhere but under the boola boola rock  it was a very quietly glad evening as we three sat round the open window and asked and answered questions  harold said he would come to the wedding with me the next day he must see old eu married and besides he wanted to give up to him the three nuggets which had been rather a serious charge  harold prometesky and dermot had each carried one in case of any disaster that there might be three chances but now they were all three laid in my lapwonderful things one a little larger than the others but all curiously applelike in form such gifts as a bride has seldom had  there was the account of the sale of boola boola to be rendered up too and the place had risen so much in value that it had brought in far more than harold had expected when leaving england so that he and eustace were much richer men than he had reckoned on being  mrs sam alison had arrived safely but rather surprised not to find people walking on their heads as she had been told everything was upside down  her son had so far recovered that he could undertake such employment in writing as it was possible to procure  the mother and son were very happy together but harold winced as if a sore were touched when he spoke of their meeting  i was anxious that he should hear of nothing to vex him that night for there was more than enough to annoy him another day and i talked on eagerly about the arrangements for the wedding  hippolyta had insisted on making it a mingled archery and huntwedding  she was to wear the famous belt  the bridegroom her brothers and most of the gentlemen were to be in their pink we bridesmaids had scarlet ribbons and the favours had miniature fox brushes fastened with arrows in the centre even our lockets with their elaborate cypher of es as and hs depended from the head of a fox  prometesky looked amazed as well he might  your ladies are changed he said  it would formerly scarcely have been thought feminine to show such ardour for the chase  perhaps it is not now i said  or is it in honour of the ladys name  hippolyta should have a midsummer wedding and love the musick of her hounds continued the old gentleman whom i found to have shakespeare almost by heart as one of the chief companions of his solitude  as soon as harold heard his boxes arriving he went to work to disinter the wedding present he had provideda pretty bracelet of new zealand green jade set in gold  there was a little parcel for me too which he gave me leading me aside  it was also a locket and bore a cypher but how unlike the other  it was a simple a and within was a lock of silver hair  there was no need to tell me whose it was  she said she wished she had anything to send you were harolds words and i cut off this bit of her hair and when i wondered over her having taken thought of me he said she blessed you for your kindness to me  if i could only have brought her to you  i secured then as the completion of his gift one of his thick curls of yellowbrown hair   he showed me the chain he had brought for dora and gave me one glance at a clear pure crystal cross from spar found in new zealand near the goldfields  would he ever be able to give it  i answered the question in his eyes by telling him a certain etruscan flowerpot had stood in a certain window at arked house all the winter and was gone to london now  our home breakfast had to be very early to give time for the drive to therford but harold had been already into mycening had exchanged countless hearty greetings roused up an unfortunate haircutter to trim his locks bought a hat and with considerable difficulty found a pair of gloves that he could put onnot kid but thick ridinggloves white at leastand so he hoped that they would pass in the crowd and eustace would not feel himself disgraced  he had not put on the red coat but had tried to make himself look as satisfactory to eustace as possible in black and from a rather comical sense of duty he made me look him over to see if he were worthy of the occasion  he certainly was in splendid looks his rich profuse beard and hair were well arranged and his fine bronzed face had not lost its grave expression when at rest but had acquired a certain loftiness of countenance which gave him more than ever the air i was going to say of a demigod but he had now an expression no heathen greek could give it was more like that of the heads by michael angelo where christian yearning is added to classic might and beauty  prometesky preferred staying at home  he seemed suffering and weary and said that perhaps he should wander about and renew his acquaintance with the country and so harold and i set off together on the drive which as i well knew would be the most agreeable part of the day  very lovely it was as we passed in the morning freshness of the glowing summer day through lanes wreathed with dogroses and white with may looking over grassfields with silvery ripples in the breeze into woods all golden and olivegreen above with young foliage and pink below with campion flowers while the moorland beyond was in its glory of gorse near at hand and purple hills closing the distance  i remember the drive especially because harold looked at the wealth of gay colouring so lovingly comparing it with the frequently parched uniformity of the bush regretting somewhat the limited range but owning there were better things than unbounded liberty  when we reached therford he would not go to the house with me nor seek to see eustace before the wedding saying he should wait in the churchyard and join us afterwards  so in i went into the scene of waiting interspersed with bustle that always precedes a wedding and was handed into the bedroom where the bridesmaids were secluded till the bride was ready all save pippa and the most favoured cousin who were arraying her  there were a dozen and all were horsmans except dora and me  the child made one great leap at me and squeezed me to such detriment of our flimsy draperies that she was instantly called to order  her lip pouted and her brow lowered but i whispered two words in her ear and with a glance in her eye and an intent look on her face she stood a being strangely changed from the listless sullen defiant creature she had been a minute before  therford was one of those old places where the church is as near as possible to the manor house standing on a little elevation above it and with a long avenue of lombardy poplars leading from the south porch the family entrance to the front door of the house so this was that pretty thing a walking instead of a carriage wedding  as one of the procession i could not see but the red and white must have made it very pretty and the northchester paper was quite poetical in its raptures  all this was however forgotten in the terrible adventure that immediately followed  the general entrance was by the west door and close to this i perceived harold following his usual practice of getting into the rear and looking over peoples heads  when the service was over and we waited for the signing of the registers most of the spectators and he among them went out by this western door and waited in the churchyard to see the procession come out  forth it came headed by the bride and bridegroom both looking their very handsomest and we bridesmaids in six couples behind when just as we were clear of the porch and schoolchildren were strewing flowers before the pair there was a strange shuddering cry and the great bloodhound kirby with broken chain and foaming jawsall the dreadful tokens of madness about himcame rushing up the avenue with the speed of the wind making full for his mistress the bride there was not a moment for her to do more than give a sort of shrieking despairing command down kirby when just as the beast was springing on her his throat was seized by the powerful hands that alone could have grappled with him and the terrible head foaming and making horrid choking growls was swung round from her and the dog lifted by the back of the neck in the air struggling and kicking violently  everyone had given back hippolyta had thrown herself on eustace who drew her back crowding on us into the porch harold still holding the dog at arms length made his voice heard in steady tones will some one give me my other glove  one hand that which grasped the dog was gloved but the free hand was bare and it was dora who first understood saw the glove at his feet sprang to his side and held it up to him while he worked his hand into it and she pulled it on for him  then he transferred his grasp from one hand to the other and in that moment the powerful bloodhound made a desperate struggle and managed to get one paw on the ground and writhe itself round so as to fly at his face and make its teeth actually meet in his beard a great mouthful of which it tore out and we saw it champing the hairs as he again swung it up so that it could only make frantic contortions with its body and legs while he held it at arms length with the iron strength of his wrists  this had taken hardly three seconds and in that time jack horsman and a keeper or two had been able to come up but no one unarmed could give efficient aid and harold said ill take him to the yard  mr horsman led the way and as the keepers followed with several of the gentlemen i was forced to let harold vanish carrying at arms length that immense dog still making horrible rabid struggles  i dont clearly remember how we got back to the house  somebody had fainted i believe and there was much confusion but i know nothing but that there was the report of a pistol and almost immediately after i saw harold coming up to the hall door with dora lying back in his arms  then my eyes and ears grew clear and i flew forward to ask the dreadful question  no he said she is only a little upset unperceived that child had followed him down holding the broken chain in which he might have tripped and had stood by even while he set the poor beast on his feet and held it for the merciful death shot  it seemed that her purpose had been to suck the wound if he had been bitten and when once she heard mr horsman exclaim all safe thank god she clung to harold with an inarticulate gasp in one of those hysterical agonies by which her womanhood from time to time asserted itself  she could not breathe or speak and he only begged for a place to lay her down  old marianne horsman the quiet one of the family took us to her own den and with me insisted on looking well at harolds hands and face  what might not that horrid leap have done but we convinced ourselves that those fangs had only caught his beard where there was a visible gap but no sign of a wound and those ridinggloves had entirely guarded his hands  how blessed the providence for ordinarily he never touched gloves and common white kid ones would have availed little  there was scarce time to speak of it for the child required all our care and was only just becoming calmer as harold held her when the bride and bridegroom came in she red and eager he white and shaken to summon us to the breakfast dont go was her moan half asleep  harold bade me go and as the bride declared they could not sit down without him he answered not yet thank you i couldnt  and i remembered that his prompt deed of daring had been in defiance of a strong nervous antipathy  there was a spasmodic effort in the smile he attempted a twitching in the muscles of his throat he was as pale as his browned cheeks could become and his hand was still so unsteady that he was forced to resign to me the spoonful of cordial to put into doras mouth  and at that moment eustace turned and said have you brought the nuggets  without speaking harold put his hand into his pocket and laid them in eustaces hand  these you said they were golden apples i thought they would be bigger  they are wonderful said hippolyta no one ever had such a weddinggift  not thata debt said harold hoarsely but pippa horsman came and summoned them and i was obliged to follow answering old mariannes entreaties to say what would be good for him by begging for strong coffee which she promised and ordered but in the skurry of the household it never came  the banquet held in a tent was meant to be a brilliantly merry one the cake had a hunt in sugar all round it and the appropriate motto hip hip hurrah and people tried to be hilarious but with that awful shock thrilling on everybodys nerves we only succeeded in being noisy though as we were assured there was no cause for alarm or grief  the dog had been tied up on suspicion and had bitten nothing but one cat which it had killed  yet surely grave thankfulness would have been better for us all as well as more comfortable than loud witticisms and excited laughter  i looked at the two or three clerical members of the clan and wondered at them  when the moment for healths came the bride called to her brother the head of the house by his pleasing name of baby and sent him to fetch harold whom he brought back with him  dora was sound asleep they said and room was made for harold in the bridal neighbourhood in time to hear the baronet who had married a horsman of the last generation propose the health of the bride with all the conventional phrases and of the bridegroom as a gentleman who from his first arrival had made it his study to maintain the old character of the family and to distinguish himself by intelligent care for the welfare of his tenants c c  hippolyta must have longed to make the speech in return  we could see her prompting her husband and by means of imitations of lord erymanth he got through pretty well with his gracious acceptance of all the praises  baby jack proposed the health of the bridesmaids adding more especially that of the absent one as a little heroine and after the response came a ponderous speech by another kinsman full of compliments to harolds courage in a fulsome style that made me flush with the vexation it must give him and the annoyance it would be to reply  i had been watching him  as a pile of lumps of ice fortunately stood near him he had at every interval been transferring one to his glass filling it up with water guarding it from the circling decanters and taking such a draught at every toast that i knew his mouth was parched and i dreaded that sheer worry would make him utter one of his young barbarian bluntnesses but what he did was to stand up and say simply it is very kind of colonel horsman to speak in this way of my share in the great mercy and deliverance we have received today  it is a matter of the greatest thankfulness  let me in return thank the friends here assembled for their welcome and above all for their appreciation of my cousin whose position now fulfils my great wish  three years ago we were friendless strangers  now he has made himself one with you and i thank you heartily for it  i felt rather than heard nessy horsman muttering pretty well for the large young man and it seemed to occur to no one that friends position and all had been gained for eustace by harold himself he was requesting permission to take dora back with us and it was granted with some demur because she must be with mrs randal horsman on her return to town on the monday a days lessons could not be sacrificed for she was very backward and had no application but harold undertook that she should meet the lady at the station and gained his point  clan horsman knew too well what he had done to deny him anything he asked  a man who had not only taken a mad dog by the throat but had brought home two hundred and twenty pounds worth of gold to lay on the table deserved something at their hands though ice was all he actually received but eustace when he came to us while the bride was changing her dress was in a fretful faultfinding mood partly it may be from the desire to assert himself as usual above his cousin  he was dissatisfied with the price paid for boolaboola  someone had told him it would realise four times as much and when harold would have explained that this was unreasonable he was cut short with the declaration that the offer ought not to have been accepted without reference to the other party concerned  next he informed harold in an offhand way that some of the new improvements at arghouse would not work and that he had a new agenta responsible agentwho was not to be interfered with  there was a certain growl in harolds very well but the climax was eustaces indignation when he heard of prometeskys arrival  he had worked himself by way of doing the country squire completely into a disgust of the old exile far outheroding what he had heard from lord erymanth and that the old incendiary should be in his house was a great offence  he shall not sleep there another night neither will i said harold in a calm voice but with such a gleam in his eyes as i had seen when he fell on bullock  it had at least the effect of reducing eustace to his old habit of subordination and he fell into an agony of no i did not mean that and stammering out something in excuse about not liking the servants and all to think he was harbouring a returned convict  i had taken care of that  i knew how that that there fotsky was the ogre of the riots and i had guarded against his identification by speaking of our guest as the foreign gentleman who had come home with mr harold and causing him to be called count stanislas and on hearing this eustace became so urgent in his entreaties that harold though much hurt relented so far as to promise at any rate to remain till monday so that dora should not detect the offence  we saw the happy pair off among the old shoes to spend some months abroad while the old house was revivified for them and then we had our own drive home which was chiefly occupied with dora who sitting on harolds knee seemed to expect her full rescue from all grievances and was terribly disappointed to find that he had no power to remove her from her durance in the london schoolroom where she was plainly the dunce and the black sheep a misery to herself and all concerned hating everyone and disliked by all  to the little maiden of the bush only half tamed as yet the london schoolroom and walks in the park were penance in themselves and the company of three steady prim girls in the idealess state produced by confinement to a schoolroom and nothing but childish books was as distasteful to her as she was shocking to them and her life was one warfare with them and with their fraulein  the only person she seemed able to endure was nessy horsman who was allowed to haunt his cousin randals house and who delighted in shocking the decorous monotony of the trio of sisters finding the vehement little australian far more entertaining while whether he teased or stimulated her she found him the least uncongenial being she met in paddington  but what struck me most was the manner in which harold spoke to her not merely spoiling her and giving her her own way as if he were only a bigger child but saying it will all get better dora if you only try to do your best  i havent got any best to do  everybody has  but i dont want it to be better  i want to be with you and lucy  then came some reasoning about impossibilities too low for me to hear in the noise of the wheels but ending with it is only another thing to conquer  you can conquer anything if you only try and pray to god to help you  i havent said my prayers since i went away  they ordered me and said i was wicked but you dont harold do you she cried triumphantly little expecting the groan she met in answer yes indeed i do dora  i only wish i had done so sooner  i thought it was no use she said crying at his tone  it was so unkind to take me away from lucy and whereas she hardly ever shed tears and was now far from restored after the fright when she once began we could hardly stop her weeping and were thankful when she was soothed into another sleep which we durst not peril by a word  it deepened and lasted so that harold carried her upstairs still asleep and laid her on her own little bed  then he came out with me into my dear old sittingroom where without another word he knelt in the old place and said that psalm please lucy  i think we ought to give thanks in church i said presently  whatever is right he said fervently  it was the greatest escape you ever had i said  yes he said shuddering at least it seemed so  i really thought the dog had bitten me when he flew in my face  it felt just like it and i was very near giving up  i dont mean letting him go but not heeding whether he touched me or not  it kept on haunting me till i was alone with dora and could examine at the lookingglass  of course i was not content till i had likewise again convinced myself by searching into the beard and then i added ah this is worse than the lion though then you were really hurt  yes but there one knew the worst  besides he said again overcoming a shudder i know my feeling about dogs is a weakness owing to my sin  deliver me from the power of the dog to me expresses all the power of evil  then he sat down and took a pen to write to mr crosse  harold alison wishes to give thanks to almighty god for a great mercy  and after that he never alluded to the adventure again  i told the story to prometesky in his absence and we never mentioned it more  indeed the next thing harold said as he addressed his envelope was it is a pity to lose this room  there is one that i can fit up like it i said  all the things here are mine  and then i was glad to divert his attention by proposing to go and inspect mount eaton as soon as he had had some muchneeded food since prometesky was out and we at once plunged into the flitting affairs glad in them to stifle some of the pain that eustace had given but on which we neither of us would dwell  was harold changed or had he only gone on growing in the course he had begun  he was as simple and unconsciously powerful as ever but there was something there was not before reminding me of the dawning of undines soul  he was called off in the middle of our consultation as to the house which was our common property by a message that mr crabbe would be glad of a few minutes with him  was there any fresh annoyance about the hydriots i asked when he came back  oh no  the rascal is come over to my side  what do you think he wanted to say  that he had been to look at my grandfathers will and he thinks you could drive a coach and horses through it and he proposes to me to upset it and come in as heiratlaw  the scoundrel  after all i said after a pause it would be very good for poor arghouse if you thought it right  i should not be very good for arghouse if i did such a thing as that returned harold  no poor old eu im not going to disturb him because he has got out of my hands and i think she will take care of the people  i daresay i bullied him more than was bearable  would harold have so forgiven even eustaces ingratitude three years ago     chapter xiv  sunset gold and purple   we had a happy time after that our sunday was a very glad and peaceful one with our thanksgiving in the morning and doras pleasure in the dear old childrens service in the afternoon  poor child she liked everything that she had only submitted to when she was with us and harold took her away on the monday in a more resigned frame of mind with a kind of promise that she would be good if the horsmans would let her  then came the removal and i must say there was some compensation for the pain of leaving my old home in that sense of snugness and liberty in our new plenishing rather like the playing at dolls houses  we had stable room for harolds horse and my ponythe kangaroo alas had pined and died the winter that harold was away the garden was practicable and the rooms were capable of being made homelike and pleasant  the tracys were out of reach for the present  dermot was gone to ireland and lady diana and her daughter were making a long round of visits among friends so that there was nothing for it but waiting and as it was hopeful waiting enlivened by violas letters to me harold endured it very happily having indeed much to think about  there was prometeskys health  it was ascertained that he must undergo an operation and when we found that all the requisite skill could be had near at hand i overruled the scruples about alarming or distressing me  i knew that it would be better for him to be watched by george yolland and for harold to be at home and i had come to love the old man very heartily  one day of expectation in which he was the most calm and resolute of us one anxious day when they sent me to miss woolmer until harold came thankful and hopeful to fetch me a few more of nursing accepted with touching gratitude and he was soon downstairs again a hale old man though nearly seventy but more than ever bent on his retreat to la trappe  it distressed us much  he seemed so much to enjoy intelligent talk with miss woolmer and the yollands he so delighted in books and took such fresh interest in all whether mechanical or moral that was doing at the hydriotsof which bytheby as first inventor the company had contrived at harolds suggestion to make him a shareholder to an extent that would cover all his modest needs i could not think how he would bear the change  my dear young lady he said to me when i tried to persuade him out of writing the first letter you forget how much i have of sin upon me  can years of negation of faith or the ruin of four young lives and i know not of how many more be repented of at ease in your pleasant town amid the amiable cares you young people are good enough to lavish on the old man  i made some foolish answer about his having meant all for good and noble purposes but he shook his head  error my dear madam error excusable perhaps in one whose country has been destroyed  i see now that i have returned after years alone with my god that the work i tried to precipitate was one of patience the fire from heaven must first illuminate the soul then the spirit and then the bonds will be loosed of themselves otherwise we do but pluck them asunder to set maniacs free to rush into the gulf  and as to my influence on my two pupils your brothers i see now that what began in filial rebellion and disobedience could never end well  i bless god that i have been permitted to see in the next generation the true hero and reformer i ought to have made of my ambrose  ah ambrose ambrose noble young spirit would that any tears and penance of mine would expiate the shipwreck to which i led thee and he burst into tears  he had of course seen the roman catholic priest several times before encountering the danger of the operation and was a thoroughly devout penitent but of his old liberalism he retained the intense benevolence that made the improvements at the potteries a great delight to him likewise the historical breadth of understanding that prevented his thinking us all uncatholic and unsafe  it was a great blessing that harold was not held back but rather aided and stimulated by the example of the man to whom he most looked up but with his characteristic silence it was long before i found that having felt beside his mothers deathbed how far his spiritual wants had outgrown me he had carried them to ben yolland though the old morning habit remained unbroken and he always came to the little room i had made like my old one  ben yolland had become more entirely chaplain to the hydriots  those two brothers lived together in a curious way at what we all still called the dragons head each with his own sittingroom and one in common one fitted as a clergymans study the other more like a surgery for though george had given up his public practice since he had been manager of the works he still attended all the workpeople and their families only making them pay for their medicines when it was good for them  thus the care of the soul and bodies of the hydriots was divided between the two and they seemed to work in concert although george showed no symptom of change of opinions never saying anything openly to discredit his brothers principles nay viewing them as wholesome restraints for those who were not too scientific to accept them and even going to church when he had nothing else to do but by preference looking up his patients on a sunday  he viewed everything from religion to vice as the outcome of certain states of brain nerves and health and so far from being influenced by the example of prometesky regarded him as a proof of his own theory and talked of the slavonic temperament returning to its normal forms as the vigour of life departed  nevertheless he did not seem to do harm to the workpeople drunkenness was at least somewhat restrained though far from conquered and the general spirit of the people was wonderful compared with those of other factories  plans were under discussion for a mission chapel and the people themselves were thoroughly anxious for it  lord erymanth returning kindly came to call on me in my new house and as i was out of the drawingroom at the time he had ten minutes conversation with the gentleman whom he found reading at the window and was so much pleased with him that when making the tour of our small domain he said you did not introduce me lucy  is that an australian acquaintance of harold alisons i did not expect such high cultivation  an australian acquaintance yes said i and also a polish count  prometesky  prometesky said i to whom the name had begun to sound historical i did not know you did not recognise him  i was afraid my old friend would be angry with me but he stood still and said i never saw him except at his trial  i can understand now the fascination he was said to have possessed  i could not conscientiously assist your nephew in his recall but i highly honour the generous perseverance with which he has effected it and i am happy to acknowledge that the subject is worthy of his enthusiasm animosity may be laid aside now and you may tell mr harold alison that i heartily congratulate him  and hecount stanislas we call himsees now that he was mistaken i said  does he  that is the best of the higher stamp of men my dear they know when they are wrong and own it  in fact thats the greatest difference between men  the feeble and selfopinionated never acknowledge an error but the truly sincere can confess and retrieve their hallucinations and prejudices  well i am glad to have seen prometesky and to be disabused of some ideas respecting him  count stanislas on the other hand received me with so that is erymanth  the tyrant against whom we raged proves a charitable benevolent prosy old gentleman  how many illusions a few decades dispel and how much hatred one wastes  lord erymanth had told me that his sister would soon be at home and in september i was surprised by a call from dermot  yes im at arked he said killy marey is full of dublin workmen  my uncle has undertaken to make it habitable for me like an old brick and in the meantime theres not a room fit to smoke or sleep in so im come home like a dutiful son  then your mother is come  oh yes she is come for six weeks and then she and the st glears are to join company and winter at rome  at rome  prevention you see said dermot with a twinkle in his eye as if he were not very uneasy  the question is whether it is in time she will have piggys attentions at christmas  he is to come out for the vacation  then he further told me that his mother had brought home with her a mrs sandford with a daughter heiress to l60000 and to a newlybought estate in surrey and newlybuilt house of the most desirable description he added shrugging his shoulders  and what sort of a young lady is she  oh very desirable too i suppose  but what is she like  like  oh like other people and he whistled a little seeming relieved when count stanislas came in and soon after going to hunt up harry at the hydriot works  it made me uncomfortable it was so evidently another attempt on his mothers part to secure a rich home for him in england and his tone did not at all reassure me that with his easy temper he would not drift into the arrangement without his heart in it  why should i be so vexed about it  it might be very good for him said i to myself  no his heart was not in it for he came back with harold and lingered over our fire beyond all reasonable time talking amusing random stuff till he had left himself only ten minutes to ride home in to dinner  the next day harold and i rode over to arked together  dermot was the first person we saw disporting himself with a pugdog at the door the fates have sped you well said he as he helped me down from my pony  my mother has taken mrs sandford in state to call on mrs vernon having arranged that viola and i should conduct the sixtythousand pounder to admire the tints in the beech woods  the young ladies are putting on their hats  will it be too far for you lucy to go with us  wherewith he fraternally shouted for vi who appeared all in a rosy glow and took me upstairs to equip me for walking extracting from me in the meantime the main features of the story of the bloodhound and trembling while she gave exulting little nods  then she called for nina were they so intimate already and found that young lady in a point device walking dress nursing the pug and talking to dermot and so we set forth for the beechwoods very soon breaking our five into three and two  certainly lady diana ought to have viewed dermots attentions to the sixtythousand pounder as exemplary for he engrossed her and me so entirely with the description of harolds victory over a buckjumper at boola boola that it was full a quarter of an hour before she looked round to exclaim what is become of viola  and then we would not let her wait and in truth we never came again upon viola and harold till we overtook them at the foot of the last hill and they never could satisfy miss sandford where they had been nor what they had seen nor how they had missed us and dermot invented for the nonce a legend about a fairy in the hill who made people gyrate round it in utter oblivion of all things thus successfully diverting the attention of miss sandford who took it all seriously  yes she certainly was a stupid girl  every moment that lengthened the veritable enchantment of that autumn afternoon was precious beyond what we knew and we kept miss sandford prowling about the garden on all sorts of pretexts till the poor girl was tired out as well she might be for we had kept her on her feet for three hours and a half and she made her escape at last to join viola  i always think of harold and viola as i saw them at that moment on the top of the western slope of the lawn so that there was a great ruddy gold sky behind them against which their silhouettes stood out in a sort of rich dark purple shade  oh they are looking at such a sunset cried miss sandford climbing up the hill  query murmured dermot for the faces were in profile not turning towards the sun in the sky but to the sunbeams in one anothers eyessunbeams that were still there when we joined them and in my recollection seem to blend with the glorious haze of light that was pouring down in a flood over the purple moorland horizon and the wood field and lake below  i was forced to say something about going home and viola took me up to her room where we had one of those embraces that can never be forgotten  the chief thing that the dear girl said to me was oh lucy  how he has suffered  how shall i ever make it up to him  poor dear viola little did she think that she was to cause the very sharpest of his sufferings  nay as little did he when we rode home together with the still brilliant sky before us  i never see a lane ending in golden light melting into blue and dark pine trees framing as it were the brightness with every little branch defined against it without thinking of that silence of intense almost awestruck joy in which harold went home by my side only at long intervals uttering some brief phrase such as this is blessedness or thank god who gives women such hearts  he had told her all and it had but added a reverent enthusiastic pity and fervour to that admiring love which had been growing up so long and to which he had set the spark  his old friend was admitted to share their joy and was as happy as we were perhaps doubly so since he had beheld with despair harolds early infatuation and its results which had made him fear during those three wretched years that all the lads great and noble gifts would be lost in the coarse excesses of his wild life with barbarous prosperity without and a miserable hardening home  that he should have been delivered from it still capable of refinement still young and fresh enough for a new beginning had been a cause of great joy and now that all should be repaired by a true and worthy love had seemed beyond hope  we built our castles over the fire that evening harold had already marked out with his eye the tract of neme heath which he would reclaim and the little he had already set me on doing among  the women and children at the potteries had filled us with schemes as to what viola was to carry out  some misgivings there were even then  lady diana was not to be expected to like harolds l1200 a year as well as piggys heirship to the erymanth coronet or any of the other chances that might befall an attractive girl of twenty  for coldness and difficulties we were prepared but not for the unqualified refusal with which she met harold the next morning grounding all on the vague term circumstances preventing his even seeing viola and cutting short the interview in the manner of a grande dame whose family had received an insult  dermot however not only raging but raving on his side assured him of the staunchness of his sister and her resolve to hold by him through everything and further in sundry arguments with his mother got to the bottom of the circumstances  she had put away from herself the objection to the convict birth and breeding by being willing to accept eustace to whom exactly the same objections applied and when she called eustace a man of more education and manners her son laughed in her face at the comparison of that idiot with a man like harold  then came the past life a much more tangible objection but dermot was ready there declaring that whatever harold had done considering his surroundings was much less heinous than his own transgressions after such a bringing up as his and would his mother say that nobody ought to marry him  besides to whom had she given di  they were not arguments that lady diana accepted but she weakened her own cause by trying to reinforce it with all the stympson farrago the exaggeration of which dermot after his own meeting with henry alison and with prometesky to corroborate him was fully prepared to explode to the satisfaction even of lord eryinanth  harold himself was deeply sensible of the stain and burthen of his actual guilt more so indeed than he had ever been before both from the religious influences to which he had submitted himself and from the sense of that sweet innocence of his violas but his feeling had come to be that if his heavenly father loved and forgave him so in a lesser way viola forgave him because she loved him he did not wonder at nor complain of lady dianas not thinking him worthy of her good and lovely child  he would be thankful to submit to any probation five seven ten years without any engagement if he might hope at last even lord erymanth when he saw how his darlings soul was set on it thought that thus much might be granted  but lady diana had still another entrenchment which she had concealed as it were to the last not wishing to shock and pain us all she said  though she said she had reason to complain of not having been told from the first that harold had once been insane nothing could induce her to sanction her daughters marriage with a man whose mind had been disordered nay who had done mortal injury in his frenzy  it was a monstrous idea  dermots reply to this was that nobody then ought to marry who had had a delirious fever and he brought prometesky over to arked to testify to her how far the attack had been from anything approaching to constitutional insanity  the terrible fall of which harolds head still bore the mark the shock the burning sun were a combination of causes that only made it wonderful that he should have recovered the ensuing brain fever and the blow to his rival had been fatal by the mere accident of his strength  a more ordinary man would have done no serious harm by such a stroke given when not accountable  lady diana answered stiffly that this might be quite true but that there had been another cause for the temporary derangement which had not been mentioned and that it was notorious that mr alison in consequence had been forced to avoid all liquors and she appealed to dermot as to the effects of a very small quantity on his friends brain  poor dermot it was bitter enough for him to have that orgie at foling brought forward against his friend  nor could any representation appease lady diana  i thought her very cruel and unreasonable then and i am afraid i believe that if harold had had ten or even five thousand a year these objections would never have been heard of but after years and experience have cooled my mind it seems to me that on several grounds she was justified in her reluctance and that as viola was so young and harolds repentance had been comparatively recent she might fairly have insisted on waiting long enough to see whether he were indeed to be depended upon or if violas affection were strong enough to endure such risk as there might be  for dermot resolute to defend his friend and declaring that his sisters heart should not be broken was the prime mover in harold going up to consult the most eminent men of the day on mental disease prometesky going with him as having been his only attendant during his illness to give an account of the symptoms and dermot who so comported himself in his excitement as to seem far more like the lover whose hopes might have depended on the verdict on his doubtful sanity than did the grave quiet selfcontained man who answered all questions so steadily  the sentence was so far satisfactory that the doctor confirmed prometeskys original view that concussion of the brain aggravated by circumstances had produced the attack and that there was no reasonable ground for apprehension of its recurrence certainly not of its being hereditary  but he evidently did not like the confession of the strange horror of dogs which harold thought it right to mention as having been brought on by the circumstances of his accident and he would not venture to say that any exciting cause might not more easily affect the brain than if nothing had ever been amiss  yet when dermot tarried explaining that he was the brother of a young lady deeply concerned the doctor assured him that whereas no living man could be insured from insanity he should consider the gentleman he had just seen to be as secure as any one else since there was no fear of any hereditary taint and his having so entirely outgrown and cast off all traces of the malady was a sign of his splendid health and vigour of constitution  but lady diana was still not satisfied  she still absolutely refused all consent and was no more moved at the end of three weeks than before  dear harold said he did not wonder and that if he had seen himself in this true light he would have loved viola at a distance without disquieting her peace but since he had spoken and knew she loved him he could not but persevere for her sake  we could see he said it with a steady countenance but a burning heart  neither he nor i was allowed to see viola but there was dermot as constant reporter and to my surprise viola was not the submissive daughter i had expected  lady diana had never had any real ascendancy over her childrens wills or principles  even violas obedience had been that of duty not of the heart and she had from the first declared that mamma might forbid her to marry harold or to correspond with him and she should consider herself bound to obey but that she had given him her promise and that she could not and would not take it back again she would wait on for ever if otherwise it could not be but he had her troth plight and she would be faithful to it she would not give up her crystal cross and she sent harold her love every day by her brother often in her mothers very hearing saying she was too proud of him to be ashamed  she had resolved on her own line of passive obedience but of never renouncing her engagement and her brother upheld her in it while her uncle let himself be coaxed out of his displeasure and committed himself to that compromise plan of waiting which his sister viewed as fatal since viola would only lose all her bloom and perhaps her health nothing she said was so much to be deplored for a girl as a long engagement  the accepting a reformed rake had been always against her principles and she did not need even the dreadful possibility of derangement or the frightful story of his first marriage to make her inexorable  viola we were told had made up her mind that it was a case for perseverance and all this time kept up dauntlessly not failing in spirits nor activity but telling her brother she had always known she should have to go through something but harolds love was worth it and she meant to be brave how should she not be when she knew harold cared for her and as to what seemed to be objections in the eyes of others did they not make her long the more to compensate him  she has to make all her love to me poor little woman and very pretty love it is said dermot  whether harold made as much love in return to their ready medium i cannot tell for their conferences were almost always out of doors or at the office and harold was more reserved than ever  he was not carrying matters with the same high hand as his little love for as he always said he knew he had brought it all on himself  he never complained of lady diana but rather defended her to her son for not thinking him fit for her daughter only adhering to his original standpoint that where there was so much love surely some hope might be granted since he would thankfully submit to any probation  we all expected that this would be the upshot of our suspense and that patience and constancy would prevail and by the help of immense walks and rides and a good deal of interest in some new buildings at the potteries and schemes for the workmen harold kept himself very equable and fairly cheerful though his eyes were weary and anxious and when he was sitting still musing there was something in his pose which reminded me more than ever of michel angelos figures above all the grand one on the medicean monument  he consorted much more now with mr yolland the curate and was making arrangements by which the school chapel might expand into a mission church but still i did not know that he was finding the best aid through this time in the devotions and heartsearchings to which the young clergyman had led him and which were the real cause of the calm and dignified humility with which he waited  at last lady diana finding herself powerless with her daughter sent a letter to harold beginning i appeal to your generosity  a very cruel letter in some ways it was representing that he had acquiesced in her judgment that there were certain unfortunate passages in his past life which made it her painful duty to prevent her child from following the dictates of an inexperienced heart  then she put it to him whether it were not a most unfortunate position for a young girl to be involved in an engagement which could never be fulfilled and which was contrary to the commands of her only remaining parent and she showed how family peace confidence and maternal and filial affection must suffer if the daughter should hold fast persistently to the promise by which she held herself bound  in fact it was an urgent entreaty for violas own sake that he would release her from her promise  dermot was shooting at erymanth and neither he nor i knew of this letter till harold had acted  he rode at once to arked saw lady diana and declared himself convinced that the engagement having no chance of sanction ought to be given up  rather than keep viola in the wearing state of resistance and disobedience her mother described he would resign all hopes of her  lady diana went to her daughter with the tidings that mr alison saw the hopelessness of his suit and released her from her promise  you have made him do so mamma cried viola if he releases me i do not release myself  finally lady diana astonished to find harold so reasonable and amenable perceived that the only means of dealing with her daughter was to let them meet again  of course no one fully knows what passed then  harold told me the only time he spoke of it that he had just taken out his own heart and crushed it but viola dwelt on each phrase and long after used to go over all with me  he had fully made up his mind that to let viola hold to her troth would neither be right nor good for her and he used his power of will and influence to make her resign it  there was no concealment nor denial of their mutual love  it was violas comfort to remember that but said harold your mother has only too good reasons for withholding you from me and there is nothing for it but to submit and give one another up  but we do not leave off loving one another said poor viola  we cannot do what we cannot  and when we are old  that would be a mental reservation said harold  there must be no mutual understanding of coming together again  i promised your mother because i am a guilty man i am not to break up your life  he made her at last resign her will into his she only feeling that his judgment could not be other than decisive and that she could not resist him even for his own sake  he took her for a moment into his arms and exchanged one long burning kiss then while she was almost faint and quite passive with emotion he laid her on the sofa and called her mother  lady diana he said we give up all claim to one anothers promise in obedience to you  do we not viola  yes she faintly said  he gave her brow one more kiss and was gone  he took his horse home and sent in a pencil note to me all over dont wait for meh a  i was dreadfully afraid he would go off to australia or do something desperate but count stanislas reassured me that this would be unlike harolds present self since his strength had come to be used not in passion but in patience  we dined as best we could without him waited all the evening and sat up till eleven when we heard him at the door  i went out and took down the chain to let him in  it was a wet misty night and he was soaked through  i begged him to come in and warm himself and have something hot but he shook his head as if he could not speak took his candle and went upstairs  i made the tea for which i had kept the kettle boiling all this time and prometesky took his great cup in to him presently returning to say he is calm  he has done wisely he has exhausted himself so that he will sleep  he says he will see me at once to my retreat in normandy  i think it will be best for him  count stanislas was in fact on the eve of departure and in a couple of days more harold went away with him having only broached the matter to me to make me understand that the break had been his not violas and that i must say no more about it  dermot had come over and raged against his mother and even against harold declaring that if the two had stood out they would have prevailed but that he did not wonder harold was tired of it  harolds look made him repent of that bit of passion but he was contemptuous of the for her sake which was all harold uttered as further defence  what tell him it was for her sake when she was creeping about the house like a ghost looking as if she had just come out of a great illness  dermot meant to escort his mother and sister to florence chiefly in order to be a comfort to the latter but he meant to return to ireland as soon as they had joined the st glears  taking you by the way he said before going to my private la trappe  prometesky took leave of me not quite as if we were never to meet again for his experimental retreat was to be over at christmas and he would then be able to receive letters  he promised me that if i then wrote to him that harold stood in need of him for a time he would return to us instead of commencing the novitiate which would lead to his becoming dead to the outer world  harold was gone only ten days and came back late on a friday evening he tried to tell me about what he had done and seen but broke off and said well i am very stupid i went to all the places they told me to see at rouen and everywhere else but i cant recollect anything about them  so i let him gaze into the fire in peace and all saturday he was at the potteries or at the office very busy about all his plans and also taking in hand the charge for george yolland for both brothers were going on monday to take a fortnights holiday among their relations he only came in to dinner and after it told me very kindly that he must leave me alone again for he wanted to see ben yolland  a good person for him to wish to see but was all this restlessness thought this foolish lucy  when he came in only just at bedtime there was something more of rest and less of weary sadness about his eyes than i had seen since the troubles began and as we wished one another good night he said lucy god forgives while he punishes  he is better to us than man yolland says i may be with you at church early tomorrow  then my cheeks flushed hot with joy and i said how thankful i was that all this had not distracted his thoughts from the subject when i wanted help more than ever he said  so in some ways that was to me at least a gladsome sunday though not half so much at the time as it has become in remembrance and i could not guess how much of conscious peace or joy harold felt as for the first and only time he and i knelt together on the chancel step  he said nothing but he had quite recovered his usual countenance and manner only looking more kind and majestic than ever as i his fond aunt thought when we went among the children after the school service to give them the little dainties they had missed in his absence and he smiled when they came round him with their odd little bits of chatter  we sat over the fire in the evening and talked a little of surface things but that died away and after a quarter of an hour or so he looked up at me and said and what next  what are we to do do you mean i said for i had been thinking how all his schemes of life had given way  we spoke of it together old eu did not want him as he said and though there was much for him to do at the hydriot works and the mission chapel the reading room the association for savings and all the rest which needed his eye yet for violas peace he thought he ought not to stay and the same cause hindered the schemes he had once shared with dermot he had cut himself loose from australia and there seemed nothing before him  there were the city missions he said wearily for he did not love the city and yet he felt more than ever the force of his dying fathers commission to carry out his longings for the true good of the people  i said we could make a london home and see dora sometimes trying to make him understand that he might reckon on me as his sister friend but the answer was i dont count on that  you dont want to cast me off  no indeed but there is another to be thought of  then he told me how over my letters to him in new south wales there had come out dermots account of the early liking that everyone nipped till my goodgirlish submission wounded and affronted him and he forgot or disliked me for years how old feelings had revived when we came in contact once more but how he was withheld from their manifestation by the miserable state of his affairs as well as by my own coldness and indifference  i made some sound which made harold say you told me to keep him away  i knew i ought i remember saying faintly  ohh a prolonged sound that began a little triumphantly but ended in a sigh and then he earnestly said you do not think you ought to discourage him now  your mother did not forbid it for ever  oh no no it never came to that  and you know what he is now  i know he is changed was all i could say  and you will help him forward a little when he comes back  you and he will be happy  there might be a great surging wave of joy in my heart but it would not let me say anything but and leave you alone harold  i must learn to be alone he said  i can stay here this winter and see to the things in hand and then i suppose something will turn up  as a call i said  yes he answered  i told god today that i had nothing to do but his service and i suppose he will find it for me  there was something in the steadfast yet wistful look of his eyes that made me take down the legend of st christopher and read it aloud reading generally sent him into a doze but even that would be a respite to the heartache he so patiently bore and i took the chance but he sat with his chin on his hand and his eyes fixed attentively on mine all the time then held out his hand for the book and pondered as was his thorough way in such matters  at last he said well ill wait by the stream  some day he will send me some one to carry over  we little thought what stream was very near     chapter xv  the fatal token   tuesday morning brought a strange little untidy packet tied with blue ribbon understamped and directed to harold alison esquire in the worst form of poor doras always bad handwriting  within was a single knitted muffatee and a long lock of the stiffly curling yellow hair peculiar to doras head  in blotted sloping roundhand was written   my dear harry  goodbye i do fele so very ill i cant do any more  dont forget i allwaies was your wiffe                                i am your affex d a   we looked at each other in wonder and dismay sure that the child must be very ill and indignant that we had not been told  harold talked of going up to town to find out i was rather for going or sending to therford for tidings and all the time alas alas he was smoothing and caressing the yellow tress between his fingers pitying the child and fancying she was being moped to death in the schoolroom  we determined on riding to therford and harold had hastened to the office to despatch some business first when mr horsman himself came inon his way to the petty sessionsto explain matters  mrs randall horsman had arrived with her children at therford the day before flying from the infection of smallpox for which the doctor had declared dora to be sickening  the whole family had been spending the autumn months at the seaside  nessy horsman had been with them and had taken dora about with him much more than had been approved  in one of these expeditions he had taken her into the shop of a village ratcatcher where it had since been ascertained two children were ill of smallpox  she had been ailing ever since the party had returned to london the doctor had been called in on monday and had not only pronounced the dreadful name of the disease but seeking in vain for the marks of vaccination on her arms he greatly apprehended that she would have it in full and unmitigated virulence  mrs randall horsman had herself and her children vaccinated without loss of time and fled to the country  her husband would spend all day in his chambers and only sleep at home on the groundfloor with every precaution and dora had been left in the charge of a young underhousemaid whose marked face proved her safety until the doctor could send in a regular nurse  it was this wretched little stupid maid who was ignorant enough to assist the poor child in sending off her unhappy packet all unknowing of the seeds of destruction it conveyed  i had had a slight attack of undoubted smallpox when a young child and i immediately resolved on going to nurse my poor dora secure that she would now be left to me and unable to bear the thought of her being among strangers  i went at once to the office to tell harry and baby jack walked with me as far as our roads lay together asking me on the way if it were true that harold alison was engaged to miss tracy and on my denial saying that mrs randall had come down full of the report that nessy had heard of it and on sunday afternoon had teased dora about it to such a degree that she had leaped up from the sofa and actually boxed his ears after which she had gone into such a paroxysm of tears and sobs that she had been sent to bed and in the morning the family mind began to perceive she was really ill  the poor childs passionate jealousy had no doubt prompted her letter as well as her desire to take leave of the object of her love and knowing her strange character as i did i was sure the idea was adding tenfold to the misery of the dreadful illness that was coming on her  i had to pursue harold to the potteries where one of the workmen directed me to him as he was helping to put in order some machine for hoisting that was out of gear  bless you maam said the man he is as strong as any four of we  when i found him his consternation was great and he quite agreed with me that i had better go up that very afternoon and take charge of dora since baby jack answered for it that randall horsman would be most grateful and thankful  harold found out the hours for the trains and did everything to expedite me  he made it certain that poor little dora had not been vaccinated  when she was born no doctor lived within sixty miles of boola boola and nobody had ever thought of such a thing  and you harry i asked with a sudden thrill of alarm  do you expect me to remember he asked with a smile  i begged him to look for the moons upon his arm and at any rate to undergo the operation again since even if it had been done in his infancy the effect might have worn out and it was only too probable that in the case of a child born on board a sailing vessel without a doctor it had been forgotten  he gave in to my solicitude so far as to say that he would see about it but reminded me that it was not he who was going into the infection  yes i said but there was that lock of hair and the worsted cuff  such things did carry contagion and he ought to burn them at once  poor dora he said rather indignantly  oh that i had seen them burnt  oh that i had taken him to dr kingstons for vaccination before i went away instead of contenting myself with the unmeaning halfincredulous promise to see about it by which of course he meant to mention it when george yolland came home  yet it might have made no difference for he had been fondling and smoothing that fatal curl all the time we were talking over the letter  he came to the station with me gave me the kindest messages for dora arranged for my telegraphing reports of her every daytook care of me as men will do when they seem to think their womankind incapable without them making all the more of me because i did not venture to take colman whom i sent to visit her home  he insisted on mr ben yolland who had been detained a day behind his brother going in a firstclass carriage with me  i leant out at the window for the parting kiss and the last sight i had of my dear harold as the train steamed out of the station was bearing on his shoulder a fat childa potterswho had just arrived by the train and had been screaming to his mother to carry him regardless of the younger baby and baskets in her arms  it might well make my last sight of him remind me of st christopher  that journey with the curate was comfortable in itself and a great comfort to me afterwards  we could not but rejoice together over that sunday and ben yolland showed himself deeply struck with the simplicity and depth that had been revealed to him the reality of whatever harold said and his manner of taking his dire disappointment as the just and natural outcome of his former life many men would have been soured and driven back to evil by such a rejection  harold had made it the occasion of his most difficult victory and sharpest struggle yet all the time he was unconscious how great a victory it was  and so thorough was the penitence so great the need of refreshment after the keen struggle for selfmastery and so needful the pledge of pardon that though he had never been confirmed there was no doubt as to making him welcome at once to the heavenly feast well that it was so  the what next concerned mr yolland as much as it did me  he could not bear to think of relinquishing one whoall unknown to himselfdid more to guide and win the hearts of those hydriots than teaching or sermons could ever do and yet no one could advise harold to remain after this winter  in the reprieve however we both rejoiced and ben then added for my brothers sake especially  do you think the example tells on him i ventured on asking  i can hardly say it does was the answer  george used to point to harold alison as a specimen of a vigorous physical development so perfectly balanced as to be in a manner selfadjusting without need of what he called imaginative influences  i always thought he was a little staggered that evening that he had to summon you miss alison to his help but he had some theory of sentiment to account for it and managed as people do to put it aside  lately however he has been looking on he says with curiosityi believe with something more you see he reveres alison for what he is not for what he knows  of course not your brother must know far more than harold  but the strength of character and will impresses him  the bending of such a nature to faith the acceptance of things spiritual by one real unimaginative and unsophisticated and above all the self conquest just where a great greek hero would have failed have certainly told on george so that i see more hope than i have ever done before  so careful of me was mr yolland that he only parted with me at randall horsmans door where i was gladly welcomed by the master of the house and found my poor little niece a grievous spectacle and so miserable with the horrible illness that she only showed her pleasure in my coming by fretting whenever anyone else touched her  she had it badly in the natural form but never was in immediate danger and began in due time to recover  i had ceased my daily telegrams and had not been alarmed by some days intermission of harolds letters for i knew that dermot was at arked alone and that by this time the yollands would be returned and my nephew would have less time to spend on me  one dismal wintry afternoon however when i was sitting in the dark telling dora stories a card was brought up to me by the little housemaid  the gentleman begged to see me  mr tracy was on the card and the very sight startled me with the certainty that something was amiss  i left the girl in charge and hurried down to the room where dermot was leaning over the mantelshelf with his head against his arms in a sorrowful attitude as if he could not bear to turn round and face me i flew up to him crying out that i knew he was come to fetch me to harold dora was so much better that i could leave her  he turned up to me a white haggard face and eyes with dismay pity and grief in them such as even now it wrings my heart to recall and hoarsely said in a sunken voice no lucy i am not come to fetch you and he took my hand and grasped it convulsively  but he has caught it  dermot bent his head  i must go to him even if he bids me not  i know he wants me  no again said dermot as if his tongue refused to move  oh lucy lucy i cannot tell you  and he burst into a flood of tears shaking choking even rending him  i stood feeling as if turned to stone and presently the words came out in a sob oh lucy he is dead and sinking on the nearest seat his tempest of grief was for the moment more frightful than the tidings which i could not take in so impossible did the sudden quenching of that glorious vitality seem  i began in some foolish way to try to console him as if it were a mere fancy  i brought him a glass of water from the sideboard and implored him to compose himself and tell me what made him say such terrible things but he wrung my hand and leant his head against me as he groaned i tell you it is true  we buried him this morning  the noblest dearest friend that ever  and you never told me  you never fetched me i might have saved him was my cry then oh why did you not  then he told me that there had been no time and how useless my presence would have been  we sat on the sofa and he gasped out something of the sad story though not by any means all that i afterwards learnt from himself and from the yollands but enough to make me feel the reality of the terrible loss  and i will tell the whole here  left to himself the dear fellow had no doubt forgotten all about vaccination or any peril to himself for he never mentioned it to dermot who only thought him anxious about dora  on the saturday they were to have had a days shooting and then to have dined at erymanth but harold sent over in the morning to say he had a headache and could not come so dermot went alone  when the yollands came home at nine at night a message was given that mr alison would like to see mr george as soon as he came in but as the train had been an hour late and the message had not been delivered immediately on their coming in george thought it could not concern that night so he waited till morning but he was awaked in the winter twilight by harold at his door saying doctor im not quite right  i wish you would come up presently and see after me  he was gone again while he was being called to wait and dressing as fast as possible george yolland went out after him into the dark cold frosty foggy morning and overtook him leaning on the gate of a field shivering panting and so dizzy that it was with difficulty he was helped to the house  he made known that he had felt very unwell all the day before and had had a miserable night in which all the warnings about infection had returned on him  the desire to keep clear of all whom he might endanger as well as a feveredperhaps already halfdeliriouslonging for cool air had sent him forth himself to summon george yolland  and already strong shivering fits and increased distress showed what fatal mischief that cold walk had done  all he cared now to say was that he trusted to his doctor to keep everybody out of the house that i was not to be called away from dora and that it was all his own fault  one person could not be kept away and that was dermot tracy  he came over to spend the sunday with his friend and finding the door closed and richardson giving warning of smallpox only made him the more eagerly run upstairs  george could by that time ill dispense with a strong mans help and after vaccinating him admitted him to the room where the checking of the eruption had already produced terrible fever and violent raving  it was a very remarkable delirium as the three faithful watchers described it  the mind and senses seemed astray only not the will it was as if all the vices of his past life came in turn to assail him and he was writhing and struggling under their attacks yet not surrendering himself  whenthe sunday duties overben yolland came in he found him apparently acting over some of the wild scenes of his early youth with shreds of the dreadful mirth and evil words of profane revelry and yet as if they struck his ears he would catch himself up and strike his fist on his mouth and when ben entered he stretched out his arms and said dont let me  prayer soothed him for a short interval but just as they hoped that sleep might come the fierce struggle with oppression brought back the old habits of violent language and then the distressed endeavour to check himself and the clutch at the clergymans aid  ben yolland saw standing in the room a great rough wooden cross which harold had made for some decorating plan of mine  he held it over him put it into his hand and bade him repeat after him christ has conquered  by thy cross and passion by thy precious death and burial good lord deliver us  so it went on hour after hour evening closing into night the long long night brightening at last into day and still the fever raged and the fits of delirious agony came on as though every fiend that had ever tempted him were assailing him now  yet still he had the power to grasp the cross when it was held to him and speak the words christ has conquered and his ears were open to the prayer by thy cross and passion by thine agony and bloody sweat good lord deliver usthe prayer that ben prayed like moses at rephidim time came and went the northchester physician came and said he might be saved if the eruption could only be brought out but he feared that it had been thrown inwards so that nothing would avail but of all this harold knew nothing he was only in that seething brain whose former injury now added to the danger living over again all his former life as those who knew it could trace in the choked and broken words  yet as the doctors averred that the conscience and the will should not be mastered by the delirium was most unusual and proved the extraordinary force of his character and resolution even though the conflict was evidently a great addition to his sufferings  worst of all was the deadly strife when with darkness came the old horror of being pursued by hell hounds driven on by meg and the rival he had killednay once it was even by his little children then he turned even from the cross in agony  i cannot  see there they will not let me and he would have thrown himself from his bed taking the hands that held him for the dogs fangs  and yet even then a command rather than a prayer from the priest reached his ears he wrestled with choking stifling breath as though with a weight on his chest grappling with his hands as if the dog were at his throat but at last he uttered those words once more christ has conquered then with a gasp as from a freed breast for his strength was going fast fell back in a kind of swoon  yes he was delivered from the power of the dog for after that when he woke it was in a different mood  he knew ben but he thought he had little ambrose sitting on his pillow held his arm as if his baby were in it and talked to them smiling and tenderly as if glad they had come to him and he were enjoying their caresses their brightness and beauty  nor did the peace pass away he was so quiet that all hoped except george yolland who knew the mischief had become irreparable and though he never was actually sensible the borderland was haunted no more with images of evil or of terror but with the fair visions fit for him that overcometh  once they thought he fancied he was showing his children to viola or to me once when dermots face came before him he recurred to some of the words used in the struggle about viola  i dont deserve her  good things are not for me  all will be made pure there  they thought then that he was himself and knew he was dying but the next moment some words evidently addressed to his child showed them he was not in our world and after that all the murmurs were about what had last taken up his mindthe bread of heaven the fruit of everlasting life  to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the fruit of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god  that was what mr yolland ventured now to say over him and it woke the last respondent glance of his eyes  he had tasted of that feast of life on the sunday he was alone and ben yolland would even then have given it to him but before it could be arranged he could no longer swallow and the affection of the brain was fast blocking up the senses so that blindness and deafness came on and passed into that insensibility in which the last struggles of life are as they tell us rather agonising to the beholder than to the sufferer  it was at sundown at last that the mightiest and gentlest spirit i ever knew was set free  those three durst not wait to mourn  their first duty was to hasten the burial so as to prevent the spread of contagion and they went at once their different ways to make the preparations  no form of conventional respect could be used but it was the three who so deeply loved him who laid him in the roughmade coffin hastily put together the same evening with the cross that had served him in his conflict on his breast and three camellia buds from violas tree dermot had thought of her and ridden over to fetch them  there had been no disfigurement  if there had been he might have lived but still it was a comfort to know that the dear face was last seen in more than its own calm majesty as of one who lay asleep after a mighty conquest  over the coffin they placed the lions skin  it had been left in the room during his illness and must have been condemned and it made his fit pall when they took it to be buried with him  it was before daybreak that with good old richardsons help they carried him down to a large cart belonging to the potteries drawn by the two big horses he used to pet and driven by george yolland himself  they took him to our own family burialplace in arghouse churchyard where the grave had been dug at night  they meant no one to be there but behold there was a multitude of heads gathered round two or three hundred at least and when the faithful four seemed to need aid in carrying that great weight the few steps from the gate there was a rush forward in spite of the peril and disappointment when no help was accepted  ben yolland read the service over the grave and therewith there was the low voice of many many weepers as they closed it in and left him there among his forefathers under his lions skin and even at that moment a great golden glorious sun broke out above the horizon and bathed them all over with light while going forth as a giant to run his course conquering the night mists  then they turned back to the town and dermot came by the next train to town to tell me  but of all this i at first gathered but little for his words were broken and his voice faint and choked not only with grief but with utter exhaustion and i was so slow to realise all that i hardly knew more than the absolute fact before a message came hurriedly down that dora was worse and i must come instantly dermot who had talked himself into a kind of dull composure stood up and said he would come again on the morrow when he was a little rested for indeed he had not lain down since saturday and was quite worn out  i went up with heart quailing at the thought of letting that passionately loving creature guess what had befallen her and yet how could i command myself with her  but that perplexity was spared me the tidings had through the horsman family reached the house and in my absence that same foolish housemaid had actually told dora of them pointblank  she said nothing but presently the girl found her with her teeth locked and eyes fixed in what looked like a convulsion but was in reality such suppressed hysteria as she had had before  she soon came out of that attack but was exceedingly ill all that night and the next day her recovery being altogether thrown back by feverishness and loss of appetite but strange child that she was she never named harold nor let me speak of him  i think she instinctively shrank from her own emotion and had a kind of dread and jealous horror of seeing anyone else grieve for him  dermot did not come the next day but a note was brought me left the servant said by the gentleman in a cab  it told me that he felt so ill that he thought it wisest to go at once to the smallpox hospital and find out whether it were the disease or only vaccination and fatigue  it was a brave unselfish resolve full of the spirit he had imbibed and it was wise for the illness was upon him already the more severe from his exhausted state and the shock he had undergone mr randall horsman who was very kind managed that i should hear of him and i knew he was going on fairly well and not in any special danger  but oh that time seems to me the most wretched that ever i passed up in those great london attic nurseries where dora and i were prisonersall winter fogginess with the gas from below sending up its light on the ceiling and dora never letting me sit still to grieve she could not bear the association or memory i believe and with the imperious power of recovery used to keep me reading mayne reids storybooks to her incessantly or else playing at backgammon i hate the sound of dice to this hour and when i heard that unhappy french criminals the night before their execution are apt to send for fenimore coopers novels it seemed to reveal doras state of mind  after two or three days george yolland came up to see me  he had been to see dermot and gave me comfort as to his condition and the care taken of him but the chief cause of the visit was that they wanted my authority for the needful destruction of whatever had been in that room and could not be passed through fire  mr yolland had brought me my harolds big wellworn pocketbook which he said must undergo the same doom for though i was contagion proof yet harm might be laid up for others and only what was absolutely necessary must be saved  first of all indeed lay in their crumpled paper poor doras fatal gifts treasured no doubt as probably her last and there in a deep leathern pocket was another little parcel with violas crystal cross which her mother had made her return  she might have that now it would bear disinfecting but the irish heathbells that told of autumn days at killey marey must go and that brief note to me that had been treasured upyes and the quaint old housewife with d l his aunts maiden initials whence his needles and thread used to come for his mending work  an old worn pencilcase kept for his mothers sakefor alice was on the sealwas the only thing i could rescue but next there came an envelope with my will scrawled on it  mr yolland thought i ought to open it to see who had authority to act and it proved that we alone had for he was made executor with l1000  a favourite rifle was bequeathed to eustace an annuity of l50 to smith and all the rest of the property was to be shared between dora and me it was in the fewest words not at all in form but all right and fully witnessed  it was in the dear handwriting and was dated on the sad lonely saturday when he felt himself sickening  the other things were accounts and all my letters most of which could follow the fate of all that he had touched in those last days  however the visit was a comfort to me george yolland answered my questions and told me much more than poor dermot could do in his stupefaction from grief fatigue and illness even if i then could have understood  he told me of the grief shown by all mycening and arghouse and of the sobbing and weeping of mothers and children who went in a broken pilgrimage on sunday afternoon to the grave at arghouse of the throngs at the church and the hush like a sob held back when the text was given out thanks be to him who giveth us the victory through jesus christ our lord  yet on the saturday evening there was something more noted still the men stood about when they had come up for their wages to the office where but a week before harold had paid them with a sore struggle to see and to count aright as some even then had observed and at last their spokesman had explained their great desire to do something themselves in memory of the best friend they ever had as they truly called him  some of them had seen memorialwindows and they wanted mr yolland to take from each a small weekly subscription throughout the winter to adorn the new chapel with windows with the history of samson a killin of the lion called out a gruff voice  it was the voice of the father of the boy whom harold had rescued on neme heath  so said george yolland as he told me the poor fellows hearty way was almost more than one could bear but i knew alison would have me try to turn it to some sort of good to themselves so i stood up and said id take it on one condition only  they knew very well what vexed mr alison most in themselves and the example he had sethow he had striven to make them give up making beasts of themselves wouldnt they think with me it was insulting him to let a drunkard have a hand in doing a thing to his memory  so i would manage their collection on condition they agreed that whoever took more than his decent pint a dayor whatever else sober men among them chose to fix it atshould have his money returned on the spot  poor fellows they cheered and said i was in the right but whether they will keep to it is another thing  they did keep to it  all that winter while the chapel was building there were only five cases in which the money had to be returned and two of those took the pledge pleaded hard and were restored indeed i believe it was only the habitually sober who ventured on the tolerated pint  of course there were some who never came into the thing at all and continued in their usual course but these were the dregs sure to be found everywhere and the main body of the hydriot potters kept their word so staunchly that the demon of intoxication among them was slain by those samson windows as harold had never slain it during his life  beautiful bright windows they are glowing with samson in his typical might slaying his lion out of the strong finding sweetness drinking water after the fight bearing away the gates and slaying his foes in his death  but samson is not there alone  as the more thoughtful remarked samson was scarce a worthy likeness for one who had had grace to triumph  no samson whose life always seems like a great type in shattered fragments must be set in juxtaposition with the great antitype  his conflict with satan his last supper his pointing out the water of life his death and his victory over death shine forth giving their own lesson of who hath won the victory  we ventured to add two little windows with st george and st christopher to show how christs soldiers may follow in the conquest treading down the dragon and bending to the yoke of the little child who leads them out of many waters  that winter of temperance proved the fulcrum that had been wanting to the lever of improvement  schools of art concerts lectures choir preparation recreation occupation and interests of all sorts were vigorously devised by the two yollands and moreover the new dragons head and the genuine dragons head with sundry of their congeners died a natural death by inanition so that when the winter was over habits had been formed and a standard of respectability set up which has never entirely fallen and a spirit which has withstood the temptation of strikes  of course the world has much to do with the tone of many  what amount of true and real religion there may be can only be tested by trial and there are many who do not show any signs of being influenced by anything more than public opinion some who fall below that but as everyone knows the hydriot works have come to be not only noted for the beauty and excellence of their execution and the orderliness intelligence and sobriety of their artisans but for their large congregations ample offertories and numerous communicants  of course all this would never have kept up but for the yollands the hydriots are wife children everything to him who is now called vicar of st christophers mycening  he has refused better preferment for he has grown noted now since the work that harold had begun is still the task he feels his charge  and whatever is good is led by the manager of the works whose influence over the workmens minds has never failed  even when he talked to me on that day i thought there was a change in his tone he had never sneered at least in my hearing nor questioned other mens faith but when he told me of harold his manner had something of awe as well as of sorrow and admiration and i could not but think that a sense had dawned out that the spiritual was a reality and an absolute power over the material  the great simple nature that had gradually and truly undergone that influence had been watched and studied by him and had had its effect the supernatural had made itself felt and thenceforth he made it his study in a quiet unobtrusive manner scarcely known even to his brother but gradually resulting in heartwhole acceptance of faith and therewith in full devotion of heart and soul  did harold rejoice in that victory which to him would have been one of the dearest of all     chapter xvi  conclusion   i must finish my story though it seems hardly worth telling since my nephew my tower of strength and trust had suddenly sunk away from me in the prime of his manhood  the light seemed gone out of the whole world and my heart felt dull and dead as if i could never heed or care for anything again  even dermots illness did not seem capable of stirring me to active anxiety in this crushed stupid state with no one to speak to of what lay heavy on my heart no one even to write to for who would venture to read my letters nay i had not energy even to write to poor miss woolmer  we got into a way of going on day after day with doras little meals the backgammon and the mayne reid till sometimes it felt as if it had always been thus with us from all time and always would be and at others it would seem as if it were a dream and that if i could but wake i should be making tea for harold in our cheerful little drawingroom at mount eaton  at last i had almost a morbid dread of breaking up this monotonous life and having to think what to do or where to go  the randall horsmans must long for our departure and my own house was in a state of purification and uninhabitable  the doctor said that dora must be moved as soon as it could be managed for in that london attic she could have no impulse towards recovery and while it still seemed a fearful risk he sent us off to st clements a little village on the south coast where he knew of rooms in a great old manorhouse which had sunk to farmers use and had a master and mistress proof against infection  when i brought my tired wornout fretting charge in through the great draughty porch and was led up the old shallow oak stairs to a big panelled room clean and scantily furnished where the rats ran about behind the wainscot and a rainladen branch of monthly rose went tap tap against the window and a dog howled all night long i thought we had come to a miserable place at the end of the earth i thought so still the next morning when the mist lay in white rolls and curls round the house and the sea when we had a peep of it was as leadcoloured as the sky while the kind pity of the good wife for doras weak limbs and disfigured face irritated me so that i could hardly be civil  dora mended from that day devoted herself to the hideous little lambs that were brought in to be nursed by the fire ate and drank like a little cormorant and soon began to rush about after mr and mrs long whether in house or farmyard like a thing in its native element while they were enchanted with her colonial farm experience and could not make enough of little missy  i had a respite from mayne reid and could wander as far as i pleased alone on the shingle or sit and think as i had so often longed to do but the thoughts only resulted in a sense of dreariness and of almost indifference as to my fate since the one person in all the world who had needed me was gone and i had heard nothing whatever of dermot tracy  he might be gone out to his mother and sister or back to ireland  our paths would never come together again for he thought i did not care for him  nay was i even sure of his recovery  his constitution had been much tried  he was in a strange place among mere professional nurses  who could tell how it had been with him  everything went from me that had loved me  even dora was to leave me as soon as people ceased to be afraid of her  letters had found out the married pair on their return from the cataracts of the nile  eustace had immediately been vaccinated fourteen times but he was shocked and appalled and the spirit of his letter was            o while my brother with me stayed           would i had loved him more  and i forgave him much  hippolyta likewise wrote with feeling but it rather stung me to be thanked for my care of her poor little sister as if dora were not my child before she was hers  as soon as it was considered safe dora was to be returned to horsman keeping and as the randall party declined to receive her again philippa would convey her to a school at badenbaden  and dora declared she was glad  there was none of the angry resistance with which she had left me in the spring when i had done nothing for her compared with what i had gone through for her now but i believe i was dull company and showed myself displeased at her hardness and wild outbreaks of spirits and that the poor child longed to escape from all that reminded her of the unbearable sorrow at the bottom of her heart but it was a grievance to a grievancemaking temper such as i feel mine was  the most wholesome thing i received was a letter from prometesky to whom i had written the tidings that harold would never need his comfort more  the old man was where the personal loss was not felt and he knew more deeply than anyone the pain which that strong fervent heart suffered in its selfconquests so that he did not grieve for harold himself but he gave me that sympathy of entire appreciation of my loss which is far better than compassion  for himself he said his last link with the world was gone he found the peace and the expression of penitence his soul required in the course he was about to embrace and i might look on this as a voice from the grave  i should never hear of him more but i should know that as long as life was left him it would be spent in prayers for those whose souls he had wrecked in his overboiling youth  he ended with thanks to all of us who he said had sent him to his retreat with more kindly and charitable recollections than he should otherwise have carried thither  i never did hear of him again dermot went to the convent some years later and tried to ascertain if he lived but the monks do not know each others names and it failed  the village of st clements a small fishingplace was halfamile off through lanes a foot deep in mud and with a good old sleepy rector of the old school not remarkable for his performances in church  i was entering the little shop serving as the postoffice where i went every day in the unreasonable expectation of letters when i heard a voice that made me start did you say turn to the right  and there among the piles of cheeses stood a figure i knew full well though it had grown very thin and had a very red and mottled face at the top  we held out our hands to one another in silence and walked at once out of hearing  dermot said he was well and had been as kindly looked after as possible and now he had been let out as safe company but his family and friends would hardly believe it so he had come down to see whether he could share our quarantine  happily a few cottages of the better sort had accommodation for lodgers and one of themfor a considerationaccepted the gentlemans bill of health  he walked on by my side both of us feeling the blessing of having someone to speak to  he poor fellow had seen no being who had ever heard of harold except george yolland who came when he was too ill to talk and we went on with the conversation that had been broken off weeks before with such comfort as it could give us in such a loss as ours  he walked all the way back with me and i was frightened to see how tired he looked  i took him to mrs long for the refreshment she loved to give and begged for the pony for him to ride home on and a boy to fetch it back  it was wonderful how much more blue there was in the sea the next day how the evergreens glistened and how beautiful and picturesque the old house grew and when i went out in the morning sunshine for once inclined to admit some beauty in the staggering blacklegged and visaged lambs and meditating a walk to the village i saw dermot coming across the yard so wearily and breathlessly that i could only say how could you  he looked up piteously  you dont forbid me he said  i almost cried as i told him it was only his fatigue that i objected to and indeed he was glad enough to take doras now vacated place on the great sofa while we talked of viola  writing to her had been of course impossible for him and he had only had two short notes from her so meaningless that i thought she wrote them fearing to disturb him while he was ill but he muttered an ominous line from locksley hall vituperated piggy and confessed that his ground for doing so was that his mother reported viola as pleased with foreign life and happy with her cousins  i said it was his mothers way and he replied exactly so and a girl may be worried into anything  a slight dispute on that score cheered him a little for he showed himself greatly depressed  he was goingas soon as he had gathered a little strengthback to the duties he had promised to fulfil on his own property but he hated the thought was downhearted as to the chances of success and distrustful of himself among discouragements and the old associations he had made for himself  it is a different thing without alison to look to and keep one up he said  there are higher motives was my stupid speech  it is precious hard on a poor fellow to be left alone with his higher motives as you call them before he has well begun to act on his lower  and then i dont know how he began talking drearily almost as if i was not there of his having once begun to fancy he could do something creditable enough to make me some day look on him as i used to do in the good old times  my heart gave a great bound and remembering how harold said i discouraged him out came how do you know that i dont  how he sprang up  andno i cant tell what we said only we found it was no new beginning only taking up an old old precious threadsomething brought it all out  he had talked it all over with harold when he came back from florence and had taken home a little hope which he said had helped him through the solitary hours of his recovery  so it was harold who after all gave us to one another  outspoken dora informed us before the day was much older that the longs had asked whether that was her brother or my young man  so we took them into our confidence and even borrowed the trap for one of the roughest and the sweetest drives that ever we had through those splashing lanes dropping dermot at his lodgings to write his letters while the harvest moon made a path over the sea no longer leaden but full of silvery glittering light  there had something come back into the air which made us feel that life was worth living after all  next morning the good people who were much excited about our affairs sent the pony for him and he came in full force with that flattering irish tongue of his bent on persuading me that old lovers as we were with no more to find out about one another there was nothing to wait for  how could he go back by himself what a brogue he put on yet the tears were in his eyes to his great desolate castle with not a living man in it at all at all barring the banshee and a ghost or two and as i had nothing to do and nowhere to go why not be married then and there without more ado if i refused he should think it was all my pride and that i couldnt take that ornary object as he had overheard himself described that day  as if i did not love him the better for that marred complexion  his mother  his uncle  they had long ago repented of having come between us ten years ago and were ready to go down on their knees to any dacent young woman who would take him let alone a bit of an heiress who though not to compete with the sixtythousand pounder could provide something better than praties and buttermilk for herself at killy marey  i could not help thinking dear harold might have remembered killy mareys needs when he gave me that half of his means  and as to going back to mount eaton ghosts of past times would meet me there whose pain was then too recent to have turned into the treasure these recollections are to me  there would be just time dermot declared if he put up our banns the very next sunday to go through with it before the time pippa had appointed for receiving dora and it would save all the trouble of hunting up a surrogate and startling him with his lovely face  however he did startle the poor old parish clergyman effectually by calling on him to publish the banns of marriage between dermot edward st glear tracy and lucy percy alison both residing in this parish he evidently thought we were in hiding from someone who knew of some just cause or impediment but whereas we certainly did full justice to our ages twentyeight and twentysix he could only try to examine us individually very politely but betraying how uncomfortable he was  it was most amusing to see how his face cleared up when two days later he met us on the beach with a dignified old whitehaired gentleman though dermot declared that the imposing title mentioned on the introduction made him suspect us of having hired a benignant stage father for the occasion  the dear old uncle ery had actually come down to chaperone us and really act as much as possible as a father to me and as i had likewise sent for colman and a white silk dress the st clements minds were free to be pleasantly excited about us  lord erymanth had intended to have carried us off to be married from his castle but we begged off and when he saw dermot he allowed that it was not the time to make a public spectacle of what dermot was pleased to say would have the pleasing preeminence of being the ugliest of weddings both as to bridegroom and bridesmaid  for he and dora used to make daily fun of their respective beauties which were much on a par since though she had three weeks start of him the complaint having been unmitigated in her had left much more permanentlooking traces  those two chose to keep each other up to the most mirthful nonsensepitch and yet i am sure none of us felt so light of spirit as we must have appeared though perhaps the being on the edge of such a great shadow made the sunshine seem brighter  we had considered of beginning with a flying visit to see how poor viola really was but the italian letters prevented this  lady diana accepted me cordially and kindly as a daughter and said all that was proper but she actually forestalled us by desiring her son not to come out to her for she thought it much better for viola not to have painful recollections revived and viola herself wrote in a way that disappointed usloving indeed but with a strain of something between lightness and bitterness and absolutely congratulating her brother that there was no one on my side to bring up bygones against him  one half of her letter was a mere guidebook to the roman antiquities and was broken off short for some carnival gaiety  lord erymanth clearly liked his letters as little as we did  in the abstract in spite of the first cousinship i am afraid he would rather have given viola to pigou st glear than to harold alison but he had thought better of his niece than to think she could forget such a man so soon  however the day came  dora slept with me and that last night when i came to bed i found the true self had made a reassertion in one of those frightful fits of dumb hysteria  half the night colman and i were attending to her but still she never opened to me more than by clinging frantically round my neck in the intervals  she fell asleep at last and slept till we actually pulled her out of bed to be dressed for the wedding but we agreed that we could not expose our uncle who was to escort her to northchester station to being left alone with her in one of these attacks and as our programme had never been quite fixed we altered it so far as to pass through northchester and see her safe into baby horsmans hands  she was altogether herself by day gave no sign of emotion and was as merry as possible throughout the journey calling out to dermot airily from the platform that she should send him a present of sour krout from baden  poor child it was five years before we saw her again  we had scarcely had time to settle in at killy marey before lady diana implored us to meet her in london without explaining what was the matter  when we came to lord erymanths house we were met by viola very thin but with a bright red colour on her usually pale cheeks and a strange gleaming light in her eyes making them larger than ever and oh how she did talk  chatter chatter about all they had seen or done and all the absurdities of the people they had met mimicking them and making fun and all the time her mother became paler and graver looking as if she had grown ten years older it went on so all dinnertime  she talked instead of eating and all the evening those bright eyes of hers seemed to be keeping jealous watch that no one should exchange any words in private  nor could we till poor lady diana with a fagged miserable face came to my room at night and i called dermot in  and then she told us how the child had seemed to bear everything most beautifully and had never given way  i believe it was from that grain of perversity in violas highspirited nature as well as the having grown up without confidence towards her mother which forbade her to mourn visibly among unsympathising watchers and when her hope was gone led her in her dull despair to do as they pleased try to distract her thoughts let herself be hunted hither and thither and laugh at and play with pigou st glear quite enough to pass for an encouraging flirtation and to lead all around her to think their engagement immediately coming on the only thing she refused to do was to go to the farnese palace where was the statue to which there had more than once been comparisons made at last one day when they were going over the vatican galleries everyone was startled by a strange peal of laughter and before a frieze of the labours of hercules stood pigou looking pale and frightened and trying to get viola away as she stood pointing to the carrying home of the erymanthian boar and laughing in this wild forced way  they got her away at last but piggy told his father that he would have no more to do with her even if their uncle left her half his property though he never would tell what she had said to him  since that time she had gone on in this excited state apparently scarcely eating or sleeping talking incessantly not irrationally but altogether at random mockingly and in contradiction to everyone caring chiefly to do the very thing her mother did not wish never resting and apparently with untiring vigour though her cheeks and hands were burning and she was wasting away from day to day  lady diana really thought her mind was going and by this time would have given all she had in the world to have been able to call harold back to her  diana enderby tried reproofs for her flightiness but only made her worse with dermot she would only make ridiculous nonsense and utter those heartrending laughs and when i tried to soothe her and speak low and quietly she started away from me showed me her foreign purchases or sang snatches of comic songs  dermot went at last to consult the same doctor to whom half a year before he had taken harold and it was contrived that he should see and hear her at a dinnerparty without her knowledge  he consoled us very much by saying that her mind was not touched and that it was a fever on the nerves produced by the never having succumbed to the unhappiness and the shock which when he heard in what manner she had lost harold he considered quite adequate to produce such effects indeed he had been so much struck with harold himself that he was quite startled to hear of his death and seemed to think an excess of grief only his due  he bade us take her to her home give her no external excitement and leave her as much as possible to go her own way and let her feel herself unwatched and if we could find her some new yet calming engrossing occupation  we took the advice and poor lady diana besought us to remain with her for the present nor indeed could we have left her  our chief care was to hinder her oppressing her daughter with her anxiety for we found that viola was so jealous of being watched that she would hardly have tolerated us but that i had real business in packing up my properties at mount eaton  for the first week she took up her old occupations in the same violent and fitful way never sitting long to anything but rushing out to dash round the garden and taking long walks in all weathers rejecting companionship  from various causes chiefly lady dianas wretchedness and anxiety dermot and i had to wait a week before we could have the ponychaise and go together to harolds grave  the great massive irish granite cross was not ready then and there was only the long very long green mound at my mothers feet  there lay two wreaths on it  one was a poor thorn garlandfor his own hydriot children had we heard never left it untended all the winterthe other was of a great whiteflowered rhododendron that was peculiar to the arked garden  was it disloyal to harry that we thought more of viola than we did of him that first time we stood by his grave  it was an immense walk from arked to arghouse church over four miles even by the shortest way which lay through rough carttracks which we had avoided in coming but now felt we had better take  nearly half way home under a great old pollard ash we saw a little brown figure  it was viola crouched together with her head on her knees sitting on the bank  she started up and tried to say something petulantly joking about our always dogging her but she broke down in a flood of tears to which sheer weariness conduced she was tired out at last footsore and hardly able to move a limb when dermot almost lifted her into the carriage the dreadful hard selfcontrol all over now when in those long lanes with the maybushes meeting overhead she leant against me and sobbed with longpent anguish while her brother walked at the ponys head  she had quite broken down now and her natural self was come back to us  when we came home i got her up to her own room and dermot went to his mother  she had a long quiet sleep lying on her bed and when she woke it was growing dark on the may evening  she looked at me a little while without speaking and her eyes were soft again  lucy she said i think i have been very naughty but they made me so  i said as i kissed her that i thought they had done so  he would not have let anybody make him so she said  i was the bad one  i was almost unfaithful  i told him so today  not unfaithful dearest only harassed and miserable beyond all bearing  nothing is beyond bearing  i said so to myself over and over again that was why i would let no one see that i minded  you tried to bear it proudly all by yourself i said that was what made it so dreadful  he said it was gods will said poor viola but i knew it was mammas  i did what he told me lucy i did not get so wrong as long as he lived but after that i did not care what became of me and yet i did love him as much as ever  she seemed to look on me as his representative and was now ready to take any persuasion of mine as coming from him  she admitted her mother was gentle and natural with her ate and drank at her bidding and went to bed pale and worn down but not ill  she never gave in or professed indisposition but for more than ten days she went softly was very tired and equal to nothing but lying on the sofa and sitting in the garden and it was in those days that sometimes with her brother sometimes with me she went over all that we could tell her or she tell us of him who had been so dear to us all  the first time she was alone with dermot she kissed every remaining mark she could find in his face and said she had ached to do it every time she saw him  all those wells of deeper thought that had been so long choked by the stony hardness of a proudlyborne sorrow seemed suddenly to open when she gave herself up to the thought of harold  she even arrived at sorrow for the way she had treated her mother when he had given up his own hope rather than make her disobedient  she asked lady dianas pardon  she had never done so voluntarily in her whole life  she was met by tears and humility that softened and humiliated her in her sorrow more than aught else  her precious flowerpot was in her window with its fragrant verbena and i gave her the crystal cross again telling her where i had found it and she held it a moment and said some day it will be buried with me  but i must do something to feel as if i deserved it  you know it comes to me like a token out of the sea of glass like unto crystal where they stand that overcome  i think ill only wear it at night when i think i have done something or conquered a bit of my perverseness with mamma  a sudden idea came over me  mr benjamin yolland was in dire want of a lady as reference to a parish woman for his hydriots  i had begun but had been called away  miss woolmer had tried but was not well enough and there was no one else whom he thought capable  i was to stay at arked for six weeks more should i put viola in the way  it would be work for him  she caught at it  lady diana bridled a little as she thought of the two young men who managed the hydriots but the doctors prescription recurred to her mind and she consented  need i tell you how dear aunt violas soul and spirit have gone forth with those hydriot people how from going once a week to meet the parish woman at miss woolmers she soon came to presiding at the mothers meetings to knowing everybody and giving more and more of her time her thoughts her very self to them and being loved by them enormously  the spirit fun and enterprise that were in her fitted her as they began to revive for dealing with the lads who were sure to be devoted to anything so pretty and refined  when she began the whisper that she was the love of their hero gave them a romantic interest and though with the younger generation this is only a tradition yet our lady has won ground of her own and is still fair and sweet enough to be looked on by those youths as a sort of flower of the whole world yet their own peculiar property  for is she not a hydriot shareholder and does she not like to know that it was to harolds revival of those shares that she chiefly owes her present means  since her mothers death she has lived among them at the house that was old miss woolmers and is tranquilly happy in finding happiness for other people and always being ready when any one needs her as our dear old uncle does very often though i think her hydriot boys have the most of her  hippolyta made eustace a good wife and watched over him well but there was no preventing his deficiency from increasing it became acknowledged disease of the brain and he did not survive his cousin six years  happily none of his feebleness of intellect seems to have descended to eustace the third who is growing up a steady sensible lad under his mothers management and perhaps it is not the worse for arghouse to have become a horsman dependency  it was the year before eustaces death that the conductress of the school at baden wrote to mrs alison about dora  the sad state of her brother had prevented her coming home or being visited and though i exchanged letters with her periodically we had not sufficient knowledge of one another for any freedom of expression after she had conquered the difficulties of writing  when she was a little more than sixteen came a letter to tell that she was wasting away in either atrophy or consumption and that the doctors said the only hope for her was home and native air  poor child what home was there for her with her sisterinlaw absorbed in the care of her brother whose imbecility was no spectacle for one in a critical state of health and failing spirits  we were at arked at the time and offered to go and fetch her it was dermots kind thought leaving the children to violas care  poor dear what a sight she was  tall in proportion to the giant breed she came of but thin to the most painful degree and bending like a fishingrod or a plant brought up in the dark which bytheby she most resembled with her white face and thin yellow hair her complexion had recovered but her hair never had nor as it proved her health for she had been more or less ailing ever since she came and the regimen of the frugal germans had not supported the fastgrowing english girls frame any more than the strict and thoroughgoing round of accurate education had suited the untrained desultory intellect unused to method or application  nor did the company of the good plodding sentimental maedchens give any pleasure to the vehement creature whose playfellow from babyhood had been a manand such a man  use did no good but rather as the childish activity and power of play and the sense of novelty passed the growth of the womanly soul made the hearthunger and solitude worse and spirit and health came yearly to a lower level  she was too languid to be more than indifferent when she saw us and the first sign of warmth that she gave was her kiss when i went back to visit her after putting her to bed at the hotel  she looked up put her arms round my neck and said this is like the old days  we brought her by slow stages to london where hippolyta came up to see her for one day and was terribly shocked  the doctors were not hopeful but said she might go where she pleased and do what she liked and as her one wish was to be with us my dear husband laughed to scorn the notion that whatever had been dear to harold should not be his sacred charge and so we took her back  and there she did not die  she lay on the sofa day after day watched the children at play and listened dreamily to the family affairs rested and was petted by us both called it very comfortable and was patient but that whole winter seemed to remain where she was neither better nor worse  with the spring came a visit from george yolland a prosperous man as he well deserved to be and the foremost layman in all good works in the neighbourhood since dear old lord erymanth had been disabled  in the forenoons when i was teaching the children and dermot was busy he was generally in the drawingroom talking to dora whose blue eyes had a vivid silent intelligence like no one but harolds  from the first day he had confirmed my conviction that at any rate she was not dying now and she began to start into strength she sat up all the evening she walked round the garden she drove out she came down to breakfast  the day after that achievement she came to me sobbing for joy with something inaudible about his sake while george was assuring dermot that there was only one woman in the world for him  so on a bright summer day we gave her to the friend harold had gained on the same day as dermot and she went to be the happy mistress of mount eaton and reign there an abrupt woman not universally liked but intensely kind and true and much beloved by all who have cared to penetrate through her shell  there my work is done though i fear it is a weaker likeness of my young alcides than even the faded photograph by my side but i could not brook that you my children should grow up unknowing of the great character to whom your father and i owe one another and all besides that is best in our lives  there are things that must surprise you about your dear father  remember that he insisted on my putting them in and would not have them softened because he said you ought to have the portrait in full and that save at his own expense you could not know the full gratitude he feels to the man who made a new era in our lives  he says he is not afraid either of the example for you or that you will respect him less and i know you will not for you will only see his truth and generosity                                                    l p t   all that your mother has written is trueblessings on herevery word of it except that she never could and i hope none of you ever will understand the depth and blackness of the slough harold alison drew me out of by just being the man he was nor will she show youfor indeed she is blind to it herselfthat it was no other than she with her quiet upright sweetness and resolution that was the making of him and of both of us  very odd it is that a woman should set it all down in black and white and never perceive it was all her own doing  but if you see it young people what you have to do is to be thankful for the mother you have got and try to be worthy of her and if the drop of alison blood in you should make one of you even the tenth part of what harold was then youll be your fathers pride and much more than he deserves                                                d e st g t   thank you dear brother for having let me see this though i know lucy did not intend it for my eyes or she would not have been so hard on poor mamma  it shows me how naughty i must have been to let her get such a notion of our relations with one another but an outsider can never judge of such things  for the rest dear lucy has done her best and in many ways she did know him better than anybody else did and he looked up to her more than to anyone  but even she cannot reach to the inmost depth of the sweetness out of the strong nor fully know the wonderful power of tender strength that seemed to wrap ones mind round and bear one on with him and that has lasted me ever since and well it may for he was the very glory of my life                                                     v t   i am glad to have read it because it explains a great deal that i was too much of a child to understand but i dont like it  i dont mean for putting in the fatal thing i did in my ignorant folly  i knew that and she has softened my wilfulness  but theres too much flummery and he was a hundred times more than all that  i had rather recollect him for myself than have such a ladylike drawingroom picture but lucy means it well and it is just as he smoothed and combed himself down for her  nobody should have done it but george he would have made a man of him                                                     d y   as if george could have done it  a lady must always see a man somewhat as a carpet knight and ill would betide both if it were not so  but allowing for this and the want of more power to her elbow i am thankful to mrs tracy for this vivid recall of the man to whom i and all here owe an unspeakable debt  for my own part i can only say that from the day when i marvelled at his fortitude under the terrible pain of the lions bites to that when i saw the almost unexampled triumph of his will over the promptings of a disordered brain he stood before me the grandest specimen of manhood i ever met ever a victor and above all over himself                                                     g y
