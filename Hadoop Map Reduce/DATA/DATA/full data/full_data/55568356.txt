55568356	the wild man of the west by rm ballantyne    the action of this book takes place entirely in the foothills of the rocky mountains in north america  we can certainly appreciate the hardness of the life of the hunters in those days which were during the early part of the nineteenth century  the action is very well narrated and is very exciting and interesting  all sorts of things are suddenly pulled together in the very last few pages and it would be quite hard for the reader to guess what was going to happen before the last two chapters    the wild man of the west by rm ballantyne    chapter one  in which the reader is introduced to a mad hero a reckless lover and a runaway husbandbackwoods juvenile training describedthe principles of fighting fully discussed and some valuable hints thrown out  march marston was mad  the exact state of madness to which march had attained at the age when we take up his personal historynamely sixteenis uncertain for the people of the backwoods settlement in which he dwelt differed in their opinions on that point  the clergyman who was a wesleyan said he was as wild as a young buffalo bull but the manner in which he said so led his hearers to conclude that he did not think such a state of ungovernable madness to be a hopeless condition by any means  the doctor said he was as mad as a hatter but this was an indefinite remark worthy of a doctor who had never obtained a diploma and required explanation inasmuch as it was impossible to know how mad he considered a hatter to be  some of the trappers who came to the settlement for powder and lead said he was as mad as a grisly bear with a whoopingcougha remark which if true might tend to throw light on the diseases to which the grisly bear is liable but which failed to indicate to any one except perhaps trappers the extent of young marstons madness  the carpenter and the blacksmith of the placewho were fast friends and had a pitched battle only once a month or twice at mostagreed in saying that he was as mad as a wildcat  in short every one asserted stoutly that the boy was mad with the exception of the women of the settlement who thought him a fine bold handsome fellow and his own mother who thought him a paragon of perfection and who held the opinion privately that in the wide range of the habitable globe there was not another like himand she was not far wrong  now the whole and sole reason why march marston was thus deemed a madman was that he displayed an insane tendency at all times and in all manners to break his own neck or to make away with himself in some similarly violent and uncomfortable manner  there was not a fence in the whole countryside that march had not bolted over at full gallop or ridden crash through if he could not go over it there was not a tree within a circuit of four miles from the top of which he had not fallen  there was not a pond or pool in the neighbourhood into which he had not soused at some period of his stormy juvenile career and there was not a big boy whom he had not fought and thrashedor been thrashed byscores of times  but for all this march had not a single enemy  he did his companions many a kind turn never an unkind one  he fought for love not for hatred  he loved a dogif any one kicked it he fought him  he loved a little boyif any one was cruel to that little boy he fought him he loved fair playif any one was guilty of foul play he fought him when he was guilty of foul play himself as was sometimes the case for who is perfect he felt inclined to jump out of his own body and turn about and thrash himself  and he would have done so often had it been practicable  yes there is no doubt whatever about it march marston was madas mad after a fashion as any creature human or otherwise you choose to name  young marstons mother was a handsome stout blueeyed flaxenhaired woman of a little over thirtyfive summers  she was an english emigrant and had seventeen years before the time we write of settled at pine point on the banks of the yellowstone river along with her brother the blacksmith above referred to  at that time she was the sweetest maiden in all the village and now she was the handsomest matron  indeed the bloom of her youth remained on her cheeks so little impaired that she was often mistaken by strangers for march marstons elder sister  the men of the place called her pretty widow marston but she was not a widowat least they had as little ground for saying that she was as they had for asserting that her son was mad  mrs marston was peculiarly circumstanced but she was not a widow  the peculiar circumstances connected with her history are soon told immediately after the arrival of the blacksmith and his pretty sister at pine point settlement a tall stout young striplinga trapperabout a year older than herself fell deeply in love with mary westthat being mrs marstons maiden name  the young trappers case was desperate  he sank at once so deep into the profundities of love that no deepsea lead however ingeniously contrived could reach him  although just emerging from boyhood louis the trapper was already a tall strong handsome man and mary felt flattered by his attentions but when a month afterwards he boldly offered her his hand and fortune which latter consisted of a trappers costume and a western rifle she was taken aback and flatly refused him  louis was harebrained and passionate  he told her he would give her one day and a night to think of it  at the end of that time he came back and was again refused for mary west had no notion of being taken by storm in that fashion  but she trembled and grew pale on observing the storm of angry passion that gleamed from the young trappers eyes and caused his broad chest to heave violently  he did not speak  he did not even look at maryhad he done so years of sorrow and suffering might have been spared them both  he stood for one moment with his eyes fixed upon the groundthen he turned sprang through the doorway vaulted on his horse and went off from her cottage door as an arrow leaps from a bow  the fences and ditches that lay in his way were no impediment  his powerful steed carried him over all and into the forest beyond where he was quickly lost to view  mary tried to resume her household occupations with a sigh  she did not believe he was gone  but he was  at first mary was nettled then she grew sad as weeks passed away she became nettled again and at this juncture another suitor appeared in the shape of a young immigrant farmer whose good looks and insinuating address soothed her irritation at the strange abrupt conduct of her lover  she began to think that she must have been mistaken in supposing that she cared for the wild trapperand in order to prove the correctness of her supposition she married obadiah marston the farmer  alas poor mary discovered her error too late  marston turned out a profligate drunkard  at first he did not come out in his true colours a son was born and he insisted on calling him march for no other reason than that he was born in the month so named  mary was obliged to consent and at last came to congratulate herself that the child had been born in march and not in april or october or any other month equally unsuitable for a christian name  after the first year obadiah marston treated his wife badly then brutally and at last he received a sound drubbing from his brotherinlaw the blacksmith for having beaten poor mary with a stick  this brought things to a climax marston vowed he would forsake his wife and never set eyes on her again and he kept his vow  he embarked one day in a boat that was going down to the missouri with a cargo of furs and his poor wife never saw him again  thus was mary west forsaken first by her lover and then by her husband  it was long before she recovered from the blow but time gradually reconciled her to her lot and she devoted herself thenceforth to the training of her little boy  as years rolled on mrs marston recovered her spirits and her looks but although many a fine young fellow sought her heart and hand assuring her that she was a widowthat she must be a widow that no man in his senses could remain so long away from such a wife unless he were deadshe turned a deaf ear to them all  march marstons infancy was spent in yelling and kicking with the exception of those preternaturally calm periods when he was employed in eating and sleeping  as he grew older the kicking and yelling decreased the eating increased and the sleeping continued pretty much the same  then came a period when he began to learn his a b c  mrs marston had been well educated for her station in life  she had read much and had brought a number of books to the backwoods settlement so she gave her boy a pretty good educationas education went in those daysand certainly a much better one than was given to boys in such outoftheway regions  she taught him to read and write and carried him on in arithmetic as far as compound division where she stuck having reached the extreme limits of her own tether  contemporaneously with the cessation of squalling and kicking and the acquirement of the a b c there arose in little marchs bosom unutterable love for his mother or rather the love that had always dwelt there began to well up powerfully and to overflow in copious streams of obedience and considerate attention  about the same time the roving reckless madness as it was styled began to develop itself and strange to say mrs marston did not check that  she was a largeminded a liberalminded woman that semiwidow  she watched her son closely but very few of his deeds were regarded by her in the light of faults  tumbling off trees was not  falling into ditches and horse ponds was not  fighting was to some extent and on this point alone did mother and son seem to entertain any difference of opinion if we may style that difference of opinion where the son fell into silent and extreme perplexity after a short and on his part humble discussion on the subject  why mother said march in surprise having attained the mature age of eight when he said it if a grisly bear was to tack me youd let me defend myself wouldnt you  mrs marston smiled to see the rotund little object of twofeetten standing before the fire with its legs apart and its arms crossed putting such a question and replied  certainly my boy  and when tom blake offered to hit susy jefferson wasnt i right to fight him for that  yes my boy i think it right to fight in defence of the weak and helpless  the object of twofeetten began to swell and his eyes to brighten at the unexpected success of this catechising of its mother and went on to say  well mother why do you blame me for fightin then if its right  because fighting is not always right my boy  you had a fight with bill summers hadnt you yesterday  yes mother  twofeetten said this in a hesitating tone and shrank into its ordinary proportions as it continued  but i didnt lick him mother he licked me  but ill try again motherindeed i will and ill be sure to lick him next time  i dont want you to try again rejoined mrs marston and you must not try again without a good reason  why did you fight him yesterday  because he told a lie said the object promptly swelling out again and looking big under the impression that the goodness of its reason could not be questioned  it was therefore with a look of baffled surprise that it collapsed again on being told that that was not a sufficient reason for engaging in warfare and that it was wrong to take the law into its own hands or to put in its word or its little fist where it had no right to interfereand a great deal more to that effect  but march my boy said mrs marston drawing the object towards her and patting its round little fair head what makes you so fond of fighting  i aint fond o fighting mother but i cant help it  cant help it  do you ever try  iino i dont think that i do  but i feel so funny when i see bill summers cheatin at play  i feel all over redhotlikeoh youve seen the big pot boilin over  well i just feel like that  an wen it boils over you know mother it must be took off the fire else it kicks up sich a row  but theres nobody to take me off the fire when im boilin over an theres no fire to take me offso you see i cant help it  can i  as the object concluded these precociously philosophical remarks it looked up in its mothers face with an earnest inquiring gaze  the mother looked down at it with an equally earnest lookthough there was a twinkle in each eye and a small dimple in each cheek that indicated a struggle with gravityand said  i could stop the big pot from boilingover without taking it off the fire  how inquired twofeetten eagerly  by letting it boil over till it put the fire out  the object opened its eyes very wide and pursed its mouth very tight then it relaxed grinned a little with an air of uncertainty and was about to laugh but checked itself and with a look of perplexity said  eh  ay my boy resumed the mother just you try the boilingover plan next time  when you feel inclined to fight and know or think that you shouldnt just stand quite still and look hard at the ground mind dont look at the boy you want to fight with but at the ground and begin to count one two three four and so on and im quite sure that when youve counted fifty the fire will be out  now will you try my son  mother replied twofeetten earnestly and becoming at least two feet eleven while he spoke ill try  this ended the conversation at that time and we beg leave to apologise to our reader for having given it in such full detail but we think it necessary to the forming of a just appreciation of our hero and his mother as it shows one phase of their characters better than could have been accomplished by a laboured description  before march marston had attained to the age of sixteen he had read aloud to his mothernot once but several timesthe vicar of wakefield robinson crusoe the pilgrims progress and tales of a grandfather aesops fables and a variety of tales and stories and histories of lesser noteall of which he stored up in a good memory and gave forth in piecemeal to his unlettered companions as opportunity offered  better than all this he had many and many a time read his bible through and was familiar with all its leading heroes and histories and anecdotes  thus it will be seen that march marston was quite a learned youth for a backwoodsman besides being a hero and a madman    chapter two  the great prairiea wild chasea remarkable accident and an extraordinary charger all of which terminate in a crashbounce talks philosophy and tells of terrible thingsour hero determines to beard the wild man of the west in his own den  the rising sun lifted his head above the horizon of the great western prairie gilding the upper edges of those swelling undulations that bear so strong a resemblance to solidified billows as to have acquired the name of prairie waves  on the sunny side of these waves the flowerets of the plains were already basking in full enjoyment of the new day on the summits only the tips of their petals were turned to gold  on the other side of those waves and down in the hollows everything was clothed in deep shadow as if the still undissipated shades of night were lingering there unwilling or unable to depart from so beautiful a scene  this mingling of strong lights and deep shadows had the effect of rendering more apparent the tremendous magnitude of those vast solitudes  there were no trees within the circuit of vision but there were a few scattered bushes so low and insignificant in appearance as to be quite unobvious to the eye except when close to the feet of the spectator near to a clump of these bushes there stood two horses motionless as if chiselled in stone and with their heads drooping low as if sound asleep  directly under the noses of these horses lay two men each wrapped in a blanket with his head pillowed on his saddle and his rifle close at his side  both were also sound asleep  about a mile distant from the spot on which those sleepers rested there grew another small bush and under its sheltering boughs in the snuggest conceivable hole nestled a grouse or prairie hen also sound asleep with its head lost in feathers and its whole rotund aspect conveying the idea of extreme comfort and good living  now we do not draw the readers attention to that bird because of its rarity but because of the fact that it was unwittingly instrumental in influencing the fortunes of the two sleepers above referred to  the sun in his upward march overtopped a prairie wave and his rays darting onward struck the bosom of the prairie hen and awoke it looking up quickly with one eye it seemed to find the glare too strong winked at the sun and turned the other eye  with this it winked also then got up flapped its wings ruffled its feathers and after a pause sprang into the air with that violent whirrr which is so gladdening yet so startling to the ear of a sportsman  it was instantly joined by the other members of the covey to which it belonged and the united flock went sweeping past the sleeping hunters causing their horses to awake with a snort and themselves to spring to their feet with the alacrity of men who were accustomed to repose in the midst of alarms and with a grunt of surprise  prairiehens muttered the elder of the twoa big burly backwoodsmanas he turned towards his companion with a quiet smile it was very thoughtful on em to rouse us lad considerin the work that lies before us  i wish with all my heart they didnt rise quite so early replied the younger man also a stout backwoodsman who was none other than our hero march marston himself i dont approve of risin until one wakes in the course of nature dye see bounce  i hear but we cant always git things to go xactly as we approves of replied bounce stooping down to arrange the embers of the previous nights fire  bounces proper name was bob ounce  he styled himself and wrote himself for he could write to the extent of scrawling his own name in angularly irregular large text b ounce  his comrades called him bounce  you see march continued bounce in a quiet way thrusting his rugged countenance close to the embers occasionally and blowing up the spark which he had kindled by means of flint steel and tinderyou see this is a curous wurld it takes a feelosopher to onderstand it crectly and even he dont make much ot at the best  but ive always noticed that wen the time for wakin ups come weve got to wake up whether we like it or no dye see lad  id see better if you didnt blow the ashes into my eyes in that way answered march laughing at the depth of his companions philosophical remark  but i say old chap march had no occasion to call him old chap for bounce was barely forty what if we dont fall in with a herd  then we shall have to go home without meat thats all replied bounce filling and lighting his pipe  but i promised my mother a buffalohump in less than three days and the first day and night are gone  youd no right to promise your mother a hump returned the plainspoken and matteroffact hunter  nobody shud never go to promise wot they cant perform  ive lived off an on nigh forty years now and ive obsarved them wot promises most always does least so if youll take the advice of an oldish hunter youll give it up lad at once  humph ejaculated march i suppose you began your obsarvations before you were a year oldeh bounce  i began em afore i was a day old  the first thing i did in this life was to utter an orrible roar and i obsarved that immediately i got a drink so i roared agin an got another  leastwise ive bin told that i did an if it wasnt obsarvation as caused me for to roar wen i wanted a drink wot wos it  instead of replying march started up and shading his eyes with his right hand gazed intently towards the horizon  wot now lad said bounce rising quickly  ha buffaloes  in half a minute the cords by which the two horses were fastened to pegs driven into the plain were coiled up in another halfminute the saddlegirths were buckled in half a second more the men were mounted and tearing over the prairie like the wind  ha lad remarked bounce with one of his quiet smilesfor he was a preeminently quiet manbut for them there prairiehens wed ha slept this chance away  the buffaloes or more correctly speaking the bisons which young marstons sharp eye had discovered were still so fardistant that they appeared like crows or little black specks against the sky  in order to approach them as near as possible without attracting their attention it was necessary that the two horsemen should make a wide circuit so as to get well to leeward lest the wind should carry the scent of them to the herd  their horses being fleet strong and fresh soon carried them to the proper direction when they wheeled to the right and galloped straight down upon their quarry without any further attempt at concealment  the formation of the ground favoured their approach so that they were within a mile of the herd before being discovered  at first the huge hairy creatures gazed at the hunters in stupid surprise then they turned and fled  they appeared at the outset to run slowly and with difficulty and the plain seemed to thunder with their heavy tread for there could not have been fewer than a thousand animals in the herd  but as the horsemen drew near they increased their speed and put the steeds fleet and strong though they were to their mettle  on approaching the buffaloes the horsemen separated each fixing his attention on a particularly fat young cow and pressing towards it bounce was successful in coming up with the one he had selected and put a ball through its heart at the first shot  not so marston  misfortune awaited him  having come close up with the animal he meant to shoot he cocked his rifle and held it in readiness across the pommel of his saddle at the same time urging his horse nearer in order to make a sure shot  when the horse had run up so close that its head was in line with the buffalos flank he pointed his rifle at its shoulder  at that precise moment the horse whose attention was entirely engrossed with the buffalo put its left forefoot into a badgers hole  the consequence of such an accident is usually a tremendous flight through the air on the part of the rider while his steed rolls upon the plain but on the present occasion a still more surprising result followed march marston not only performed the aerial flight but he alighted with considerable violence on the back of the affrighted buffalo  falling on his face in a sprawling manner he chanced to grasp the hairy mane of the creature with both hands and with a violent halfinvoluntary effort succeeded in seating himself astride its back  the whole thing was done so instantaneously that he had scarce time to realise what had happened to him ere he felt himself sweeping comfortably over the prairie on this novel and hitherto unridden steed a spirit of wild ungovernable glee instantly arose within him  seizing the handle of the heavy huntingwhip which still hung from his right wrist by a leather thong he flourished it in the air and brought it down on his chargers flank with a crack like a pistolshot causing the animal to wriggle its tail toss its ponderous head and kick up its heels in a way that wellnigh unseated him  the moment bounce beheld this curious apparition he uttered a short laugh or grunt and turning his horse abruptly soon ranged up alongside  hallo march he exclaimed are you mad boy  just about it cried marston giving the buffalo another cut with the whip as he looked round with sparkling eyes and a broad grin at the hunter  come now that wont do said bounce gravely  im sponsible to your mother for you  git off now or ill poke ye over  git off shouted the youth how can i  well keep your right leg a bit to one side an ill stop yer horse for ye said bounce coolly cocking his rifle  hold hard old fellow cried marston in some alarm youll smash my thighbone if you try  stay ill do the thing myself  saying this marston drew his long huntingknife and plunged it into the buffalos side  lower down ladlower down  ye cant reach the life there  march bent forward and plunged his knife into the animals side again up to the hilt but it still kept on its headlong course although the blood flowed in streams upon the plain  the remainder of the buffaloes had diverged right and left leaving this singular group alone  mind your eye said bounce quickly shes agoin to fall  unfortunately marston had not time given him to mind either his eye or his neck  the wounded buffalo stumbled and fell to the ground with a sudden and heavy plunge sending its wild rider once again on an aerial journey which terminated in his coming down on the plain so violently that he was rendered insensible  on recovering consciousness he found himself lying on his back in what seemed to be a beautiful forest through which a stream flowed with a gentle silvery sound  the bank opposite rose considerably higher than the spot on which he lay and he could observe through his halfclosed eyelids that its green slope was gemmed with beautiful flowers and gilded with patches of sunlight that struggled through the branches overhead  young marstons first impression was that he must be dreaming and that he had got into one of the fairytale regions about which he had so often read to his mother  a shadow seemed to pass over his eyes as he thought this and looking up he beheld the rugged face of bounce gazing at him with an expression of considerable interest and anxiety  i say bounce this is jolly  is it replied the hunter with a humph  if ye try to lift yer head i guess youll change yer opinion  marston did try to raise his head and did change his opinion  his neck felt as if it were a complication of iron hinges which had become exceedingly rusty and stood much in need of oil  oh dear groaned marston letting his head fall back on the saddle from which he had raised it  ah i thought so remarked bounce  and is that all the sympathy you have got to give me you old savage said the youth testily  by no means replied the other patting his head heres a drop o water asll do ye good lad and after youve drunk it ill rub ye down  thankee for the water said marston with a deep sigh as he lay back after drinking with difficulty as to the rubbin down ill ask for that when i want it  but tell me bounce what has happened to meoh i remember nowthe buffalo cow and that famous gallop  ha ha ha hoo  marstons laugh terminated in an abrupt groan as the rusty hinges again clamoured for oil  youll have to keep quiet boy for a few hours and take a sleep if you can  ill roast a bit o meat and rub ye down with fat after youve eat as much of it as ye can  theres nothing like beef for a sick mans inside an fat for his outsidethats the feelosophy o the whole matter  youve amost bin busted wi that there fall but youll be alright tomorrow  an youve killed yer buffalo lad so yer mother ll get the hump after all  only keep yer mind easy an i guess human nature ll do the rest  having delivered himself of these sentiments in a quietly oracular manner bounce again patted march on the head as if he had been a large baby or a favourite dog and rising up proceeded to kindle a small fire and to light his pipe  bounce smoked a tomahawk which is a small iron hatchet used by most of the indians of north america as a battleaxe  there is an iron pipe bowl on the top of the weapon and the handle which is hollow answers the purpose of a pipe stem  the hunter continued to smoke and marston continued to gaze at him till he fell asleep  when he awoke bounce was still smoking his tomahawk in the selfsame attitude  the youth might have concluded that he had been asleep only a few minutes and that his friend had never moved but he was of an observant nature and noticed that there was a savoury wellcooked buffalosteak near the fire and that a strong odour of marrowbones tickled his nostrilsalso that the sun no longer rested on the green bank opposite  hence he concluded that he must have slept a considerable time and that the tomahawk had been filled and emptied more than once  well lad said bounce looking round had a comfrable nap  how did you know i was awake said march  you werent looking at me and i didnt move  praps not lad but you winked  and pray how did you know that  cause ye couldnt wink if ye wos asleep an i heerd ye breathe diffrent from afore so i knowd ye wos awake an i knows that a man always winks wen he comes awake dye see  thats wot i calls the feelosophy of obsarvation  very good replied marston and that bein the case i should like much to try a little of the feelosophy of supper  right lad here you are theres nothin like it rejoined bounce handing a pewter plate of juicy steak and marrowbones to his young companion  marston attained a sitting posture with much difficulty and pain but when he had eaten the steak and the marrowbones he felt much better and when he had swallowed a cup of hot tea for they carried a small quantity of tea and sugar with them by way of luxury he felt immensely better and when he finally lay down for the night he felt perfectly wellalways excepting a sensation of general batteredness about the back and a feeling of rustyhingeswantingoiliness in the region of the neck  now bounce said he as he lay down and pulled his blanket over his shoulder are the horses hobbled and the rifles loaded and my mothers hump out o the way of wolves  all right lad  then bounce you go ahead and tell me a story till im off asleep dont stop tellin till im safe off  pull my nose to make sure and if i dont say hallo to that im all rightin the land of nod  march marston smiled as he said this and bounce grinned by way of reply  wotll i tell ye about boy  i dont mind whatindians grislies buffaloes trappersits all one to me only begin quick and go ahead strong  well i aint great at storytellin  praps it would be more to the pint if i was to tell ye about what i heerd tell of on my last trip to the mountains  did i ever tell ye about the feller as the trappers that goes to the far north calls the wild man o the west  no what was he said marston yawning and closing his eyes  i dun know xactly wot he was  im not overly sure that i even know wot he is but i know wot the trappers says of him an if only the half ots true hes a shiner he is  having said this much bounce filled his tomahawk lighted it puffed a large cloud from it and looked through the smoke at his companion  march whose curiosity was aroused partly by the novelty of the wild mans title and partly by the lugubrious solemnity of bounce said  go on old boy  ha its easy to say go on but if you knowd the orrible things as is said about the wild man o the mountains praps youd say go off  it ll make yer blood froze  never mind  an yer hair git up on end  dont care  an yer two eyes start out o yer head  all right  bounce who was deeply superstitious looked at his young friend with severe gravity for at least two minutes  marston who was not quite so superstitious looked at his comrade for exactly the same length of time and winked with one eye at the end of it  they says resumed bounce in a deep tone the wild man o the west eats men  dont he eat women inquired march sleepily  yes an childers too  an wots wuss he eats em raw an they say he once swallered onea little onealive without chewin or chokin horrible murmured march hes a dead shot too he carries a doublebarrelled rifle twenty foot long that takes a small cannonball i forgot to tell ye hes a giantsome o the trappers calls him the giant o the hills and they say hes bout thirty feet highsome says forty  but theres no gittin at the truth in this here wurld  bounce paused here but as his companion made no observation he went on in a halfsoliloquising fashion looking earnestly all the time into the heart of the fire as if he were addressing his remarks to a salamander  ay hes a crack shot as i wos sayin  one day he fell in with a grisly bar an the brute rushed at him so he up rifle an puts a ball up each nosei didnt know a grisly had two noses murmured marchan loaded agin an afore it comed up he put a ball in each eye then he drew his knife an split it right down the middle from nose to tail at one stroke an cut it across with another stroke an puttin one quarter on his head he took another quarter under each arm an the fourth quarter in his mouth and so walked home to his cave in the mountainsbout one hundred and fifty miles off where he roasted an ate the whole bar at one sittinbones hair an all  this flight was too strong for march  he burst into a fit of laughter which called the rusty hinges into violent action and produced a groan the laugh and the groan together banished drowsiness so he turned on his back and said  bounce do you really believe all that  thus pointedly questioned on what he felt to be a delicate point bounce drew a great number of whiffs from the tomahawk ere he ventured to reply  at length he said  well to say truth an takin a feelosophical view o the pinti dont  but i blieve some of it  i do blieve theres some xtraordnary critter in them there mountainsfor ive lived nigh forty years off and on in these parts an ive always obsarved that in this wurld wenever ye find anythin yeve always got somethin  nobody never got hold o somethin an found afterwards that it wos nothin so i blieve theres somethin in this wild manhow much i dun know  bounce followed up this remark with a minute account of the reputed deeds of this mysterious creature all of which were more or less marvellous and at length succeeded in interesting his young companion so deeply as to fill him with a good deal of his own belief in at least a wild something that dwelt in the heart of the rocky mountains  after a great deal of talk and prolonged discussion bounce concluded with the assertion that hed give his best rifle an that was his only one to see this wild man  to which marston replied  ill tell you what it is bounce i will see this wild man if its in the power of bones and muscles to carry me within eyeshot of him now see if i dont  bounce nodded his head and looked sagacious as he said  dye know lad i dont mind if i go along with ye  its true im not tired of them parts hereaboutsand if i wos to live till i couldnt see i dont think as ever id git tired o the spot where my father larned me to shoot an my mother dandled me on her knee but ive got a fancy to see a little more o the wurldspecially the faroff parts o the rocky mountains were ive never bin yit so i do blieve if ye wos to try an persuade me very hard id consent to go along with ye  will you though cried march eagerly again to his cost forgetting the rusty hinges  ay that will i boy replied the hunter an now i think on it theres four as jolly trappers in pine point settlement at this here moment as ever floored a grisly or fought an injun  theyre the real sort of metal  none o yer tearin swearin murderin chaps as thinks the more they curse the bolder they are an the more injuns they kill the cliverer they are but steady quiet fellers as dont speak much but does a powerful quantity boys that know a deer from a blackfoot injun i guess that goes to the mountains to trap and comes back to sell their skins an wen theyve sold em goes right off agin an niver drinks  i know who you mean i think at least i know one of them observed march  no ye dont do ye  who  waller the yankee  thats one said bounce nodding big waller we calls him  im not sure that i can guess the others  surely tim slater isnt one  no said bounce with an emphasis of tone and a peculiar twist of the point of his nose that went far to stamp the individual named with a character the reverse of noble  try agin  i cant guess  ones a french canadian said bounce a little chap with a red nose an a pair o coalblack eyes but as bold as a lion  i know him interrupted march gibault noirblack gibault as they sometimes call him  am i right  right lad thats two  then theres hawkswing the injun whose wife and family were all murdered by a man of his own tribe and who left his people after that an tuck to trappin with the whites thats three an theres redhand the old trapper thats

what his right name is  nobody knows that lad  you know as well as i do that he wos called redhand by the injuns in consekence o the lot o grislies hes killed in his day but nobody never could git at his real name  praps its not worth gittin at  now them four ll be startin in a week or two for the mountains an wots to hinder us ajinin of them  to his own question bounce after a pause replied with deliberate emphasis nothin wotsomdiver and his young companion heartily echoed the sentiment  exactly thirtysix hours after the satisfactory formation of the above resolution march marston galloped furiously towards the door of his mothers cottage reined up leaped to the ground seized the buffalohump that hung at his saddlebow and entered with a good deal of that impetuosity that had gone far to procure for him the title of madman  flinging the bloody mass of meat on the floor he sat down on a chair and said  there mother  well you are a clever fellow said mrs marston drying her hands for she had been washing dishes and giving her son a hearty kiss on the forehead  clever or not clever mother im off to the rocky mountains in two days  mrs marston was neither dismayed nor surprised  she was used to that sort of thing and didnt mind it  what to do there my boy  to see the wild man o the west  the what  the wild man o the west mother  it is needless to try our readers patience with the long conversation that followed  march had resolved to preach a discourse with the wild man o the west for his text and he preached so eloquently that his mother who was by no means a timid woman at length not only agreed to let him go but commended him for his resolution  the only restraint she laid upon her son had reference to his behaviour towards the wild man if he should happen to meet with him  you may look at him march mrs marston spoke of him as if he were a caged wild beast and you may speak to him but you must not fight with him except in selfdefence  if he lets you alone you must let him alone  promise me that boy  i promise mother  not long after this promise was made a light bark canoe was launched upon the river and into it stepped our hero with his friend bounce and big waller black gibault hawkswing and redhand the trappers  a cheer rang from the end of the little wharf at pine point as the frail craft shot out into the stream  the wild woods echoed back the cheer which mingled with the lusty answering shout of the trappers as they waved their caps to the friends they left behind them  then dipping their paddles with strong rapid strokes they headed the canoe towards the rocky mountains and soon disappeared up one of those numerous tributary streams that constitute the head waters of the missouri river    chapter three  the beauties of the wildernessportagesphilosophy of settling down an enormous footprintsupper procured and a bearhunt in prospect  after paddling and hauling and lifting and tearing and wading and toiling and struggling for three weeks our hero and his friends found themselves deep in the heart of the unknown wildernessunknown at least to the civilised world though not altogether unknown to the trappers and the red indians of the far west  there is something inexpressibly romantic and captivating in the idea of traversing those wild regions of this beautiful world of ours which have never been visited by human beings with the exception of a few wandering savages who dwell therein  so thought and felt young marston one splendid afternoon as he toiled up to the summit of a grassy mound with a heavy pack on his shoulders throwing down the pack he seated himself upon it wiped his heated brow with the sleeve of his huntingshirt and gazed with delight upon the noble landscape that lay spread out before him  ha thats the sort o thingthats ithe exclaimed nodding his head as if the rich and picturesque arrangement of wood and water had been got up expressly for his benefit and he were pleased to signify his entire approval of it  thats just it he continued after a short contemplative pause just what i expected to find  aint i glad eh  march certainly looked as if he was but being at that moment alone no one replied to his question or shared his enjoyment  after another pause he resumed his audible meditations  now did ever any one see sich a place as this in all the wide arth thats what i want to know  never  just look at it now  theres miles an miles o woods an plains an lakes an rivers wherever i choose to lookall round me  and there are deer too lots of em lookin quite tame and no wonder for i suppose the fut of man never rested here before except maybe the fut of a redskin now an again  and theres poplars an oaks an willows as thick as they can grow  march might have added that there were also elm and sycamore and ash and hickory and walnut and cottonwood trees in abundance with numerous aspen groves in the midst of which were lakelets margined with reeds and harebells and red willows and wild roses and chokeberries and prickly pears and red and white currants  he might we say have added all this and a great deal more with perfect truth but he didnt for his knowledge of the names of such things was limited so he confined himself like a wise youth to the enumeration of those things that he happened to be acquainted with  and continued march starting up and addressing his remark to a hollow in the ground a few yards off theres grisly bars here too for theres the futmark of one as sure as im a white man  most people would have been inclined to differ with march in regard to his being a white man for he was as brown as constant exposure in hot weather could make him but he referred to his blood rather than to his skin which was that of white parents  the footprint which he had discovered was indeed that of a grisly bear and he examined it with more than usual interest for although many of those ferocious denizens of the western woods had been already seen and a few shot by the trappers on their voyage to this point none had been seen so large as the monster whose footprint now attracted marstons attention  the print was eleven inches long exclusive of the claws and seven inches broad  while march was busily engaged in examining it black gibault came panting up the hill with a huge pack on his back  ho  march me garcon vat you be find la cried the canadian throwing down his pack and advancing  a bar gibault caleb himself a regular big un too  just look here  ah oui vraiment dat am be one extinishin vopper sure nuff  mais hims gone pass long ago so you better come avay an finish de portage  not i lad cried march gaily as he flung himself upon the grassy mound im goin to admire this splendid country till im tired of it and leave you and the other fellows to do the work  oh ver goot cried gibault sitting down beside our hero and proceeding to fill his pipe i will mire de countray too  ha it be unmarkibly beautifulspecially when beholded troo one cloud of tabacca smoke  alas  gibault well have to move off sooner than we expected for there it comes  the two friends leaped up simultaneously and seizing their packs hurried down the mound entered the thick bushes and vanished  the object whose sudden appearance had occasioned this abrupt departure would in truth have been somewhat singular not to say alarming in aspect to those who did not know its nature  at a distance it looked like one of those horrible antediluvian monsters one reads of with a lank body about thirty feet long  it was reddishyellow in colour and came on at a slow crawling pace its back appearing occasionally above the underwood  presently its outline became more defined and it turned out to be a canoe instead of an antediluvian monster with big waller and bounce acting the part of legs to it  old redhand the trapper and hawkswing the indian walked alongside ready to relieve their comrades when they should grow tiredfor a large canoe is a heavy load for two menor to assist them in unusually bad places or to support them and prevent accidents should they chance to stumble  have a care now lad at the last step said redhand who walked a little in advance  yer help would be better than yer advice old feller replied bounce as he stepped upon the ridge or mound which marston and his companion had just quitted  lend a hand well take a spell here  i do believe my shoulders out o joint  there gentlythats it  wall i guess this is eden cried big waller gazing around him with unfeigned delight  leastwise if it aint it must be the very nixt location to them there diggins of old father adam  aint it splendiferous  big waller was an outandout yankee trapper  it is a mistake to suppose that all yankees guess and calculate and talk through their nose  there are many who dont as well as many who do but certain it is that big waller possessed all of these peculiarities in an alarming degree  moreover he was characteristically thin and tall and sallow nevertheless he was a hearty goodnatured fellow not given to boasting so much as most of his class but much more given to the performance of daring deeds  in addition to his other qualities the stout yankee had a loud thundering melodious voice which he was fond of using and tremendous activity of body which he was fond of exhibiting  he was quite a contrast in all respects to his indian companion hawkswing who although about as tall was not nearly so massive or powerful  like most north american indians he was grave and taciturn in disposition in other respects there was nothing striking about him he was clad like his comrades in a trappers huntingshirt and leggings but he scorned to use a cap of any kind conceiving that his thick straight black hair was a sufficient covering as undoubtedly it was  he was as courageous as most men a fair average shot and when occasion required as lithe and agile as a panther but he was not a herofew savages are  he possessed one good quality however beyond his kinsmenhe preferred mercy to revenge and did not gloat over the idea of tearing the scalps off his enemies and fringing his coat and leggings therewith  tis a sweet spot said redhand to his comrades who stood or reclined in various attitudes around him  such a place as ive often thought of casting anchor in for life  an why dont ye then inquired waller  if i was thinkin o locating down anywhar i guess id jine ye old man  but im too fond o rovin for that yet  i calclate itll be some years afore i come to that pint  why dont ye build a log hut and enjoy yerself  cause ive not just come to that point either replied the old man with a smile  redhand had passed his best days many years before  his form was spare and his silvery locks were thin but his figure was still tall and straight as a poplar and the fire of youth still lingered in his darkblue eye  the most striking and attractive point about redhand was the extreme kindliness that beamed in his countenance  a long life in the wilderness had wrinkled it but every wrinkle tended somehow to bring out the great characteristic of the man  even his frown had something kindly in it  the prevailing aspect was that of calm serenity  redhand spoke little but he was an attentive listener and although he never laughed loudly he laughed often and heartily in his own way at the sallies of his younger comrades  in youth he must have been a strikingly handsome man  even in old age he was a strong one  ill tell ye whats my opinion now boys in regard to settlin down said bounce who having filled and lighted his pipe now found himself in a position to state his views comfortably  ye see settlin down may in a ginral way be said to be nonsense  in pint o fact there aint no sich a thing as settlin down  when a feller sits down why in a short bit hes bound to rise up agin and when he goes to bed he means for to get up next mornin  here bounce paused drew several whiffs and rammed down the tobacco in his pipe with the end of his little finger then when a feller locates in a place hes sure for to be movin about more or less as long as hes got a leg to stand on now what i say is that when a man comes to talk o settlin down hes losin heart for a wanderin life among all the beautiful things o creation an when a man loses heart for the beautiful things o creation hell soon settle down for good and all  hes in a bad way he is and oughtnt to encourage hisself in sich feelins  i blieve that to be the feelosophy o the whole affair and i dont blieve that nobody o common edicationi dont mean school edication but backwoods edicationwould go for to think otherwise  wot say you waller  sartinly not replied the individual thus appealed to  big waller had a deep reverence for the supposed wisdom of his friend bounce  he listened to his lucubrations with earnest attention at all times and when he understood them usually assented to all his friend said  when bounce became too profound for him as was not infrequently the case he contented himself with nodding his head as though to say im with you in heart lad though not quite clear in my mind but its all right im quite sartin  well then resumed bounce turning to redhand what do you think o them sentiments old man  redhand who had been paying no attention whatever to these sentiments but during the delivery of them had been gazing wistfully out upon the wide expanse of country before him laid his hand on bounces shoulder and said in a low earnest tone  its a grand country  dye see the little clear spot yonder on the river bank with the aspen grove behind it an the run of prairie on the right an the little lake not a gunshot off on the left  thats the spot ive sometimes thought of locatin on when my gun begins to feel too heavy  therell be cities there some day  bricks and mortar and stone ll change its facean cornfields anbut not in our day lad not in our day  the redskins and the bears ll hold it as long as were above ground  yes id like to settle down there  come come redhand said bounce this sort o thing ll never do why youre as hale and hearty as the best on us  wot on arth makes you talk of settlin down in that there fashion  ha exclaimed waller energetically i guess if ye goes on in that style yell turn into a riglar hiplecondrikaint that the word bounce  i heerd the minister say as it was the wust kind o the blues whats your opinion o settlin down hawkswing  to this question the indian gravely replied in his own language with which the trappers were well acquainted that not having the remotest idea of what they were talking about he entertained no opinion in regard to it whatever  well wotiver others may hold remarked bounce emphatically im strong agin settlin down nowhar  so am i out an out said waller  dat be plain to the naked eye observed gibault coming up at the moment  surement you have settle down here for ever  do you spose mes garcons dat de canoe will carry hisself over de portage  voila vat is dat  gibault pointed to the footprint of the grisly bear as he spoke  its a bar remarked bounce quietly  caleb added waller giving the name frequently applied to the grisly bear by western hunters  i calclate its nothin new to see calebs fut in the mud  mais it be new to see hims fut so big you oogly yankee cried gibault putting wallers cap over his eyes and running into the bush to avoid the consequences  at that moment a deer emerged from the bushes about fifty yards from the spot on which the trappers rested and plunging into the river made for the opposite bank  theres our supper said bounce quietly lifting his rifle in a leisurely way and taking aim without rising from the spot on which he sat or removing the pipe from his lips  the sharp crack was followed by a convulsive heave on the part of the deer which fell over on its side and floated downstream  big waller gave utterance to a roar of satisfaction and flinging his pipe from him bounded down the bank towards a point of rock where he knew from the set of the current the deer would be certain to be stranded  gibault forgetting his recent piece of impertinence darted towards the same place and both men reached it at the same instant big waller immediately lifted his little friend in his huge arms and tossed him into the centre of a thick soft bush out of which he scrambled in time to see his comrade catch the deer by the horns as it floated past and drag it on shore  hoh  i vill pay you off von time cried gibault laughing and shaking his fist at waller  then seizing the last bale of goods that had not been carried across the portage he ran away with it nimbly up the bank of the stream  big waller placed the deer on his shoulders with some difficulty and followed in the same direction  on reaching the other end of the portage they found the canoe reloaded and in the water and their comrades evincing symptoms of impatience  come on lads come on cried march who seemed to be the most impatient of them all  weve seen caleb  hes up the river on this side  get in  hes sich a banger oh  before the sentence was well finished all the men were in their places except black gibault who remained on the bank to shove off the canoe  now lad get in said redhand whose usually quiet eye appeared to gleam at the near prospect of a combat with the fierce and muchdreaded monster of the far west  all right mes garcons replied gibault hand me mine gun i vill valk on the bank an see vich vay hims goso adieu  with a powerful push he sent the light craft into the stream and turning on his heel entered the woods  the others at once commenced paddling up the river with energetic strokes  hes a wild feller that remarked bounce after they had proceeded some distance and reached a part of the stream where the current was less powerful  id bet my rifle hes git the first shot at caleb i only hope hell not fall in with him till we git ashore else it may go hard with him  so it may said waller if it goes as hard wi gibault as it did wi my old comrade bob swan itll be no fun i guess  what happened to him asked march who was ever openeared for stories  oh it was nothing very curious but i guess it was onconvanient as them coons from ireland says  bob swan wenthe didaway right off alone all by hisself to shoot a grisly with a old musket as wasnt fit to fire powder not to speak o ball  he was sich a desprit feller bob swan was that he cut after it without takin time to see wot wos in the gun  i follered him as fast as i could hollerin for him to stop and see if he wos loaded but i calclate he was past stoppin  wall he comes up wi the bar suddently and the bar looks at him and he looks at it  then he runs up claps the gun to his shoulder and pulls the trigger but it wos a rusty old lock an no fire came  there was fire come from the bars eyes though i do guess  it ran at him an he ran away  of course caleb soon came up an bob primed as he ran an wheeled about stuck the muzzle of the old musket right into calebs mouth and fired  he swallered the whole charge that bar did as if it had been a glass o grog and didnt he cough some  oh no an he roared too jist like this  big waller in the excitement of his narrative was about to give a vocal illustration when bounce suddenly extinguished him by clapping his hand on his mouth  hist you wild buffalo he said youll frighten off all the bars within ten miles of us if you raise your horrable trumpet  i do believe i forgot said the yankee with a low chuckle when his mouth was released  well but what happened to bob swan inquired march eagerly  wot happened  i guess the bar cotched him by the leg an smashed it in three places before you could wink but by good luck i come up at that moment an put a ball right through calebs brains  bob got better but he never got the right use o his leg after that  an we found that hed fired a charge o small shot down that bars throathe had  hallo look is yon caleb inquired march in a hoarse whisper as he pointed with his paddle to a distant point up the river where a dark object was seen moving on the bank  thats him said bounce  now then do your best an well land on the point just below him  thats sooner said than done remarked redhand quietly for theres another portage between us and caleb  as the old man spoke the canoe passed round a low point which had hitherto shut out the view of the bed of the river from the travellers and the vision of a white though not a high waterfall burst upon their sight at the same moment that the gushing sound of water broke upon their ears  at any other time the beauty of the scene would have drawn forth warm though perhaps quaint and pithy remarks of admiration wood and water were seen picturesquely mingled and diversified in endless variety  little islands studded the surface of the river which was so broad and calm at that place as to wear the appearance of a small lake  at the upper end of this lake it narrowed abruptly and here occurred the fall which glittered in the suns bright rays like a cascade of molten silver  the divers trees and shrubs both on the islets and on the mainland presented in some places the rich cultivated appearance of the plantations on a welltended domain but in other places the fallen timber the rank tangled vegetation and the beautiful wild flowers showed that mans hand had not yet destroyed the wild beauty of the virgin wilderness  the sky above was bright and blue with a few thin feathery clouds resting motionless upon its vast concave and the air was so still that even the tremulous aspen leaves were but slightly agitated while the rest of the forests drapery hung perfectly motionless  complete silence would have reigned but for the mellow sound of the distant fall and the sweet plaintive cries of innumerable wildfowl that flew hither and thither or revelled in the security of their sedgy homes  flocks of wild geese passed in constant succession overhead in the form of acute angles giving a few trumpet notes now and then as if to advertise their passage to the far north to the dwellers in the world below  bustling teal rose in groups of dozens or halfdozens as the red canoe broke upon their astonished gaze and sent them with whistling wings up or down the river  a solitary northern diver put up his long neck here and there to gaze for an instant inquisitively and then sank as if for ever into the calm water to reappear long after in some totally new and unexpected quarter  a napping duck or two being wellnigh run over by the canoe took wing with a tremendous splutter and a perfectly idiotical compound of a quack and a roar while numerous flocks of plover which had evidently meant to lie still among the sedges and hide while the canoe passed sprang into the air at the unwonted hullabaloo and made off with diverse shriek and whistle as fast as their wings could carry them  besides these noisy denizens of the wilderness there were seen in various places cranes and crows and magpies and black terns and turkeybuzzards all of which were more or less garrulous in expressing surprise at the unexpected appearance of the trappers in their wild domain  and just as the canoe drew near to the place at the foot of the fall where they meant to land and make the portage a little cabri or pronghorned antelope leaped out of the woods intending doubtless to drink caught sight of the intruders gave one short glance of unutterable amazement and then rebounded into the bush like an electrified indiarubber ball  now then said bounce as he leaped ashore and held the canoe steady while his comrades landed jist be cool an no hurry make the portage launch the canoe atop o the fall sot off agin an then hurrah for that there grisly bar    chapter four  gibault has an adventure and discovers a very strange creature in the woodsa most tremendous bearhunt particularly described  meanwhile black gibault having followed the course of the river for some distance on foot struck into the woods sought for and found the track of the bear and looking carefully to the priming of his gun and knocking the edge of the flint to sharpen it pushed forward in pursuit with the ardour of a reckless man  gibault noir was a goose  but he was an amiable goose therefore men forgave his follies  had gibault not been a goose he never would have set off alone in pursuit of a grisly bear when he had comrades who might have accompanied him  every one knowsat least if every one does not know every one who reads these pages may know henceforththat the grisly bear of the western prairies and rocky mountains is one of the most desperate and most dreaded animals on the face of the earth not dreaded merely by the weak and the timorous but dreaded also by the bravest indians and the boldest trappers  of course we do not mean to say that by these latter the grisly bear is dreaded with anything like cowardly terror but it is regarded with that degree of wholesome anxiety and extreme caution with which men usually regard an excessively dangerous and powerful enemy  unlike other bears the grisly bear scorns to fly from before the face of man  his ferocity when wounded is terrible and his tenacity of life is such that however many mortal wounds one may give him he will retain life and strength long enough to kill his assailant before he himself dies unless he is shot dead at once by a ball being planted in his heart or brain both of which are difficult to reach  he has a grumpy sort of magnanimity of his own however and will usually let men alone if men will let him alone  but men are not prone to let anything alone hence encounters are frequent wounds on both sides are numerous and death on one or other side is almost certain  old trappers are not fond of attacking caleb singlehanded but young hotblooded fellows who have got their names to make are less cautious and sometimes even court the combat as was the case in the present instance with reckless gibault noir  for half an hour gibault went over the ground at a sort of halfwalk halftrot stopping occasionally to examine the prints of the bear more narrowly when they passed across hard ground that did not take a good impression  at length he came to a deep gully or creek where the bushes were so dense that he could not see far through them in any direction  here he halted reexamined his priming and peering cautiously through the underwood advanced with much greater deliberation and care than heretofore  in descending the gully gibault stumbled once or twice and made one or two crashing bursts through bushes that would have proved quite impervious to most men  after much toil he reached the bottom and standing there up to the ankles in a small rivulet gazed upward at the bank he had now to ascend  vraiment it be uncommonly difficile said he addressing himself to the task while the perspiration began to roll down his forehead  at last he reached the top of the bank on the other side and after panting for some time began to look for the bears footprints but these could not now be found  in his scramble through the gully he had lost them and the ground on the side he had just reached was so hard and rocky that it seemed to him doubtful whether it was capable of receiving any visible impression from a bears paw  it was just possible too that the animal had found the descent of the gully as difficult as he himself had in which case it was highly probable that it had used the course of the rivulet as a pathway  for a moment the little canadian meditated a second descent into the gully for the purpose of settling this point but having not yet quite ceased to pant from his recent exertions he thought better of it and determined to make a further examination of the ground where he was after doing so for a quarter of an hour his exertions were rewarded by the discovery of what appeared to be a track  it was not very distinct but it was sufficiently so to induce him to follow it up with renewed ardour  presently he came upon a spot where the ground was not so thickly covered with underwood and where in some places it was so soft as to show an exact print of the foot of the animal he was following up  here he received a great disappointment and an equally great surprisea disappointment on finding that the track he followed was not that of a bear and a surprise on discovering that it was that of a man  on first making this discovery gibault stopped short laid his gun on the ground stooped down planted a hand on each knee opened his eyes to their utmost pursed his lips to the tightest and stared at the footprint the very embodiment of astonishment  after a few seconds he gave vent to a low whistle and said ho  exactly ten seconds after that he said ha and raising his right hand scratched the point of his nose which being too red naturally was not improved by the operation  none of these acts and exclamations either collectively or singly seemed to afford him any enlightenment for he began to shake his head slowly from side to side as if he had come to the conclusion that the whole affair was utterly beyond his limited comprehension then he started up shouldered his gun and followed the track of the man with as much ardour as he had formerly pursued that of the bear  perseverance is almost invariably rewarded  this would seem to be one of those laws of nature which fail to operate only on very rare and peculiar occasions  gibault had not advanced more than a hundred yards when he came suddenly upon the man whose feet had made the tracks he had been following  the vildmanofdevest certainement muttered black gibault slowly as he gazed at the creature before him and quietly cocked his rifle to be ready for any emergency  certainly the man upon whom our trapper had stumbled thus suddenly might have been styled the wild man of any regionwest north east or southwith perfect propriety  on his legs were a pair of dark grey fustian trousers which had seen so much service that from the knee downwards they were torn into shreds  his feet were covered by a pair of moccasins  instead of the usual huntingshirt he wore one of the yellow deerskin coats of a blackfoot chief which was richly embroidered with beads and quilt work and fringed with scalplocks  on his head he wore a felt hat with a broad rim and a tall conical crown somewhat resembling a spanish sombrero and beside him on the bough of a tree hung a long blue spanish cloak  the countenance of this extraordinary man was handsome and youthful but wild and somewhat haggard as if from much recent suffering  his eye was black and piercing his nose aquiline and his forehead broad but his mouth was effeminate his chin small and beardless his neck long his shoulders narrow and sloping and his black hair hung in long straight locks over his shoulders  a short sword somewhat resembling that of the ancient roman lay on the sward beside him and near to it a huge cavalry pistol of the olden time with a brass barrel and a bell moutha species of miniature blunderbuss  its fellow was stuck in his belt beneath the chiefs coat as could be observed from the appearance of the butt protruding from the opening in the breast thereof  this personage was seated on a grassy knoll so absorbed in some curious kind of occupation that he was totally unobservant of the presence of gibault until he had approached to within thirty yards of him  although his occupation was a mystery to the trapper to one a little more conversant with the usages of civilised life the open book on the knee the easy flow of the pencil and the occasional use of a piece of indiarubber would have been sufficient evidence that the young man was sketching the view before him  ahem coughed gibault  the stranger scattered book pencil and indiarubber to the winds or to the atmosphere for there happened to be no wind at the time and started up  in doing so he showed that he was at least a tall if not a stout fellow  seizing a pistol with one hand and his sword with the other he presented both at gibault and yelled rather than shouted stay halt stop now my man drop the butt of your gun else ill ill blow out your brains  although somewhat startled by this unusual mode of salutation the trapper had sense and quickness enough to perceive that the artist was in anything but a warlike state of mind and that his violent demonstration was the result of having been startled so pulling off his cap with that native politeness which is one of the characteristics of the french canadian he advanced and said  bon jour monsieur  i ver moch sorray dat i be give you von fright pardon sair how you do  thank youthank you good fellow replied the artist laying down his weapons and grasping gibaults proffered hand with a sigh of evident relief i am well excellently well  you did indeed startle me by your sudden appearance but no harm is done and where none was intended no apology is necessary  you are a frenchman i think  non sair not xactly  i be french canadian  mine fadder was be von canadian mine moder was a frenchvoman i be leetle of both  and you have cause to be proud of your country my man returned the artist collecting his scattered drawing materials and quietly sitting down to continue his sketch a splendid country and a noble people sit down my good friend if you can spare time while i put a few finishing touches to this sketch  mais said gibault rubbing his nose in great perplexity at the coolness of this eccentric wanderer mais monsieur i hab not time i be follerin de tracks of von monstracious grisly bar  what a grisly bear cried the artist looking up with sudden animation  oui monsieur  we have see him not long go an hopes to kill him soon  the artists dark eye sparkled with animation as he hastily shut up his sketchbook and thrust it with his drawing materials into a small pocket inside the breast of his coat  a grisly bear he repeated  ha lead on good fellow i will follow  thus urged gibault without further loss of time led the way to the banks of the river followed closely by his new friend who stalked behind him with long ostrichlike strides  the semitheatrical air of the artist made a deep impression on the trapper  had gibault known what a theatrical air was he might have been immensely tickled but being what he wasan unsophisticated son of the wildernesshe knew nothing about such airs and therefore regarded his companion in the light of a superior order of being or a madman he was not quite sure which  in a few minutes they emerged from the bushes and came out upon the bank of the river which at that part was high and precipitous with few trees but a considerable quantity of underwood on the slopes  are you sure friend that a bear has been seen by you inquired the artist  oui most positavly sure sair  ha an here be hims fut encore  i have lose him in de vood  now monsieur have your pistol ready  lead on returned the artist  i have longed much for this day  to shoot an individual of this ferocious class has been my ambitionho friend look here  yonder object seems like a canoe  whence comes it think you  this region i know is not very safe  there are indians who do not love the whites in  no fear monsieur interrupted gibault dat be mine comeradesgood mans an true every von  dey come to land here i see  a low growl in the bushes a little distance ahead of them put an abrupt termination to the conversation  gibault threw forward the muzzle of his gun and glanced at his comrade  the glance did not tend to comfort him  the artist was pale as death  this and an occasional twitch of the lip were clear and unmistakable signs to the backwoodsman that fear had taken possession of his friend and that he was not to be counted on in the moment of danger  yet there was a stern knitting of the eyebrows and a firm pressure of the lips that seemed to indicate better qualities and perplexed him not a little  praps monsieur suggested gibault hesitatingly you had better vait for de canoe  lead on said the artist cocking both pistols and pointing with one of them to the place whence the growl had issued  gibault elevated his eyebrows shrugged his shoulders characteristically and uttering the single word bien walked quickly forward  a few steps brought him to an open space in the midst of which the grisly bear was discovered  it was seated on its haunches looking sulkily about as if it had a suspicion that enemies were tracking it creeping with the utmost caution on his hands and knees gibault got to within forty yards of the monster whose aspect at that moment was enough to try the courage of most men  there was a wicked glare in his little eye as he swayed his huge body from side to side that indicated but too clearly the savage nature of his disposition  even gibault felt a little uneasy and began to think himself a fool for having ventured on such an expedition alone  his state of mind was not improved by the sound of the artists teeth chattering in his head like castanets  taking a very long and deliberate aim at the bears heart he pulled the trigger but the faithless lock of his old flintgun missed fire without a sign of annoyance or agitation the trapper recocked the gun again pulled the trigger and with the same result  three times this occurred and at each click of the lock the bear cocked his ears inquiringly  the third time he rose and sauntered slowly towards the spot where the men lay concealed  stay whispered the artist as gibault was once more about to try his piece after rubbing the edge of his flint with his thumbnail stay i will fire  so saying he suddenly pointed a pistol straight at the advancing monster and fired  a tremendous roar followed the report  gibault leaped up exclaiming angrily vat foolishness a pistol hah ve must run  he turned at once to do so  stay cried the artist who no longer trembled though his countenance was still ashy pale i have another pistol  does you vish to die yelled the trapper seizing his comrade by the collar  whether it was the yell of the man or the reiterated roar of the advancing bear or both combined that had an effect on the artist we cannot tell but certain it is that he sprang up and darted after gibault with astonishing rapidity  being longlegged and uncommonly supple he soon passed him but fast though they both ran the bear ran faster and having been badly cut up about the face by the slugs with which the pistol had been charged his spirit was roused to the utmost pitch of ferocity  now while this was going on in the bush the other trappers were quietly fastening the line of their canoe to a shrub that held it floating in a pool of still water near the shore  no sooner did the pistolshot ring upon their ears than every man seized his gun hastily examined the priming and scrambled up the bank which at that spot was very steep  having gained the top they paused for an instant to gaze intently at the bank of the river above them in order to ascertain the exact spot to which they ought to hurry  i see no smoke said march marston in a tone of deep anxiety  gibaults gun didnt use for to bark in that sort o voice observed bounce  i do blieve that bars got im cried big waller bounding forward  he had not taken a second bound when the artist flying at full speed about three hundred yards up the river burst upon the astonished vision of the party  his sombrero had blown off his long hair streamed straight behind him so did the scalplocks on his coat and so did his long cloak which was fastened to his neck by a clasp and which in his present panting and rushing condition wellnigh strangled him  before the wonderstricken trappers had time to remark on this singular apparition or to form any opinion in regard to it poor gibault came tearing round the point like a maniac with the bear close upon his heels  this was enough  the backwoodsmen no longer showed any signs of surprise or hesitancy  a grisly bear was a familiar objecta comrade in imminent danger was equally so  they sprang forward to meet the fugitives  by this time the cloak had so retarded and strangled the poor artist that he had fallen a pace or two behind gibault and it seemed almost certain that he would fall a victim to the furious bear before the trappers could kill it for they could not venture to fire at it while the fugitives almost screened it from their view  as they drew near to each other the trappers almost instinctively divided into two parties redhand and hawkswing went a little to the right bounce waller and our hero diverged to the left so as to let the flying men pass between them and thus attack the bear on both sides at once  gibault attempted to cheer as he darted through the friendly line but he could only give forth a gasp  at that moment an unexpected incident contributed to the deliverance of the artist  the bear was within a yard of him as he came up just then the clasp of his cloak gave way and the huge garment instantly enveloped the head of the bear and a considerable portion of its body  it tripped rolled over and in attempting to free itself tore the cloak to shreds  at the same instant a volley was fired by the trappers and three balls pierced its body  none of them however seemed to have hit a mortal part for the infuriated animal instantly rose and glared from side to side in disappointed malice while the trappers who had fired were reloading each behind a bush with perfect coolness but with the utmost celerity  while the bear was on the ground the fugitives had each sprung into the bush and found a place of concealment  redhand on the one side and bounce on the other had reserved their fire the wisdom of this was now shown  the bear made a rush at the bushes on one side and instantly received a shot from the other  it turned at once to rush on the concealed enemy there but before it had made a stride in that direction another ball was lodged in it from the opposite side  the vacillations thus produced gave the other trappers time to reload and before it had made up its mind which to attack another volley was fired and three balls took effect redhand and bounce still reserving their fire as at the first  the impotent fury of the creature was now awful to behold  it was mortally wounded there could be no doubt as to that for the trappers were all pretty good shots and knew where to fire but they had not succeeded yet in reaching the seat of life  one ball had broken the bears shoulder and the blood flowed from its wounds while churned blood and foam dropped from its jaws  before another volley could be fired it made a furious rush at the three men who had kept away to the left namely big waller bounce and march  there was no help for it not having completed their loading they had to drop their guns and run  we have already said that these three had diverged towards the river  it now proved to be unfortunate that they had done so for the bank at that place jutted out into the stream in such a way that it was impossible for them to avoid leaping into the river  the bank overhung the stream and was fully twenty feet high  big waller who reached it first hesitated to take the leap bounce who came next rushed violently against him and the two went over together fell into the water with a tremendous splash and sank march come up the instant after and sprang far out at once with a bold unhesitating spring  the bear was so close upon the youth that for one moment they were both in the air at the same time but the former had not gone off with a spring he merely tumbled over half involuntarily so that when they struck the water there was at least a yard between them  but this was not a long space  the superior swimming powers of the bear over the man would have diminished the distance to nothing in a minute or so  even as it was the bear was within six inches of marchs heels when hawkswing and redhand gained the edge of the bank  redhand was armed with a riflean old and trusty weapon that had been the means of saving his own life and the lives of comrades in many a doubtful encounter with beast and with man  kneeling down he took a rapid aim and fired  the bullet sped true  it entered the back of the bears head and the lifeless carcass floated down the stream  the three men instantly observing the effect of the shot turned round and swimming towards their late enemy laid hold of him and dragged and pushed him with some difficulty towards the shore  meanwhile black gibault who had issued from his hidingplace and had witnessed redhands successful shot began to caper and dance and shout in the exuberance of his glee  most men are apt to suffer when they give way to extravagant action of any kind  gibault forgot that he was on the edge of an overhanging bank  the concussion with which he came to the ground after the performance of a peculiarly complicated pirouette broke off the edge of the bank and he was precipitated headlong into the river just a yard or so from the spot where his comrades were engaged in landing the bear  a loud laugh greeted his sudden and unexpected descent  scrambling on shore and laying hold of the bears tail he exclaimed  hah mes garcons heave avay  i have come down for to give you leetle help  splenderous hear  pull avay  the bear was then dragged out of the water and stretched upon the green sward where for some time the trappers stood round it in a picturesque group commenting upon its size and appearance and remarking upon the various incidents of the chase  as the exact dimensions of this particular bear were taken and noted down on the spot we will give them here for the benefit of inquiring minds  it weighed as nearly as could be guessed by men who were practised in estimating weights 600 pounds  on its hind legs it stood 8 feet 7 inches  round the chest it measured 5 feet 10 inches round the neck 3 feet 11 inches  the circumference of the thickest part of the fore leg was 2 feet and the length of each of its claws was 4 and a quarter inches  it was whiteybrown in colour and a shaggier fiercer uglier monster could not well be imagined  but i say cried bounce looking round suddenly wots come o yon xtraornary feller as  bounce paused abruptly for at that moment his eye fell on the xtraornary feller in question  he was seated quietly on a large stone not many yards distant with book on knee and pencil in hand making a rapid sketch of the party and the surrounding scene  wot is he inquired bounce of gibault in a whisper  i calclate observed waller in a low voice at the same time touching his forehead and looking mysterious i calclate hes noncombobblefusticated  perhaps said redhand with a quiet laugh  whatever he is its bad manners to stand starin at him said redhand so youd better go and pick up yer guns and things while bounce and i skin this feller and cut off his claws  the party separated at once and the artist who seemed a little disappointed at being thus checked in his work no sooner observed the flaying process begin than he turned over the leaf of his book and began a new sketch  not many minutes were required for the skinning of the bear  when it was done it along with all the scattered things was placed in the canoe and then redhand approaching the artist touched his cap and said  you have shared our hunt today sir mayhap youll not object to share our camp and our supper  most willingly my good friend replied the artist rising and holding out his hand which the trapper shook heartily  you seem to be trappers  we are sir at your service  its gettin late and weve a good bit to go yet before we come to the place where we mean to camp so youd better come at once  certainly by all means let us embark without delay replied the artist pocketing his sketchbook  pardon me sir said redhand with some hesitation are you alone  i am replied the other sadly then as if a sudden thought had struck himi had two pistols and a cloak once  weve picked em up sir  theyre in the canoe now  at least the pistols are an whats left o the cloak  ha twas an old and cherished friend  are you ready  all ready sir  so saying the old man led the way to the canoe and embarked with his strange companion  then pushing out into the stream just as the shades of night began to descend upon the wilderness the trappers paddled swiftly away wondering in their hearts who and what the stranger could be and talking occasionally in subdued tones of the chief incidents of the exciting combat through which they had so recently passed    chapter five  fiery remarks and cogitationsround the camp firethe artist gives an account of himselfvalue of a sketchbookdiscoveries and dark threatsthe bearsclaw collar  there is no doubt whatever that a western trapper knows how to make a fire  that is an axiomatic certainty  he also knows how to enjoy it he is thoroughly conversant with it in all its phases and with all the phenomena connected with it from the bright little spark that flies from his flint and steel and nestles on his piece of tinder to the great rolling flame that leaps up among the branches of the forest trees roaring lustily as it goes out upon the night air like a mighty spirit set free from some diminutive prison house rejoicing in being once more permitted to reassume its original grand dimensions  yes a western trapper has a grand massive notion of a fire and his actions are all in keeping with that notion  almost everything is small at the fountain  a mighty river usually begins in a bubbling spring or a tiny rivulet  so the trappers initial acts are delicate  he handles the tinder gently and guards it from damp  he fosters the spark when caught and blows upon it softly and wraps it up in dry grass and watches it intently as a mother might watch the lifespark of her newborn babe  but when once the flame has caught and the bundle of little dry twigs has been placed above it and the pile of broken sticks has been superadded the trappers character is changed  he grasps the ponderous hatchet and homerically speaking    now toils the hero trees on trees oerthrown   fall crackling round him and the forests groan  these loppd and lightend of their branchy load he assaults singly heaving the huge axe with lusty sweeping blows he brings it down great wedgy splinters fly and strew the plain like autumn leaves  then with massive logs full six feet long he feeds the hungry fire until it leaps and roars in might and glows full red and hot and huge enough to roast him a bison bull for supper an he should feel so disposed  descending now from the abstract to the concrete we would remark that whether the reader does or does not admit the general proposition that western trappers are preeminently up to fire not to mention smoke or snuff he cannot deny the fact that big waller the yankee trapper was peculiarly gifted in that way  on the evening of the day on which occurred the memorable encounter with the grisly bear as related in the last chapter that stalwart individual heaved his ponderous axe and felled the trees around him in a way that would have paled the ineffectual fires of ulysses himself and would probably have induced that hero not only to cease cutting trees but to commence cutting his stick thenceforth from the field of competition  march marston meanwhile kindled the spark and nursed the infant flame  the others busied themselves in the various occupations of the camp  some cut down pinebranches and strewed them a foot deep in front of the fire and trod them down until a soft elastic couch was formed on which to spread their blankets  others cut steaks of venison and portions of the grisly bear and set them up on the end of sticks before the fire to roast and others made fast and secured the canoe and her lading  the artist seating himself beside the fire just near enough to profit by the light but far enough away to obtain a general view of everything and everybody proceeded with enthusiasm to sketch the whole affair collectively and in detail  he devoted his chief attention however to big waller  he caught that gigantic yankee in every conceivable action and attitude  he photographed him we might almost say with his legs apart the hatchet high above his head and every muscle tense and rigid preliminary to a sweeping blow  he took him with a monstrous pile of logs on his brawny shoulder he portrayed him resting for a moment in the midst of his toil he even attempted to delineate him tumbling over one of the logs and hurling a shoulderload upon the ground but he failed utterly in the last attempt being quite destitute of comical perception and he did not finally conclude until gibault went forward and informed him that supper was ready  then he shut up his book and taking his place beside the trappers began supper  this is comfortablethis is pleasant remarked the artist as he sat down before the warm blaze and applied himself with infinite relish to the venison steak placed before him by bounce  you live well here it would seem  this latter remark was addressed to hawkswing who sat close beside him but that imperturbable worthy shook his head gravely  he dont understand ye interposed bounce knows nothin but his own mother tongue  we do live pretty middlin so so hereabouts when we aint starvin wich it isnt for me to deny is sometimes the case dye see  bounce stopped his own talk at this point by stuffing his mouth so full of meat that no word not even a word of one syllable could have forced itself out had it tried ever so much  a long silence now ensued during which the clack of seven pairs of active jaws was the only sound that broke upon the ear  it might have been observed however that all eyes were fixed more or less wonderingly on the stranger  big waller in particular looked him figuratively speaking through and through  he did not remove his eyes off him for an instant but devoured his food with somewhat the expression of a dog that expects his bone to be snatched from him  try a duck said march marston to the artist observing that he had finished his steak  thank you answered the artist accepting the proffered bird which happened to be a teal and beginning to carve it with a penknife  he had no fork but used the fingers of his left hand instead  silence again ensued  try another said march again  the artist hesitated  youd better its a fat un  nno  no said the artist shutting up his knife with an air of decision  no thank you i always advocate moderation and it would ill become me to set an example of glutah of the reverse  wal stranger said waller who having finished eating wiped his mouth with a tuft of grass and began to fill his pipe  you do come out in the way o moderation rather powerful  why a teal duck an a venson steak is barely enough to stop a feller dyin right off  i guess a downeast baby o six months old ud swab up that an axe for more  nevertheless it is quite enough for me replied the artist leaning down on his elbow  i could indeed eat more but i hold that man should always rise from table capable of eating more if required  here was a proposition that it had not entered into the minds of the trappers even in their most transcendental efforts of abstruse meditation to think of  they gazed at each other in amazement  wot not eat yer fill wen ye git the chance exclaimed bounce  no certainly not  i say stranger when did you feed last inquired big waller  why do you ask said the artist looking quickly up  cause i wants to know  the artist smiled  my last meal was eaten yesterday morning  ha  i was sure ob dat cried gibault your face look like as if you be full ob starvation  an wot did ye eat last inquired bounce laying down his pipe and looking at their guest with much interest not unmingled with pity  i breakfasted on a little bird about the size of a hens egg  i know not what it is named but it was excellently flavoured  i relished it much  on hearing this gibault pressed his hand on his stomach as if the mere thought of such a delicately minute breakfast caused him pain in that region  i say stranger broke in waller in a tone of voice that seemed to imply that he was determined to be at the bottom of this mystery and would stand it no longerwots your name  theodore bertram replied the artist without hesitation  where do you come from  from england  where air you agoin to  to the rocky mountains  wot for to do there  you are inquisitive friend said bertram smiling but i have no reason for concealing my object in travelling hereit is to sketch and shoot and take notes and witness the works of the almighty in the wilderness  i hold it to be an object worthy the ambition of a great man to act the part of pioneer to the missionary and the merchant in natures wildest and most inaccessible regions and although i pretend not to greatness i endeavour humbly to do what i can  no one can do more than that said redhand regarding the young enthusiast with interest  but surely you have not travelled to this outotheway place without a guide  bertram pointed to the stars  these are my guides said he the man who can read the heavens needs no guide  but that book aint always readable said redhand when clouds are flying what do you do then  furtraders in the far north have taught me how to ascertain the north by the bark on the trees besides this i have a bosom friend who always points the way  so saying he pulled a small compass from an inner pocket and held it up  good rejoined redhand but a compass is not food neither will it kill game  have you nought but them pistols  i have none other arms now but these save this good sword  they will serve to defend me in the hour of need i trust though now that i have seen the grisly bear i should doubt my chance of success were i to cope with him alone  i should imagine that monster to be worse even than the wild man of the west himself  the wild man o the west echoed march marston eagerly have you seen him  nay verily but i have heard of him replied the artist smiling and a strangely ferocious creature he must be if all thats said of him be correct  but to say truth i believe the stories told of him are idle tales  indeed i do not believe there is such a man at all  march marstons countenance fell  no wild man of the west at all  the bare possibility of such a crushing blow to all his romantic hopes and dreams caused his heart to sink  bertram observed the change in his countenance and quickly divining the cause added but i am of a sceptical turn of mind and do not easily believe unless i see  there is one thing i have observed however which is in favour of his existence  whats that inquired march brightening up  that the nearer one comes to his reputed dwellingplace this wild man assumes smaller and more natural proportions  i first heard of him in the red river prairies where he is held to be a giant who devours men as well as brutes  as i came nearer to the missouri i found that the people there do not believe him to be either a cannibal or a giant but assert that he is an enormously tall and powerful man exceedingly fierce and the sworn enemy of the whole human race a species of cain whose hand is against every man and every mans hand against him  the last white man i metabout two weeks agotold me he had been with a tribe of indians some of whom had seen him and they said that he was indeed awfully wild but that he was not cruelon the contrary he had been known to have performed one or two kind deeds to some who had fallen into his power  most extonishin exclaimed gibault who sat openmouthed and openeyed listening to this account of the wild man of the west  for some time the party round the camp fire sat smoking in silence ruminating on what had been said  then big waller broke the silence with one of his abrupt questions  but i say stranger how did you come here  bertram looked up without speaking  then settling himself comfortably in a reclining position with his back against a tree he said  i will relieve your curiosity  listen i am as i have said an englishman  my father and mother are dead  i have no brothers or sisters and but few relations  possessing as i do a small independence i am not obliged to work for my living  i have therefore come to the conclusion that it is my duty to work for my fellowmen  of course i do not mean to deny that every man who works for his living works also for his fellowmen  what i mean is that i hold myself bound to apply myself to such works as other men have not leisure to undertake and the profit of which will go direct to mankind without constituting my livelihood on its passage  to open up the unknown wilderness has ever been my ambition  for that purpose i have come to these wild regions  my enthusiasm on quitting my native land was unbounded  but  here bertram paused and gazed dreamily at the glowing embers of the camp fire with an expression that led the trappers to infer that experience had somewhat moderated his enthusiasm  after a few minutes he resumed  i have done wrong to make this venture alone  on reaching canada i succeeded through the kindness of the governor of the hudsons bay company in obtaining a passage in one of the companys canoes through that series of rivers and lakes by which the furtraders penetrate into the regions of the far north  arrived at red river settlement i pushed forward on horseback over the plains with a small party of horsemen to the head waters of the saskatchewan  here i succeeded in engaging a party of twelve men composed of halfbreeds and indians and set out on a journey of exploration over the prairies towards the rocky mountains circumstances led me to modify my plans  we diverged towards the south and finally came to within a few days journey of the region in which we now are  we were suddenly surprised one night by a warparty of blackfoot indians  my men had grown careless  they neglected to keep strict watch and before we were aware that danger threatened us all our horses were carried off  this was a terrible calamity  my men declared that it was impossible to advance without horses and refused to accompany me any farther  i remonstrated in vain then filled with indignation at their cowardice i left them and pursued my journey alone  since then i have seen only one man a trapper who was travelling south to the settlements  he offered to take me with him but i declined  i felt that no great or good work could ever be accomplished by the man who turns back at the first disaster so he left me  i have suffered somewhat  i am unfortunately a bad shot and although game is everywhere abundant i cannot kill it  i have subsisted hitherto on small birds but my powder and lead are almost expended  had i not fallen in with you i know not what i should have done  to this narrative the trappers listened with respectful attention for despite the feelings of pity almost bordering on contempt with which they regarded the strangers weapons and his knowledge or rather ignorance of woodcraft they could not help reverencing the simpleminded enthusiasm in a good cause that had conducted the artist so deep into a savage land in which he was evidently unfitted either by nature or training to travel  but i say stranger said big waller wot do ye mean by openin up the country  it aint a oyster that ye can open it up with a big knife i guess  there friend you are wrong  this country does indeed resemble an oyster and i hope by the aid of the mighty levers of knowledge and enterprise to open it up  i mean to take notes and sketches and if spared return to my native land and publish the result of my observations  i do not indeed expect that the public will buy my work but i shall publish a large edition at my own cost and present copies to all the influential men in the kingdom  the trappers opened their eyes wider than ever at this  what  make a book cried redhand  even so  will it have pictures eagerly asked march who regarded the artist with rapidly increasing veneration  ay it will be profusely illustrated  wot pictures o grisly bears inquired bounce  of course  an men cried big waller  and men also if i fall in with them  then heres one i guess cried the bold yankee combing out his matted locks hastily with his fingers and sitting up in what he conceived to be a proper position  here you are sir  im your man fix me off slick  only think  big waller in a booka raal book  he chuckled immensely at the bright prospect of immortality that had suddenly opened up to him  i have drawn you already friend said bertram  drawd me already  ay there you are he replied handing his sketchbook to the trapper who gazed at his own portrait with unmitigated satisfaction  turning over the leaf he came unexpectedly on the likeness of gibault which being a truthful representation was almost a caricature  big waller burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter at this  he rolled over on his back and yelled with delight  his yell being quite in keeping with his body the din was so tremendous that bounce roared  stop yer noise ye buffalo  but waller didnt hear him so march marston effected the desired object by stuffing the corner of a blanket into his mouth and smothering his face in its folds  bertrams sketchbook was now examined and for nearly an hour proved a source of the most intense interest and amusement to these unsophisticated trappers  in those days few very few men of education had succeeded in penetrating far into the western wilderness and although the trappers there knew what books and pictures meant they had seen but few of them in the course of their lives and none of those few had any reference to the wild country in which their lives were spent  it may be imagined then with what delight and excitement they now for the first time beheld scenes of their own beloved woods and prairies as well as their own rough forms vividly sketched by a masterhand one of the most interesting points in the inspection of the sketchbook was that old redhand recognised almost every one of the landscapes as spots with which he was well acquainted and as bertram had sketched most diligently as he travelled along redhand told him that by the aid of that book without compass or anything else he could trace his route backward step by step to the saskatchewan river  moreover he described to the artist accurately many scenes which were near to those he had sketched and gradually fell to talking about adventures and rencontres he had had in many of them so that at last it became evident there would be no proposal to go to rest that night at all unless some wise one of the party should remind the others that another days toil lay before them in the course of a few hours  at length they took up their pipes which had been forgotten in the excitement and refilled them with the intention of having a last quiet whiff before lying down  ho exclaimed redhand who still continued to turn over the pages of the book heres a face i know  where saw ye that indian  i cannot easily tell where it was we met him but i remember well that it was just a days ride from the spot where our horses were stolen  were there others with him  no he was alone  ha at least he said so i fancy  yes he did and i had no reason to doubt him  youre not used to the ways o the redskin sir replied redhand looking meditatively at the fire  did he chance to mention his name  oh yes he called himself big snake at least one of my men translated it so  a significant smile overspread the old trappers face as he replied  i thought as much  a greater thief and villain does not disgrace the prairies  hes the man that took yer horses sich a fellow as that never goes about alone hes always got a tail following him as black as himself  but ill see if we cant pay the rascal off in his own coin  how so inquired bertram  he must be far from this spot  not so far as you think  i know his haunts and could take you to them in a few days overland but itll take longer by the river and we cant quit our canoe just now  but good friend said bertram quietly i cannot presume on your hospitality so far as to expect you to carry me along with you for the purpose of redressing my wrongs  make your mind easy on that pint returned redhand well talk of it in the mornin  while the old trapper and the artist were conversing bounce had busied himself in stringing the claws of the grisly bear on a strip of deerskin for the purpose of making a collar  a necklace of this description is very highly prized among indians especially when the claws are large  while it was being made gibault sighed so deeply once or twice that march suggested he must be in love  so i is sighed gibault  thats interesting remarked march who with  ay thats it said bounce out with her name lad  no one ought never to be ashamed o bein in love  its a glorious state o mind an body as a feller should gratilate hisself on havin  who be ye in love wi lad  vid dat necklace replied gibault sighing again heavily  oh if thats all ye dont need to look so blue for its yer own by rights said bounce  im jist doin it up for ye  non it cannot be mine returned gibault  how so inquired waller ye arned it didnt ye  drew first blood i calclate  non i not draw de fuss blood  mais i vill hab chance again no doubt monsieur bertram he drew fuss blood  ho he cried waller in surprise  you didnt tell us that before come im glad ont  what exclaimed bertram the necklace mine there must be some mistake  i certainly fired my pistol at the bear but it seemed to have had no effect whatever  gibault said bounce emphatically did you fire at all  non pour certain cause de gun he not go off  then continued bounce handing the muchcoveted necklace to bertram the thing blongs to you sir for that bar comed up wounded an as he couldnt ha wounded hisself you must ha done itthere  the young man positively refused for some time to accept of the necklace saying that as gibault had tracked and discovered the bear it certainly belonged to him but gibault as positively affirmed that he would not disgrace himself by wearing what belonged rightfully to another man and as the other trappers confirmed what their comrade said bertram was at last fain to accept of a trophy which to say truth he was in his heart most anxious to possess  at the close of this amicable dispute each man rolled himself in his blanket and lay down to sleep with his feet to the fire  being in a part of the country where there were very few indians and these few on pretty good terms with the white trappers no watch was set  bertram lay down with his tattered cloak around him and taking a little book from his pocket read it or appeared to read it till he fell asleep on observing which march marston crept noiselessly to his side and lying gently down beside him covered him with a portion of his own blanket  ere long the camp was buried in repose    chapter six  the dangers of the wildernessan unexpected catastrophe which necessitates a change of plansa descent upon robbers proposed and agreed to  there are few passages in holy writ more frequently brought to remembrance by the incidents of everyday life than thisye know not what a day or an hour may bring forth  the uncertainty of sublunary things is proverbial whether in the city or in the wilderness whether among the luxuriously nurtured sons and daughters of civilisation or among the toilworn wanderers in the midst of savage life  to each and all there is or may be sunshine today and cloud tomorrow gladness today sadness tomorrow  there is no such thing as perpetual felicity in the world of matter  a nearer approach to it may perhaps be made in the world of mind but like perpetual motion it is not to be absolutely attained to in this world of ours  those who fancy that it is to be found in the wilderness are hereby warned by one who has dwelt in savage lands that its habitation is not there  march marston thought it was  on the morning after the night whose close we have described he awoke refreshed invigorated and buoyant with a feeling of youthful strength and health  starting up he met the glorious sun face to face as it rose above the edge of a distant blue hill and the meeting almost blinded him  there was a saffron hue over the eastern landscape that caused it to appear like the plains of paradise  lakelets in the prairies glittered in the midst of verdant foliage ponds in the hollows lay as yet unillumined like blots of ink streams and rivulets gleamed as they flowed round wooded knolls or sparkled silvery white as they leaped over rocky obstructions  the noble river on the banks of which the camp had been made flowed with a calm sweep through the richly varied countryrefreshing to look upon and pleasant to hear as it murmured on its way to join the father of waters  the soft roar of a fardistant cataract was heard mingling with the cries of innumerable water fowl that had risen an hour before to enjoy the first breathings of the young day  to march marstons ear it seemed as though all nature animate and inanimate were rejoicing in the beneficence of its creator  the youths reverie was suddenly broken by the approach of theodore bertram  good morrow friend said the latter grasping marchs hand and shaking it heartily  you are early astir  oh what a scene  what heavenly colours  what a glorious expanse of beauty  the artists hand moved involuntarily to the pouch in which he was wont to carry his sketchbook but he did not draw it forth his soul was too deeply absorbed in admiration to permit of his doing aught but gaze in silence  this repays my toils he resumed soliloquising rather than speaking to march  twere worth a journey such as i have taken twice repeated to witness such a scene as this  ay aint it grand said march delighted to find such congenial enthusiasm in the young painter  bertram turned his eyes on his companion and in doing so observed the wild rose at his side  ah sweet rose he said stooping eagerly down to smell it    full many a flower is born to blush unseen   and waste its sweetness on the desert air  he was no poet who wrote that anyhow observed march with a look of disdain  you are wrong friend  he was a good poet and true  do you mean to tell me that the sweetness o that rose is wasted here  nay i do not say that  the poet did not mean to imply that its sweetness is utterly wasted but to assert the fact that as far as civilised man is concerned it is so  civilised man echoed march turning up his nose a difficult feat by the way for his nose by nature turned down  an pray whats civilised man that he should think everythings wasted that dont go in at his own eyes or up his own nose or down his own throat eh  bertram laughed slightly he never laughed heartily  you are a severe critic friend  i dont know and i dont care what sort o cricket i am but this i do know that roses are as little wasted here as in your countrymayhap not so much  why i tell ye ive seen the bars smell em  indeed  ay an eat em too  that was not taking a poetical view of them suggested bertram  perhaps not but it was uncommonly practical returned march laughing  the conversation was abruptly terminated at this point by a flock of wild ducks which ignorant of the presence of the two youths swept close past their heads with a startling whirr  the artist leaped backwards and march partly in the exuberant glee of his heart and partly to relieve his own startled feelings gave utterance to a hideous yell  hi hallo roared big waller starting up and replying to the yell with compound interest  wots to do  bars or savageswhich  oh savages i see he added rubbing his eyes as he observed march laughing at him  ha lad dye know theres a sort o critter in other diggins o this here world as they calls a hieeno or somethin o that sort as can laugh it can so youre not the only beast as can do it dye see  the camp was now thoroughly roused and the trappers set about making preparations for a start but little was said  it is generally the case at early morningat least among healthy men who have work to do before breakfast in the wildernessthat tongues are disinclined to move after the first somewhat outrageous and rather unusual burst no one spoke again while they carried their goods down to the waters edge except in a short grumpy way when an order or a remark was needful  in about ten minutes after the utterance of big wallers roar they were in their places in the little red canoe paddling blithely up the river  bertrams place in the canoe was the centre  he was placed there as a passenger but not being by any means of a lazy disposition he relieved all the men by turns and thus did a good share of the work during the day  towards evening the travellers came to a cataract which effectually barred their further progress and rendered a portage necessary  just above the cataract there was a short stretch of comparatively smooth water in which however the current was very strong  immediately above that there was a rapid of considerable length and strength which boiled furiously among the rocks and seemed to be impassable to a canoe  after close inspection of it however redhand and bounce who were tacitly recognised as joint leaders of the party agreed that the canoe could easily enough be hauled up by means of a line  to make a long portage and so avoid the whole obstruction was desirable but the precipitous nature of the banks at that place rendered the carrying of the canoe and goods a work not only of severe labour but of considerable danger  the mode of proceeding having been settled all hands went to work without delay  the goods were carried to the top of the fall which was about fifteen feet high then the canoe was shouldered by waller and bounce and soon it floated in a calm eddy near the head of the cataract  having replaced the cargo a strong line or rope was fastened to the bows and redhand and bounce proceeded to take their places in the canoe in order to guide it through the rapid while the others were engaged in hauling on the trackline  stay cried march marston as bounce was stepping in let me go in the canoe bounce  you know well enough that i can manage it besides youre a heavy buffalo and more able to track than i  nay lad replied bounce shaking his head youll only run the risk o gettin a wet skinmayhap somethin worse  now thats too bad  dye think nobody can manage a canoe but yourself  come redhand do let me go  its not safe boy  the rapid looks bad and youre not much used to the bowpaddle  tut nonsense exclaimed march pushing bounce aside and stepping into the canoe  now hold on  before the men on the bank of the river were well aware of what the reckless youth was about he shoved the bow of the canoe off  the instant it passed the still water of the eddy and caught the powerful stream the light bark darted like an arrow from the bank and redhand was obliged to use his paddle with the utmost dexterity while the men on shore had to haul on the line with all their might to prevent it being swept over the brink of the fall  in a second however the danger was past and putting their strength to the trackline they dragged the canoe slowly but steadily upstream while redhand and march guided it past rocks and dangerous eddies  seeing that the youth used his paddle dexterously bounce after a little thought resolved to let him encounter the more dangerous rapid above  redhand silently came to the same conclusion though he felt uneasy and blamed himself for allowing the ardour of the boy to get the better of him  march is a bold fellow observed bertram who walked immediately behind bounce hauling on the line like the rest  bold he is sir replied bounce an if yed seed him as i did not many weeks agone aridin on the back of a buffalo bull yed mayhap say he was more nor that  hah he is mad cried gibault who although the last in the line of tracksmen was sharpeared and overheard the conversation  dont talk gibault interposed big waller you need all the wind in your little carcass i guess to enable ye to steam ahead  oui mon dear ami you is righti do ver much require all mine steammine spiritsfor to push such a heavy useless hulk as you before me  heres a steep bit lads mind your eye hawkswing said bounce as the indian who led the party began to ascend a steep part of the bank where the footing was not secure owing to the loose gravelly nature of the soil  as they advanced the path along the bank became narrower and the cliff itself so precipitous that it seemed as if a jerk on the line would drag the men off and send them rolling down into the flood below in the midst of which the canoe was buffeting its way through the hissing foam  bertram who was unused to such a position of comparative danger and whose head was not capable of standing the sight of a precipice descending from his very feet into a roaring stream began to feel giddy and would have given the world to return but he felt ashamed to confess his weakness and endeavoured by gazing earnestly into the bank at his side to steady himself hoping that the nature of the track would improve as they advanced  instead of this being the case it became worse at every step and the trackers were at length obliged to proceed cautiously along a ledge of rock that barely afforded them foothold  bertram now felt an almost irresistible desire to turn his head to the left and glance at the river below yet he knew that if he should do so he would become utterly unable to advance another yard while engaged in this struggle it suddenly occurred to him that it was impossible now to turn no matter how nervous he should become as the path was too narrow to permit one of the party to pass another  he became deadly pale and his heart sank at the thought  little did the hardy trappers think as they plodded silently along that such an agonising conflict was going on in the breast of one of their number  a slight groan escaped him in spite of his utmost efforts to restrain himself  bounce looked back in surprise  hey wots to do sir  no matter lead oni will follow said bertram sternly between his clenched teeth  hallo up there shouted redhand who was at that moment along with march exerting his utmost strength in order to keep the canoe off a rock over which the water was bursting in volumes of thick foam haul away haul away were just about up  the shout attracted bertrams attention he turned his eyes involuntarily towards the river  instantly his brain swam round he staggered and would have fallen over the bank had not big waller who was close behind observed his situation and caught him by the collar in doing so he was compelled to let go his hold of the line  the additional strain thus suddenly cast upon gibault wrenched the line from his grasp with a degree of violence that wellnigh hurled him into the river  bounce and hawkswing held on for one moment but the canoe having been eased off a little caught a sweep of the rapid and went out with a dart that the united strength of the whole party could not have checked  the two men had to let go to save themselves and in a shorter time than it takes to relate the canoe went down the river towards the fall dancing like a cork on the heaving spray while the old man and the youth stood up in the bow and stern wielding their paddles now on one side now on the other with ceaseless rapidity in their efforts to avoid being dashed to pieces on the rocks  the sight of this catastrophe superadded to his already agonised feelings caused the unhappy artist to swoon  gibault on seeing the line let go turned instantly and sprang like a deer along the track they had been following intending to render what assistance he could to his comrades at the foot of the rapid  the others could not follow because of big waller and the artist who obstructed the path  seeing this the powerful yankee seized bertram round the waist and heaving him on his shoulder as one would swing a child followed in gibaults footsteps as fast as he could run  the distance to the spot whence they had commenced to track the canoe was not great but before they reached it the frail craft had been shattered against a rock and was now hurrying along with the scattered cargo and the two men towards the fall to pass over which involved certain destruction  there is nothing more uncertain however than the action of the whirling eddies of a great rapid  true the general flow of its body of water is almost always the same but its superficial billows are more variablenow tossing a drifting log to the right anon to the left and casting it ashore or dragging it with fearful violence into the raging current  although there was only the canoes length between the old trapper and the youth when they were left struggling in the water they were swept in totally different directions  redhand was hurled violently into the eddy where the canoe had lain before the ascent was commenced and was dragged safe to land by his comrades  march marston on the other hand was swept out near to the main current and would in a few seconds more have been carried over the fall had he not with wonderful presence of mind and an almost superhuman exertion of muscle dashed into an eddy which was formed by a rock about fifty yards from the top of the fall  the rock was completely covered with the bursting spray so that it formed no restingplace and it with the partial eddy that tailed away from it was about twenty yards from the shore where the trappers stood gazing in horror at their companion as he struggled bravely to maintain his position by swimming but to cross those twenty yards of gushing water so as to afford him aid seemed beyond the power of man  men bred in the wilderness are not usually slow to act in cases of danger where action is possible  each man was revolving in fervid haste every plan that seemed likely to afford succour  redhands quick eye observed that the rocks at the edge of the fall on the side of the river on which they stood projected out so far that a straight line drawn from the eddy to the fall would pass within a yard of them and that consequently if march would push straight across the stream and make vigorously for the bank he might hit the point of rocks referred to before being carried over  down some of you he cried to the point an be ready to catch him ill shout to him what to do  big waller and gibault darted away  poor bertram having recovered remained gazing in speechless agony at march who having made several fruitless efforts to seize hold of the sunken rock was evidently growing weaker  bounce also remained to gaze as if he had lost all his wonted selfcommand  ho  march shouted redhand  dash into the streamstraight for me with all yer might dont be afraid lad do it boldly  but march heard not  the rush of water about him deadened all other sounds  in an instant bounce started at full speed up the river plunged into it and descending with fearful rapidity swung round into the eddy behind the stone almost before his companions could divine what he meant to do  even in that moment of terrible suspense march marston looked with an expression of surprise at his friend as he swam up beside him  bounce did not waste time or words he merely raised one hand for a second and pointing to the bank of the river cried push for ittis your only chance  march marston made no reply but at once obeyed yet so exhausted was he that in the effort he lost strength and sank  bounce was prepared for this  he seized him by the hair and struck out with the energy of despair  a moment more and he was within a foot of the brink of the fallbut also within a foot of the point of rock on which big waller was lying at full length part of his body overhanging the cataract his arms extended and gibault and hawkswing holding him firmly by the legs bounce caught his comrades hand and swung close in to the bank while with the other hand he continued to grasp march by the hair of the head the force of the current was so great however that not one of the party dared move and it seemed for a moment as if all of them would be lost when bertram rushed forward and seizing bounce by the arm dragged him still nearer the bank and relieved the strain upon the others  just then redhand came to the rescue and in another moment the two men were safe upon the land  poor bertram fell upon his knees and while he thanked god for the deliverance of his companions sobbed liked a little child  for some time the trappers spoke little  accustomed though they were to danger they were solemnised by the recent narrow escape from sudden death  perhaps too their minds were more deeply affected than usual with a sense of their dependence upon the living god by the example and the heartfelt unrestrained thanksgiving of bertram  but men whose lives are spent in the midst of alarms are not long seriously affected even by the most solemn events  the trappers quickly recurred to their present circumstances which were in truth of a nature calculated to fill them with anxiety and cause them to bend the powers of their quick wits and iron energies to the simple consideration of how they were to subsist and how proceed on their journey  first of all said redhand quickly we must try what we can recover of our odds and ends  right cried bounce who was none the worse for his late gallant exertions the current wont stop for no man an the bales aint likely to stem it o their own accord till were ready to look for em  saying this he set off down the river at a run followed by all the others including march who after wringing the water from his garments and resting a few minutes felt as well and strong as ever but alas their losses were grievous and irreparable  their little bundles of spare clothing and trinkets for trading with or conciliating the indians were indeed saved but their guns and all their ammunition were gone  all that remained to them of the latter were the few charges of powder in the horns suspended round their necks and a few slugs and bullets in their pouches  the only firearms left were bertrams cavalry pistols  as for the canoe it was smashed so thoroughly that only a very few shreds of bark were cast up on the shore but entangled with these shreds they were happy to find several of their steel trapsa most fortunate circumstance as it held out hopes that they might still be enabled to prosecute to some extent the main object of their expedition  as each man had been in the habit of carrying his axe and knife in his belt those indispensable implements of the backwoodsman were saved but the loss of guns and ammunition was a very severe misfortune and one which for at least half an hour after every attempt to recover them had failed cast a damp over the spirits of the whole party  but these men had neither time nor inclination to hang down their heads and sigh  big waller being a careless individual by nature was the first to regain somewhat of his wonted tone and manner  sitting on a grassy knoll on which all the party had been resting for some time after their fruitless exertions in moody silence waller looked up suddenly and said whos afraid  as no one happened at that moment to be exhibiting symptoms of terror and there was no apparent cause for fear the question seemed irrelevant  we therefore conclude that the bold yankee meant by it to imply that he at least was not afraid of circumstances no matter how disastrous or heartrending they might be  having said this he looked at the faces of his companions one by one  the last face he looked at was that of gibault noir and it wore such a lugubrious aspect of hopeless melancholy that big waller burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter and bounce without knowing why joined him  well its of no use looking blue about it said march marston making an effort to cheer up the question to be settled now is whats to be done  ay that is the question observed bertram gravely  wall now that bein the keewestion said waller whose agoin to answer it  theres a chance now lads but dont all speak at once  right thats wot it is observed bounce nodding thats the feelosophy on it  when a fellers turned upside down wots he agoin to do nixt  you cant put no other construction on it in this here wurld  redhand who had been ruminating abstractedly for some minutes now looked round on his comrades and said  heres a plan for you lads  that outrageous villain the big snake lives for the most part in a pretty little spot just three days march from this place  he stole as ye all know the horses belongin to mr bertrams party  well i propose that we shud go an call on him an make him stand an redeliver  what say you  agreed cried waller tossing his cap into the air  hurrah shouted march marston  in one way or another each gave his consent to the plan of making a descent upon the robbers and causing them to make restitution  the plans of backwoodsmen once formed are always quickly put in execution  they had no arrangements to make no portmanteaus to pack no difficulties in the way to overcome  each man strapped a portion of the remaining property on his broad shoulders and pushing into the forest with vigorous strides they were soon far from the spot where their late disaster had occurred and gradually drew near to the wild glens and gorges of the rocky mountains    chapter seven  a wolfish way of killing buffaloes describedbounce becomes metaphysical on the fine artsbutchering enlarged ona glorious feast and sketching under difficulties  one of the ancient poets has said that wandering through the wild woods is a pleasant thing  at least if one of them has not said that he ought to have said it and certainly many of them must have thought it whether they said it or not  undoubtedly if future historians record faithfully all that has been said and written from the commencement of time to the period in which they flourish they will embalm the fact that at least one prose writer of the present day has enunciated that incontrovertible proposition  but we go a step further  we assert positively that wandering through the wild woods is a healthy as well as a pleasant sort of thing  the free air of the mountains and prairies is renovating the perfumes of the forests are salubrious while the constantly recurring necessity for leaping and scrambling is good for the muscles and the occasional tripping over roots tumbling into holes scratching ones face and banging ones shins and toes against stumps are good forthough somewhat trying tothe temper  further stillwe affirm that wandering through the wild woods is a funny thing  any one who had observed our friends march marston and redhand and bounce and big waller and black gibault the trappers and bertram the artist and hawkswing the indian one beautiful afternoon not long after the day on which they lost their canoe would have admitted without hesitation that wandering through the wild woods was among other things a funny thing  on the beautiful afternoon referred to the first six individuals above named were huddled together in a promiscuous heap behind a small bush in such a confused way that an ignorant spectator might have supposed that bounces head belonged to big wallers body and the artists shoulders to redhands head and their respective legs and arms to no one individually but to all collectively in a miscellaneous sort of way  the fact was that the bush behind which they were huddled was almost too small to conceal them all and being a solitary bush in the midst of a little plain of about a half a mile in extent they had to make the most of it and the least of themselves  it would have been a refreshing sight for a moralist to have witnessed this instance of man whose natural tendency is to try to look bigthus voluntarily endeavouring to look as small as possible  this bundle of humanity was staring through the bush with as the saying is all its eyes that is with six pairs ofor twelve individualeyes and they were staring at a wolfan enormous wolf that was slowly walking away from the bush behind which they were ensconced  it was a very singular wolf indeedone that was well calculated to excite surprise in the breast even of trappers  there was something radically wrong with that wolf especially about the legs its ears and head were all right and it had a tail a very good tail for a wolf but there was a strange unaccountable lump under its neck and its fore legs bent the wrong way at the knees and it seemed to have long feet trailing behind its hind legs besides being otherwise misshapen  the mystery is explained when we state that this wolf was none other than hawkswing down on his hands and knees with a wolfskin over his back and bertrams blunderbusspistol in his hand  he was creeping cautiously towards a herd of six or seven buffaloes that chanced to be feeding quietly there quite unconscious of the near proximity of so dangerous an enemy  i hope the old pistol wont miss fire whispered redhand as he observed that the wolf paused evidently for the purpose of examining the priming  i hope added bounce that the injun wont miss his aim  he bent used to pistols  never fear said march with a quiet grin  if he aims within a yard o the brute hes sure to hit for i loaded the old blunderbuss myself an its crammed nigh to the muzzle with all sorts o things includin stones  at this big waller stared and said emphatically itll bust  bertram felt and looked uneasy but bounce shook his head  them old things said he never bust  ive been forty years off an on in these parts an ive always obsarved that old irons o that sort dont bust cause why theyd ha busted wen they wos new if theyd bin goin to bust at all  the fact is they cant bust  theyre too useless even for that  how comes it inquired bertram that the buffaloes are not afraid of a wolf  i have been led to understand that wolves are the inveterate enemies of buffaloes and that they often attack them  to this question march whose head was in close proximity to that of the artist replied  ay the sneakin brutes will attack a single wounded or wornout old buffalo when it falls behind the herd and when there are lots o their lowminded comrades along with em but the buffaloes dont care a straw for a single wolf as ye may see now if ye pay attention to what hawkswings doin  bertram became silent on observing that the indian had approached to within about pistol range of the buffalo without attracting particular attention and that he was in the act of taking aim at its shoulder immediately a sharp click caused the buffalo to look up and apprised the onlookers that the faithless weapon had missed fire again hawkswing pulled the trigger and with a like result  by this time the buffalo having become alarmed started off at a run  once more the click was heard then the wolf rising on its hind legs coolly walked backed to its comrades behind the bush while the herd of buffaloes galloped furiously away  the indian solemnly stalked up to bertram and presented the pistol to him with such an expression of grave contempt on his countenance that march marston burst into an irresistible fit of laughter thereby relieving his own feelings and giving as it were direction to those of the others most of whom were in the unpleasant condition of being undecided whether to laugh or cry  to miss a buffalo was not indeed a new or in ordinary circumstances a severe misfortune but to miss one after having been three days without food with the exception of a little unpalatable wolfs flesh was not an agreeable much less an amusing incident  ill tell ye wot it is said bounce slapping his thigh violently and emphasising his words as if to imply that nobody had ever told anybody wot anything wos since the world began up to that time ill tell ye wot it is i wont stand this sort o thing no longer  it is most unfortunate sighed poor bertram who thoroughly identified himself with his pistol and felt as much ashamed of it as if the fault had been his own  wall lads observed big waller drawing forth his pipe as the only source of comfort in these trying circumstances and filling it with scrupulous care it aint of no use gettin growowly about it i guess there air more buffaloes than them wots gone mayhap well splinicate one before we gits more waspisher  it may perhaps be necessary to explain that wallers last word referred to the unusually small waists of the party the result of a pretty long fast  ill tell ye what it is said march advancing towards bounce with a swagger and drawing his huntingknife i quite agree with wallers sentiments  i dont mean to allow myself to get any more waspisher so i vote that we cut bounce up and have a feed  what say you comrades  all right replied bounce laying bare his broad chest as if to receive the knife only praps yell allow me to eat the first slice off myself afore ye begin cause i couldnt well have my share afterwards dye see  but now i think ont id be rather a tough morsel  young meats ginrally thought the tenderest  wot say ye to cuttin up march first an tryin me nixt  if youll only wait lads said redhand till mr bertram gits a new flint into his pistol well shoot the victim instead o cutting him up itll be quicker you know  hah non cried gibault leaping a few inches off the ground under the impulse of a new idea i vill show to you vat ve vill do  ve vill each cot hoff von finger  redhand he vill begin vid de thomb et so on till it come to me and i vill cot hoff mine leetle finger  each vill devour the finger of de oder an sove shall have von dinner vidout committing mordorha vat say you  as bertram had by this time arranged the lock of his pistol and reprimed it the hungry travellers resumed their weary march without coming to a decision upon this delicate point  it had happened that during the last few days the land over which they travelled being somewhat barren small game had become scarce and the large game could not be approached near enough to be shot with such weapons as the artists antiquated pistols and as the party possessed nothing better in the shape of a projectile they had failed to procure supplies  they had now however again reached a rich country and had succeeded in trapping a large wolf under the skin of which hawkswing had made as we have seen an unsuccessful effort to shoot a buffalo soon after this failure the party came to a ridge of gravelly soil that stretched across the plain like a wave  the plain or small prairie to which we refer was in the midst of a most lovely scene  the earth was carpeted with rich green grass in which the wild flowers nestled like gems  the ground was undulating yet so varied in its formations that the waves and mounds did not prevent the eyes of the travellers ranging over a vast tract of country even when they were down among the hollows and when they had ascended the backs of the ridges they could cast a wide glance over a scene of mingled plain and wood lake and river such as is never seen except in earths remotest wilds where man has not attempted to adorn the face of nature with the exuberances of his own wonderful invention  far away on the horizon the jagged forms and snowy peaks of the rocky mountains rose clear and sharp against the sky  for some days past the trappers had sighted this stupendous backbone of the far west yet so slowly did they draw near that march marston and bertram in their impatience almost believed they were a range of phantom hills which ever receded from them as they advanced  on reaching the summit of the gravelly ridge redhand looked along it with an earnest searching gaze  wots ado now inquired bounce  there ought to be prairiehens here replied the other  oh do stand still just as you are men cried bertram enthusiastically flopping down on a stone and drawing forth his sketchbook youll make such a capital foreground  the trappers smiled and took out their pipes having now learned from experience that smoking was not detrimental to a sketchrather the reverse  cut away gibault said bounce an take a look at the edge o yon bluff o poplars and willows  ive obsarved that prairiehens is fond o sich places  youll not be missed out o the pictur bein only a small objict dye see besides an ogly one  the jovial canadian acknowledged the compliment with a smile and obeyed the command leaving his companions to smoke their pipes and gaze with quiet complacency upon the magnificent scene  doubtless much of their satisfaction resulted from the soothing influence of tobacco on their empty stomachs  i say whispered waller removing his pipe and puffing from his lips a large cloud of smoke which rolled upwards in the form of a white ring i say bounce i guess its past my comprehension what he means by a foreground  how does we make a capital foreground  bounce looked at his companion in silence for a few seconds then he removed his pipe pursed his lips frowned heavily looked at the ground and repeated slowly how does we make a capital foreground  waller nodded  ay thats it  bounce resumed his pipe for a few seconds and then said with an air of the utmost profundity  dont you know  no i dont  wot  nothin about it wotiver  nothin wotsomdiver  hm thats okard said bounce once more applying to his pipe cause dye see its most orrible difficult to explain a thing to a feller as dont know nothin wotiver about it  if ye only had the smallest guess o  wall come i does know somethin about it interrupted waller  wots that inquired bounce brightening up  i calclate that i knows for certain it aint got no place wotiver in my onderstandin  hah exclaimed bounce  come then ill do my best for to explain it tye  heres wot it is  dye see mr bertram there  yes i does  an dye see yerself  wall i does replied waller looking complacently down at his huge limbs  good then dye see the ground over there continued bounce pointing with his pipe to the rocky mountains  waller nodded  now then said bounce in those deep earnest tones with which men usually attempt to probe the marrow of some desperately knotty question now then when mr bertrams a drawin of an tries to look at the ground over there you an me comes before the ground dye see an so were as ye may say beforegrounds  but men wot studies human natur an langwidges dye see comes for to know that words is always gittin onnecessary bits chopped off emsometimes at one end sometimes at tother  so they tuck off the b dye see an made it foreground and thats how we come to be foregrounds  oh said waller with the vacant air of a man who feels himself as wise at the termination as he was at the beginning of an explanation  yes resumed bounce thats how it is  i must confess for my part that i dont xactly see the advantage o us in that light  i should ha thought it would ha bin better to make us stand to one side dye see and let him see how the land lies  but theres no accountin for taste in this wurldive obsarved that iver since i was three fut two  having delivered himself of this graphic exposition of an abstruse subject bounce relapsed into silence and the whole party continued for some minutes in a profound reverie  from this felicitous condition they were awakened by the sudden appearance of black gibault who darted out of the poplar bluff and made towards them at the top of his speed  he uttered no cry but on coming near enough to permit of his features being clearly seen it was observed that his eyes were eagerly wide open and that his mouth was engaged in the formation of words  a second or two more and he was near enough to be heard uttering the word buffaloes in a hoarse whisper  ho boy wot ist cried bounce in an equally hoarse whisper  babuffaloes hah buffaloes cried gibault panting violently as he came up where be de leetle gun  he  monsieur bertram out vid it  where saw ye them asked redhand seizing the two pistols and examining the priming  jist oder side of de bluff  ver close to de bushes  queek queek vite mon garcon you is so drefful slow  the latter part of this sentence was addressed to hawkswing who was quietly putting on his wolfskin  although too slow for the hasty spirit of gibault the indian was quick enough for all useful purposes in three minutes he was in the clump of poplar trees behind which the buffaloes were reported to be feeding and in another minute he was out upon the plain creeping towards his victims while the rest of the party were again huddled together behind a bush looking on with deep interest and breathless attention  gradually and slowly the indian crept towards the buffaloes pausing and snuffing about from time to time as if he were a veritable wolf in search of something to eat  at last he had approached near enough to the herd to attract their attention but scarcely near enough to make sure of bringing one down  the huge unwieldy creatures looked up inquiringly for a moment but seeing only a solitary enemy they scorned to take further notice of him and went on feeding  hawkswing paused within a few yards of the side of a fat sleek animal and slowly raised his pistol  the trappers held their breath and bertram uttered a low groan of anxiety  one moment more and a white puff was followed by a loud crack and a bellow as the horrorstricken buffaloes tossed up their heels and fled wildly from the spot leaving one of their number in the agonies of death upon the plain  the knife of the indian hastened its end and with a rush and a yell of delight the whole party fell upon the luckless animal  it was a wonderful sight to see the way in which these experienced men flayed and cut up that buffalo  hawkswing without taking time to remove his wolfskin covering commenced upon the head and speedily cut out the tonguea more difficult operation than inexperienced persons would suppose  redhand and bounce began at the shoulders and big waller and gibault fell to work upon the flanks  march marston seized his axe and hastening into the bluff felled a dead pine and kindled a fire  as for bertram he sat down to sketch the whole with a degree of prompt facility and gusto that showed the habit had become second nature to him  the way in which these men wielded their bloody knives flayed and sliced dismembered and divided that buffalo is past beliefalmost beyond description  each man threw off his capote and tucked up his shirtsleeves to the elbows and very soon each had on a pair of bright red gauntlets  and the bloody appearance of hawkswings mouth proved that he had been anticipating the feast with a few titbits raw  the others were more patient  in very nearly as short a time as it takes to tell the buffalo was converted into a mass of fragments that were powerfully suggestive of a butchers shop and the trappers adjourned to a neighbouring rivulet to wash their hands and arms  now ill tell ye wot it is observed bounce while thus engaged i means for to have a most awful blow out and then go to sleep for fourandtwenty hours on end  ditto remarked big waller with a nod to which old redhand replied with a chuckle  an who be go to vatch tink you inquired gibault as they all returned to the camp  perhaps de injuns look out for usvat den  ah ye may well ask that gibault said redhand the fact is ive been thinkin that now were drawin near to enemies we must begin to keep better watch at night and to burn small fires o dry wood lest the smoke should tell a tale upon us  oh dont talk bam old feller said waller i guess well have watchin enough wen we gits into the mountains  lets take it easy here  well have one good blow out tonight anyhow cried march marston heaving a fresh pile of logs on the already roaring fire  now mr bertram do give up your scratchin tonight and lets see what you can do in the eatin way  im sure youve fasted long enough at least for the good o your health  the poor artist had indeed fasted long enough to give to his naturally thin and lank figure a threadpapery appearance that might have suggested the idea that he was evaporating  he smiled goodhumouredly when march marston who had now become rather familiar with him shut up his sketchbook and set him forcibly down before the fire all round which steaks and hunks of meat were roasting and grilling and sending forth an odour that would have rendered less hungry men impatient of delay  but they had not to wait long  each man sat before his respective steak or hunk gazing eagerly as skewered on the end of a splinter of wood his supper roasted hissingly  when the side next the fire was partially cooked he turned it round and fell to work upon that while the other side was roastingthus the cooking and the eating went on together  after a considerable time symptoms of satiety began to appear in the shape of an occasional remark  soon bounce uttered a deep sigh and announced his belief that having taken the edge off his appetite it was time to begin with the marrowbones  thereupon with the marrowbones he began and his example was quickly followed by his companions  there was a businesslike steadiness of purpose in the way in which that meal was eaten and in the whole of the procedure connected with it that would have been highly diverting to a disinterested spectator  when the feast was concluded the pipes made their appearance as a matter of course and when these were lighted and in full blast the trappers found leisure to look round upon each others faces with expressions of benignity  dat be a monstrobolly goot supper remarked gibault noir  gibault spoke with an effort  it was quite plain that moderation was a virtue that he did not possess in a high degreeat least not on the present occasion  youll need a monstrobolly good sleep arter it observed bounce quietly  you will jist said waller an so will this coon i cal  big waller was going to have calculated according to custom but sleepiness overpowered him at the moment and he terminated the word with a yawn of such ferocity that it drew from redhand a remark of doubt as to whether his jaws could stand such treatment long  every member of that party seemed to be quite contented and amiable but no one showed much inclination to talk and ere many minutes had passed half their number were under their blankets their heads pillowed on their bundles and their eyes sealed in sleep  a few minutes later and big waller sinking into a very sprawling and reckless posture with his back against the stem of a large cottontree dropped into a state of slumber with his pipe hanging gracefully from his lips  this seemed so picturesque to theodore bertram who sat immediately opposite to the yankee on the other side of the fire that he pulled out his sketchbook and began enthusiastically to sketch by the flickering light  while he was thus occupied the others lay down one by one and he was left at last the only waking member of the camp  but theodore bertram was human and this is tantamount to saying that he was not capable of ignoring the somnolent influences of human nature to his own extreme surprise his head fell forward with an abrupt nod while he was engaged in the act of depicting big wallers nose and he found on resuming work with an imbecile smile at what he deemed his weakness that that member of the yankees face was at least two feet long and was formed after the pattern of a somewhat irregular bologna sausage  indiarubber quickly put this to rights however and he set to again with renewed zeal  throwing back his head and looking up as if for inspiration his wideawake fell off and it required a sudden and powerful effort to prevent his head and shoulders falling in the same direction  having replaced his hat and shaken himself a little the persevering man once more applied himself to his task of finishing the yankees portrait which to say truth now presented a variety of jagged and picturesque outlines that savoured more of caricature than anything bertram had ever yet accomplished  for some time the pencil moved upon the paper pretty steadily and the artist was beginning to congratulate himself on his success when to his horror he observed that the tree against which the yankee leaned was in the act of falling over to the right  the same instant he received a shock upon the left side and awoke to find that he had fallen heavily upon poor gibaults breast and that waller and his tree were in statu quo  but gibault cared not he was too deeply intent upon sleeping to mind such trifles  bertram smiled meekly as he resumed his sitting posture but the smile faded and was replaced by a gaze of mute astonishment as he observed that he had depicted wallers right eye upon his chin close beneath his nose  there seemed to be some sort of magic here and he felt disposed to regard the thing in the light of some serious optical illusion when on closer inspection he discovered wallers mouth drawn altogether beyond the circle of his countenance a foot or so above his head on the stem of the tree against which he leaned  this changed the current of his thoughts and led him to believe that he must be dreaming under which impression he fell back and went to sleep  of course bertram recollected nothing after that but when gibault awoke next morning he found him lying on his back with his feet in the ashes of the extinct fire his tall brigandish wideawake perfectly flat beneath his shoulders and his sketchbook lying open across his face    chapter eight  a cache discoveredbertram becomes valorousfailure follows and a brief skirmish flight and separation are the results  the sun was high scattering the golden clouds in the bright sky gilding the hilltops flooding the plains vivifying vegetable life and gladdening the whole animal creation when on the following morning our wearied trappers raised their heads and began to think of breakfast  to do these trappers justice however we must add that their looks when they became wide enough awake to take full cognisance of the scenery indicated the presence of thoughts and emotions of a more elevated character though from the nature of their training from infancy they wanted words to express their feelings  it was otherwise with bertram and march marston  their exclamations the instant they arose showed that both their hearts were keenly alive to the good and the beautiful which surrounded themand their tongues were not altogether incapable of uttering the praise of him who clothes so gorgeously the lovely earth and peoples it with millions of happy creaturesyes happy creatures for despite the existence of death and sin and sorrow everywhere and the croaking of misanthropes there is much very much of pure overflowing happiness here below  come marchmr bertram time presses said redhand interrupting the two friends in the midst of earnest conversation weve got a long day before us and mayhap a fight with redskins at the end ot so it behoves us to make a good breakfast and set off as soon as we can were late enough already  ah redhand exclaimed march youre a terrible fellow for duty an business an all that sort o thing  its always time to be off or time to think o this or that or we mustnt put off with you  why wont ye let us take a breathin spell once in a way to enjoy ourselves eh  the old man pointed to the sun  youve enjoyed yourself late enough today hant ye  come march youre in a faultfinding humour this morning said bertram as they walked towards the camp  lets enjoy ourselves in spite of circumstances  do you know i hold it to be exceedingly wise as well as philosophical to make the best of things at all times  do you exclaimed march in a tone of affected surprise now thats odd  you must be a real clever fellow to have made up your mind on that point  but somehow or other im inclined to think that most o the trappers hereabouts are as wise as yourself on it though mayhap they dont say it just in the same words  theres waller now as ll tell ye that when he cant help it he guesses hell jist grin an bear it and theres an old irish trapper thats bin in the mountains nigh forty years now and whos alive at this dayif he beant deadthat used to say to himself when ill luck came upon him now terence be aisy boy an av ye cant be aisy be as aisy as ye can  so you see mr bertram we have got a few sparks of wisdom in these diggins  now then stop yer feelosophy cried bounce hitching his shoulders so as to induce his light load to take up a more accommodating position ye didnt use to be a slow feller march wots to do  ye aint agoin to cave in cause were gettin nigh the redskins are ye  to this march deigned no reply but swinging his bundle over his shoulder set off at a pace that speedily left his laughing comrades far behind  when in the course of an hour after they overtook him he was discovered lying flat on his back with his head resting on his bundle and smoking his pipe with an air of perfect satisfaction  during the course of that day the trappers walked about thirty miles towards the afternoon they came to a large river along the banks of which they pursued their way led by redhand who seemed as familiar with the country as if he had dwelt there from infancy  the old trappers kindly visage was lighted up with a smile of recognition ever and anon when some new and striking feature of the landscape opened up to view as if he had met with and were greeting some personal friend he spoke occasionally in a low tone to march who usually kept close to his side and pointed to spots which were associated in his memory with adventures of various kinds  but redhands observations were few  he preferred to listen to the conversations of his comrades as they plodded steadily along enlivening their march with many an anecdote and legend  at last redhand called a halt and gazed inquiringly around him as if in search of some object  wots up inquired bounce earnestly  it was hereabouts somewhere muttered redhand to himself rather than to his friend then added quickly as he threw down his pack ay there it isnever touched  now thats what i call luck  wots luck inquired waller  ah dat is de keevestion added gibault with a look of surprise  you must know lads said redhand turning to his comrades who observed his movements with considerable astonishment you must know lads there was an old chap who once trapped beavers up in them parts  oh its a hanikdot interrupted big waller then i guess wed as well sot down  so saying he seated himself on his bundle and as a matter of course proceeded to fill his pipe  the others followed his example with the exception of redhand who remained standing and of bertram who quickly opened his sketchbook that being the first opportunity he had enjoyed during the day of making an entry therein  right exclaimed bounce  its allers more feelosophical to sot than to standalso more ekornomical cause it saves yer moccasins  go on with yer story old man  it aint a story said redhand nor i dont think it can even be called an anecdote  well this old chap that once trapped beaver in them parts came down to pine point settlement one year with a load o furs sold em all off took a ragin fever and died  redhand paused and gazed dreamily at the ground  i say observed bounce seriously aint that wot ye may call raither a short hanikdotnot much in it eh  but before he died resumed redhand without noticing the interruption he sent for me an said redhand im goin onder an ive got some property as i dont want lost  ye know beaver creek  yes says i every fut of it  well then says he theres a spot there with three mounds on the right side o the creek and a tall poplar in front of em  i know it says i  well wen i last come from that part says he i made a cache at the foot o that poplar an put one or two things in which it ud be a pity to loseso i give em to you redhand  i was chased by injuns at the place so i couldnt stop to bring em away dye see  an what were the things ye put there said i  but he gave me no answer his mind began to wander and he never spoke sense again  now lads this is beaver creek and there stands the poplar in front o the three mounds  redhand pointed to the tree as he spoke and the others started up with alacrity for the little touch of romance connected with the incident combined with their comparatively destitute condition and their ignorance of what the concealed treasure might be powerfully stirred their curiosity  arming themselves with strong staves they began to dig away the earth at the roots of the poplar  after a few minutes hard work bounce rose to wipe the perspiration from his brow and said  wot for didnt ye tell us o this before redhand  because i wasnt sure the cache might not have bin discovered long ago and i didnt want to risk disappointin ye  hallo heres somethin exclaimed big waller as the point of the stake with which he tore up the earth struck against some hard substance  have a care boy cried bounce stooping down and clearing away the earth with his hands  praps its easy broken  nowhyits a keg  so it am cried gibault praps it am poudre  at this moment big waller and bounce gave the keg a violent tug and disentombed it an operation which proved gibaults surmise to be wrong for the shake showed that the contents were liquid  in a moment the plug was driven in and bounce putting his nose to the hole inhaled the result  he drew back with a look of surprise and said  brandy  ha here is one oder ting cried gibault laying hold of a bundle and dragging it to light  vat can dis be  the question was soon answered the string was cut the leathern cover unrolled and a considerable quantity of tobacco was disclosed to the view of the trappers whose looks showed pretty clearly that this latter discovery was much more agreeable than the former  after digging deep all round the tree they came to the conclusion that this was all that the cache contained  now said bounce after some talk in reference to their newlyfound treasure wots to be done with dis here keg o brandy  as for the baccy well carry that along with us of course an if master redhands a liberal feller well help him to smoke it  but the brandy kegs heavy an to say truth im not much inclined for it  i never wos fond o firewater  if youd allow me friends to suggest said bertram whose experience among trappers in other regions had convinced him that spirits was a most undesirable commodity i would recommend that you should throw this brandy away  i never saw good come of it  we do not require it for health neither do we for sickness  let us throw it away my friends it is a dangerous and deceitful foe  mais monsieur interposed gibault with a rueful countenance you speak de trooth but though hims be dangereux an ver bad for drink oftin yet ven it be cold vedder it doo varm de cokils of de hart  big waller laughed vociferously at this  i guess gibaults right said he it ud be a powerful shame to fling it away  well lads said redhand its evident that we cant drink it just now for it would unsteady our hands for the work we have to do this night  its also clear we cant carry it with us on a war expedition so i propose that we should put it where we found it an come back for it when weve done wi the redskins  this plan was finally agreed to the keg was reburied at the foot of the poplar and the party continued their journey carrying the muchprized tobacco along with them  the sun was still blazing above the mountains in the west tingeing their snowy spires with rosy red when the trappers came upon the first indication of the neighbourhood of indians in the shape of recent footprints and cuttings in the woods  a large canoe was also found lying bottom up on the bank of the creek  this redhand examined and found it to be in good condition although from the marks in the vicinity it was evident that it had not been recently used  men who spend their lives in the backwoods of america are celebrated for the closeness with which they observe every object and circumstance which happens to pass within the range of their perceptions  this habit and acuteness of observation is the result of necessity  the trapper and the red indian are alike dependent very much on this faculty for their sustenance and for their safety  surrounded as they are by perils of every kind their eyes and ears are constantly on the alert as they pass through the pathless wilderness on the hunt or on the war trail no object within the range of vision is passed with indifference everything is carefully yet quickly notedthe breaking of a twig the crushing of a blade of grass or the footprint of man or beast  hence the backwoodsman acquires the habit of turning all things in his path to account or notes them in case they should by any possibility be required by him at a future time  redhand had no definite object in view when with the assistance of march marston he lifted the canoe and placed it in the stream to ascertain that it was watertight and then replaced it on the bank with the paddles close beside it  but he had a general idea founded on experience that a good canoe was a useful thing in many supposable circumstances and that it was as well to know where such an article was to be found  we shall have to go cautiously now said he before resuming the march the injuns are not far off as ye may see by yonder thin line o smoke that rises above the trees on the mountain side  if they are the men we seek theyre sharp as foxes so well have to step like the painter  bertram looked up quickly at the last word then he smiled the next moment as he remembered that the panther was thus styled by trappers  proceeding cautiously forward in single file they at length gained a spot beyond which they could not advance without running the risk of being discovered  here another halt was made and here it was agreed that redhand should advance alone near enough to ascertain whether the indians whose camp they were approaching were actually the scamps who had robbed bertram of his horses  the old trapper was about to set forward when bertram stopped him  methinks old man said he it were well that i should accompany you on this expedition which i foresee is one of no little danger and as the danger is encountered chiefly on my account it seems to me right and fitting that i should share it along with you  besides two are better than one in a struggle whether mental or physical  redhand looked a little perplexed  he did not like to tell the poor artist that he was totally unfit to make a stealthy approach to an indian camp yet he felt that the danger of failure would be increased tenfold if he allowed him to make the attempt but bertram pleaded so earnestly and withal so resolutely that he at length consented on condition of his doing nothing but what he was desired to do and keeping as quiet as a mouse  this the artist promised to do and the two accordingly set forth armed with their knives and the two pistols bertram also carried his sword  the rest of the party were to remain in ambush until the return of the others  during the first part of their advance through the wood bertram trod as softly and carefully as an indian and watched every motion of his companion who led him down into a ravine which conducted them to within a few hundred yards of the camp  from the absence of such noises as the barking of dogs and shouts of children the old trapper conjectured that this must be either a party of trappers or a warparty of indians  a few minutes creeping on hands and knees through the underwood brought them to a spot whence the camp could be seen and showed that in the latter conjecture he was right  the red warriors forty in number were seated in a circle round their watchfire smoking their tomahawks in moody silence  to the eye of bertram they all seemed to be lost in dreamy reverie but redhand observed with a feeling of anxiety that he who seemed to be their chief sat in that peculiar attitude which indicates intense attention  laying his hand on bertrams shoulder the old man said in the faintest possible whisper  yonder sits the thief ant he  bertram at once recognised in the chief of the band before him big snake the indian who had stolen his horses and property so he nodded his head violently and looked excited but wisely refrained from speech lest his voice should be overheard  redhand shook his head  the thief said he in a tone that was scarcely audible has heard us i see by his face that he suspects he has heard something and he knows that it was not the falling of a leaf  if we break a twig now were done for  redhand meant this to be a salutary caution to his companion which would ensure a noiseless retreat  to men of his own stamp it would have been useful but he little knew the peculiar temperament of his friend the mere idea of the success of the whole expedition depending upon his extreme care unhinged the nerves of the poor artist who although absolutely a brave man in the true sense of the term could no more control his nervous system than he could perform an indian wardance he could have rushed singlehanded on the whole body of warriors with ease but he could not creep among the dry twigs that strewed the ground without trembling like an aspen leaf lest he should break one  it is wonderful however what necessity will enable men to do  bertram did creep after his friend back towards the spot where the rest of his party lay as softly and noiselessly as if he had been bred to the work from infancy  on regaining the edge of the ravine they rose and advanced in a crouching posture  then bertram sighed and felt that imminent danger was over  alas that feeling of partial security cost him dear  the step that succeeded the sigh was a careless one  his foot caught in a projecting root and next moment he went headforemost into the centre of a decayed bush with a crackling crash that was absolutely appalling in the circumstances  redhand cast upon the luckless man one glance of horror and uttering the words run for your life dashed down the bank and coursed along the bottom like a hare  at the same moment that terrific yell which has so often chilled the hearts blood of men and women in those western wilds rang through the forest telling that they were discovered and that the indians were in pursuit  bertram kept close to the heels of the old trapper at first but before he had run fifty yards he tripped and fell again  on attempting to rise he was seized and thrown violently to the ground by an indian warrior looking back and observing this redhand turned at once like a hare doubling on its course and rushed to the rescue but before he reached his friend he was surrounded by a dozen yelling indians  at the foremost of these he levelled his pistol but the faithless weapon missed fire and he was in the act of hurling it at his adversary when a blow from behind felled him to the ground  while this was going on the trappers were bounding to the succour of their comrades  when they came to the field of action and saw neither of their friends for they had been borne swiftly away and beheld an overwhelming band of armed savages rushing towards them they at once perceived that strength or courage could avail them nothing in such an unequal conflict so they turned and fled scattering themselves among the bushes so as to divert pursuit as much as possible  bounce and gibault were the only two who kept together  these made for the spot where the canoe had been left but the latter outran the former so quickly that he was soon lost to view ahead of him  in a few minutes bounce gained the bank of the stream and seized the end of the canoe to his amazement gibault was nowhere to be seen  but he had no time for thought for at that moment he was discovered by two indians who ran towards him  the canoe was launched and a paddle seized in an instant but the trusty trapper was loath even in his extremity to push off while his comrade might be in danger  ho  gibault  gibault noir he shouted  quick lad yer too late amost ho  grinding his teeth in an agony of anxiety he made a sudden dart at the foremost indian who little dreamed of such an attack and hit him with the paddle with all his force  the savage dropped like a stone and the paddle flew into a dozen splinters  this was a foolish act on the part of bounce for the second indian was now close upon him and seeing the fate of his companion he stopped short and hastily fitted an arrow to his bow  just then several of the savages burst from the wood with fierce cries  there was no time to lose  bounce turned pushed off the canoe and leaped in as an arrow grazed his neck  the bold trappers condition seemed hopeless for having broken the paddle to pieces he could not propel his little bark out of danger the stream was broad and rapid at that place and swept him away swiftly  immediately a shower of arrows fell around him some grazing his person and piercing his clothes and the canoe but fortunately not wounding him  meanwhile three of the indians darted downstream and throwing themselves into the current swam out so as to intercept the canoe as it passed  bounce having lain down at full length in the bottom of his tiny bark to avoid the arrows which were discharged at him did not observe these men and the first intimation he had of what was taking place was the canoe being nearly upset as a powerful savage laid hold of the side of it  to draw his knife and pass it round the wrist of the indian so as to sever the tendons was the work of a moment  the savage fell back with a yell of mingled rage and pain  the others seeing what had occurred wisely turned and made for the shore  this incident was the means of saving the trapper for the indians fearful of wounding their comrade had ceased to discharge their arrows and when they again ventured to do so a tumultuous rapid had caught the canoe and whirled it nearly over to the opposite shore  bounce watched his opportunity  as he swept near to a rocky point he sprang towards it with all his might  he fell short but happily the water did not reach above his knees  next moment he sprang up the bank and stood on the edge of the underwood where he paused and turning round shook his clenched fist at his enemies and uttered a shout of defiance  the disappointed indians gave vent to a fiendish howl and discharged a cloud of arrows most of which fell short of their mark  ere the last shaft had fallen harmless to the ground bounce had entered the forest and was gone  the wild man of the westby rm ballantyne    chapter nine  bounce cogitates upon the embarrassing circumstances of his condition discovery of black gibaultterrible fate in store for their comradesa mode of rescue planneddreadful effects of firewaterthe rescue  about ten minutes after making his escape from his indian foes bounce seated himself on the trunk of a fallen tree and began to think upon number one  a little red squirrel had been seated on the trunk of that tree just two minutes before his arrival  it was now seated on the topmost branch of a neighbouring pine looking with a pair of brilliant black eyes indignantly at the unceremonious intruder  possibly the reader may think that it was selfish of bounce at such a time to devote much attention to number one  he had just escaped he was in comparative safety he was free while there could be little or no doubt that his late companions were prisoners if not killed and that in the ordinary course of things they would eventually suffer death by torture  at such a time and in such circumstances it would be more natural even in a selfish man to think of any or of all the other numerals than number one  but reader i need scarcely tell you that things are not always what they seem  men are frequently not so bad as at a first glance they would appear to be  bounce always reasoned philosophically and he often thought aloud  he did so on this occasion to the immense edification of the little red squirrel no doubt  at least if we may judge from the way in which it glared and stared at the trapperpeeped at him round the trunk of the tree and over the branches and under the twigs and through the leaves jerking its body and quirking its head and whisking its tailwe have every reason to conclude that it experienced very deep interest and intense excitement  pleasure and excitement being with many people convertible terms we have no reason for supposing that it is otherwise with squirrels and therefore every reason for concluding that the squirrel in question enjoyed bounces visit greatly  now this is wot it comes to said bounce calmly filling his pipe from the mere force of habit for he had not at that time the most distant idea of enjoying a smoke  this is wot it comes to  savages is savages all the wurld over and they always wos savages an they always will be savages an they cant be nothin else  at this point bounce recollected having seen an indian missionary who had been taken when a boy from his fathers wigwam and educated and who had turned out as good and respectable a christian gentleman as most white men and better than many so he checked himself and said  leastwise they cant be nothin but savages soso long as they is savages  this argument although exceedingly obvious seemed even to his own mind to possess so little power that he endeavoured to enforce it by slapping his thigh with such energy that the body of the red squirrel nearly jumped out at its own eyes  it clasped the tree stem to its beating heart bravely however and judging from its subsequent conduct speedily recovered its selfpossession  thats how it is continued bounce an that bein the case savages always invariably thinks o number one before they thinks on anythin else  now as men judges theirselves so they judges of othersthats a fact as all feelosophy has preclaimed an all experience has pruven wot then  why them savages ll think ive cleared offmade tracks thankful to git away with my own skin whole and carin no more for my comrades than if they wos so many stumps  thinkin that of coorse theyll think its o no use to try to cross the river and give chase cause ive got a long start o em an so dye see theyll give me up an think no more about me  good very good  but praps its jest possble that feller whose paw i tickled may sometimes recall me to mind  this last idea tickled the trapper so powerfully that he chuckled in a quiet way and in doing so exposed such a double row of white teeth that the squirrel which had remained for some time in an attitude of deep attention began to show symptoms of uneasiness  now ill tell you wot ill do continued bounce resuming his look of grave anxiety as the thought of his comrades recurred to him ill go up the river till i comes to opposite the place where i shoved the canoe into the water  by the time i git there itll be dark then ill swum across an foller the redskins an save my comrades if i can  if i cant wot then why ill leave the scalp of bob ounce to dangle in the smoke of a redskins wigwam  we have elsewhere hinted that when a rocky mountain trapper makes up his mind to do a certain thing he usually does it at once  having settled the plan of his future proceedings bounce did not waste more time in thought or speech  he thrust his unsmoked pipe into his bosom leaped up from the trunk of the fallen tree and darted from the spot with such sudden promptitude that the horrified squirrel sprang wildly into empty space and vanished from the scene for ever  for a quarter of an hour bounce glided noiselessly through the forest keeping a course parallel with the river  in the deepening gloom of evening he appeared more like a spectre than a human beingso quick and agile were his motions as he flitted past the tree stems yet so noiseless the tread of his moccasined feet  the bushes were thick and in places tangled compelling him to stoop and twist and diverge right and left as he sped along but being unencumbered with weapons or weight of any kind he advanced so rapidly that in the short space of time we have mentioned he stood opposite to that part of the bank where the attack had been made and below which he had been swept for a great distance in the canoe by the rapid stream  here he spent some time in reconnoitring the opposite bank but without gathering much information from his observations  no symptom of the presence of human beings could be discovered  no column of smoke rising above the trees to tell of the watchfire of white man or red  the trapper listened intently then he bethought him for the first time of giving the signal which at setting out on their journey they had agreed to use in all circumstances of danger  it was the low howl of a wolf followed immediately by the hoot of an owl  the reply to it was to be the hoot of the owl without the cry of the wolf when danger should be imminent and extreme caution necessary or the howl of the wolf alone if danger should have passed away  to the first utterance of the signal no reply was made  after waiting a few seconds bounce gave it forth again  immediately after the low howl of a wolf was heard on the opposite bank and a figure appeared at the edge of the river  darkness prevented the trapper ascertaining who it was but a repetition of the cry convinced him that it could be none other than black gibault  with a grunt of satisfaction bounce at once proceeded to make preparations for crossing the river  cutting a large piece of bark from a neighbouring tree he hastily formed it into a species of dish or flat boat then stripping off all his garments he tied them up in a tight bundle and placed them in this miniature canoe after which he plunged boldly into the stream and made for the opposite shore pushing his little ark before him  in five minutes he had crossed and entered into a hasty conversation with gibault in low eager tones while pulling on his clothes  first of all lad said bounce laying his hand impressively on the others shoulder are they all safenone killed  non dey be all alive for certain  im thankful for thatvery thankful  now go ahead lad and tell me what ye know while i pull on my leggins  vell dey be alive as i have say  mais dey not live long  gibault said this with such a look of woebegone despair that bounce paused in the midst of his dressing and said with much anxietywots

very much and looked wild and haggard for his nature was sensitive and sympathetic and the idea of his comrades meeting with such a horrible fate was almost too much for him  bounces honest face assumed an expression of deep anxiety for fertile though his resources usually were he could not at that moment conceive how it was possible for two unarmed men either by force or by stratagem to rescue five comrades who were securely bound and guarded by forty armed warriors all of whom were trained from infancy in the midst of alarms that made caution and intense watchfulness second nature to them  it looks bad said bounce sitting down on a stone clasping his hard hands together and resting an elbow on each knee  sit ye down gibault  well think a bit an then go to work  thats wot well do dye see  non i dont see groaned gibault  vat can ve do  two to forty  if it was only swords ve had to fight vidhah  but alas we have notingdey have everyting  true lad force wont do returned bounce an yit he added knitting his brows if nothin else ll do well try at least how much force ll do  after a short pause bounce resumed wos they tied very tight gibault  oui  i see de cords deep in de wrists an poor redhand seem to be ver moch stunned he valk as if hims be dronk  drunk exclaimed bounce suddenly springing up as if he had received an electric shock and seizing his companion by both shoulders while for a moment he gazed eagerly into his eyes then pushing him violently away he turned round and darted along the bank of the river crying as he went come along gibault ill tell ye wots up as we go  the astonished canadian followed as fast as he could and in an exclamatory interjectional sort of way his friend explained the plan of rescue which he had suddenly conceived and which was as follows  first he proposed to go back to the cache at the foot of the tall tree and dig up the keg of brandy with which he resolved to proceed to the camp of the indians and by some means or other get the whole clan to drink until they should become intoxicated  once in this condition he felt assured they could be easily circumvented  gibault grasped at this wild plan as a drowning man is said to grasp at a straw and lent his aid right willingly to disentomb and carry the brandy keg  neither he nor bounce knew whether there was enough brandy to intoxicate the whole tribe but they had no time to inquire minutely into probabilities  vigorously perseveringly without rest or halt did these two trappers pursue their way that night with the keg slung on a pole between them the stars glimmered down through the trees upon their path as if they wished them success in their enterprise  it was allimportant that they should reach the indian camp before daybreak so although footsore and weary from their late exertions after a long days march they nevertheless ran steadily on at a long swinging trot which brought them to their inexpressible joy much sooner than they had anticipated to their journeys end  it was two hours before dawn when they came suddenly upon the campso suddenly that they had to crouch the instant they saw the watchfires in order to avoid being discovered  now gibault whispered bounce youll have to remain here  get into a hidingplace as fast as you can and keep close  youre clever enough to know what to do and when to do it  only lad come near and have your knife handy when the row is at the loudest and see that ye dont let the squaws cut out our livers when were tied up  gibault nodded significantly  its a curious fact continued bounce in a somewhat sad tone that im more afraid o the squaws than o the men  howsomdiver its got to be done  so saying bounce shouldered the keg and shaking his comrade by the hand as if he felt that he might be parting with him for ever he glided into the darkness of the forest leaving gibault to secrete himself on the side of a mound from which he could witness all that went on in the camp  from this point of observation the poor canadian beheld what was not calculated to allay his fears  the camp lay in a hollow surrounded by trees  on an open space were erected several leathern huts or tents in the midst of which blazed a large camp fire  round this the forty warriors were seated eating their supper while a number of squaws were sitting in the entrances to their tents variously engaged  horses hobbledthat is with the forefeet tied together to prevent their running awaywere cropping the grass close to the tents  not far from them and within the circle of light cast around by the fire stood a group of small trees  to each of these was tied a man and gibault had no difficulty in making them out to be his unfortunate comrades  occasionally as he gazed one or two of the old indian women went up to these helpless men with a yell of execration and brandishing scalpingknives before their faces appeared as if about to plunge them into their hearts but their time had not yet come the hags were only anticipating the feast of butchery that awaited them on the morrow  while gibault was gazing at this scene with mingled feelings of anxiety rage and horror the whole band of indians suddenly sprang to their feet and seized their weapons  almost at the same moment bounce strode into the circle of light and deposited his cask on the ground  then making signs of peace he advanced towards one of the indians who from his dress and appearance seemed to be the chief and presented him with a piece of tobacco  the chief accepted the gift in silence  bounce who was well acquainted with many of the dialects of that region had no difficulty in making himself understood  he stated that he was a trapper that he had come to that country to trade and asked whether his indian friends had furs to dispose of  as he had anticipated the savages were in no mood to treat with a solitary man who was entirely in their power  the chief who evidently suspected that he was a friend of the prisoners instead of replying asked him sarcastically what he had in the keg  firewater replied bounce unhesitatingly  at this the eyes of the savages sparkled with delight  not deigning to waste more time with him they seized the unfortunate trapper and confronted him with his companions gazing earnestly in their faces the while to observe whether they betrayed any sign of recognition  it said much for the selfcontrol of these hardy men that although their comrade was thus suddenly and unexpectedly placed before them they did not permit a muscle of their countenances to change but gazed on him and on his captors with that expression of defiant contempt with which indians usually meet their fate and in which they are equalled sometimes even outdone by the unfortunate white trappers who chance to fall into their cruel hands  and well was it for the success of the scheme that theodore bertrams nerves had received such repeated and awful shocks that day that they were now incapable of feeling  he had been so terribly and repeatedly struck with amazement that his features had assumed a settled expression of surprise that could not be increased so that when he beheld bounce a prisoner before him although he certainly felt astonishment he could by no means increase the expression of that sensation  the indians therefore passed away from him with a howl of derision and tied bounce to a tree beside his comrades concluding that instead of a plotter they had in him made another lucky capture  anxiety to taste their beloved beverage had something to do with their haste in this matter no doubt  no one who has not seen it can conceive of the intense passion the north american indian has for ardent spirits  he seems to have no power of restraint whatever when the opportunity of indulging that passion presents itself  the head of the keg was quickly knocked in and the eyes of the savages seemed positively to flash as they gazed upon the precious fluid  the chief advanced first with a little tin mug such as was sold to them by traders and drank a deep draught he then handed the cup to another but the impatience of the others could not be restrainedthey crowded round with their mugs and dipping them into the keg drank eagerly while the squaws who loved the firewater as much as did their masters formed an outer circle and as patiently as they could awaited their turn  they knew full well that it would soon come  the indians being unaccustomed to frequent potations were quickly maddened by the spirit which mounted to their brains and rushed through their veins like wildfire causing every nerve in their strong frames to tingle  their characteristic gravity and decorum vanished  they laughed they danced they sang they yelled like a troop of incarnate fiends  then they rushed in a body towards their prisoners and began a species of wardance round them flourishing their tomahawks and knives close to their faces as if they were about to slay them shrieking and howling in the most unearthly manner and using all those cruel devices that are practised by red indians to terrify those unfortunates whom they intend ultimately to kill  suddenly one of the warriors observed that the squaws were stealthily approaching the spirit keg and rushed towards them with a howl of fury followed by his comrades who drove the women away and recommenced drinking  and now a fiercer spirit seemed to seize upon the savages old feuds and jealousies that had long been cherished in silence broke irresistibly forth  angry words and fierce looks were followed by the drawing of knives  suddenly a young man rushed upon a comrade and buried his knife in his heart  the piercing deathcry was followed by the vengeful yell of the relatives of the murdered man as they sprang upon the murderer  others flew to the rescue and the drunken melee became general  blood began to flow freely and there is no doubt that many lives would have been sacrificed had not the combatants been too much intoxicated to fight with vigour  many of them fell prostrate and helpless on attempting to rise  others dealt their blows at random staggering and falling one upon another until they lay in a heap shrieking biting tearing and stabbinga bloody struggling mass which told more eloquently than tongue can tell that deep and low though savage human nature has fallen in sin and misery there is a depth profounder still to which even those who seem to be the lowest may be precipitated by the fatal power of strong drink  and now gibault noir felt that it was time for him to draw near to the horrible scene in order to be ready when the moment should arrive to release the prisoners or to protect them in the event of any of the drunken crew being tempted to a premature slaughter  the women were now actively interfering to prevent further bloodshed most of the indians were already dead drunk  only a few whose powers of endurance were greater than those of their comrades continued to shout their warsongs  when these were down the women rushed at the spirits like wolves  even the little children came out from the tents and got their share  it was a terrible scene such as has alas been often enacted before in the wilds of the far west and doubtless shall be enacted again unless socalled christian traders give up firewater as an article of traffic  in a very short space of time the women were as helpless as their masters  then gibault cut the thongs that bound his comrades and set them free  thanks thanks to the almighty said bertram earnestly when his bonds were cut  i had thought that my days were numbered that it was to be my sad fate to fill a grave here in the wilderness  but his hand is indeed mighty to save  and thanks be to you good gibault  under god we owe our lives to you  bertram attempted to seize gibaults hand as he spoke but his own hands refused obedience to his will  they had been so long and so tightly bound that they were utterly powerless  rub em rub em well said gibault seizing the artists hands and enforcing his own recommendation vigorously  ay thats it said redhand who with his companions had the instant he was loose commenced to rub and chafe his own benumbed limbs into vitality as if his life and theirs depended on their exertionsas indeed they did to no small extent for had they been called upon to fight or fly at that moment they could have done neither  now lads said bounce who having been a prisoner for but a short time was unhurt by his bonds while ye rub the life into yer limbs ill tell ye wot we must do  them scamps pointing to the prostrate indians wont lie there long  of course bein white men an christians we dont mean to kill them or to lift their scalps  ive knowd white men interrupted redhand who called themselves christians and didnt object to take scalps when they got the chance  so have i returned bounce an mores the pity  its sichlike blackguards as these that keeps honest trappers and furtraders for iver in hot water here  howsomdiver were not agoin to turn ourselves into brute beasts cause theyve turned theirselves into sich  im not so sure o that broke in big waller casting a scowling glance on the savages as he surveyed a wound in his left arm which although not serious was from want of dressing sufficiently painful i calclate it would serve them reptiles right if we was to whangskiver the whole on em as they lie  i dont blieve retorted bounce that whangskiver is either english injun french or yankee but if it means killin youll do nothing o the sort  heres what well do  well ketch as many horses as wos took from mr bertrams fellers an as many guns too the same ones if we can lay hands on em an as much powder an shot an other things as that keg o brandy is worth an then well bid the redskins goodbye without wakenin of em up  goot ejaculated gibault pausing in his manipulation of the artist now you can do  capital thanks i feel quite strong again  i say gibault observed march ruefully theyve almost sawed through the skin o my ankle  ive no left foot at all as far as feelin goes  hah me boy tis well you have foot left though you not feel left foot  let me see  thats it gibault rub away if your jokes were as good as your surgery youd be too good a long way for the backwoods  by dint of chafing and rubbing and leaping and stamping the whole party were soon restored to a serviceable condition after which they set about active preparations for departure  first they ransacked the tents where they discovered all the guns that had been taken from bertrams party  these they tied up in a bundle after each had secured one for his own use  among them the artist found to his intense delight his own doublebarrelled gun the loss of which he had mourned most sincerely  next they secured the horses which being hobbled as we have said elsewhere were easily caught  then the powderhorns and shotbelts of bertrams party were found and being full of ammunition were slung across their shoulders forthwith  among other things belonging to the same party were discovered a number of blankets some tea and sugar and a variety of other useful articles besides several packs of furs all of which were made up into portable bundles that could be easily carried at their saddlebows  the supply of everything was so ample that it was not necessary to touch a single article belonging to the indians  this was a matter of much satisfaction to redhand who wished to show these unfortunate children of the wilderness that there were at least some white trappers who were actuated by different and kindlier feelings than many who sought their livelihood in those regions  hullo wot have we here cried big waller who was poking inquisitively about among the tents to the consternation of the poor indian children who lay huddled up in their rabbitskin blankets trembling from head to foot and expecting to be scalped forthwithsuch of them at least as were old enough to expect anything  heres your blunderbusses i guess mister  what my pistols cried bertram seizing his weapons with as much delight as if they had been really serviceable  hah ver goot for play vid observed gibault contemptuously  i say heres something else said bounce picking up a rifle  wah exclaimed hawkswing pointing to the weapon in surprise and turning his eyes on redhand  wot dye know who it blongd to inquired bounce  an expression of deep sorrow overspread redhands countenance  ay said he mournfully i know it well  it belonged to young blake glancing quickly up at a place where several scalps were hanging to a pole he took one down and after gazing at it sadly for a few seconds he added in a tone of deep melancholy poor poor blake ye had a hearty spirit an a kindly heart  your huntin days were soon over  was he a friend of yours inquired bertram affected by the old trappers look and tone  ay ay he was he was said redhand quickly and with a sternness of manner that surprised his companions come lads mount mount  the redskins wont part with plunder without making an effort to get it back  but stop a bit redhand cried bounce detaining the old man ye didnt use for to be so hot an hasty  where are we to go to  thats wot i want to know  true observed redhand in his old gentle tones weve more horses than we need and some furs to dispose of  theres a tradin fort in the mountains but its a good bit from this  what o that said march marston somewhat impetuously  are we not armed and well mounted and strong and have we not lots o time before us  well said cried bounce  ditto echoed waller  then well do it cried redhand vaulting into the saddle with a spring that a young man might have envied  the others followed his example and in a few seconds they were picking their way carefully down the ravine in which the indian camp was situated  leaving this quickly behind they trotted briskly along the more open banks of the river until they gained a level sweep of land which terminated in a belt of low bushes  beyond this lay the great plains  breaking into a gallop they speedily cleared the underwood and just as the rosy smile of morning beamed in the eastern sky they dashed away with light hearts and loose reins out upon the springy turf of the open prairie    chapter ten  short treatise on horsefleshremarks on slangdoings and sights on the prairiethe mountain fort  a horse is a wonderful thingif we may presume to style so noble a creature a thing  and the associations connected in some minds with a horse are wonderful associations  no doubt a horse to many people is a commonplace enough sort of thing and the associations connected with horseflesh in general in some minds are decidedly lowhaving relation to tugging a cart or tumbling along with a plough or rattling with a cab or prancing in a carriage or being cut up into butchers meat for cats and dogs  nevertheless a horse is a wonderful creature and mans associations in connection with him are not infrequently of the most wonderful and romantic kind  talk to the warrior of his steed and he will speak of him as of his dearest friend  talk to the arab of his horse and he will talk of his pet his spoiled child  as it is with these so is it with the trapper of the western prairies  after a few weeks acquaintance the trapper and his horse become one part and parcel of each other at least as far as it is possible for man and horse to amalgamate  on the one hand the horse is tended hobbled patted saddled spoken to watched over and tenderly cared for by the man on the other hand the man is carried respected sometimes bitten playfully depended on and loved by the horse  day after day and week after week the limbs of the one and the ribs of the other are pressed against each other until they become all but united and the various play of muscles on the part of both becomes so delicately significant that the bridle to a great extent becomes unnecessary and the rider feels when the horse is about to shy just as quickly as the horse feels by a gentle pressure on either side how much the rider wishes him to diverge to the right or left  sometimes the horse breaks his hobbles and runs away thus aggravating the spirits of and causing infinite annoyance to the man  frequently the man out of revenge for such or similar freaks larrups and pains and worries the horse  but these little asperities are the occasional landmarks that give point and piquancy to the even tenor of their loving career  neither would for a moment think of allowing such incidents to rankle in his bosom  both would repudiate with scorn the idea that they were a whit less useful or in any degree less attached to each other on account of such trifling tiffs  day after day our trappers mounted their steeds and traversed the great prairienow at a rattling trot now at a tearing gallop frequently at a quiet footpace when the nature of the ground rendered a more rapid progress dangerous or when the exhaustion of horses and men rendered rest necessary or when the beautiful nature of the scenery and the warm sunny condition of the atmosphere induced a contemplative frame of mind and a placid state of body  night after night the horseshaving stuffed themselves like greedy things as they were with the greenest and tenderest herbage on the rich plainsreturned to the camp fire round which the trappers were lying in deep slumber and each selecting his own master would stand over him with drooping head and go to sleep until dawn called them again to united action  thus day and night passed for the space of three weeks after the night of the surprise of the indian camp without anything particular occurring and thus quadrupeds and bipeds came to be familiar and well acquainted with each otherso thoroughly united in sympathetic action as almost to become hexapeds if we may be permitted the expression  march marstons quadruped was a beautiful little bay whose tendency to bound over every little stick and stone as if it were a fivebarred gate and to run away upon all and every occasion admirably suited the tastes and inclinations of its mercurial rider  there was one among the quadrupeds which was striking in appearancenot to say stunning  no we wont say stunning because that is a slang expression and many persons object to slang expressions therefore we will avoid that word although we confess to being unable to see why if it is allowable as every one will admit it is to assert that men may be mentally struck it is not equally proper to say that they may be stunned  but we bow to prejudice  we wont say that that horse was stunning  while on this subject we think it right to guard ourself parenthetically from the charge of being favourable to all kinds of slang  we are in favour of speechyes we assert that broadly and fearlessly without reservationbut we are not in favour of all speech  coarse speech for instance we decidedly object to  so we are in favour of slang but not of all slang  there are some slang words which are used instead of oaths and these besides being wicked are exceedingly contemptible  tempting however they aretoo apt to slip from the tongue and from the pen and to cause regret afterwards  but to return  although we wont say that the quadruped in question was stunning we will say again that it was strikingso powerfully striking that the force of the stroke was calculated almost to stun  it was uncommonly tall remarkably short in the body and had a piebald coat moreover it had no tailto speak ofas that member had in some unguarded moment got into the blaze of the camp fire and been burnt off close to the stump  the stump however was pretty long and at the time when the trappers became possessed of the animal that appendage was covered with a new growth of sparsely scattered and very stiff hair about three inches long so that it resembled a gigantic bottlebrush being a spirited animal the horse had a lively bottlebrush which was grotesque if it was nothing else  this quadrupeds own particular biped was theodore bertram  he had a peculiar liking for it as he had for everything picturesque not only on account of its good qualitieswhich were an easy gait and a tender mouthbut also because it was his own original animal that of which he had been deprived by the indians and which he had recaptured with feelings akin to those of a mother who recovers a longlost child  we have said that the space of three weeks passed without anything particular occurring to our trappers  this remark however must be taken in a limited sense  nothing particularly connected with the thread of this story occurred though very many and particularly interesting things of a minor nature did occur during the course of that period  it would require a work equal in size to the encyclopaedia britannica to contain all the interesting things that were said and seen and done on those prairies by these trappers within that brief space of time  a conscientiously particular chronicler of events would have detailed the route of each day the latitude and longitude of each restingplace the very nature of the wood which composed the fuel of each fire  he would have recorded that march marstons little bay ran away with himnot in a general way fifty or a hundred times but exactly so many times specifying the concomitant circumstances of each separate time and the results of each particular race  he would have noted with painful accuracy the precise number of times in which theodore bertram being a bad rider fell off his horse or was pitched off in consequence of that quadruped putting its foot inadvertently into badger holes  he would have mentioned that on each occasion the unfortunate artist blackened his eye or bled or skinned his nasal organ and would have dilated anatomically on the peculiar colour of the disfigured orb and the exact amount of damage done to the bruised nose  he would have told not only the general fact that bears and elks and antelopes and prairie dogs and wolves and buffaloes were seen in great numbers continually and were shot in abundance but he would have recorded that bertram did on one occasion in the height of his enthusiastic daring give a shout and draw one of his blunderbusspistols on observing a grisly bear at a short distance ahead of him that he dashed his heels violently against the sides of his remarkable horse that the said horse did toss his head shake his bottlebrush and rush full tilt towards the bear until he caught sight of it when he turned off at a sharp angle leaving bertram on the plain at the mercy of the bear that bruin who was in nowise alarmed observing his condition came to see what was the matter with him and that he mr bertram would certainly have fallen a victim to his own headstrong courage on the one hand and to the bears known tendency to rend human beings on the other had not march come up at that moment and shot it through the heart while redhand shot it through the brain  and this supposed conscientious chronicler of events had he been a naturalist would have further detailed with graphic particularity the rich exuberant and varied flora of the regionfrom the largest plant that waved and blossomed in the prairie winds to the lowliest floweret that nestled among the tender and sweetscented grasses on the prairies breast  in regard to the fauna of those regions he would have launched out upon the form the colour size habits peculiarities etcetera of every living thing from the great buffalo which he would have carefully explained was not the buffalo but the bison down to the sly impudent yet harmless little prairie dog which he would have also carefully noted was not the prairie dog but the marmot  had this supposed recorder of facts been of an erratic nature given to wander from anecdote to description and vice versa he would perhaps have told in a parenthetical sort of way how that during these three weeks the trappers enjoyed uninterrupted fine weather how the artist sketched so indefatigably that he at last filled his book to overflowing and had to turn it upside down begin at the end and sketch on the backs of his previous drawings how big waller and black gibault became inseparable friends and sang duets together when at full gallop the latter shrieking like a wildcat the former roaring like a buffalo bull how march marston became madder than ever and infected his little steed with the same disease so that the two together formed a species of insane compound that caused redhand and bounce to give vent to many a low chuckle and many a deep sagacious remark and induced hawkswing to gaze at itthe compoundin grave astonishment  all this and a great deal more might be told and no doubt might prove deeply interesting  but as no man can do everything so no man can record everything therefore we wont attempt it but shall at once and without further delay proceed to that part of our tale which bears more directly on the rocky mountains and the wild man of the west himself  its a strong place said redhand checking the pace of his horse and pointing to a small edifice or fort which stood on the summit of a little mound or hill about a quarter of a mile in advance of thema very strong placesuch as would puzzle the redskins to break into if defended by men of ordinary pluck  men of pluck sometimes get careless and go to sleep though said march marston riding up to the old trapper ive heard o such forts bein taken by redskins before now  so have i lad so have i returned redhand ive heard o a fort bein attacked by injuns when the men were away huntin an bein burnt down  but it ginerally turns out that the whites have had themselves to thank fort  ay thats true observed bounce some o the whites in them parts is no better nor they should be  they treats the poor injuns as if they wos dogs or varmints an then theyre astonished if the redskins murder them out o revenge  i knowd one feller as told me that when he lived on the west side o the mountains where some of the injuns are a murderin set o thieves he niver lost a chance o killin a redskin of course the redskins niver lost a chance o killin the whites an so they come to sich a state o war that they had to make peace by givin them no end o presents o guns an cloth an beadsenough to buy up the furs o a whole tribe  i guess they was powerful green to do anything o the sort said big waller  i knowed a feller as was in command of a party o whites who got into much the same sort of fix with the injunsalways fightin and murderin so what does he do think ye  shooted de chief and all hims peepil suggested gibault  nothin o the sort replied waller  he sends for the chief an gives him a grand present an says he wants to marry his darter  an so he did marry his darter right off an the whites an redskins was friends ever after that  the man what did that was a gentleman tooso they said tho for my part i dont know wot a gentleman isno more do i blieve there aint sich a thing but if there be an it means anything good i calclate that that man wos a gentleman for wen he grew old he took his old squaw to canada with him spite the larfin o his comrades who said hed have to sot up a wigwam for her in his garden  but he says no says he i married the old ooman for better an for worse an ill stick by her to the last  theres too many o you chaps as leaves yer wives behind ye when ye go homeim detarmined to sot ye a better example  an so he did  he tuk her home an put her in a grand house in some town in canadai dont well mind which but when he wasnt watchin of her the old ooman would squat down on the carpet in the drawinroom for dye see she hadnt bin used to chairs  his frinds used to advise him to put her away an the kindlier sort said he should give her a room to herself and not bring her into company where she warnt at ease but no the old man said always shes my lawful wedded wife an if she was a buffalo cow id stick by her to the lastan so he did  vraiment he was von curous creetur observed gibault  see they have descried us exclaimed bertram pointing to the fort which they were now approaching and where a bustle among the inhabitants showed that their visitors were not always peacefully disposed and that it behoved them to regard strangers with suspicion  would it not be well to send one of our party on in advance with a white flag observed bertram  no need for that replied redhand theyre used to all kinds o visitorsfriends as well as foes  i fear however from the haste they show in closing their gate that they aint on good terms with the injuns  the redmen and the palefaces are at war said hawkswing  ay youre used to the signs no doubt returned redhand for youve lived here once upon a time i blieve  the indian made no reply but a dark frown overspread his countenance for a few minutes  when it passed his features settled down into their usual state of quiet gravity  have ye ever seed that fort before inquired bounce in the indian tongue  i have answered hawkswing  many moons have passed since i was in this spot  my nation was strong then  it is weak now  few braves are left  we sometimes carried our furs to that fort to trade with the palefaces  it is called the mountain fort  the chief of the palefaces was a bad man then  he loved firewater too much  if he is there still i do not wonder that there is war between him and the redmen  thats bad said bounce shaking his head slowlyvery bad for the redskins ll kill us if they can on account o them rascally furtraders  howsomdiver we cant mend it so we must bear it  as bounce uttered this consolatory remark the party cantered up to the open space in front of the gate of the fort just above which a man was seen leaning quietly over the wooden walls of the place with a gun resting on his arm  hallo shouted this individual when they came within hail  hallo responded bounce  friends or foes and where from inquired the laconic guardian of the fort  friends replied redhand riding forward we come from the yellowstone  have lost some of our property but got some of it back and want to trade furs with you  to this the sentinel made no reply but looking straight at big waller inquired abruptly are you the wild man  wot wild man said waller gruffly  why the wild man o the west  no i haint said waller still more gruffly for he did not feel flattered by the question  have you seen him  no i haint an guess i shouldnt know him if i had  why do you ask inquired march marston whose curiosity had been roused by these unexpected questions  cause i want to know replied the man quitting his post and disappearing  in a few minutes he opened the gate and the trappers trotted into the square of the fort  the mountain fort in which they now dismounted was one of those little wooden erections in which the hardy pioneers of the fur trade were wont in days of old to establish themselves in the very heart of the indian country  such forts may still be seen in precisely similar circumstances and built in the same manner at the present day in the hudsons bay territories with this difference that the indians having had long experience of the good intentions and the kindness of the palefaces no longer regard them with suspicion  the walls were made of strong tall palisades with bastions built of logs at the corners and a gallery running all round inside close to the top of the walls so that the defenders of the place could fire over the palisades if need be at their assailants  there was a small iron cannon in each bastion one large gate formed the entrance but this was only opened to admit horsemen or carts a small wicket in one leaf of the gate formed the usual entrance  the buildings within the fort consisted of three little houses one being a store the others dwellinghouses about which several men and women and indian children besides a number of dogs were grouped these immediately surrounded the trappers as they dismounted  who commands here inquired redhand  i do said the sentinel before referred to pushing aside the others and stepping forward at least i do at present  my names mcleod  he who ought to command is drunk  hes always drunk  there was a savage gruffness in the way in which mcleod said this that surprised the visitors for his sturdylooking and honest countenance seemed to accord ill with such tones  an may i ask who he is said redhand  oh yes his names macgregoryou cant see him tonight though therell be bloody work here before long if he dont turn over a new leaf  mcleod checked himself as if he felt that he had gone too far  then he added in a tone that seemed much more natural to him now sirs come this way  here turning to the men who stood by look to these horses and see them fed  come into the hall friends an the squaws will prepare something for you to eat while we have a smoke and a talk together  so saying this changeable man who was a strange compound of a trapper and a gentleman led the way to the principal dwellinghouse and throwing open the door ushered his guests into the reception hall of the mountain fort    chapter eleven  original efforts in the art of paintingfurtrading hospitality wonderful accounts of the wild man of the west from an eyewitness buffalo hunting scalping murdering and a summary method of inflicting punishment  the reception hall of the mountain fort into which as we have stated the trappers were ushered by mcleod was one of those curious apartments which were in those days and in a few cases still are created for the express purpose of astonishing the natives  it was a square room occupying the centre of the house and having doors all round which opened into the sleeping or other apartments of the dwelling  in the front wall of this room were the door which led direct into the open air and the two windows  there were no passages in the houseit was all rooms and doors  one of these doors towards the back opened into a species of scullerybut it was not exactly a scullery neither was it a kitchen neither was it a pantry  the squaws lived thereespecially the cooking squawsand a few favoured dogs  a large number of pots and pans and kettles besides a good deal of lumber and provisions in daily use also dwelt there  a door led from this room out to the back of the house and into a small offshoot which was the kitchen proper  here a spirited french canadian reigned supreme in the midst of food fire and steam smoke smells and fat  but to return to the reception hall  there were no pictures on its walls no draperies about its windows no carpets on its floors no cloths on its tables and no ornaments on its mantelshelf  indeed there was no mantelshelf to put ornaments upon  the floor the walls the ceiling the chairs the tables all were composed of the same materialwood  the splendour of the apartment was entirely due to paint  everything was paintedand that with a view solely to startling effect  blue red and yellow in their most brilliant purity were laid on in a variety of original devices and with a boldness of contrast that threw moorish effort in that line quite into the shade the alhambra was nothing to it  the floor was yellow ochre the ceiling was skyblue the cornices were scarlet with flutings of blue and yellow and underneath a broad belt of fruit and foliage executed in an extremely arabesque style  the walls were light green with narrow bands of red down the sides of each plank  the table was yellow the chairs blue and their bottoms red by way of harmonious variety  but the grand pointthe great masterpiece in the ornamentation of this apartmentwas the centrepiece in the ceiling in the execution of which there was an extraordinary display of what can be accomplished by the daring flight of an original genius revelling in the conscious possession of illimitable power without the paralysing influence of conventional education  the device itself was indescribable  it was a sun or a star or rather a union and commingling of suns and stars in violent contrast wreathed with fanciful fruits and foliage and cupids and creatures of a now extinct species  the rainbow had been the painters palette genius his brush fancygonemad his attendant the total temporary stagnation of redskin faculties his object and ecstasy his general state of mind when he executed this magnificent chef doeuvre in the centre of the ceiling of the reception hall at the mountain fort  the fireplace was a capacious cavern in the wall opposite the entrance door in which during winter there usually burned a roaring bonfire of huge logs of wood but where at the time of which we write there was just enough fire to enable visitors to light their pipes  when that fire blazed up in the dark winter nights the effect of that gorgeous apartment was dazzlingabsolutely bewildering  the effect upon our trappers when they entered was sufficiently strong they gazed round in amazement each giving vent to his feelings in his own peculiar exclamatory grunt or gasp or cough  in addition to this bounce smote his thigh with unwonted vigour  gibault after gazing for a few minutes sighed out something that sounded like magnifique and bertram grinned from ear to ear  he went further he laughed aloudan impolite thing to do in the circumstances and for a grave man like him an unusual ebullition of feeling  but it was observed and noted that on this occasion the artist did not draw forth his sketchbook  mcleod who from his speech and bearing was evidently a man of some education placed chairs for his visitors took the lid off a large canister of tobacco and pushing it into the middle of the yellow table said  sit ye down friends and help yourselves  he set them the example by taking down his own pipe from a nail in the wall and proceeding to fill it  having done so he took a piece of glowing charcoal from the fire and placing it on the bowl began to smoke glancing the while with an amused expression on his grave face at the trappers who while filling their pipes kept gazing round the walls and up at the ceiling  ha said he you are struck with our hall puff puff  its rather puff an effective one puff  have a light  bounce to whom the light was offered accepted the same applied it to his pipe and said  well yes puff it is puff raither wot ye may call puff pecooliar  most visitors to this place think so said mcleod  the indians highly approve of it and deem me quite a marvel of artistic power  wot did you paint it inquired waller  i did answered mcleod with a nod  vraiment de injuns am right in deir opinion of you cried gibault relighting his pipe which in the astonished state of his mind he had allowed to go out  mcleod smiled if we may so speak gravely in acknowledgment of the compliment  ha cried gibault turning to bertram as if a sudden thought had occurred to him monsieur bertram et monsieur mak load you be broders oui monsieur mak load dis mine comradehim be von painteur  indeed said mcleod turning to the artist with more interest than he had yet shown towards the strangers  i have indeed the honour to follow the noble profession of painting said bertram but i cannot boast of having soared so high asas  as to attempt the frescoes on the ceiling of a reception hall in the backwoods interrupted mcleod laughing  no i believe you sir but although i cannot presume to call you brother professionally still i trust that i may do so as an amateur  i am delighted to see you here it is not often we are refreshed with the sight of the face of a civilised man in these wild regions  upon my word sir you are plainspoken said march marston with a look of affected indignation what do you call us  pardon me young sir replied mcleod i call you trappers which means neither civilised nor savage neither fish nor flesh nor fowl  thats a foul calumny cried bounce knocking the ashes out of his pipe and refilling it from the canister its wot may be called a a  lie suggested waller  no said bounce it aint that  i dont like that word  its a ugly word an you shouldnt ought to use it waller  its a error thats wot it is in a feelosophical pint o view  jest as much of a error now as it was in you mister mcleod putting so little baccy in this here thing that there aint none left  what is it all done cried mcleod rising and seizing the canister so it is  i declare you smoke almost as fast as the wild man himself for whom i mistook you mr waller when i saw you first at some distance off  saying this he left the room to fetch a further supply of the soothing weed and at the same moment two squaws appeared bearing smoking dishes of whitefish and venison  that fellow knows something about the wild man o the west said march marston in a low eager tone to his comrades  twice has he mentioned his name since we arrived  so he has observed redhand but there may be other wild men besides our one  unpossible said bounce emphatically  ditto cried waller still more emphatically what say you hawkswing  there is but one wild man of the west replied the indian  by the way hawkswing what was the name o the rascally trader you said was in charge o this fort when you lived here asked redhand  mokgroggir replied the indian  ha macgregor ye mean no doubt  hawkswing nodded  here you are friends said mcleod reentering the room with a large roll of tobacco  help yourselves and dont spare it  theres plenty more where that came from  but i see the steaks are ready so let us fall to we can smoke afterwards  during the repast to which the trappers applied themselves with the gusto of hungry men march marston questioned mcleod about the wild man  the wild man o the west said he in some surprise is it possible there are trappers in the rocky mountains who have not heard of him  oh yes said march hastily weve heard of him but we want to hear more particularly about him for the accounts dont all agree  ha thats it said bounce speaking with difficulty through a large mouthful of fish thats it  they dont agree  one says his rifle is thirty feet long another forty feet an so on  theres no gittin at truth in this here  a bone having stuck in bounces throat at that moment he was unable to conclude the sentence  as to the length of his rifle said mcleod when the noise made by bounce in partially choking had subsided you seem to have got rather wild notions about that and about the wild man too i see  but he is a giant isnt he inquired march anxiously  nnot exactly  certainly he is a big fellow about the biggest man i ever sawbut hes not forty feet high  march marstons romantic hopes began to sink  then hes an ordinary man just like one o us he said almost gloomily  nay that he is not returned mcleod laughing  your comrade waller does indeed approach to him somewhat in height but hes nothing to him in breadth and as for ferocity strength and activity i never saw anything like him in my life  he comes sometimes here to exchange his furs for powder and lead but hell speak to no one except in the sharpest gruffest way  i think hes mad myself  but he seems to lead a charmed life here for although he has had fights with many of the tribes in these parts he always puts them to flight although he fights singlehanded  singlehanded exclaimed bounce in surprise  ay  ive seen him at it myself and can vouch for it that if ever there was a born fiend let loose on this earth its the wild man of the west when he setsto to thrash a dozen indians  but i must do him the justice to say that i never heard of him making an unprovoked attack on anybody  when he first came to these mountains many years agobefore i came herethe indians used to wonder who he was and what he meant to do  then after a while seeing he had a good horse a good rifle and plenty of ammunition they tried to kill him but the first fellow that tried that only tried it once  he lay in a close thicket nigh to where the wild man used to pass from his home in the mountains to places where he used to hunt the elk and the buffalo so when he came up the indian laid an arrow on his bow  but the wild mans eye was sharp as a needle he stopped his horse took aim like a flash of lightning and shot him through the head  i heard this from another indian that was with the murderin fellow that was shot  the wild man did nothing to the other he let him escape  of course the relations of the man who was killed were up immediately and twenty of them set out to murder the wild man  they took their horses spears and bows with them and lay in wait at a place where he was often seen passing  sure enough up he came on horseback at a slow walk looking as careless and easy as if no blood of a redskin rested on his hand  it chanced the day before that day that we had run out of fresh meat so mr macgregor our commandant here ordered me to take three of the men and go out after the buffaloes  away we went looking sharp out however for some of the indians had been treated by macgregor so brutally i am sorry to say that we knew our scalps were not safe next morning i happened to pass close by the place where the indians lay in ambush and we came to the top of a precipice that overlooked the spot  we saw them before they saw us so we went quietly back into the bush tied our horses to trees and lay on the edge of the cliff to watch them  in about ten minutes after we saw the wild man riding slowly forward he was a strange sight  it was the first time i had seen him although i had often heard of him before  well on he came with his head bent and his eyes fixed on the ground a dense thicket hid his enemies from him though not from us we being so high above them  the wild man was armed with his long rifle slung at his back a huntingknife and a small shield such as the blackfoot indians use to protect themselves from arrows  the only unusual sort of weapon he carried was a long sword  not knowing at the time that the indians were waiting for him of course i gave no alarm to warn him of his danger  when he came within a hundred yards of the thicket i saw him push his arm a little further into the handle of the shield  it was but a slight action such as one might perform to ease the arm by change of position but the redskins are quickwitted  they knew that he suspected they were there so giving one tremendous yell they sent a cloud of arrows at him and sprang out upon the plain at full gallop with their spears lowered  instead of turning to fly from such an unequal combat the wild man drew his sword and rushed at them like a thunderbolt  his onset was the most awful thing i ever saw in my life  the plain seemed to shake under the tread of his gigantic horse  his hair streamed wildly out behind him and as he was coming towards me i could see that his teeth were set and his eyes flashed like those of a tiger  the indians were appalled by the sight  the idea of one man attacking twenty had never occurred to them  they drew up but it was too late to prevent a shock  there was a yell from the savages a shout like the roar of a lion from the wild man and two horses and their riders lay on the plain  i saw the long sword gleam for one moment just as the shock took place and the head of a savage rolled immediately after along the ground  the indians though overawed were brave men  they turned to pursue the flying horseman but they needed not  the wild man was not flying he was only unable at first to check the headlong pace of his charger in a few seconds he wheeled about and charged again  the indians however did not await the issue they turned and fled and they have ever since remained in the firm belief that the wild man is a great medicine man and that no one can kill him  they say that neither arrows nor bullets can pierce his skin which is an inch thick that fire and smoke come out of his mouth and eyes and that his horse is like himself invulnerable  i must confess however that with the exception of his enormous size and his ferocity he is from what i saw of him much the same as other men  mcleod concluded his description of this singular being to which his guests listened openeyed and mouthed and helped himself to a buffalosteak  an what did he when the indians ran away inquired march marston  oh he quietly pulled up his horse and let them run  after they were gone he continued his journey as slow and cool as if nothing had happened  few indians attack him now except new bands from distant parts of the country who dont know him but all who meddle with him find to their cost that it would have been better had they let him alone  is he cruel  does he eat men and childers inquired bounce commencing a fourth steak with a degree of violent energy that suggested the possibility of his being himself able to do some execution in the cannibal line if necessary  mcleod laughed  oh dear no hes not cruel  neither does he eat human flesh  in fact he has been known to do some kind acts to poor starving indians when they least expected it  the real truth is that he is only fierce when hes meddled with  he never takes revenge and he has never been known to lift a scalp  but what like is he when he comes to trade his furs at the fort here how does he speak and in what language inquired marston who although delighted with the account given of the strength and valour of the wild man of the west was by no means pleased to learn that he was not an absolute giant something like the giant despair of whom he had read in the pilgrims progress  hes just like a trapperonly hes a tremendous big onesix feet six if hes an inch and would make two of the biggest of the present company round the shoulders  but hes very silent and wont let any one question him  the long and the short of it is that i believe he is a madmanluckily hes a welldisposed madman and i can vouch for it he is a crack hunter though he dont bring many furs to trade  i think he spends most of his idle time in moping among the caves of the mountains  does any one know where he lives asked bertram who was gradually becoming interested in this strange being  no  we have sometimes tried to track him but at a certain place we have invariably lost all traces of him  but what is his face like and how does he dress inquired march eagerly you have not yet said anything about that  mcleod was about to reply when he was interrupted by a loud shouting in the yard of the fort  leaping from their seats the whole party ran to the windows  i thought so cried mcleod seizing his cap and hurrying out  these are six of my men who have been out after the buffalo and i see they have been successful  the fort gate had been swung open and just as the guests issued from the reception hall six hunters galloped into the square with all the reckless noise and dash peculiar to that class of men  leaping from their foaming steeds they were quickly surrounded by their comrades and by the women and children of the place who congratulated them on their success in the chase and plied them with eager questions  that they had indeed been successful was evident from the masses of fresh meat with which the horses were laden  well done davis said mcleod stepping up to one of the men who from his age and intelligence had been put in command of the hunting party  you are back sooner than i anticipated  surely your good genius sent the buffalo across your path  we have bin in luck sir replied the hunter touching his cap weve killed more than we could carry an whats worse weve killed more than we wanted  how so  weve had a brush wi the redskins sir an we had to kill one or two in selfdefence  mcleods brow darkened  he clenched his teeth and the large veins swelled in his neck and forehead  with a powerful effort he repressed his anger and said  did i not warn you to avoid that if you could  true sir replied davis humbly but we could not help it for in the first heat of passion one o them was shot an after that of course we had to fight to save our own scalps  who fired that first shot inquired mcleod sternly  davis made no reply but all eyes were at once turned upon a tall slouching man with a forbidding cast of countenance who had hitherto kept in the background  so so larocque said mcleod stepping up to the man youve been at your bloody work again you scoundrel  hah you not only bring the enmity of the whole indian race down on your own worthless head and on the heads of your innocent companions but you have the effrontery to bring the evidence of your guilt into this fort along with you  as mcleod spoke he laid hold of a scalp which still dropped fresh blood as it hung at the hunters saddlebow  if im to answer to you for every scalp i choose to lift in selfdefence the sooner i quit you the better answered larocque sulkily  was there any occasion to lift this scalp at all demanded mcleod as he seized the man by the collar  who talks of lifting scalps growled a loud deeptoned voice  all eyes were instantly turned on the speaker and the crowd fell back to permit mr macgregor the person in command of the mountain fort to approach the scene of action  the man who now appeared on the scene was a sad and a terrible sight to behold  he was one of that wretched class of human beings who having run a long course of unbridled wickedness become total wrecks in body and mind long before the prime of manhood has been passed  macgregor had been a confirmed drunkard for many years  he had long lost all power of selfcontrol and had now reached that last fearful stage when occasional fits of delirium tremens rendered him more like a wild beast than a man  being a large and powerful man and naturally passionate he was at these times a terror to all who came near him  he had been many years in charge of the furtrading establishment and having on many occasions maltreated the indians he was hated by them most cordially  one of his mad fits had been on him for some days before the arrival of march marston and his friends  he had recovered sufficiently to be able to stagger out of his room just at the time the buffalo hunters as above described entered the square of the fort  as he strode forward with nothing on but his shirt and trousers his eyes bloodshot his hair matted and dishevelled and his countenance haggard in the extreme he was the most pitiable and at the same time most terrible specimen of human degradation that the mind of man could conceive of  what now who has been lifting scalps he growled between his set teeth striding up to larocque and glaring in his face with his bloodshot eyes like a tiger  mcleod held up the bloody scalp  who did it roared macgregor  i did said larocque with an attempt at a defiant air  the words had barely passed his lips when he received a blow between the eyes that felled him to the earth  he attempted to rise but with a yell that sounded more like the warcry of a savage than the wrathful shout of a civilised man macgregor knocked him down again and springing at his throat began to strangle him  up to this point mcleod refrained from interfering for he was not sorry to see the murderer receive such severe punishment but having no desire to witness a second murder he now seized his master and with the assistance of two of the men succeeded in tearing him off from larocque and in conveying him as respectfully as possible in the circumstances to his private chamber    chapter twelve  an argument on argumentationalso on religionbounce feelosophical againa race cut short by a bulletflight and pursuit of the redskins  when mcleod returned to the square he found that the trappers had adjourned with the men of the establishment to enjoy a social pipe together and that theodore bertram was taking a solitary meditative promenade in front of the gate of the fort  you seem in a pensive mood mr bertram said the fur trader on coming up will you not try the soothing effects of a pipe  our tobacco is good i can recommend it  he offered a plug of tobacco to the artist as he spoke  thank you i do not smoke said bertram declining the proffered luxury  tobacco may be goodthough i know it not from experience yet methinks the man is wiser who does not create an unnatural taste than he who does so for the purpose of gratifying it  ah you are a philosopher  if judging of things and questions simply on their own merit and with the single object of ascertaining what is truth in regard to them constitutes a philosopher i am  dont you find that men who philosophise in that way are usually deemed an obstinate generation by their fellowmen inquired the trader smiling as he puffed a voluminous cloud from his lips  i do replied bertram  and dont you think the charge is just continued the other in a jocular tone  i do not replied the artist  i think those who call them obstinate are often much more truly deserving of the epithet  philosophers in the popular sense of the word are men who not only acquire knowledge and make themselves acquainted with the opinions of others but who make independent use of acquired knowledge and thus originate new ideas and frequently arrive at new conclusions  they thus often come to differ from the rest of mankind on many points and having good reasons for this difference of opinion they are ever ready to explain and expound their opinions and to prove their correctness or to receive proof of their incorrectness if that can be givenhence they are called argumentative  being unwilling to give up what appears to them to be truth unless it can be shown to be falsehood their opinions are not easily overturnedhence they are called obstinate  thinking out a subject in a calm dispassionate logical manner from its first proposition to its legitimate conclusion is laborious to all  a very large class of men and women have no patience for such a process of investigationhence argumentation that most noble of all mental exercises is deemed a nuisance  certainly argumentation with unphilosophical persons is a nuisance but i know of few earthly enjoyments more gratifying than an argument with a true philosopher  thats wot i says so i do outanout observed bounce who had come up unperceived and had overheard the greater part of the above remarks jist wot i thinks myself mr bertram only i couldnt xactly put it in the same way dye see  thats wot i calls outanout feelosophy  glad to hear youre such a wise fellow said mcleod patronisingly so you agree of course with mr bertram in condemning the use of the pipe  condemn the pipe said bounce pulling out his own special favourite and beginning to fill itwot condemn smokin  no by no means wotsomdiver  thats quite another keewestion wot we haint bin a disputin about  i only heerd mr bertram atalkin about obstnitness an argementation  well in regard to that said bertram i firmly believe that men and women are all alike equally obstinate  ha ejaculated bounce with that tone of mingled uncertainty and profound consideration which indicates an unwillingness to commit oneself in reference to a new and startling proposition  on what grounds do you think so asked mcleod  why on the simple ground that a man cannot change any opinion until he is convinced that it is wrong and that he inevitably must and actually does change his opinion on the instant that he is so convinced and that in virtue not of his will but of the constitution of his mind  some mens minds are of such a naturethey take such a limited and weak grasp of thingsthat they cannot be easily convinced others are so powerful that they readily seize upon truth when it is presented to them but in either case the instant the point of conviction is reached the mind is changed  pride may indeed prevent the admission of this change but it takes place as i have said inevitably  at this bounce opened his eyes to their utmost possible width and said solemnly wot do ye mean for to tell me then that thair aint no sich thing as obstinacy  he accompanied this question with a shake of the head that implied that if bertram were to argue till doomsday he would never convince him bounce of that  by no means returned the artist smiling there is plenty of it but obstinacy does not consist in the simple act of holding ones opinion firmly  wot does it consist of then  in thisin holding firmly to opinions that have been taken hastily up without the grounds on which they are founded having been duly weighed and in refusing to consider these grounds in a philosophical which means a rational way because the process would prove tiresome  the man who has comfortably settled all his opinions in this way very much resembles that fool of whom it is written that he is wiser in his own conceit than seven men who can render a reason  well but to come back to the startingpoint said mcleod many wise men smoke  if you say that in the way of argument i meet it with the counter proposition that many wise men dont smoke  hah ejaculated bounce but whether bounces ejaculation was one of approval or disapproval we cannot tell  neither can we tell what conclusion these philosophers came to in regard to smoking because just then two horsemen were seen approaching the fort at full speed  seeing that they were alone mcleod took no precautions to prevent surprise  he knew well enough that indians frequently approach in this manner so waited in front of the gate coolly smoking his pipe until the savages were within a few yards of him  it seemed as if they purposed running him down but just as they came to within a couple of bounds of him they drew up so violently as to throw their foaming steeds on their haunches  leaping to the ground the indianswho were a couple of strong finelooking savages dressed in leathern costume with the usual ornaments of bead and quill work tags and scalplockscame forward and spoke a few words to mcleod in the cree language and immediately after delivering their horses to the care of one of the men of the establishment accompanied him to the store  in less than half an hour they returned to the gate when the indians remounted and starting away at their favourite pacefull gallopwere soon out of sight  them fellows seem to be in a hurry remarked bounce as they disappeared  ay theyre after mischief too replied mcleod in a sad tone of voice they are two cree chiefs who have come here for a supply of ammunition to hunt the buffalo but i know they mean to hunt different game for i heard them talking to each other about a warparty of blood indians being in this part of the country  depend upon it scalps will be taken ere long  tis a sad sad state of things  blood blood blood seems to be the universal cry here and now that weve had so many quarrels with the redskins i fear that the day is not fardistant when blood will flow even in the mountain fort  i see no prospect of a better state of things for savage nature cannot be changed  it seems a hopeless case  there was a touch of pathos in the tone in which this was said that was very different from mcleods usual bold and reckless manner  it was evident that his natural disposition was kind hearty and peaceable but that the constant feuds in which he was involved both in the fort and out of it had soured his temper and rendered him wellnigh desperate  you are wrong sir in saying that their case is hopeless said bertram earnestly  there is a remedy  i wish you could show it me replied the trader  here it is returned the artist taking his little testament from the inside pocket of his huntingshirt  the gospel is able to make all men wise unto salvation  mcleod shook his head and said it wont do here  to be plain with you sir i dont believe the gospels of any use in these wild regions where murder seems to be as natural to man woman and child as food  but sir rejoined bertram you forget that our saviour himself says that he came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance  in this volume we are told that the blood of christ cleanseth us from all sin and not only have we his assurance that none who come unto him shall be cast out but we have examples in all parts of the known world of men and women who were once steeped to the lips in every species of gross iniquity having been turned to the service of god through faith in christ and that by the power of the holy spirit who in this word of god is promised freely to them that simply ask  it may be so returned mcleod i have not studied these things much i dont profess to be a very religious man and i cannot pretend to know much of what the gospel has done elsewhere but i feel quite sure that it cannot do much here  then you do not believe the bible which says distinctly that this gospel is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth  ay but these wretched indians wont believe objected the trader  true answered bertram they have not faith by nature and they wont because they cant believe but faith is the gift of god and it is to be had for the asking  to that i answer that theyll never ask  how do you know  did you ever give them a trial  did you ever preach the gospel to them  no i never did that  then you cannot tell how they would treat it  your remarks are mere assertions of opinionnot arguments  you know the wickedness of the indians and can therefore speak authoritatively on that point but you know not according to your own admission the power of the gospel therefore you are not in a position to speak on that point  mcleod was about to reply when he was interrupted by the approach of mr macgregor who had now recovered somewhat from the effects of his violent fit of passion  having observed during the melee that strangers had arrived at his fort he had washed and converted himself into a more presentable personage and now came forward to the group of trappers all of whom had assembled at the gate  addressing them in a tone of affable hospitality he said  goodday friends im glad to see you at the mountain fort  that blackguard larocque somewhat ruffled my temper  hes been the cause of much mischief here i assure you  do you intend to trap in these parts  the latter part of this speech was addressed to redhand who replied  we do mean to try our luck in these parts but we hant yet made up our minds exactly where to go  mayhap youll give us the benefit of your advice  while he was speaking the fur trader glanced with an earnest yet half stupid stare at the faces of the trappers as if he wished to impress their features on his memory  advice he replied youre welcome to all the advice ive got to give ye and its thisgo home go to where you belong to sell your traps and rifles and take to the plough the hatchet the forehammerto anything you like so long as it keeps you out of this macgregor paused a moment as if he were about to utter an oath then dropped his voice and said this wretched indian country  i guess then that we wont take yer advice old man said big waller with a laugh  old man echoed macgregor with a start  wall if ye beant old ye aint exactly a chicken  youre a plainspoken man replied the trader biting his lips  i always wos retorted waller  macgregor frowned for a moment then he broke into a forced laugh and said  well friends youll please yourselves of coursemost people do and if you are so determined to stick to the wilderness i would advise some of you to stop here  theres plenty of fun and fighting if youre fond of that  what say you now lad turning to march to remain with us here at the mountain fort  ive taen a sort of fancy to your face  we want young bloods here  ill give you a good wage and plenty to do  thanks you are kind replied march smiling but i love freedom too well to part with it yet awhile  mais monsieur cried gibault pushing forward pulling off his cap and making a low bow if you vants yonger blod an also ver goot blod here am von  the trader laughed and was about to reply when a sudden burst of laughter and the sound of noisy voices in the yard interrupted him presently two of the men belonging to the establishment cantered out of the square followed by all the men women and children of the place amounting probably to between twenty and thirty souls  a race a race shouted the foremost  hallo  dupont whats to do inquired mcleod as the two horsemen came up  please monsieur lincoln have bet me von gun dat hims horse go more queek dan mineso we try  yes so we shall i guess added the man named lincoln whose speech told that he was a yankee  go it stranger i calclate youll do him slick cried waller patronisingly for his heart warmed towards his countryman  ah non  go home put your horse to bed cried gibault glancing at the yankees steed in contempt  dis is de von as vill do it more slicker by far  well well clear the course we shall soon see cried mcleod  now thenheres the wordone twoaway  at the last word the riders whips cracked and the horses sprang forward at a furious gallop  both of them were good spirited animals and during the first part of the race it could not be said that either had the advantage  they ran neck and neck together  the racecourse at the mountain fort was a beautiful stretch of level turf which extended a considerable distance in front of the gates  it crossed a clear open country towards the forest where it terminated and sweeping round in an abrupt curve formed as it were a loop so that competitors after passing over the course swept round the loop and reentering the original course again came back towards the fort where a long pole formed the winningpost  dupont and lincoln kept together as we have said for some time after starting but before they had cleared the first half of the course the former was considerably in advance of the latter much to the delight of most of the excited spectators with whom he was a favourite  on gaining the loop above referred to and making the graceful sweep round it which brought the foremost rider into full side view the distance between them became more apparent and a cheer arose from the people near the fort gate  at that moment a puff of smoke issued from the bushes  dupont tossed his arms in the air uttered a sharp cry and fell headlong to the ground  at the same instant a band of indians sprang from the underwood with an exulting yell  lincoln succeeded in checking and turning his horse before they caught his bridle but an arrow pierced his shoulder ere he had galloped out of reach of his enemies  the instant dupont fell a savage leaped upon him and plunged his knife into his heart  then passing the sharp weapon quickly round his head with his right hand with his left he tore the scalp off and leaping up shook the bloody trophy defiantly at the horrified spectators  all this was accomplished so quickly that the horrorstricken people of the mountain fort had not time to move a finger to save their comrade but as the savage raised the scalp of poor dupont above his head redhands rifle flew to his shoulder and in another moment the indian fell to the earth beside his victim  seeing this the other indians darted into the forest  then a fearful imprecation burst from the lips of macgregor as with a face convulsed with passion he rushed into the fort shouting to horse to horse men and see that your horns and pouches are full of powder and ball  the commotion and hubbub that now took place baffle all description the men shouted and raved as they ran hither and thither arming themselves and saddling their horses while the shrieks of poor duponts widow mingled with those of the other women and the cries of the terrified children  half a dozen of you must keep the fort said mcleod when they were all assembled the others will be sufficient to punish these fiends youll help us i suppose  this latter question was addressed to redhand who with his comrades stood armed and ready to mount  ready sir answered the trapper promptly  mcleod looked round with a gleam of satisfaction on the stalwart forms of his guests as they stood each at his horses head examining the state of his weapons or securing more firmly some portion of his costume  mount mount shouted macgregor galloping at that moment through the gateway and dashing away in the direction of the forest  staymy sketchbook cried bertram in an agony at the same time dropping his reins and his gun and darting back towards the hall of the fort  git on lads ill look arter him said bounce with a grin catching up the bridle of the artists horse  without a moments hesitation the remainder of the party turned and galloped after macgregor who with the most of his own men had already wellnigh gained the edge of the forest  in a few seconds bertram rushed wildly out of the fort with the sketchbook in one hand and the two blunderbusspistols in the other in leaping on his horse he dropped the latter but bounce picked them up and stuck them hastily into his own belt  now put that book into its own pouch or yell be fit for nothin said bounce almost sternly  bertram obeyed and grasped the rifle which his friend placed in his hand  then bounce vaulted into his saddle and ere those who were left behind had drawn the bolts and let down the ponderous bars of the gate of the mountain fort the two horsemen were flying at full speed over the plain in the track of the avengers of blood who had gone before them    chapter thirteen  the pursuitconscientious scruples of the artiststrategic movements surprised in the wildcat passmarch shows coolness and pluck in the hour of dangera terrific onslaught by a wonderful warriorthe battlehard knocks and mysterious differences of opinion  crossing the open ground in front of the mountain fort bounce and bertram entered the wood beyond and traversed it with comparative ease by means of a bridlepath which had been cut there by the furtraders a few minutes gallop brought them to the other side of the wood which was one of those narrow strips or clumps of forest which grow more or less thickly on the skirts of the rocky mountains forming that fine picturesque region where the prairie and the forest meet and seem to contend for the mastery  the plain beyond this belt of wood was open and levelat least sufficiently so to enable the two horsemen to see for a considerable distance around them  here in the far distance they descried their companions sweeping over the turf at their utmost speed and making towards a low hill or ridge that intercepted the view of the more distant country  theyll have to draw in a bit said bounce turning to his comrade horses no more nor men cant go helterskelter up a hill without takin breath so rouse up your beast mr bertram an well overtake em afore they gits to the tother side  bertram obeyed his friends command but made no rejoinder his thoughts being too deeply engaged at that moment in a controversy with his conscience as to the propriety of the business he had then in hand  the young artist had a deep veneration for abstract truthtruth pure and simple not only in reference to morals but to all things terrestrial and celestial and he was deeply impressed with the belief that what was right was right and what was wrong was wrong and could not by any possibility be otherwise  he felt also that the man who recognised truth and acted upon it must go right and he who saw and did otherwise must go wrong  holding this simple creed very tenaciously and as we think very properly bertram nevertheless found that his attempts to act up to it frequently involved him in a maze of perplexities  on the present occasion as he and bounce thundered over the green turf of the flowering plains scattering the terrified grasshoppers right and left and causing the beautifully striped groundsquirrels to plunge with astonishing precipitancy into their holes he argued with himself that the mere fact of a murderous deed having been done was not a sufficient reason perhaps to justify his sallying forth with a reckless band of desperate furtraders bent on indiscriminate revenge it was quite true in his opinion that a murderer should be punished with death and that the pursuit and capture of a murderer was not only a legitimate act in itself but in the circumstances a bounden duty on his part  yet it was equally true that most of the men with whom he was associated were thirsting for vengeance and from past experience he knew full well that there would be no attempt to find out the murderer but a simple and general massacre of all the indians whom they could overtake  then it suddenly occurred to him that the murderer had already been shot by redhand so that his mission was one of simple revenge but a moment after it flashed across his troubled mind that lincoln had been left in the fort woundedmight possibly be dead by that time so that there were probably among the flying savages other murderers to be dealt with this idea was strengthened by another thought namely that the savage who stabbed and scalped dupont might not have been the savage who shot him  the complication and aggregate of improbability amounted in bertrams mind so nearly to a certainty that he dismissed the digressive question as to whether there might or might not be a murderer among the indians and returned to the original proposition as to whether it was right in him to take part in a pursuit of vengeance that would very likely terminate murderously  but before he could come to any satisfactory conclusion on that point he and bounce found themselves suddenly in the midst of the cavalcade which had halted on the summit of the ridge in order to allow them to come up  here we are lads cried macgregor his flushed face still blazing with wrath which he made no effort to subdue and his eyes red with prolonged debauchery flashing like the eyes of a tigerhere we are too late to cut off the retreat o these detestable reptiles from the woods but not too late to circumvent them  the fur trader spoke rapidly almost breathlessly and pointed to the band of indians they were in pursuit of who observing that their pursuers had halted also drew rein on the edge of a belt of thick forest that extended for miles into the mountains  they appeared to wait in order to ascertain what their enemies meant to do  the villains continued macgregor think weve given up pursuit as hopeless but theyre mistakentheyre mistaken as theyll find to their cost  now mark me men we shall turn back as if we had really given in but the moment we get down into the hollow out of sight well go as hard as we can bolt up that valley there and round by the place we call the wildcat pass  its a difficult pass but who cares for that  once through it we can get by a short cut to the other side of that wood and meet the redskins right in the teeth  theyre blackfoot indians i know by their dress and as they dont belong to this part o the country they cant be aware of the pass  but some of us must go back a good way towards the fort so as to deceive the blackguards wholl be sure to get on the first hill they can to see where weve gone to  nowaway  stay he added in a less commanding tone i dont know that my guests are willing to go with us through thick an thin in this fashion  ive no desire to have unwilling warriors  had we not been willing replied redhand dryly we wouldnt have come even thus far  very good rejoined macgregor with a grim smile then perhaps since you are so good as to go along with us youll make for the head of that valley and when you come to the wildcat pass ive spoken of youll wait there till the rest of us who are to sham going back to the fort come up with ye then well go through the pass together and polish off the redskins  to this plan redhand assented so he and his comrades prepared to take the way to the pass while the men of the fort turned homewards  a triumphant shout from the indians showed that they imagined the pursuit was given up but macgregor knew their cunning too well to fall into the mistake of at once concluding that they were thoroughly deceived  he knew that they would send out scouts to dog them and felt that if his plan was to succeed he must put it into execution promptly  ive scarce had time to ask your names or where youve come from he said on parting from the trappers but therell be plenty of time for that when we meet again  keep close in the bottom and ride fast till the shadow of yonder crag conceals you from view  if the indians get sight of you theyll smell the dodge at once and escape us  perhaps young man youd like to come with my party  the latter part of this speech was made rather abruptly to march marston who received it with some surprise and with a distinct refusal  ill stick by my comrades said he till i see good reason  well well boyplease yourself muttered the trader angrily as he broke away at full speed followed by his men  our trappers instantly turned their horses heads towards the mountains and made for the wildcat pass  macgregors estimate of the cunning of the indians was but too correct the instant the furtraders disappeared behind the ridge as if on their return homewards several of their fastest riders were dispatched to the nearest hill to watch the movements of the enemy  they ascended one which commanded a wide view of the surrounding country and thence beheld the furtraders proceeding swiftly back in the direction of the fort  unfortunately they also perceived the bottlebrush of bertrams steed as it disappeared behind the crag which already concealed the rest of his comrades from view  one instant later and the indians would have failed to make this discovery for a deep impassable gorge lay between them and the ravine which conducted to the pass  it was but the barest possible glimpse they got of that shabby tail but it told a tale which they perfectly understood for they flew back in the utmost haste to warn their comrades who knowing the smallness of the party thus sent against them from the largeness of the party that had shammed returning to the fort resolved upon executing a counter movement  they had a shrewd suspicion from the nature of the country that the intention of the whites was to get through a pass of some sort and intercept them and concluding that this pass must lie at the head of the valley up which the bottlebrush had vanished they resolved to proceed to the same spot through the gorge that separated the hill from the crag or rocky ridge before referred to  promptitude they knew to be everything so they swept up the gorge like a whirlwind  thus both parties drew nearer to the chaotic opening styled the wildcat passthe trappers all ignorant of what awaited them there the savages bent on giving their enemies an unpleasant surprise  but unknown to either there was a pair of eyes high on a rock above the wildcat pass that overlooked the two valleys or ravines and gazed with considerable interest and curiosity on the two advancing parties those eyes belonged to a solitary horseman who stood on the edge of the wild precipice that overhung the pass  the hunter for such his leathern dress bespoke him stood beside his horse his right arm over its arched neck and his right hand patting its sleek shoulder  from the position which he occupied he could see without being seen  his magnificent steed seemed to be aware that danger was at hand for it stood like a statue absolutely motionless with the exception of its fine fiery eyes  whatever this solitary hunters thoughts regarding the two approaching parties might be it was evident that he meant to remain an invisible spectator of their doings for he stood in the same attitude of statuelike attention until they reached the heads of the two ravines where they were separated from each other only by the pass here on the one side the indians about forty in number lay in ambush among the rocks prepared to surprise and attack the trappers when they should pass  on the other side the trappers halted and dismounting allowed their horses to graze while they awaited the arrival of macgregor and his party  they wont be long o comin remarked redhand seating himself on a stone and proceeding to strike a light  that fellow macgregor ant the man to waste time when hes out after the redskins  i only hope he wont waste life when he gets up to them  so do i said bounce seating himself beside redhand and carefully cutting a small piece of tobacco into shreds by means of a scalpingknife  a sartin amount o punishment is needful dye see to keep em down but i dont like slaughtering human beins onnecessary like  id skiver em all i guessevery one observed big waller angrily theyre a murderin thievin set o varmints as dont desarve to live nohow  bah exclaimed gibault in disgust you is most awferfully onfeelosophicule as bounce do say  if dey not fit for live for fat vas dey made  you vicked man  big waller deigned no reply  im off to look at the pass cried march marston vaulting suddenly into the saddle  come bertram youll go with me wont you and see if we can find some wildcats in it  the artist who had not dismounted merely replied by a nod and a smile and the two reckless youths galloped away heedless of bounces warning not to go too far for fear they should find something worse than wildcats there  the wildcat pass through which they were speedily picking their steps in order to get a view of the country beyond was not inappropriately named for it seemed at the first glance of those who entered it as if no creature less savagely reckless than a cat could by any possibility scramble through it without the aid of wings  the greater part of it was the ancient bed of a mountain torrent whose gushing waters had owing to some antediluvian convulsion of nature been diverted into another channel  the whole scene was an absolute chaos of rocks which had fallen into the torrents bed from the precipice that hemmed it in on the west and these rocky masses lay heaped about in such a confused way that it was extremely difficult to select a pathway along which the horses could proceed without running great risk of breaking their limbs  the entire length of the pass could not have been much more than a quarter of a mile yet it took march marston and his companion full half an hour to traverse it  when about half through the pass march who led the way drew up on a small rocky elevation from which he could survey the amphitheatre of rugged and naked rocks in the midst of which he stood  upon my word bertram he said gazing round if bunyan had ever been in the rocky mountains i think he would have chosen such a spot as this for the castle o giant despair  i know not replied bertram with a deep sigh as he drew rein what bunyan would have done but i know that giant despair has already located himself here for he has been trying to take possession of my bosom for at least twenty minutes  i never rode over such ground in my life  however it ill becomes pioneers to be overcome by such a giant so pray push on i feel quite eager to see what sort of region lies beyond this gloomy portal  march laughed and turned to continue the scramble bertram removed his brigandish hat wiped his heated brows replaced the hat firmly thereon and drove his heels violently against the ribs of his horse an act which induced that patient quadruped to toss its head and shake its bottlebrush ere it condescended to move on  it was quite evident that although bertram spoke in a halfjesting tone of giant despair he was in reality much delighted with the singularity of this extemporised and interesting ramble  i say bertram dont you like this sort of thing inquired march looking back at his companion on reaching a somewhat level part of the pass  like it  ay that do i  i love it march  there is a freedom a species of wild romance about it that is more captivating than i can describe  you dont need to describe it returned march  i have it all described splendidly within me  one dont want words when ones got feelins  but ive often thought what a pity it is that we cant describe things or places at all with words  at least i cant he added modestly  when i try to tell a fellow what ive seen it aint o no manner of use to try for i dont get hold of the right words at the right time and so dont give out the right meanin and so the fellow im speakin to dont take up the right notion dye see  its a great pity that words are such useless things  why that was spoken like bounce himself said bertram smiling  look out or youll go bounce into that hole if you dont have a care cried march turning aside to avoid the danger referred to  they proceeded through the remainder of the pass in silence as the rugged nature of the ground required their undivided attention  had there been a sprite in that place who could have hopped invisibly to some elevated pinnacle or have soared on gossamer wings into the air so as to take a birdseye view of the whole scene he would have noted that while march marston and the artist were toiling slowly through the wildcat pass the solitary hunter before referred to regarded their proceedings with some surprise and that when he saw they were bent on going quite through the pass his expression changed to a look of deep concern  with slow and gentle hand this man backed his quiet and docile horse deeper into the bush and when he had got so deep into the shade of the forest as to be perfectly safe from observation he leaped on its back with a single bound and galloped swiftly away  a few minutes after the occurrence of this incident march and his friend emerged from the pass and trotted out upon a level plain whence they obtained a fine view of the magnificent country beyond  the pass from which they had just issued seemed to be the entrance to the heart of the rocky mountains  the plain or rather the plateau on which they stood was a level spot covered with soft grass free from bushes and not more than a hundred yards in extent  on three sides it was encompassed by inaccessible precipices and rocky ground in the midst of which the opening out of the pass was situated  on the fourth side it was skirted by a dense thicket of bushes that formed the entrance to a magnificent forest which extended for several miles in front of the spot  beyond this forest the scene was broken by hills and valleys and little plains richly diversified with wood and waterthe former in dense masses scattered groups and isolated clusters the latter shining in the forms of lakelet and stream or glancing snowwhite in numberless cascades  beyond all the darkblue giant masses of the rocky mountains towered up and up hill upon hill pile upon pile mass on mass till they terminated in distant peaks so little darker than the sky that they seemed scarcely more solid than the clouds with which they mingled and blended their everlasting snows  ant it beautiful cried march riding forward with a bounding sensation of inexpressible delight  bertram followed him but did not answer  he was too deeply absorbed in the simple act of intently gazing and drinking in the scene to listen or to reply  at the precise moment in which march made the above remark his quick eye observed a spear head which one of the savages hid among the bushes there had not taken sufficient pains to conceal  march marston was a young hunter and as yet an inexperienced warrior but from childhood he had been trained as if it were in spirit by the anecdotes and tales of the many hunters who had visited pine point settlement  his natural powers of selfcontrol were very great but he had to tax all these powers to the uttermost to maintain his look of animated delight in the scenery unchanged after making the above startling discovery  but march did it  his first severe trial in the perils of backwoods life had comewithout warning or time for preparation and he passed through it like a true hero  that a spear handle must necessarily support a spear head that an indian probably grasped the former that in the present position of affairs there were certainly more indians than one in ambush and that in all probability there were at that moment two or three dozen arrows resting on their respective bows and pointed towards his and his comrades hearts ready to take flight the instant they should come within sure and deadly range were ideas which did not follow each other in rapid succession through his brain but darted upon the young hunters quick perceptions instantaneously and caused his heart to beat on his ribs like a sledgehammer and the blood to fly violently to his face  luckily marchs face was deeply browned and did not show the crimson tide  with a sudden mighty effort he checked the natural look and exclamation of surprise  that was the moment of danger past  to continue his praise of the lovely scene in gay delighted tones was comparatively easy  isnt it beautiful he said turning his face full towards the ambushed savages gazing over their place of concealment with an unconscious joyous air and sweeping his hand towards the mountains as if to draw the attention of his companion to them  marchs only weapon at that moment was the small hatchet he was wont to carry in his girdle this implement chanced to be in his hand  placing it carelessly in his belt as though nothing was further from his mind than the idea of requiring to use it at that time he cried  see yonder is a mound from which we may get a better view and trotted to the summit of the spot alluded to  in doing so he placed himself still nearer to the indians  this was a bold stroke though a dangerous one meant to deceive the enemy  after gazing a few seconds from this spot he wheeled round and walked his horse quietly towards the entrance to the pass  arrived there he turned and pretending that he saw something in the far distance he shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed for a short time intently then calling to bertram who still remained in his original position all unconscious of his danger said  i say come here look at yonder splendid lake its worth seeingwell worth seeing and if you dont see it with that curious light on it youll not care to see it at all  march did not dare by energy of voice to force his friends attention therefore the first part of this speech was unheeded but the reference to a curious light had the desired effect  bertram turned and rode to join his companion  getting bertram into such a position that his own person partially screened him from the indians he made the following remarkable speech from beginning to end in the gay tones of one who discourses eloquently on the beauties of nature pointing here and there as he rattled on  ant it beautiful eh  i say just look at it nowlisten to me bertramattentively but gaze admiringly at the sceneat the scene oh man do what i bid yeyour life hangs on it  pretend to admire itwere in great dangerbut  eh what where exclaimed the artist in a tone of intense excitement at the same time laying his hand on one of his pistols and gazing anxiously all round him  alas poor bertram  it needed not the acute apprehension of a redskin to understand that you had been told of present danger  neither did it require much acuteness on the part of march to divine what was to follow  scarcely had the symptoms of alarm been exhibited when four arrows whizzed through the air and passed close to the persons of the two friends who instantly turned and made a dash for the entrance of the pass  at the same time the savages uttered a yell and darted after them  well never be able to escape by the pass exclaimed march looking behind him hurriedly as they approached the rocky gorge and i declare theres only four o them on foot  come bertram lets make a bold stroke for it  well easy break through em  he reined up so suddenly as almost to throw the horse on its haunches and wheeling round darted towards the savages  bertram followed almost mechanically  the indians offered no opposition but at that moment another yell rose from the hushes and about thirty mounted indians who had been concealed behind a projecting cliff sprang forward and closed up the only place of escape with a formidable array of spears  from their not using their arrows it was evident that they wished to capture the white men alive for the purpose no doubt of taking them home to their wigwams there to put them to death by slow torture with the assistance of their squaws  march marstons spirit rose with the occasion  he uttered a furious cry flourished his hatchet above his head and dashed at full gallop towards the line  seeing this one of the indians levelled his spear and rode out to meet him  bertrams nerves recovered at that moment he fired both pistols at the advancing savage but without effect  in despair he hurled one of them violently at the head of the indian  the missile went true to the mark and felled him  on beholding this the whole body of savages rushed upon the two white men  one powerful indian seized march by the throat  before either could use his weapon the horses separated and both fell violently to the ground bertram leaped off his horse and sprang to the rescue but he was instantly surrounded and for a few seconds defended himself with the butt of his large cavalry pistol with an amount of energy and activity that would have filled those who knew him best with amazement  at that moment there was a clatter of hoofs in the gorge and a roar or bellow was heard above the din of the fight  all eyes were turned towards the pass and next moment a solitary horseman leaped over the broken rocks and bounded over the turf towards the combatants  the aspect of this newcomer was something terrible to behold  both he and his horse were gigantic in size  the man was dressed in the costume of an indian but his hair and beard were those of a white man  the mane and tail of his huge horse were of enormous length and as he swept over the little plain which seemed to tremble beneath his heavy tread the wind blew out these and the tags and scalplocks of his coat and leggings as well as his own beard and hair in such a confused and commingled way as to make the man and horse appear like one monstrous creature  the indians turned to flee but seeing only one enemy they hesitated in another moment the wild horseman was upon them  he carried a round shield on his left arm and a long doubleedged sword in his right hand two indians lowered their spears to receive him  the point of one he turned aside with his shield and the shock of his heavy warhorse hurled horse and man upon the plain  the other he cut the iron head off with a sweep of his sword and with a continuation of the same cut he cleft his opponent to the chin  turning rapidly he bounded into the very midst of the savages uttering another of his tremendous roars of indignation  the suddenness of this act prevented the indians from using their bows and arrows effectively  before they could fit an arrow to the string two more of their number lay in the agonies of death on the ground  several arrows were discharged but the perturbation of those who discharged them and their close proximity to their mark caused them to shoot wide  most of the shafts missed him  two quivered in his shield and one pierced the sleeve of his coat  turning again to renew his rapid attacks he observed one of the indiansprobably a chiefleap to one side and turning round fit an arrow with calm deliberation to his bow  the furious horseman although delivering his sweeping blows right and left with indiscriminate recklessness seemed during the melee to have an intuitive perception of where the greatest danger lay  the savages at that moment were whirling round him and darting at him in all directions but he singled out this chief at once and bore down upon him like a thunderbolt  the chief was a brave man he did not wince but drawing the arrow to its head as the other approached let it fly full at his breast  the white man dropped on the neck of his steed as if he had been struck with lightning the arrow passed close over his back and found its mark in the breast of one of the savages whose death yell mingled with that of the chief as a moment later the gigantic warrior ran him with a straight point through the body  the indians were scattered now  the rapid dash of that tumultuous fight although of but a few seconds duration had swept the combatants to the extreme edge of the woods leaving bertram standing in the midst of dead and dying men gazing with a bewildered helpless look at the terrible scene  march marston lay close by his side apparently dead in the grip of the savage who had first attacked him and whose throat his own hand grasped with the tenacity and force of a vice  most of the indians leaped over the bushes and sought the shelter of the thick underwood as the tremendous horseman whom doubtless they now deemed invulnerable came thundering down upon them again but about twenty of the bravest stood their ground  at that moment a loud shout and a fierce hurrah rang out and echoed hither and thither among the rocks and next instant big waller followed by bounce and his friends as well as by macgregor and his whole party sprang from the wildcat pass and rushed furiously upon the savages who had already turned and fled towards the wood for shelter  the whole band crossed the battlefield like a whirlwind leaped over or burst through the bushes and were gonethe crashing tread of their footsteps and an occasional shout alone remaining to assure the bewildered artist who was still transfixed immovable to the ground that the whole scene was not a dream  but bertram was not left alone on that bloody field  on the first sound of the approach of the white men to the rescue the strange horseman who from the moment of his bursting so opportunely on the scene had seemed the very impersonation of activity and colossal mightpulled up his fiery steed and he now sat gazing calmly into the forest in the direction in which the indians and traders had disappeared  stupefied though he was bertram could not avoid being impressed and surprised by the sudden and total change which had come over this remarkable hunter  after gazing into the woods as we have said for some minutes he quietly dismounted and plucking a tuft of grass from the plain wiped his bloody sword and sheathed it  not a trace of his late ferocity was visible  his mind seemed to be filled with sadness for he sighed slightly and shook his head with a look of deep sorrow as his eyes rested on the dead men  there was a mild gravity in his countenance that seemed to bertram incompatible with the fiendlike fury of his attack and a slow heaviness in his motions that amounted almost to laziness and seemed equally inconsistent with the vigour he had so recently displayed which was almost catlike if we may apply such a term to the actions of so huge a pair as this man and his horse were  a profusion of lightbrown hair hung in heavy masses over his herculean shoulders and a bushy moustache and beard of the same colour covered the lower part of his deeply browned face which was handsome and mild but eminently masculine in expression  remounting his horse which seemed now to be as quiet and peaceable as himself this singular being turned and rode towards that part of the wood that lay nearest to the wild rocky masses that formed the outlet from the pass  on gaining the verge of the plain he turned his head full round and fixed his clear blue eyes on the wondering artist  a quiet smile played on his bronzed features for an instant as he bestowed upon him a cheerful nod of farewell  then urging his steed forward he entered the woods at a slow walk and disappeared  the heavy tramp of his horses hoofs among the broken stones of the rugged path had scarcely died away when the distant tread of the returning furtraders broke on bertrams ear  this aroused him from the state of halfsceptical horror in which he gazed upon the scene of blood and death in the midst of which he stood  presently his eye fell for the first time upon the motionless form of march marston  the sight effectually restored him  with a slight cry of alarm he sprang to his friends side and kneeling down endeavoured to loosen the deathlike grasp with which he still held the throat of his foe  the horror of the poor artist may be imagined when he observed that the skull of the indian was battered in and that his young comrades face was bespattered with blood and brains  just then several of the trappers and furtraders galloped upon the scene of the late skirmish  hallo  mr bertram here you are guess weve polished em off this time a few  hey wots this cried big waller as he and some of the others leaped to the ground and surrounded bertram  not dead is he  the tone in which the yankee trapper said this betrayed as much rage as regret  the bare idea of his young comrade having been killed by the savages caused him to gnash his teeth with suppressed passion  out o the way lads let me see him cried bounce who galloped up at that moment flung himself off his horse pushed the others aside and kneeling at his side laid his hand on march marstons heart  all right he said raising the youths head hes only stunned run gibault fetch a drop o water  the horse that brained this here redskin by good luck only stunned march  ah mon pauvre enfant cried gibault as he ran to obey  the water quickly restored march and in a few minutes he was able to sit up and call to remembrance what had passed  ere his scattered faculties were quite recovered the furtraders returned with macgregor at their head  well done the wild man of the west cried mcleod as he dismounted not badly hurt young man i trust  oh nothing to speak of  only a thump on the head from a horses hoof said march ill be all right in a little time  did you say anything about the wild man of the west he added earnestly  to be sure i did but for him you and mr bertram would have been dead men i fear  did you not see him  see him no replied march much excited  i heard a tremendous roar but just then i fell to the ground and remember nothing more that happened  was that quiet gravelooking man the wild man of the west inquired bertram with a mingled feeling of interest and surprise  this speech was received with a loud burst of laughter from all who heard it  well ive never seed the wild man till today said one though ive often heerd of him but i must say the little glimpse i got didnt show much that was mild or grave  i guess your heads bin in a swum stranger said another  ive only seed him this once but i dont hope to see him agin  he aint to be trusted he aint that feller  and ive seen him five or six times added mcleod and all i can say is that twice out o the five he was like an incarnate fiend and the other three timeswhen he came to the mountain fort for ammunitionhe was as gruff and sulky as a bear with the measles  well gentlemen said bertram with more emphasis in his tone than he was wont to employ i have seen this man only once but ive seen him under two aspects today and all that i can say is that if that was really the wild man of the west hes not quite so wild as he gets credit for  on hearing this march marston rose and shook himself  he felt ill at ease in body and mind  the idea of the wild man of the west having actually saved his life and he had not seen him was a heavy disappointment and the confused and conflicting accounts of those who had seen him combined with the racking pains that shot through his own brain rendered him incapable of forming or expressing any opinion on the subject whatever so he said abruptly  its of no use talking here all night friends  my heads splittin so i think wed better encamp  marchs suggestion was adopted at once  provisions had been carried with them from the fort  the dead bodies of the indians were buried a spot at some distance from the scene of the fight was chosen  the fires were lighted supper was devoured and a watch set and soon march marston was dreaming wildly in that savage place about the wild man of the west    chapter fourteen  the hunting groundhow they spent the sabbath day among the mountains threatening clouds on the horizon  next day the furtraders prepared to return to the mountain fort and the trappers to continue their journey into the rocky mountains  at the period of which we write the fur of the beaver was much in demand in the european markets and trappers devoted much of their time to the capture of that sagacious animal  from mcleod redhand learned that a journey of eight or ten days to the southeastward would bring them to a country that was reported to be much frequented not only by the beaver but by many other furbearing and wild animals so it was resolved that having brought their traps and supplies with them the trappers instead of returning to the fort should part with their entertainers at the spot where the skirmish had occurred and make for that hunting ground as quickly as possible  i suppose you dont want to part company with us yet mr bertram said old redhand as they were about to start  by no means replied the artist quickly i have no intention of quitting youthat is if you do not find me a burden on your hands he added with a sad smile  a burden cried bounce in surprise i tell ye wot sir i consider yer company a honour  so you wont return with us young man said macgregor to march marston as he mounted his horse  im in want of a stout young fellow and youll like the life  i thank ye sir for your good opinion returned march but my minds made up ill stick by my comrades i like trappin but i dont like tradinthough im obliged to you for bein so pressin all the same  the two parties bade each other adieu and separatedthe one retracing its way through the wildcat pass the other with old redhand at its head descending into the beautiful country that has been briefly described in the last chapter  six quiet and peaceful weeks now succeeded to the stormy period that had just passed  during this time they wandered pleasantly about in as beautiful a region of the world as the heart of man could wish to dwell in  they reached this country after several days travel  after arriving they moved about from one beautiful spot to another setting their beaver traps in the streams and remaining a longer or shorter time at each place according to their success in trapping and hunting  the country was of so peculiarly diversified a formation that within the compass of ten miles every possible variety of scenery existed from the level stretch of prairie to the towering snowpeaks of the mountains from the brakeencompassed swamp in which frogs ducks geese plover and other denizens of the marshes maintained perpetual jubilee to the dry bushdotted mounds and undulating lands where the badger delighted to burrow in the sandy soil while in other places the wolf the fox and the grisly bear prowled amid the dark recesses of the forest  it was a truly beautiful and a preeminently enjoyable region and in the midst of it under the spreading branches of a magnificent pine which grew on the top of a little mound that commanded an extensive prospect on every side the trappers pitched their camp and began their campaign against the furbearing animals that dwelt there  it was a quiet sunny sabbath morning when our trappers arrived at the tree above referred to  they had encamped the previous night on a swampy piece of ground having travelled too late to afford time to search for a better spot so that they were glad to rise and push forward at the peep of day on sabbath  but when in the course of a couple of hours they reached the dry country they at once proceeded to encamp  during their journeying the trappers had mutually agreed to rest from all labour on the sabbath day  some of them did so from no higher motive than the feeling that it was good for themselves and for their beasts to rest one day in seven from bodily labour  although not absolutely regardless of religion they nevertheless failed to connect this necessity of theirs with the appointment of a day of rest by that kind and gracious father who has told us that the sabbath was made for man  made for him not only and chiefly for the benefit of his soul but also and secondarily for the good of his body  others of the party there were however who regarded the sabbath rest in a somewhat higher light than did their comrades though none of them were fully alive to the blessings and privileges attaching to the faithful keeping of the lords day  independently altogether of the delight connected with the contemplation of the wonderful works of god in the wildernessespecially of that beautiful portion of the wildernessthe trappers experienced a sensation of intense pleasure in the simple act of physical repose after their long restless and somewhat exciting journey  they wandered about from spot to spot from hill to hill in a species of charming indolence of body that seemed to increase rather than to diminish the activity of their minds sometimes they rambled or rested on the sunny slopes in groups sometimes in couples and sometimes singly  march marston and the artist sauntered about together and conversed with animated fluency and wandering volubilityas young minds are wont to doon things past present and to come things terrestrial and celestial  in short there was no subject almost that did not get a share of their attention as they sauntered by the rippling brook or over the flowering plain or stood upon the mountain side  they tried everything by turns and nothing long and among other mental occupations they read portions of the bible together for bertram found that march carried his mothers testament in an inner breastpocket of his huntingshirt and march discovered that his friend had a small copy of the biblealso a mothers giftwhich shared the pouch of his leather coat with the wellknown sketchbook  they conversed freely and somewhat boldly on what they read and we doubt not that our learned divines had they listened to the talk of the youthful pioneer and the young hunter would have been surprised perhaps edified by the simple practical commonsense views promulgated by those raw theologians  certainly any one listening to the grave kindly philosophical commentaries of march marston would never have believed in the truth of that statement at the commencement of this story wherein it is asserted somewhat positively that march marston was mad  bounce and big waller and black gibault drew naturally together and speculated after their own peculiar fashion on every subject of thought within the reach of their capacities and as bounces capacities embraced a pretty wide range the feelosophical views he set forth upon that lovely sabbath day were so varied so eccentric so graphic and so apparently inexhaustible that he effectually quelled gibaults inveterate tendency to jest and filled big waller with deeper admiration than ever  as for redhand and the indian they wandered about in sympathetic silence broken ever and anon by the old trapper passing a remark on some interesting peculiarity of a leaf an insect or a flower  it has been said that as men grow older they find deeper pleasure in the contemplation of the minute things of nature and are less desirous than they were wont to expatiate on the striking and the grand  what truth there is in the remark we cannot tell but certain it is while the younger men of the party seemed to cast longing admiring and gladsome looks over the distant landscape and up at the snowclad and cloudencompassed heights of the rocky mountains old redhand bent his eyes we might almost say lovingly on the earth  he would sit down on a stone and pluck a leaf which he would examine with minute care or watch with the deepest interest the frantic efforts of a little ant as it staggered along under its gigantic burden of a single seed climbing over a mountainous twig tumbling into a cavernous hole the size of a hazelnut or being brought to a hesitating pause by a mountain torrent a quarter of an inch broad  the sedate indian took special pleasure in watching the doings of his old friend  usually he contented himself with a grunt of assent when redhand made a remark on the peculiarities of a plant or an insect but sometimes he ventured on a brief observation and occasionally even proposed a question to his aged companion which redhand found it difficult to answer  there was little interchange of thought between those two silent men but there was much of quiet enjoyment  so passed the sabbath day  early on the following morning the trappers were astir and before the sun tinged the mountain peaks their beaver traps were set an extensive portion of the territory they had thus quietly taken possession of had been explored in several directions a couple of deer had been shot a mountain goat seen and a grisly bear driven from his den and pursued but not killed besides a number of wildfowl having been bagged and an immense number of creatures including mustangs or wild horses roused from their lairs  when the scattered hunters returned to the camp to breakfast they found themselves in a satisfied happy state of mind with a strong disposition on the part of some to break their fast without wasting time in cooking the viands  it was of no manner of use cooking big waller said when a feller was fit to eat his own head off of his own shoulders  as for gibault he declared that he meant to give up cooking his victuals from that time forward and eat them raw  the others seemed practically to have come to the same conclusion for certain it is that the breakfast when devoured on that first monday morning was decidedly underdoneto use a mild expression  but it was when the pipes were lighted that the peculiarities and capabilities of that wild region became fully known for then it was that each hunter began to relate with minute accuracy the adventures of that morning  as they had scattered far and wide and hunted or trapped separately each had something new and more or less interesting to tell march told of how he had shot a grey goose and had gone into a moving swamp after it and had sunk up to the middle and all but took to swimming to save himself but had got hold of the goose notwithstanding as the drumstick he had just picked would testify  bounce told of having gone after a moose deer and failing to come up with it was fain to content himself with a bighorn and a buck and big waller asserted that he had suddenly come upon a grisly bear which he would certainly have shot had it not run away from him  whereupon gibault wilfully misunderstanding said with a look of unutterable surprise that he would never have believed itno neverhad anybody else told him that big waller had actually run away from a bear  he couldnt bear to hear of it and would not believe it though waller himself said it  as for bertram having filled the pages of his sketchbook back and front he was compelled to take to miniature drawing in corners and blank bits and in this way began to book the entire region and to revel in his loved art  several weeks passed away and during that time of peace and plenty our trappers had it all to themselves  they caught and killed numbers of animals stripped off dried and packed quantities of valuable furs ate enormous meals with the gusto of men who had laboriously earned the right to do so and related stories and anecdotes enough to fill a huge volume  in short they enjoyed themselves beyond conception and bertram agreed with march marston in thinking that bunyans land of beulah could not have surpassed that delightful region  but one day there came a small cloud on their blue sky of felicity  an event occurred which rudely dispelled their pleasant dreams filled their hearts with anxiety and finally broke up their camp in a way that led to disastrous though not altogether ruinous consequences    chapter fifteen  business unpleasantly interruptedthe mountain fort in dangertrappers to the rescuea rude meeting with foes in the darka wild racemarch meets with a severe misfortune  one morning just as the trappers were dropping into camp about the usual breakfast hour laden with the produce of the trap and the chase they were startled by the sudden appearance of a large band of mounted indians who galloped to the top of a neighbouring mound and crowding together stood still to gaze upon the invaders of their hunting grounds for such they deemed the trappers no doubt  to snatch up their arms and run to a place of safety was the work of a moment  it must not be supposed that such experienced men as redhand and bounce were altogether unprepared for a surprise of this sort  on the day of their arrival at the hunting ground their first care had been to select such a place for their camp as lay in close proximity to some natural stronghold  not ten paces from the camp fire there was a sort of hollow in the ground on the very summit of the mound on which they were encamped  here all their valuables had been placed and round the edge of the hollow a rude breastwork had been raised so that the party when in it could fire through little openings in the breastwork without exposing themselves to view  to this fortress they retired the instant the indians made their appearance  fortunately all the members of the little party had come in  theyre holdin a council o war said bounce carefully examining the priming of his piece  its as like as not theyll attack us but theyll get a hearty and an oncommonly warm welcome  theyll not attack us said redhand  they know that white men never travel without plenty of powder and ball and they dont like taking a place by storm  ay remarked waller sarcastically cause they knows that the first man as comes on is sartin sure to fall an they knows that they cant come on without somebody comin first  but theres brave fellers among the redskins rejoined bounce  i knowed a set o young fellers as banded theirselves together and swore theyd go through fire an water thick an thin but theyd niver turn back from the face o danger wherever they met it  so one day they wos crossin a river on the ice an the first on em fell in an wos carried away by the current an what does the second do but he walks straight into the hole an wos drowned too an the nixt wos goin to foller when the old warriors ran at him an forced him back  if they hadnt stopped him i do blieve  theyre makin up their minds to do somethin or other interrupted march  i sincerely hope they wont fight murmured bertram earnestly  it is fearful to think of the blood that is shed by these men needlessly  from the conduct of the indians it became evident that on this occasion they sympathised with the artist in his desire not to fight for one of their number dismounted and advancing unarmed towards the trappers made signs of friendship  its as well to be bold an appear to trust em said redhand laying down his rifle and leaping over the breastwork keep your guns ready lads an if ye see treachery let drive at once  dont be afraid o hittin me  ill take my chance  after a few minutes conversation with the indian redhand returned to his party  that redskin said he tells me theyre on an expedition to hunt the buffalo on the prairie and that theyre good friends of the white men and would like to have a talk with us before they go on but i dont believe em  from what i heard mr mcleod say at the mountain fort i think it not unlikely they are bound on an expedition against the whites  the very fact of their wishin to keep friends with us instead of tryin to lift our scalps and carry off our furs and horses shows me theyve some more pressin business on hand  mr mcleod described to me the appearance of one or two o the injuns that hates the furtraders most so that i might be on my guard an im quite sure that some of them are with that band  now what say ye  shall i tell em we dont want their acquaintance  tell em theyre a set o lyin thieves said big waller  i guess well have nothin to say to em wotiver  oui et give to dem mine complements added gibault an say we ver moch blige by dere goodness mais dey vill all be shooted if dey not go away queek  redhand did not give these polite messages to the indian but on returning to him he presented him with a piece of tobacco and advised him to continue his journey without loss of time as the buffaloes were travelling south and might be out of the way when they reached the prairie  whether the indians felt angry or not it is impossible to say  they seemed indifferent to their cool reception by the trappers and soon after rode off at full speed in a direction that led away from the mountain fort a circumstance which still further confirmed redhand in his suspicions  after an eager hasty consultation it was resolved that they should follow the savages and if their trail was found to diverge as was fully expected towards the fort that they should endeavour to pass them in the night and proceed by forced marches in order to get there in time to warn the furtraders of their impending danger  in less than an hour after the indians left them the trappers were galloping after them in hot haste  during the course of the day they found that the trail doubled back as they had anticipated so making a wide detour they headed the indians and during the afternoon got a little in advance of them on their way to the mountain fort  but the trappers had a subtle enemy to deal with  just as the indians were about to encamp that night for a few hours rest they chanced to diverge a short way from the direct line of march and in doing so crossed the tracks of the trappers  a halt was called and a minute inspection of the tracks made  one of the savages galloped back on them a considerable distance and soon returned with the information that they led towards the camp of the palefaces  from the appearance of the hoofprints they knew that they were fresh and thus at once guessed that their true intentions had been suspected and might yet be frustrated by the trappers  instead of encamping therefore they pushed on at full speed and very soon came up with the white men  it was a dark night so that they could not see far in advance of them and thus it happened that the two parties on entering a narrow defile almost rode into each other with a yell of fierce surprise on both sides  as there were at least fifty indians redhand thought it better to avoid a doubtful combat by scattering his men through the woods and letting each make the best of his way to the fort singly  run boys scatter to the fort  this was all that he deemed needful in the way of command or explanation  firing a single volley at the enemy they turned and fled  foller me shouted waller to the bewildered bertram as a shower of arrows whistled past their ears  the artist obeyed mechanically and in another moment they were flying through the wood at a pace that seemed and actually was reckless under the circumstances  but the indians did not attempt to pursue  they knew that their intention had been discovered and that their only chance of success now lay in outriding the palefaces  the ride in fact became a long race neither party making the slightest attempt to hunt up the other but each straining every nerve and muscle to get first to the doomed fort  the scattered trappers rode for a long time singly but as they neared the fort one or two of them met and when they came first in sight of the tall flagstaff bounce redhand and gibault rode abreast  mcleod was standing in front of the fort when the three horsemen came dashing over the plain  he hastily summoned his men and closed the gate but as the foremost rider came near he was recognised the gate was thrown open and they galloped into the square  in a few hasty words their errand was explained  arms and ammunition were served out and six men were stationed at the gate to be in readiness to open it to approaching friends or to shut it in the face of foes  but the others of the party were not so fortunate as these three  the indians reached the fort before they did and one of their number was left unknown to them in a state of insensibility near the spot where the first rencontre had taken place  when the indians and trappers met in the narrow defile as before related one of the arrows which had been discharged very much at random entered the shoulder of march marstons horse and wounded it mortally  at first march thought the wound was slight and hearing the shouts of some of the savages not far behind him he urged his horse forward as rapidly as the nature of the ground would admit of  before he had gone a quarter of a mile however the poor steed fell throwing march over its head  in his flight the youths forehead came into violent contact with a branch and he fell to the ground insensible  his comrades ignorant of his fate continued their wild flight  thus our hero was forsaken and left bruised and bleeding in the dark forest    chapter sixteen  march gets a surprise more than that he gets a variety of surprises meets with a strange huntergoes in a strange fashion to a strange cavern and beholds strange sightsbesides other matters of interest  on recovering consciousness march discovered that it was broad daylightfrom which he argued in a confused sort of way that he must have lain there all night  he also discovered that his head which ached violently rested on the knee of some unknown individual who bathed his temples with cold water  looking up he encountered the gaze of a pair of soft blue eyes  now there is something exceedingly captivating in a pair of soft blue eyesnot that there may not be something quite as captivating in a pair of brown or black or grey eyesbut there is something singularly captivating in the peculiar style of captivation wherewith a man is captivated by a pair of bluedistinctly blueeyes  perhaps it is that their resemblance to the cerulean depths of the bright sky and the blue profundities of the ocean invests them with a suggestive influence that is agreeable to the romantic and idealising tendencies of human nature or that the colour is or ought to be if it is not emblematic of purity  we throw out this suggestion solely for the benefit of unimpassioned philosophers  those whose hearts are already under the pleasant thraldom of black or brown eyes are incapable of forming an opinion on the abstract question  well march observed further that below those soft blue eyes there was a handsome roman nose and immediately below that a moustache and a thick short beard of curly lightbrown hair  a slight very slight feeling of regret mingled with the astonishment with which march passed from the contemplation of the soft blue eyes to the bushy beard  he also noted that the stranger wore a little leathern cap and that a profusion of rich brown hair descended from his head to his shoulders  yere better lad said the owner of the blue eyes in that deep musical bass voice which one meets with but rarely and which resembles strongly at times the low pipes of a cathedral organ  thankee yes im  there dont move yet awhile  youre badly bruised lad  ill go fetch ye another drop o water  the owner of the blue eyes rose as he spoke laid marchs head softly on the ground and walked towards a neighbouring brook  in doing so he displayed to the wondering gaze of march the proportions of a truly splendidlooking man  he was considerably above six feet in height but it was not that so much as the herculean build of his chest and shoulders that struck march with surprise  his costume was the ordinary leather huntingshirt and leggings of a backwoodsman and although deeply bronzed his colour not less than his blue eyes and brown hair told that he was not an indian  as he returned carrying a little birchbark dish full of water in his hand march observed that the lines of his forehead indicated a mingled feeling of anger and sadness and that his heavy brows frowned somewhat he also noted more clearly now the mans towering height and the enormous breadth of his chest  as he lay there on his back with his head pillowed on a tuft of moss he said inwardly to himself i never saw such a fellow as this before in all my life  and little wonder that march marston thought thus for as no doubt the reader has already guessed the farfamed wild man of the west himself stood before him  but he did not know him  on the only occasion on which he had had an opportunity of beholding this renowned man march had been rendered insensible just as he came on the field and the exaggerated descriptions he had heard of him seemed quite irreconcilable with the soft blue eye and gentle manner of the hunter who had come thus opportunely to his aid  for one moment indeed the idea did occur to march that this was the wild man  it was natural that having had his thoughts for so long a period filled with conjectures in reference to this wonderful creature he should suppose the first tall mysterious man he met must be he  but he dismissed the notion as untenable and absurd on second thoughts  that the blueeyed calm dignified hunter who kneeled by his side and held the refreshing water to his lips as if he were a trained sick nurse should be the wild man the man reported to be forty feet high covered with hair and exceeding fierce besides ugly was out of the question  and when march shut his eyes in the full enjoyment of the cool draught of which poor fellow he stood much in need and heard the supposed wild man give vent to a sigh which caused him to look up in surprise so that he observed the mild blue eyes gazing sadly in his face and the large head to which they belonged shaking from side to side mournfully he almost laughed at himself for even momentarily entertaining such an absurd idea  march marston had much to learnwe mean in the way of reading human character and in judging from appearances  he had not yet observed in the course of his short life that if a blue eye is capable of expressing soft pity it is also preeminently capable of indicating tigerlike ferocity  he did not consider that the gentlest natures are when roused to fury the most terrible in their outward aspect  he did not reflect that if this giant for he almost deserved thus to be styled instead of being engaged in an office of kindness that naturally induced gentleness of action and that called for no other feelings than those of tenderness and pity were placed on a warhorse armed with sword and shield and roused to fury by some such sight as that of a large band of savage indians attacking a small and innocent group of white trappers he might then amply fulfil all the conditions that would entitle him to the wildest possible name that could be invented  the prominent ideas in marchs mind at that time were a pair of blue eyes and a large gentle hand so he quietly and finally dismissed the wild man from his thoughts  luckily the wild man did not treat march in a similar manner  after allowing him to rest quietly for a few minutes he said  now lad i think yere improvin  yere badly battered about the head and shoulders so ill take ye home with me  home with you repeated march  ay put your arms round my neck returned the wild man in a tone which though soft and low it was not possible to disobey  march performed this somewhat endearing action in silent surprise whereupon the wild man introduced his left arm below the poor youths back and with his right grasped him round the legs and thus lifted him from the ground and carried him away  march experienced a sensation as if all his larger joints were being dislocated and felt disposed to cry out but restrained himself with a powerful effort  presently his bearer stopped and looking round march observed that he was standing by the side of a horse  hold on lad till i mount  youd better let me down till you get up suggested march  no replied the singularly laconic individual  standing as he was the wild man managed by raising march a little to lay his left hand on the pommel of his saddle next moment his foot was in the stirrup the moment after he himself was in the saddle and a touch of his heel sent his horse cantering away towards the mountains  had march marston seen his deliverer at that moment with his long hair waving freely in the breeze in emulation of the voluminous mane and tail of his splendid horse his thoughts regarding the wild man of the west would have certainly returned more powerfully than ever  but march did not see him his eyes being shut his lips pursed and his teeth set in a heroic attempt to endure the agonies to which he was subjected by the motion of the horse  in half an hour they reached a rocky defile that led up into one of those wild gloomy glens that are so characteristic of the rocky mountains  here the wild man had to check his pace and proceed at a walk thereby affording much relief to his wounded companion  art sore i the bones lad inquired the stout horseman looking down at his charge as if he were a small infant in arms  rather replied march  dont you think it would be better for me to ride behind you  i think i could manage to hold on  no you couldnt  i fear i must be a terrible weight carried in this fashion urged march  weight echoed the hunter with a quiet chuckle but as he did not vouchsafe any further reply march was left to interpret the expression as he thought fit  i hope no bones are broken inquired march in a tone of anxiety  hope not replied his captor  we use the word captor advisedly for march was so utterly unable at that time physically as well as morally to resist the will of this strange hunter that he felt much more like a captive in the grip of a mighty jailer than an invalid in the arms of his nurse  i fear there are said march as a rude motion of the horse caused him excruciating agony  very likely replied the othernot by any means in a careless indifferent way but with the air and tone of a straightforward man giving his opinion in reference to a matter of fact  but he added in a consolatory tone ill see when we get home  home repeated march  why where is your home  in the mountains here  were about there now  as he spoke the hunter turned his horse sharp to the left and entered a still more narrow and gloomy defile than the one they had just been ascending  so narrow was it and overshadowed by high precipitous cliffs that the light of day had to struggle for entrance even at noontide  at night it was dark as erebus  the horse had considerable difficulty in advancing indeed no horse that had not been trained to pick its steps among the confused masses of rock and debris that formed the bottom of that ravine or chasm could have ascended it at all  but the fine animal which bore march and the wild man of the west seemed to act more like a human being than a horse in winding out and in among the intricacies of the place  at length they reached the upper end of the gorge  here the cliffs which rose perpendicularly to a height of three or four hundred feet drew so near to each other that at one place they were not more than three yards asunder  just beyond this point they receded again and terminated abruptly in a sort of circle or amphitheatre the floor of which could not have been more than thirty yards in diameter and was covered with small gravel the sides were quite perpendicular and rose so high that on looking up one felt as if one had got into the bottom of a natural tunnel at the top of which a round bit of bright blue sky sent down a few scanty rays of light  in spite of the pain it caused him march raised his head and looked round as they rode into this gloomy cavernous place  then glancing at the face of the strange being who carried him a feeling of superstitious dread took possession of his heart for a moment as he remembered the many conversations he and bounce had had about evil spirits appearing in human form and he thought that perhaps he had actually fallen into the hands of one  but the grave quiet face and above all the soft blue eyes quickly put to flight such fears although they could not altogether dispel the solemn awe he felt at being carried so suddenly into such a mysterious place  but he had scarcely recovered some degree of confidence when his mind was again thrown into a violent state of agitation by the fact that the horse turning to the right began deliberately to ascend the precipice which was as perpendicular as a wall  it did not indeed ascend after the manner of a fly on a window but it went up on what appeared to be a narrow spiral pathway  in a few seconds they had ascended about fifty feet and march projecting out from the precipice as he did owing to his position in the riders left arm felt a horrible sensation of giddiness come over him and could not suppress a slight groan  dont be afeard lad said his companion ive got ye tight an the horse is used to it  the tracks broader than ye think only ye cant see it as ye lie now  march felt reassured nevertheless he shut his eyes very tight and held his breath  presently he felt that they had turned sharp to the right so he ventured to open his eyes and found that they were standing at the mouth of what appeared to be a cavern  in another moment they were under its dark roof and the horse came to a stand  from the hasty glance he gave it he could only ascertain that the interior was buried in profound darkness  without causing march to move in any way the stout horseman dismounted in fact the burden seemed no greater to him than a child would be to an ordinary man  here we areat home he said  come old horse get away in  the horse obeyed and disappeared in the darkness beyond  now lad dont be afeard i know every fut o the way  ye can shut yer eyes an ye likebut theres no occasion  saying this he advanced with a steady tread into the cave the echoes of which were still ringing with the clatter of the horses hoofs as it passed over the stone floor  it could not have been more than a quarter of a minute when they reached the end of what appeared to be the outer vestibule of this cavern though to march it seemed to be more than five minutes and now that he could no longer see the blue eyes all manner of horrible doubts and fears assailed him  he felt deeply his helpless condition poor fellow  had he been sound in wind and limb he would have cared little for a brave and a strong man naturally feels that he can fight a stout battle for life in all or any circumstances  but part of this prop namely strength having been removed by his recent accident he felt like a miserable child  doubtless it is good for strong men to be brought thus low sometimes just to prove to them what they are by nature very slow to believe that they quite as much as the weak and helpless ones of this world are dependent at all times on their fellows  on reaching the end of the outer cave the hunter turned to the left stooped down in order to pass below a small natural arch and finally stood still in the middle of another cavern on the floor of which he deposited his burden with much tenderness and care  there was light in this cave but it was so dim as to be insufficient to illuminate the surrounding objects  march perceived on looking up that it entered through a small aperture in the side of the cavern near the roof which was not more than twelve feet from the floor  there were several pieces of charred wood on one side of the cave in which a few sparks of fire still lingered  without saying a word the owner of this strange abode went towards these and blowing them into a flame heaped large logs upon them so that in ten minutes the place was brilliantly illuminated with a ruddy blaze that did ones heart good to look upon  by the light of the fire march perceived that he had been deposited on a couch of pinebranches  he was about to make other observations when his captor turned to him and said  ill go an see to the horse and be back in a minute so keep yer mind easy  and pray what name am i to call my host by said march unable to restrain his curiosity any longer  a dark almost fierce frown covered the mans face as he said angrily boy curiosity is a bad thinganywise its bad here  ive brought you to this cave cause youd ha died i the woods if i hadnt  dont ask questions about what dont consarn ye  nay friend i meant no offence replied march  ive no desire to pry into any mans secrets  nevertheless its but natural to want to know how to address a man when ye converse with him  true true replied the other somewhat mollified  call me dick its as good a name as any and better than my own  there was a slight touch of bitterness in the tone in which this was said as the man turned on his heel to quit the cave  stay cried march you only give me one name friend so ill do the same by you  my names marchthere now you may march about your business  dick smiled and said well march ill be with ye again and have a look at your sore bones in two minutes  when he was gone march for the first time since his accident bethought him of his comrades  since recovering from the state of insensibility into which his fall had thrown him his mind had been so absorbed by the strange events that had been presented to him in such rapid succession as well as with the pain that racked his head and limbs that he had had no time to think about them  but now that he was left in that quiet place alone the whole circumstances of the recent pursuit and flight rushed suddenly upon him and his mind was filled with anxious forebodings as to the fate of his comrades  oh  im glad youve come back he cried as dick reentered the cave i quite forgot my comradesshame on me but my miserable head has got such a smash that amost everythings bin drove out of it  time enough to speak o them after weve seen to your bones said dick  nay but  after said dick in a tone that was not to be gainsaid  march submitted with a sigh and his eccentric host proceeded to manipulate and punch him in a way that might perhaps have been highly necessary but was by no means agreeable  after a few minutes he pronounced his patient all right only a little bruised  having said which he proceeded to prepare some food and said to march that he might now speak about his comrades  at first he seemed to pay little attention to the youths hasty narrative but on hearing that the indians were hastening to attack the mountain fort he sprang up and asked a few questions eagerly  it was evident that the news troubled him deeply  taking one or two hasty strides up and down the cavern and paying no attention to the roasting meat which he seemed to have utterly forgotten the wild man of the west muttered angrily to himself and a slight dash of that tigerlike flash which had gone so far to earn him his title lighted up his blue eyes insomuch that march marston looked at him in amazement not unmingled with awe  thoughts of the wild man of the west once more occurred to him but in his former cogitations on that subject he had so thoroughly discarded the idea of this kind blueeyed hunter being that farfamed and ferocious individual that his thoughts only took the form of the mental question i wonder if the wild man o the west could beat such a fellow as that at a fair standup fight  so powerfully did this thought affect him that he could not refrain from exclaiming  i say dick did you ever hear of the wild man of the west  dick was so much tickled by the question that his angry mood vanished and turning towards his guest with a smile while his blue eyes seemed milder than they ever had appeared before he said  yes lad ive heard of him  have you seen him continued march eagerly  i have many a time  what is he like  hes like me replied dick with another smile the softness of which would have driven march to an immeasurable distance from the truth had he ever been near it  like you  oh i suppose you mean hes something about your size well i dont wonder at that for youre an uncommonly big fellow dick but i fancy his appearance is very different  well no  hes got light hair and blue eyes like me  this was a poser to march  it was so totally subversive of all his preconceived ideas that it reduced him for some moments to silence  isnt he hairy all over like a fox and very ugly inquired march recovering from his surprise  this was a poser in turn to the wild man  to be called upon suddenly to pronounce an opinion on his own looks was embarrassing to say the least of it  hes not exactly hairy all over said dick after a moments thought though it cant be denied hes got plenty of hair on his head and chinlike me  as for his looks lad it aint easy to say whether hes ugly or pritty for men dont agree on sich pints dye see  do sit down beside me dick and tell me about this wild man said march earnestly  you cant fancy how anxious i am to see him  ive come here for that very purpose  no doubt ive come to shoot and trap too but chiefly to see the wild man o the west  an isnt it provokin  i might have seen him some weeks agone if i hadnt bin stunned with a fall jist as he came jumpin into the middle o us like a clap o thunder  what lad interrupted dick was it you that i  just at this moment dick was seized with a very violent fit of coughing which coming as it did from such a capacious chest and so powerful a pair of lungs caused the roof of the cavern to reverberate with what might have been mistaken outside for a species of miniature artillery  youve caught cold suggested march who gazed in unspeakable admiration at the magnificent locks and beard of this remarkable man as they shook with the violence of his exertion  i never had a cold replied dick becoming quiet again theres other things as cause a man for to cough now and agin besides colds  true rejoined march but you were sayin somethindo you know of the fight i was speakin of  know of itay that do i  why how did you happen to hear of it  its wonderful lad how i comes to know about things in this part o the country  i know everything the wild man does  he cant move without my bein on his track drectly  in fact i follers him like his shadowleastwise his shadow follers me  indeed exclaimed march whose interest in dick became suddenly tenfold more deep on learning this  but why do you follow him about in this fashion  does he like your company or do you only follow him on the sly and keep out of sight  explain yourself dickyou puzzle me  i cant explain just now lad said dick rising abruptly  you forget that your comrades may be in a fix before now wi them blackguard redskins  i must go an help them  its but right that white men should lend one another a helpin hand in these regions where the injuns have it almost all their own way  but the mountain fort is far away from this an im afraid youll never be able to get there in time said march with an anxious expression of countenance  ill try returned dick  anyhow ill send the wild man o the west to help them he added with a peculiar smile  now boy listen i must not waste more time in idle talk  i shall leave you here under the charge of my little girl  your little girl echoed march in surprise  ay she ought to have been in before now continued dick without noticing the interruption an i would like to ha told her who ye are and how i come by ye an what to do till i come back  but i cant wait times precious as gold just now so ill tell ye what to say to her when she  at that moment a light footstep was heard in the outer cavern  the wild man sprang up on hearing it and strode hastily through the natural doorway leaving march to listen in a state of the utmost bewilderment to a silvery musical voice which held rapid converse with his strange host  presently dick returned followed by avision in leather the sight of which struck march marston dumb and rendered him for a few moments as totally incapable of moving hand tongue or foot as if he had been bewitchedwhich in a sense he was  this is the little girl i spoke of tye said dick looking at march and patting the girl on her soft cheek with a hand that might have passed for a small shoulder of mutton  shell take good care of ye march  ive told her what to do but she dont need to be told  now see ye dont do yerself a mischief lad till i come back  it wont be longa day or two mayhap more or less but yell take that time to mend youre worse battered than ye think ofso goodday  while the wild man was ejaculating these sentences abruptly he was striding about the cave with what may be styled enormous vigour picking up and buckling on his weapons of war  he seized a doubleedged sword of gigantic proportions and buckled it to his waist but march saw it not  he pulled on the scalpfringed coat of a blackfoot chief with leggings to match but march knew it not  he slung a powderhorn and bulletpouch round his shoulders stuck a knife and tomahawk into his belt and grasped a long rifle which stood in a corner and in doing all this he made such a tremendous clatter and displayed such wonderful activity and grew so much fiercer to look at in every stage of the process that march would certainly have recurred to the idea of the wild man had he been in his ordinary state of mind but he was not in that happy condition  march knew nothing about it whatever  before going dick stooped and kissed the vision on the cheek  march saw that  it recalled him for a moment and made him aware of the disappearance of his host and of the loud clattering sounds of his chargers hoofs as he led him at a rapid walk across the outer cave march even heard the general clatter of all his accoutrements as he vaulted into the saddle at one bound and went down that terrible rocky way at a breakneck gallop that would have caused him march in other circumstances to shudder  but he did not shudder  he was but faintly aware of these things  his intellect was overturned his whole soul was captivated his imagination his perceptions his conceptionsall his faculties and capacities were utterly overwhelmed and absorbed by that wonderful vision in leather    chapter seventeen  the vision in leather  it is all very well for men of the world men of fashion men who pride themselves on being highly civilised and peculiarly refined to fancy that there are no other visions in this world than visions in silk visions in white and the like  those who think thus labour under an egregious though a civilised mistake  happily there are kind loving pretty faces in this world the possessors of which know nothing about pink gauze or white muslinfaces that have never felt the hot air of a drawingroom but are much used to present themselves unveiled to the fresh breezes of the prairie and the mountain faces that possess the rare quality of universal attraction and that cause men to fancy when they see them for the first time that they have beheld a vision  the fact is that some faces are visions whether the forms that support them appear to us in muslin or in deerskin  the only requisite needful to constitute a face a vision to any particular person is that it should have in it that peculiar something which everybody wants but which nobody can define which is ineffably charming though utterly incomprehensible and which when once seen by any one constitutes the countenance that possesses it a vision evermore  it is quite immaterial what material composes the dress in which the vision appears  no doubt the first time it bursts upon the smitten victim dress may be a powerful auxiliary but after the first time dress goes for little or nothing  march marstons vision appeared as we have said in leather  after the wild man had vanished march continued to gaze at his new companion with all kinds of feelings and emotions but without being able to move or speak  the vision returned the compliment also without speaking or taking any further notice of him  she was a wonderful creature that vision in leather  that she was of indian extraction was evident from the hue of her skin yet she was not nearly so dark as the lightest complexioned indian  in fact her clear soft forehead was whiter than those of many socalled palefaces but her ruddy cheeks her lightbrown hair and above all her bright brown eye showed that white blood ran in her veins  she was what men term a halfcaste  she was young almost girlish in her figure and deportment but the earnest gravity of her pretty face caused her to appear older than she really was  march unconsciously and without an effort guessed her to be sixteen  he was wrong  she had only seen fifteen summers  her dress was a beautifully dressed deerskin gown reaching below the knees as soft as chamois leather and ornamented with beads and quill work  it was girded round her small waist by a leather belt from which depended a small huntingknife  a pair of ornamental leggings of the same material as the gown covered her limbs and moccasins her feet which latter as well as her hands were small and beautifully formed over her shoulders were slung the masculine appendages of a powderhorn and bulletpouch proving that this creature was so to speak a dianic vision  her staring so hard and so long at march without speaking or smiling or taking any more notice of him than if he had been an effigy on a tombstone seemed unaccountable to that youth  had he been able to look at himself from her point of view he would not have been so much surprised  in his late accident he had received so severe a blow on the left eye that that orb was altogether shut up  as he did not move and as the other eye with which he gazed in supreme astonishment at the sweet face before him happened to be farthest from the fire besides being hid in the shadow of his own nosewhich was not a small one by nature and was a peculiarly large one by force of recent circumstancesthe vision very naturally thought that he was fast asleep  as she stood there gazing wonderingly and somewhat sadly at the poor youth with the red flickering flame of the fire lighting up her yellow garments deepening the red on her round cheeks glinting on the loose masses of her rich tresses and sparkling in the depths of her bright brown eyes march thought he had never in all his life before beheld such an exquisite creature  supposing that he was asleep the vision sat down quietly on a log beside the fire still keeping her eyes however fixed on her guest the action took her out of the direct line of fire of marchs sound eye therefore he turned his head abruptly and so brought his staring orb into the light of the fire and revealed the fact that he was wideawake whereupon the vision uttered an exclamation of surprise rose hastily and went to his side  you is woke she said  me tink you was be sleep  asleep cried march with enthusiasm no i wasnt asleep  more than that ill never go to sleep any more  this bold assertion naturally filled the vision with surprise  why for not she asked sitting down on a log beside march in such a position that she could see him easily  for thinkin o you replied the bold youth firmly  the vision looked at him in still greater astonishment opening her eyes slowly until they seemed like two pellucid lakelets of unfathomable depth into which march felt inclined to fling himself clothes and all and be drowned comfortably  she then looked at the fire then at march again  it was evident that she had not been accustomed to hold intercourse with jocular minds  perceiving this march at once changed his tone and with a feeling of respect which he could not well account for said rather bluntly  whats your name  mary  ay did your father give you that name  my father echoed the girl looking hastily up  ay did dick give it you  did him tell you hims name be dick asked mary  oh hes known by another name to you then it would seem  but mary what is his name  the girl pursed her mouth and laid her finger on it  then with a little sad smile said  him tell you dick that be good name  but dick not my father  my father dead  the poor thing said this so slowly and in such a low pathetic tone that march felt sorry for having unwittingly touched a tender chord  he hastened to change the subject by saying  is dick kind to you mary  kind she cried looking up with a flashing eye and flushed face while with one of her little hands she tossed back her luxuriant tresses  kind  him be my father now  no have got nobody to love me now but him  yes you have mary said march stoutly  mary looked at him in surprise and said who  me replied march  mary said nothing to this  it was quite clear that the wild man must have neglected her education sadly  she did not even smile she merely shook her head and gazed abstractedly at the embers of the fire  dick is not your father mary continued march energetically but he has become your father  i am not your brother but ill become your brotherif youll let me  march in his enthusiasm tried to raise himself consequently he fell back and drowned marys answer in a groan of anguish  but he was not to be baulked  what said you he inquired after a moments pause  me say you be very good  she said this so calmly that march felt severely disappointed  in the height of his enthusiasm he forgot that the poor girl had as yet seen nothing to draw out her feelings towards him as his had been drawn out towards her  she had seen no vision except indeed the vision of a wretched dishevelled youth of an abrupt excitable temperament with one side of his countenance scratched in a most disreputable manner and the other side swelled and mottled to such an extent that it resembled a cheap plumpudding with the fruit unequally and sparsely distributed over its yellow surface  march was mollified however when the girl suggested that his pillow seemed uncomfortable and rose to adjust it with tender care  then she said now me bring blankit  you go sleep  me sit here till you sleep after that me go away  if ye wants me holler out  me sleep in next room  so saying this wonderful creature flitted across the cavern and vanished thereby revealing to march the fact that there was a third cavern in that place  presently she returned with a green blanket and spread it over him after which she sat down by the fire and seemed absorbed in her private meditations while march tried to sleep  but what a night march had of it  whichever way he turned that vision was ever before his eyes  when he awoke with a start there she was bending over the fire  when he dreamed there she was floating in an atmosphere of blue stars  sometimes she was smiling on him sometimes gazing sadly but never otherwise than sweetly  presently he saw her sitting on dicks knee twisting his great moustache with her delicate hand and he was about to ask dick how he had managed to get back so soon when he the wild man suddenly changed into marchs own mother who clasped the vision fervently to her breast and called her her own darling son  there was no end to it  she never left him  sometimes she appeared in curious forms and in odd aspectsthough always pleasant and sweet to look upon  sometimes she was dancing gracefully like an embodied zephyr on the floor frequently walking in midair occasionally perambulating the ceiling of the cave  she often changed her place but she never went away  there was no escape  and march was glad of it  he didnt want to escape  he was only too happy to court the phantom  but it did not require courting  it hovered over him walked round him sat beside him beckoned to him and smiled at him neverno never since the world began was any scratched and battered youth so thoroughly badgered and bewitched as was poor march marston on that memorable night by that naughty vision in leather    chapter eighteen  the cave of the wild man of the westmarch and mary hold pleasant intercoursedicks good qualities enlarged onthe wild man gives a redskin a strange lessona startling interruption to pleasant converse  when march marston awoke the following morning and found himself lying on a low couch in the mysterious cavern of the wild man of the west he experienced the curious sensation with which every one is more or less familiar of not knowing where he was  the vision in leather which had worried him to such an extent during the night had left him in peaceas most visions usually doan hour or so before daybreak and as the real vision had not yet issued from the inner chamber of the cave there was nothing familiar near him when he awoke to recall his scattered senses  his first effort to rise however quickened his memory amazingly  pains shot through all his limbs the chase the fall dick the cavern recurred to him and lastbut not least for it obliterated and swallowed up all the rest the vision broke upon his beclouded brain and cleared his faculties  looking curiously round the cavern he observed for the first timewhat he might have observed the night before had he not been preoccupied with sudden numerous and powerful surprisesthat the walls were hung with arms and trophies of the chase  just opposite to him hung the skin of an enormous grisly bear with the head and skull entire and the mouth and teeth grinning at him in an awful manner  near to this were the skin and horns of several buffaloes  in other places there were more horns and heads and hides of bears of various kinds as well as of deer and conspicuous above the entrance hung the ungainly skull and ponderous horns of an elk  mingled with these and arranged in such a manner as to prove that dick or the visionone or other or bothwere by no means destitute of taste hung various spears and bows and quivers and shields of indian manufacture with spears and bows whose form seemed to indicate that dick himself was their fabricator  there was much of tasteful ornament on the sheaths and handles of many of these weapons  the floor of the apartment in which he lay was of solid rock cleanly washed and swept but there was no furniture of any kindonly a pile of freshcut pinebranches with which the place was perfumed and two or three rough logs which had been used as seats the night before by the host and hostess of thisto marchenchanted castle  march was staring earnestly at one of these logs which lay close to the ashes of the fire trying to recall the form that had last occupied it when a rustle at the inner passage attracted his attention and next moment the vision again stood before him  it was if possible more innocent and young and sweet than on the previous night  good mornin  you very good sleep me hope  ay that had i a capital sleep cried march heartily holding out his hand which the vision grasped unhesitatingly and shook with manly vigour  bees you hongray  no not a bit said march  the girl looked sad at this  you muss heat she said quickly at the same time raking together the embers of the fire and blowing them up into a flame over which she placed a large iron pot  dick hims always heat well an keep well  once me was be sick  dick him say to me heat  me say no want heat  hims say you muss heat  so me try an sure nuff get well tomorrow  march laughed at this prompt and effectual remedy for disease and said well ill try  perhaps it will cure me especially if you feed me  poor march saw by the simplicity of his companions looks that gallantry and compliments were alike thrown away on her so he resolved to try them no more  having come to this conclusion he said  i say mary come and sit by me while i talk with you  i want to know how you came to be in this wild outotheway place and who dick is and what brought him here an in short all about it  the girl drew her log near as he desired but said what dick no tell me no tell  but surely urged march in a somewhat testy tone you may tell me something about ye  mary shook her head  why not  dick say no tell  oh  dicks an ass  had mary known the meaning of her companions rude speech she might possibly have surprised him with a decided opinion in regard to himself but never having heard of nor seen such a creature in all her life she only looked up with a quiet expression of curiosity and said  what bees an ass  ha haho he a roared our hero with a mingled feeling of exasperation and savage gleean ass  why its a lovely slender creature with short pretty ears and taper limbs and a sleek glossy coat likelike me mary dear why im an ass myself  pray do get me somethin to eat  i really believe my appetites comin back agin  mary looked at march in much concern  she had once nursed the wild man through a severe illness and knew what delirium was and she began to suspect that her guest was beginning to give way  now lie down she said with an air of decision that was almost ludicrous in one so youthful  yet march felt that he must obey  me will git meat ready  you sleep littil bit  march shut his eyes at once but the instant that mary turned to attend to the iron kettle he opened them and continued to gaze at the busy little housewife until she chanced to look in his direction when he shut them again quickly and very tight  this was done twice but the third time mary caught him in the act and broke into a merry laugh  it was the first time she had laughed aloud since march met her so he laughed too out of sheer delight and sympathy  when march had finished breakfast he tried to get up and found to his great relief and satisfaction that no bones were brokena fact of which he had stood in considerable doubtand that his muscles were less acutely pained than they had been  still he was very stiff and quite unable with any degree of comfort to walk across the cave so he made up his mind to lie there till he got wella resolution which in the pride of his heart he deemed exceedingly virtuous and praiseworthy forgetting either deliberately or stupidly that the presence of mary rendered that otherwise dull cavern the most delightful of sick chambers and that her attendance was ample compensation and reward for any amount of pain or selfdenial  mary he said when she had cleared away the debris of the morning meal sit down here and tell me a few things  youre so terribly close that one doesnt know what he may ask an what he maynt  but if you dont like to speak you can hold your tongue you know  now tell me how old are you  fifteen replied mary  ay  i thought yed been older  how long have ye bin with dick  in cave hereten year  before that me live in my fathers wigwam  was yer father a trapper inquired march tenderly  marys face at once assumed an expression of earnest gravity and she answered yes in a low sad tone  march was going to have inquired further on this point but fear lest he should hurt the feelings of the poor child induced him to change the subject  and how came ye said he first to meet with dick  mary pressed her lips  oh very well dont tell if it aint right by no manner o means  do ye think that dick intends to keep ye here always  me not know  humph  an you say hes good to ye  oh yes cried mary with a sudden blaze of animation on her usually placid countenance hims good very goodgooder to me than nobody else  well i could have guessed that seein that nobody else has had anything to do with ye but him for ten years past  but hims not only good to megood to everybody continued the girl with increasing animation  you not know how goodcant know  certainly not assented march it aint possible to know not havin bin told but if youll tell me ill listen  march marston had at last struck a chord that vibrated intensely in the bosom of the warmhearted child  she drew her log closer to him in her eagerness to dilate on the goodness of her adopted father and began to pour into his willing ears such revelations of the kind and noble deeds that he had done that march was fired with enthusiasm and began to regard his friend dick in the light of a demigod  greatheart in the pilgrims progress seemed most like to him he thought only dick seemed grander which was a natural feeling for bunyan drew his greatheart true to nature while mary and march had invested dick with a robe of romance which glittered so much that he looked preternaturally huge  march listened with rapt attention but as the reader is not march we will not give the narrative in marys bad english  suffice it to say that she told how on one occasion dick happened to be out hunting near to a river into which he saw a little indian child fall  it was carried swiftly by the current to a cataract fifty feet high and in a few minutes would have been over and dashed to pieces when dick happily saw it and plunging in brought it safe to shore yet with such difficulty that he barely gained the bank and grasped the branch of an overhanging willow when his legs were drawn over the edge of the fall he had to hold on for ten minutes till men came from the other side of the stream to his assistance  mary also told him and it was evening ere she finished all she had to tell him how that on another occasion dick was out after grislies with a hunter who had somehow allowed himself to be caught by a bear and would have been torn in pieces had not dick come up with his great twoedged swordhaving fired off his rifle without effectand with one mighty sweep at the monsters neck cut right through its jugular vein and all its other veins down to the very marrow of its backbone in fact killed it at one blowa feat which no one had ever done or had ever heard of as being done from the days of the first indian to that hour  many such stories did mary relate to the poor invalid who bore his sufferings with exemplary patience and fortitude and listened with unflagging interest but of all the stories she told none seemed to afford her so much pleasure in the telling as the following  one day dick went out to hunt buffaloes on his big horse for he had several steeds one or other of which he rode according to fancy but he always mounted the big black one when he went after the buffalo or to war  mary here explained very carefully that dick never went to war on his own accountthat he was really a man of peace but that when he saw oppression and cruelty his blood boiled within him at such a rate that he almost went mad and often under the excitement of hot indignation would he dash into the midst of a band of savages and scatter them right and left like autumn leaves  well as he was riding along among the mountains near the banks of a broad stream and not far from the edge of the great prairie he came suddenly on an object that caused his eyes to glare and his teeth to grind for there under the shade of a few branches with a pot of water by her side sat an old indian woman  dick did not need to ask what she was doing there  he knew the ways of the redskins too well to remain a moment in doubt  she had grown so old and feeble that her relations had found her burdensome so according to custom they left her there to die  the poor old creature knew that she was a burden to them  she knew also the customs of her tribeit was at her own request she had been left there a willing victim to an inevitable fate because she felt that her beloved children would get on better without her  they made no objection  food to last for a few days was put within reach of her trembling hand a fire was kindled and a little pile of wood placed beside it also within reach  then they left her  they knew that when that food was consumed and the last stick placed upon the fire the shrunken limbs would stand in no need of warmththe old heart would be still  yet that heart had once beat joyfully at the sound of those pattering feet that now retired with heavy ruthless tread for ever  what a commentary on savage life  what a contrast between the promptings of the unregenerate heart of man and the precepts of that blessedthrice blessed gospel of jesus christ where love unalterable inextinguishable glows in every lesson and sweetens every command  when dick came upon her suddenly as we have said he was not ten paces distant from the spot where she sat but she was apparently deaf and blind for she evinced no knowledge of his presence  she was reaching out her skinny arm to place another stick upon the sinking fire at the time for it was a sharp and cold though a bright and sunny autumn day dick stopped his horse crushed his teeth together and sat for a few moments regarding her intently  either the firewood had originally been placed too far away from the old womans hand or she had shifted her position for she could not reach it  once and again she made the effortshe stretched out her withered arm and succeeded in just touching the end of one of the pieces of wood but could not grasp it  she pawed it once or twice and then gave up the attempt with a little sigh  drawing herself slowly together she gathered up the rabbitskin blanket which rested on her shoulders and attempted feebly to fold it across her chest  then she slowly drooped her white head with an expression of calm resignation on her old wrinkled visage  dicks great heart almost burst with conflicting emotions  the wrath that welled up as he thought of the deserters was met by a gush of tender pity as he gazed through blinding tears on the deserted  with a fling that caused his stout warhorse to stagger he leaped to the ground tore open the breast of his huntingshirt and sitting down beside the old woman placed her cold hand in his bosom  she uttered a feeble cry and made a slight momentary effort to resist but dicks act though promptly was nevertheless tenderly done and the big hand that stroked her white head was so evidently that of a friend that the poor creature resigned herself to the enjoyment of that warmth of which she stood so much in need  meanwhile dick without shifting his position stretched forth his long arm collected all the wood within reach and placed it on the fire  after a few minutes the old woman raised her head and looking earnestly in dicks face with her bleared and almost sightless eyes said in the indian language with which her companion was well acquainted  my son have you come back to me  a gush of indignant feeling had again to be violently stifled ere dick could answer in moderate tones  no mother hes not come back but ill be a son to ye  see sit up an warm yerself at the blaze  ill get ye some meat and sticks  in hot haste and with desperate activity for he had no other way of relieving his feelings dick cut down a quantity of firewood and placed it close to the hand of the old woman  then he untied the tin kettle which he always carried at his saddlebow and with a piece of dried venison concocted a quantity of hot soup in a marvellously short space of time  this done he sat down beside the old woman and made her partake of it  is it long since they left ye mother he said after she had swallowed a little  the old woman pondered for a few seconds  no she said not long only one sun has gone down since my son left me  then she added in a sad tone i loved him  he is a great warriora brave chiefand he loved me too  but he had to leave me i am old and useless  it is my fate  describe your son to me said dick abruptly  he is tall and straight as the poplar began the old creature while a look of pride played for a moment on her withered countenance  his shoulders are broad and his limbs are supple  he can run and leap like the deer but not so well as he once could  grey hairs are now mingling with the black  has he any mark by which i could find him out interrupted dick impatiently  he has a deep cut over the right eye returned the woman but stay she added in some alarm you would not harm my son you are not an enemy  no i would not i would do him good  which way did they go  to the prairieto the rising sun  dick at once arose placed the kettle of soup close to the old womans side and unbuckling his saddlegirth removed the blanket that covered his saddle and transferred it to her shoulders  this done without uttering another word he vaulted into his saddle and dashed away as if he were flying for his life  the old woman listened until the clatter of his horses hoofs ceased to beat upon her deadened ear and then bent her head as at the first in calm resignation  doubtless she fancied that another fellowcreature had forsaken her and that the end would soon come  but dick had not forsaken her  he bounded along over the rugged ground on the mettlesome steed striking fire from the flinty rocks leaping creeks and rivulets bursting through bush and brake mile after mile until he gained the open prairie while the black coat of his charger was speckled with foam  here he drew rein and trotted hither and thither in search of the tracks of the indians  he found them at last and dismounted to examine them for save to the eye of a trapper or a redman there were no visible tracks on that hard turf  remounting he resumed his headlong coursesweeping over the springy turf of the plains as if his horse were a winged pegasus whose energies could not know exhaustion  all day he rode and as evening drew on he came in sight of the tribe of indians  they had encamped for the night and were preparing their evening meal but when they saw the solitary horseman on the faroff horizon the braves and old men went to the verge of the camp to watch him  on he came bounding over the turf like the pronghorned antelope turning neither to the right hand nor to the left but taking everything that intercepted him in a flying leap and bearing down on the camp as an arrow flies from the bow  although a single horseman is not usually an object of terror to a band of indians these braves soon began to evince by their looks that they did not feel easy in regard to this one  as he drew near they recognised him for dick had on a former occasion given this particular tribe a taste of his prowess  each man instantly rushed to his weapons and horse but the horses had been turned out to graze and could not be easily caught  before they secured their weapons dick was in the midst of them  with an eagle glance he singled out the chief with the cut over his right eye and rode between him and his tent  the indian seeing that he was cut off from his weapons darted swiftly out upon the plain and made for a clump of stunted trees hoping to find shelter until his comrades could come to his rescue  but dick was there before him and rode down upon him in such a way that he was compelled to take to the open plain and run for his life  his pursuer allowed him to run keeping just close enough to him to force him into the particular course he desired him to take  but the savage proved indeed to be what his mother had styled hima brave chief  apparently resolving rather to die than to be hunted thus like a wolf he halted suddenly turned sharp round and crossing his arms on his bare chest looked dick full in the face as he came up  just as he was within ten yards of him the indian drew his knife and hurled it at the breast of his enemy with such violence that it hissed in its passage through the air  dick received it on his shield where it stood quivering  plucking it therefrom with a grim smile he placed it in his own girdle and riding up to the indian sternly bade him mount in front of him  there was no refusing to obey that voice  the indian cast one uneasy glance towards his camp which was now far away on the plain but there was no sign of any one coming to the rescue  his captor had got the credit of being an evil spirit and he felt that he was left to his fate  a hasty repetition of the order compelled him to turn and seize the mane of the horse  dick held out his toe for him to step on the next moment he was seated in front of the paleface galloping towards the mountains  whatever astonishment the indian felt at this singular treatment or whatever his curiosity as to the result of it all his countenance expressed nothing but calm scorn and defiance  he was evidently working himself into that state of mind which these redskin warriors endeavour to assume when they are captured and taken to the stake and the torture there to prove their title to the name of brave by enduring the most inconceivable agonies with stoical indifference or there to bring discredit on their tribe infamy on their name and joy to their enemies by breaking down under the infliction of tortures at the bare mention of which humanity shudders  for some time they maintained the same headlong speed  when however all danger of pursuit was over dick drew rein and proceeded more leisurely in order to relieve his now jaded steed  but that was a steed of the true metal  it possessed that generous spirit which would have induced it willingly to exert itself even to the death  its owner might have ridden it till it fell prostrate and dying on the plain but he could not have ridden it to the point of refusing to advance because of exhaustion  he was merciful to it and went slowly during the night but he did not come to a final halt until the rising sun found him close to the camp of the dying woman  the indian now for the first time began partly to guess the object of his having been brought there and steeled his heart to bear whatever might await him  dick dismounted and grasping the indian with a force that showed him how helpless he would be in a personal struggle should he venture to attempt it led him forward and placed him a few paces in front of his dying mother  she was sitting just as she had been left but the fire had gone out and she trembled violently beneath the blanket which she had sought to pull closer around her wasted form  dick blamed himself mentally for having put so little wood on the fire and proceeded to rekindle it but before doing so he took a chain from his saddlebow with which he fastened the indian to a tree that stood exactly opposite the spot on which the old woman sat and not ten paces distant  he bound him in such a way that he could sit on the ground and lean his back against the tree but he could neither stand up nor lie down  for the first time the countenance of the savage betrayed uneasiness he believed no doubt that he was to be left to witness the dying agonies of his mother and the thought filled him with horror  to leave her as he did to perish had not been difficult because he knew that he should not see the act of perishing but to be brought there and compelled to witness this terrible doom acted out in all its minute and horrible details on the mother whom he had once loved so tenderly was maddening to think of  all the dread tortures that had yet been invented and practised on warriors must have seemed to him as nothing compared with this awful device of the paleface on whom he now glared with the eyes of implacable hate and ferocity  will the paleface he said fiercely cast me loose and meet me hand to hand in a fair fight  surely he added changing his tone to one of ineffable scorn the paleface is not weak he is not a small man that he should fear a chief like bighorn  harkee  bighorn said dick striding up to him and laying the cold edge of his hatchet on the indians forehead if you speak another word above yer breath the paleface will cleave ye to the chin  there was something so thoroughly resolute in dicks voice that the indian was cowed effectually  the fire was soon lighted and dick chafed and warmed the limbs of the old woman until he brought back the vital spark  then he set on the kettle to boil  while a new mess was preparing he went into the wood and with lusty blows brought down the trees and cut them into huge billets which he piled upon the fire until it roared again and the heart of the feeble creature began to beat once more with somewhat of its wonted vigour  this done he arranged a couch in such a way that she might get the full benefit of the heat without being scorched after which he rubbed down his good steed and cast it loose to feed  then he cooked and ate some food but offered never a bit to the indian who gazed at him as he performed these various actions with everincreasing amazement and anxiety  then dick sat down beside the old woman to feed and tend her till she should die and he knew the signs of death too well to suppose that his care would long be required  all that day and all that night and all the next day did the trapper the old woman and the indian remain in much the same position  dick moved about a little to give the old woman food and drink as she required it and to wrap the blanket more comfortably round her for which kind deeds the poor creature often tried to gaze fondly in his face with her sightless eyes  during all this time her son sat opposite observing every look and motion yet unable himself to move  the pangs of hunger now began to gnaw within him and from his cramped position he became so cold that he trembled violently in every limb despite his efforts to command himself  but dick paid no attention whatever to him he knew that he was strong and could stand it  once the indian implored his jailer to give him some food but dick said sternly ill give ye food before ye die if ye keep quiet  at last about nightfall of the second day the sands of life began to run slowly  dick saw that the old womans end was approaching so he rose and going towards her son he placed food before him  he devoured it ravenously  then he gave him drink and loosing him led him to the fire where he speedily recovered his wonted heat and energy after that dick led him to his mothers side and made him kneel  mother said dick can you see and hear me  ay but you are not my son said the dying woman faintly  you are a palefaceyou are very goodbut you are not my son  true mother but see i have brought your son back to youlay your hand on her forehead he added in that low stern undertone which he had used throughout to bighorn who could not but obey  stroke her head look in her eyes and speak to her  the redman did not require to be told now  a natural impulse led him to do as he was bid  the instant the tones of his voice struck her ear the old woman seemed to awaken with a start she looked up eagerly caught the hand that touched her forehead and passing her own thin hand up to the indians face felt the scar over his eye as if to render herself doubly sure  then she grasped the hand again in both of hers and taking it under the blanket pressed it to her withered breast and held it tightly there  but that burst of unexpected joy hastened the falling of the last few grains of sand  for ten minutes longer they watched her as the breath went and came more and more feebly  then it ceased altogether and death sealed her eyes  but she did not release the hand of her son  he had some difficulty in loosening that clasp of maternal love which was stronger even than death  after all was over dick seized the indian and led him to the tree to which he chained him again  then he dug a grave in the soft soil in which he placed the body of the old woman with gentle care  having covered it over he went into the woods caught and saddled his horse and led him towards the wondering savage whom he once more unbound and set free  bighorn said dick impressively youve been made to comfort and gladden the heart o yer old mother in her last moments  if ye was a paleface yed thank the great spirit for that to the last day o yer life  if ye ever do come to think like the palefaces youll remember that youve to thank me for bringing ye here  go tell the redskins who it is that caught ye and what he did and said to ye  saying this dick mounted his horse and rode very slowly into the forest leaving the redman standing by the side of his mothers grave  after mary had concluded this story which we may remark she related with much fewer comments than we have seen fit to pass upon it she and march looked at each other for a long time in silence  then march suddenly exclaimed  hes a splendid fellowdick  mary both by looks and words highly approved of this opinion  and yet said she somewhat abstractedly this bees the man who peepils call  mary pursed her lips suddenly  call what inquired march quickly  wicked wild bad man replied mary who fortunately could say all this with perfect truth without betraying her secret  in fact poor mary had never had a secret confided to her before and having been told by the wild man of the west that she was on no account to reveal his real title to their guest she was in the utmost perplexity lest it should slip out unawares  mary said march who was always stumbling upon the verge of the truth in a most unaccountable way without actually getting hold of it have you ever seen the wild man of the west  yes replied the girl with a gay smile  have you  well now thats odd  how much i should like to see him to tell you the truth one of my chief reasons for coming here was to see him  what like is he  like dick replied the girl quietly  like dick echoed march in surprise why thats what dick said himself and yet by all accounts his character must be very different from that of dick who seems to be the kindest tenderesthearted man that ever came to trap in the rocky mountains  what does peepil say bout this wild mans of the west inquired mary  that hes awful fierce an terrible cruel an ten or fifteen feet high i forget which for everybody gives him a different height  mary laughed  bees that all  oh no  they say he eats men  mary laughed again  an women and barsraw  mary laughed louder and longer than ever and when she laughed she looked so ineffably sweet that march resolved to go on with the catalogue of the wild mans virtues piecemeal waiting for the laugh between each statement until there was not another idea left in his brain for his tongue to utter  but this amiable intention was frustrated by the report of a gun outside which echoed and reechoed among these savage cliffs like muttering thunder  it was followed by a yell that caused mary to start up with a look of horror and rush out of the cave leaving the invalid in a most distressing state of uncertainty as to what he should do and in no little anxiety as to what would happen next    chapter nineteen  the mysteries of the cave explainedingenious devices of the wild man march and mary besiegedthe redskins proceed to make themselves at home in the cavern  there are few things in this world which are not somewhat mysterious or that cannot be by a peculiar combination of circumstances more or less invested with mystery and we hold it to be an unfair and a very paltry device on the part of an author to seek to mystify his readers by keeping them in unnecessary ignorance of that which is in itself simple and commonplace  therefore we beg leave to state that the apparent mystery with which we concluded the last chapter was not a mystery at all  the loud report there referred to was caused by a savage discharging his gun and the cry that followed was the result of that same savage opening his ugly mouth and giving vent to a tremendous howl  that this was a howl of triumph was evident to ears accustomed to the warwhoop of the redman  that it was destined to be succeeded by an exclamation of mingled disappointment and surprise was evident at least to mary who knew the mysteries of the place  in order to make this plain without further circumlocution we may as well inform the reader at once that the wild man of the west perhaps we should call him dick in deference to march marstons ignorance of his real character at this time was not only a subject of terror to the indians inhabiting this region of the earth at that particular era in the worlds history but also a subject of intense curiosity  hence for many years past it had been an object of ambition on the part of the more courageous of the indian warriors to trace this terrible creature to his familiar haunts and beard the lion in his den  dick soon became fully aware of this and not being a mysterious monster or demon but a mere mortal although doubtless a singularly huge and eccentric one it behoved him to frustrate the amiable intentions of his savage tormentors  in order to effect this he first of all selected as we have seen a gloomy secluded and almost inaccessible spot among the rocky mountains as his residence which he made a point of quitting and returning to only in the dark hours of night or early morning as far as was practicable  still further to bewilder the savagesagainst whom he bore no grudge and to avoid encountering whom was his chief desiredick varied his costume appearing sometimes in the dress of a blackfoot chief or a cree warrior at other times in the huntingshirt and cap of a trapper but despite his utmost efforts he occasionally had to face and fight the redskinsa necessity which so exasperated his naturally fiery temper that on such occasions he became utterly regardless of his life and rushing upon any odds with a terrific roar of his deep bass voice so different from the shrill yell of the indianswould cleave his way right through their ranks with his long doubleedged sword then returning to the charge with increased fury would so appal and horrify them that the usual result was a general and precipitate flight  perhaps some readers may wonder how it was possible that he could escape being killed in these encounters but it must be remembered that in those days guns were by no means so plentiful among the indians as they now are and arrows are comparatively harmless missiles  dick always wore under his leather coat a vest of thick buffalo leather which rendered him arrowproof in the vital regions of his body unless shot at with a strong bow by a powerful arm from a short distance  this undercoat or piece of armour added a little to his naturally gigantic proportions which were still further enhanced by the flying tags and scalplocks and fringes of his dress and the wild masses of his long hair  he rode as we have elsewhere mentioned a magnificent charger which he had purchased in mexico and whose sire no doubt had been one of those noble barbs which bore the cavaliers of spain to the conquest of the new world  the mane and tail of this animal having never been cut were of immense length and when violently agitated seemed to envelop horse and man  altogether the tout ensemble of dick and his charger on any of the rencontres above referred to was sufficiently awful and as he was seldom seen near at hand except in a condition of blazing fury there is little wonder that in the process of time he became celebrated throughout the country as the wild man of the west  the white trappers too were somewhat curious to know something about this mysterious brother but he shunned them even more determinedly than he did the indians though of course he never fought with them seeing that they did not attempt to murder him or interfere with his movements as the savages did  but there were one or two bolder or more inquisitive than their comrades who dogged the wild man and tried to force themselves upon him  these he caught and thrashed soundly after the fashion of a schoolmaster with a refractory boy and turned them adrift with a warning thenceforth to mind their own business  at last the indians set him down as a great medicineman or a demon whom it was impossible to slay and the trappers shook their heads and touched their foreheads significantly as if to indicate that they thought him mad  thus dick in course of years freed himself in a great measure from annoyance and many good and kind actions which he did both to indians and trappers began to be circulated and exaggerated so that he became a greater mystery than ever especially to the savages who naturally misconstrued the spirit in which he made his furious attacks in selfdefence just as much as they misunderstood his motives in performing deeds of kindness  he was a monstrous mystery the greatest mystery that had ever been seen or heard of in the rocky mountains since the beginning of time and no doubt a greater mystery than will ever be heard of there again  having traversed this roundabout pathway we now come to the explanation which we intended to have given much earlier in this chapter  but it is really wonderful how natural it is for the human mind to prose and to diverge and how very difficult it is at any time to come to the point  public speakers know this well  perhaps their hearers know it better  well although dick was thus feared yet he was not entirely unmolested wandering tribes from distant hunting grounds used to go there and not knowing much about the wild man of the west did not believe in him even ventured to go in search of him and on more than one occasion almost caught him asleep in his cave  having an ingenious turn of mind and being somewhat fanciful he devised a curious plan to deceive the savages and warn him of their approach  by means of an axe and a knife he carved a representation of his own head and covered it with hair by means of the tail of one of his lightcoloured horses which he docked for the purpose  his steeds by the way occupied another chamber of the cavern in which he dwelt  the head thus formed he planted behind a bush that grew on a ledge of rock about two yards from the bottom of the cliff of the amphitheatre outside and directly opposite to the entrance to it  the cave it will be remembered was on the right of that entrance  thus the first thing the savage beheld on prowling up to the opening of the amphitheatre was dicks image peeping at him over the bush opposite  of course the instantaneous result was the firing of a shot or the discharge of an arrow which the indians being excellent marksmen invariably alighted on the bridge of dicks nose or in the centre of his forehead or in one or other of his eyes  as the head was balanced on the front edge of a deep narrow hole which happened to be there it was invariably knocked into that hole by the blow and disappeared  this was the supposed fall of the famous wild man that caused the yell which has taken so long to account for and the discovery of nothing behind that bush except a small deep hole much too small to secrete even a little mans body in was the cause of the explanation of surprise which we asserted would certainly follow  when an event of this kind happened dick had a large blunderbuss in readiness  it was loaded with a tremendous charge of small shot and a small charge of powder for he did not want to kill  his object was simply to punish and to terrify  he also had in readiness a curious machine which we find it rather difficult to describe  every one has heard no doubt of the wooden wheels with wooden axles attached to the carts in some eastern countries which groan and creak and yell and shriek for want of grease in a manner that is almost maddening to all but native ears  dicks invention was founded partly on the principle of these eastern carts only it was worked by turning a handle and its sounds were much more excruciatingly intense  on being startled then dick was wont to seize his blunderbuss rush into the outer cave where the shriekingmachine was give the handle half a dozen turns and thus awaken as it were all the demons of the rocky mountains  dick came at last to know exactly what state of things he would find outside  at the first burst of discord the savages however numerous took to their heels and when dick emerged from his cave they were always within a yard or two of the entrance to the amphitheatre every man with outstretched arms sloped forward at the acutest possible angle with the ground rushing on the wings of terror in a flight of unparalleled precipitancy  to pour the charge of small shot down into the centre of the flying mass was the work of a moment to mount his unsaddled charger and dash down the steep rugged path with a clatter equal to that of half a squadron of dragoons was the work of two minutes more  to pull up suddenly when he had terrified the spirits of the intruders wellnigh out of their bodies return slowly to his rude domicile reload his blunderbuss and retire to rest with a grim smile on his bearded mouth and a lurking expression of fun in his big blue eyes as he drew his blanket over him was the usual termination of such scenes  but this was not all  dick like a wise man had prepared for the worst  in the event of the indians ever getting the length of the interior of his den there were other contrivances ready for them chief among which was a large cistern or tank of water directly over the fireplace the front of which was movable and could be pulled down by means of a cord passing into the innermost cave of allnamely the third cavern which we have alluded to as being marys dormitory  by pulling this cord the resultinstantaneous and hideouswould be that a deluge of water would drown the fire black out fill the cavern with hot suffocating steam and ashes and flood the floor  how the cavern was to be defended when he himself was not there was a problem which dick being a mere man and not a demon had utterly failed to solve  of course he could easily have set all manner of mantraps and springguns but as these might have taken effect upon some poor wretch who had no design upon his life he could not venture to run the risk  on the present occasiondick being absent march being prostrated and all but helpless and mary being unable to turn the handle of the shriekingmachine or to fire the blunderbuss which kicked like a small cannonthe case of the romantic pair was desperate and their only hope seemed to be that the savages would go away without examining the cavern  vain hope  but dick had not left them to take their chance in that way  he had warned mary long ago how to act in such circumstances and she soon returned to march with the news that there were four indian warriors outside examining the bush behind which the head had disappeared and that they would very soon find out the cave  thats not pleasant news mary said march starting up in spite of pain and giddiness you seem to take it very easy  com quick said she seizing march by the hand com with me  march said mentally that he would go with her into the jaws of death if need be but he followed up the mental speech with the audible remark that he had better take some weapon with him  no no com  me git you spear hatchet very quick but com  so saying she dragged rather than conducted march to the little opening which led into her dormitory  he had to stoop on entering and great was his amazement on finding himself on the brink of a black yawning gulf that seemed to descend into the bowels of the earth  the end of a narrow plank rested on the edge of this gulf and appeared to bridge it over but the other end of the plank and all beyond were lost in impenetrable darkness  com after me said mary passing rapidly across the gulf and disappearingabsolutely like a vision  march hesitated  he tried to steady his somewhat giddy head but the single word com issuing from darkness in a very commanding tone settled the point  he staggered across held out his hands and almost tumbled over his fair guide on reaching the other end of the plank much sooner than he had expected  now wait  i will com agin said mary recrossing  the view back was a very different thing from the view forward  as he stood there on the brink of the yawning gulf march could see right through into the cavern he had just left and could observe everything that took place there  mary hastily loaded herself with a rifle and the blunderbuss also with powderhorn bulletpouch and a bag containing buffalo tongues  with these she returned quickly and brushing past her companion carried them farther into the cave  now help me pull she said laying hold of the end of the plank  march obeyed and obedience cost him much poor fellow for it seemed as if in the act he had rent asunder every muscle in his right shoulder the plank being thus drawn away an impassable gulf was left between the inner and middle cavern which even in the event of its being discovered presented no particular temptation to induce any one to explore farther  mary drew the plank into the long natural passage which led to her private apartment and as this passage turned abruptly to the right there was no possibility of any one on the other side of the gulf being able to see into it  indeed a light in it was not visible from that point of view and their voices could not be heard unless they spoke loudly  just as the plank was withdrawn the indians discovered the mouth of the cavern and in a few minutes the two watchers beheld a painted savage peep in at the opening of the centre cave  seeing that it was empty and observing at a glance the opening into the inner cave he drew back quickly  a minute after the four indians darted across and got out of range of that openingevidently fearing that some one was there  they flitted past so quickly yet noiselessly that they appeared more like shadows than real men  presently one of them stepped full in front of the opening with a bow and arrow in his hand  the light of the fire was strong  march saw him raise the bow and had just time to draw back when an arrow whizzed past him and was broken to pieces on the rock behind his back  instantly after the echoes of the place burst forth as a shot was fired in the same direction  having thus made sure that the way was clear the boldest of the savages entered with a blazing pineknot held high above his headthe others following with bows ready and arrows fitted to the string  on reaching the edge of the yawning chasm the foremost savage held the torch over it and they all gazed in silence into its unfathomable depths  satisfied that it was impassable they consulted for a few minutes and then apparently coming to the conclusion that the place was untenanted they returned to the middle cave and began to rummage and toss about the things they found there  bring the rifle whispered march  i can floor two at a shot as they now sit  no mary replied firmly  why make blood  they will go way soon  mary was right but a circumstance occurred which caused them to go away sooner than either she or they had anticipated    chapter twenty  a gallop to the rescuea discoveryrightabout facea disagreeable surprise and a sudden ejectiona calm after the stormmary a huntressdicks story of the murdered trapper  when dick alias the wild man of the west left his cave as narrated in a previous chapter and galloped away with reckless speed to afford the aid of his stout right arm to his friends in the mountain fortfor he counted them friends although they little knew ithe felt that if he was to be of any use he must travel over the country as he had never travelled before except once when he had to fly for his life before five hundred pawnee warriors  it was a grand sight to behold that herculean backwoodsman on his noble steed which seemed so well proportioned to its rider that it carried him as if he were but a boy flying over the country on this brotherly errand  mile after mile was passed not indeed at full speed for that would have broken the good horse down long before the goal was reached but at a bowling gallop taking bogs and rocks and fallen trees and watercourses with an elastic bound that told of bone and muscle overflowing with surplus energy  dick patted the horses arching neck with a look of pride and affection and the animal tossed its head with a slight neigh of pleasure and a playful snap towards its riders right foot for it loved its master as the lower animals do always love those who treat them well and it loved a wild long careering gallop for that was the only means by which it could relieve its feelings  there was something unusually wildlike about this horse besides its great size and extraordinarily long mane and tail  it carried its head high and its ears pointed forward and it looked boldly from side to side as it went springingly along more like a human being than a horse  it actually appeared to be taking intelligent notice of things around it  so much so that dick had got into a habit of saying a word or two now and then to it in a grave tone as if he were conversing with a friend  ay its a fine country isnt it he said patting the neck again  the ears were pointed backwards at once and a little neigh or squeak with a toss of the head was the reply  pity ye cant speak ant it continued dick in a low quiet tone  the horse appeared to know that this was merely a meditative remark not pointedly addressed to itself for it only put back one ear and kept the other forward  now lass said dick firmly both ears went full back at that sound and remained there take it easy dont exert yerself over much  it ant o no usea short pace or two andso  the horse went full swing over a roaring watercourse as he spoke and alighted safe on the opposite bank but the gravelly soil was treacherous it gave way and the animals hind legs slipped back  with a bound dick sprang to the ground  hyp good horse he cried raising the rein  a powerful effort and footing was regained  dick vaulted into the saddle he seldom used the stirrup and away they went again blithe as ever  then a long strip of tangled forest appeared  dick diverged here  it was easier to skirt it than to crash through it  presently a broad deep river came in view  there was no looking for a ford no checking the pace  in they went with sounding plunge as if water were their native element breasted the foaming tide and gaining the opposite bank went steadily forward  thus on they sped over hill and dale all that night for the moon was bright in a cloudless sky and part of next day  then dick made a sudden halt and dismounted to examine something on the ground footprints of indian horsesfour of themgoing in the direction of his dwelling  dick rose and his strong brows were knitted and his lips firmly pressed together  for a moment or two he pondered then he told his horse to follow him and dropping the bridle set off at a rapid walk keeping steadily on the tracks and stooping now and then to examine them when the nature of the ground rendered them less discernible  thus he retraced his course for about a mile when he stopped and muttered no doubt ot  them reptiles niver come to these diggins but when they want to pay me a visit  as he said this he remounted his horse and sat for a minute or two undecided  it was hard to give up his purpose but it was impossible to leave his cavern defenceless with mary in it and the certainty that savages were hunting it out  that thought settled the matter  he shook the reins and back they flew again towards the cave at a much quicker pace than they had hitherto maintained  the result was that dick gained the entrance of his ravine just two hours later than the savages and in time to superintend personally the hospitalities of his own dwelling  riding quickly up to the head of the gorge he dismounted and ascended the pathway to his cave with giant strides and a beating heart for dick thought of mary and the words too late would whizz about in his brain  the indians were still sitting round the fire enjoying themselves when march and mary to their unutterable surprise beheld dick stride through the low doorway of the cave raise himself to his full height and stand before the stricken invaders absolutely blazing with wrath his eyes his hair his beard his glistening teeth seemed each individually imbued with indignation  the indians did not movethey could not movethey simply sat and stared and thus both parties continued for a quarter of a minute  mary used that short time well  she knew exactly what to do  darting into her chamber she seized the end of the rope connected with the tank and pulled it violently  march saw the rock above the fireplace drop a clear sparkling cataract sprang as if by magic from the wall  next instant there was black darkness and yells steam shrieks and howlsa hissing hurling hubbub such as no man can possibly conceive of unless he has seen and heard it  we will not therefore even attempt a description  the indians rushed en masse to the doorway  death in the jaws of the wild man of the west was infinitely preferable to being parboiled and suffocated but the wild man had judiciously made way for them  they gained the outer cave and sprang down the pathway  dick plied the handle of the shriekingmachine with the secondary object in view of relieving his own feelings  the din was indescribable  if those indians are not lunatics at this moment they must be dead for there could be no alternative in the circumstances  certain it is they vanished like smoke and they have never been heard of sincefrom that day to this  really dear reader if it were not that we are recounting the doings of a wild mana notoriously eccentric creaturewe would feel it necessary to impress upon you that such scenes as we have been describing are not characteristic of life in the rocky mountains nay more we question whether such scenes as these have ever been witnessed or enacted in those regions at any time with the exception of course of the present occasion  but it must be carefully borne in mind that we are recounting the deeds of a wild man and although the aspect of outward things the general tone and current of manners and customs and natural phenomenamay remain exactly the same as heretofore and be faithfully described without exaggeration as we maintain they are yet the acts devices and vagaries of such a creature as a wild man may indeed must necessarily be altogether eccentric and unparalleled  we therefore pause here to express a hope that whatever credit you may be able to give to the reported deeds of this hero you will not withhold your belief in the fidelity of the other portions of this narrative  no sooner then were those unwelcome visitors ejected than dick returned to the scene of devastation and shouted hullo  mary  safe all safe she replied as with the assistance of march marston she pushed the plank across the chasm and returned to the centre cave  is the lad march safe too inquired dick as he busied himself in striking a light with flint and steel  all right answered the youth for himself but horribly battered an fit to yell with pain not to mention surprise  do look sharp and get the fire up  sich doins as this i never did see nor hear of since i left the frontier  i do declare its worthy o the wild man o the west himself  what dye find to laugh at dick  im sure if ye had my miserable bones in yer body at this moment yed laugh wi your mouth screwed the wrong way  look alive man  patience lad patience  thats one o the vartues i believe leastwise so im told  ah its caught at last  hand me that dry stuff on the south shelf mary ye can find it i the dark i doubt not  yes its a vartue but i cant boast o having much ot myself i dun know much about it from xperience dye see  there now well git things put to rights he added applying the kindled spark to some dry chips and producing a flame with which he ignited a pineknot and stuck it blazing in a cleft in the rock  just see what them reptiles ha done to me  if it wasnt that im a goodtempered feller i blieve id git angry  see march boy theres a shelf in the corner thats escaped the flood  lie ye down there while mary and me puts the place in order  id rather help you said march dismally  i dont blieve it can make me worse an perhaps itll make me better  i wonder what in the world pain was made for  yell only be in our way lad  lie down said dick seizing a large broom and beginning to sweep away the water and ashes and pieces of charcoal with which the floor was plentifully covered while mary picked up the scattered skins and furniture of the cave and placed them on the ledge of rock about four feet from the ground which dick termed a shelf  this ledge ran all round the apartment so march selected a corner and throwing a dry skin upon it stretched himself thereon and soon found his sufferings relieved to such an extent that he began to question his host as to his sudden and unlookedfor return  how came ye to drop in upon us in the very nick o time like that he said gazing languidly at mary who bustled about with the activity of a kittenor to use an expression more in keeping with the surrounding circumstances a wild kitten  dick without checking his broom told how he had discovered the tracks of the indians and returned at once as has been related  then said march looking anxiously at his host youll not be able to help my poor comrades and the people at the mountain fort  it ant possble to be in two places at once nohow ye can fix it returned dick else id ha been there as well as here in the course of a few hours more  but should we not start off at oncenow cried march eagerly throwing his legs off the ledge and coming to a sitting position  you ant able replied dick quietly and i wont move till i have put things to rights here an had a feed an a nights rest  if it would do any good id start this minute  but the fights over by this time leastwise itll be over long afore we could git there and if its not to be a fight at all why nobodys none the worse dye see  but maybe they may hold the place for a long time argued march an the sudden appearance of you and me might turn the scale in their favour  so it mightso it might  ive thought o that and well start tomorrow if yer able  but it would be o no use tonight  my good horse cant run for ever right on end without meat and rest  then well start tomorrow cried march eagerly  ay if ye can mount and ride  that i have no fear of butbut at that moment marchs eye encountered marysbut what about mary  oh shell stop here till we come back  no fear o redskins troublin her agin for some time replied dick throwing down the broom and patting the girls head  come lass lets have some supper  show march what a capital cook ye are  ill kindle a rousin fire an spread some pinebranches round it to sit on for the floor wont be quite dry for some time  what red reptiles to be sure and they was actually devourin my poor old bay horse  what cannibals  in the course of an hour the cavern had resumed its former appearance of comfort  the ruddy glare of the fire fell warmly on the rocky walls and on the curling smoke which found egress through the hole near the roof that let in light during the day  branches were spread on the floor so as to form a thick pile near the fire and on the top of this sat the wild man of the west with the most amiable of smiles on his large handsome countenance and most benignant of expressions beaming in his clear blue eyes as he gazed first at mary who sat on his right hand then at march who sat on his left and then at the iron pot which sat or stood between his knees and into which he was about to plunge a large wooden ladle  theres worse things than buffalobeefbergoo march ant there  ha ha my lad tuck that under yer belt itll put the sore bones right faster than physic  mary my little pet lamb heres a marrowbone come yer growin an ye cant grow right if ye dont eat plenty o meat and marrowbones there he said placing the bone in question on her pewter plate  ah  mary lass yeve been mixin the victuals why what have we here  moose nose replied the girl with a look of pleasure  i do blieveso it is  why where got ye it  i hant killed a moose for three weeks an more  me kill him meself said mary  you  ay me with me own gun too  capital cried dick tossing back his heavy locks and gazing at the child with proud delight  yer a most fit an proper darter for the wildaho sneezed dick with sudden violence while mary glanced quickly up and opened her eyes very wide  whissttoahah whew wot a tickler  i raally think the mountain airs agoin to make me subjick to catchin colds  march took no notice of the remark  his attention was at that moment divided between marys eyes and a marrowbone  there is no accounting for the besotted stupidity at this time of march marston who was naturally quickwitted unless upon the principle that prejudice renders a man utterly blind  a hundred glaring and obvious facts incidents words and looks ought to have enlightened him as to who his new friend dick really was  but his mind was so thoroughly imbued so saturated with the preconceived notion of the wild man of the west being a huge ferocious ugly monster all over red or perhaps blue hair from the eyes to the toes with canine teeth and very probably a tail that unintentional hints and suggestive facts were totally thrown away upon him  the fact is that if dick had at that moment looked him full in the face and said im the wild man of the west march would have said he didnt believe it  how came ye by the iron pot inquired march suddenly as the sight of that vessel changed the current of his thoughts  dicks countenance became grave and marys eyes dropped  ill tell ye some other time said the former quietly not nownot now  come lad if ye mean to mount and ride wi me tomorrow youll ha to eat heartier than that  im doing my best  did you say it was you that shot the moose deer mary  yes it was me  me go out to kill bird for make dinner two days back an see the moose in one place where hims no can escape but by one way narrow way tree feets not more wide  hims look to memes look to him  then me climb up side of rocks so hims no touch me but must pass below me quite near  then me yellhorbuble yell  ha thought march music sweetest music that yell an hims run round in great fright  oh the blockhead thought marchbut see hims no can git away so hims rush past me  me shoot in back of hims head an him drop  huzza shouted dick in such a bass roar that march involuntarily started  well done lass yell make a splendid wife to a bold mountaineer  march could not believe his eyes while he looked at the modest little creature who thus coolly related the way in which she slaughtered the moose but he was bound to believe his ears for mary said she did the deed and to suppose it possible that mary could tell a falsehood was in marchs opinion more absurd than to suppose that the bright sun could change itself into melted butter  but dicks enthusiastic reference to mary one day becoming the wife of a mountaineer startled him  he felt that in the event of such a calamitous circumstance happening she could no longer be his sister and the thought made him first fierce and then sulky  dye kill many mountain sheep here dick inquired march when his ruffled temper had been smoothed down with another marrowbone  ay lots of em  what like are they close  ive never been nearer to em yet than a thousand yards or sonever within range  theyre bout the size of a settlement sheep an skin somethin like the red deer yeve seen the red deer of coorse march  yes often shot em too  well like them but theyve got most treemendous horns  i shot one last week with horns three fut six inches long there they lie now in that corner  are ye a good shot march  middlin  dye smoke  yes a little but i ant a slave to it like some  humph ejaculated dick sarcastically  if ye smoke a little how dye know but ye may come to smoke much an be a slave to it like other men  ye may run down a steep hill an say when yer near the top i can stop when i like but yell come to a pint lad when yell try to stop an find ye cantwhen yed give all ye own to leave off runnin but yell have to go on faster an faster till yer carried off yer legs and mayhap dashed to bits at the bottom  smokin and drinkin are both alike  ye can begin when you please an up to a certain pint ye can stop when ye please but after that pint ye cant stop o yer own free willyed die first  many an many a poor fellow has died first as i know  an pray mister solomon do you smoke inquired march testily thinking that this question would reduce his companion to silence  no never  not smoke cried march in amazement  the idea of a trapper not smoking was to him a thorough and novel incomprehensibility  no nor drink neither said dick  i once did both before i came to this part o the country and i thank the almighty for bringing me to a place where it warnt easy to get either drink or baccyspecially drink which i believe would have laid me under the sod long ago if i had bin left in a place where i could ha got it  an now as mary has just left us poor thing ill tell ye how i came by the big iron pot theres no mystery about it but as it blonged to the poor childs father i didnt want to speak about it before her  dick placed an elbow on each knee and resting his forehead upon his hands stared for some moments into the fire ere he again spoke  its many years now said he in a low sad tone since i left home andbut thats nothin to do wi the pint he added quickly  you see march when i first came to this part o the world i fell in with a comradea trappermuch to my likin  this trapper had been jilted by some girl and came away in a passion detarminin never more to return to his native place  i never knowd where he come from nor the particlars of his story for that was a pint hed never speak on  i dont believe i ever knowd his right name  he called himself adam that was the only name i ever knowd him by  well him an me became great friends  he lived wi a band of pawnee injuns and had married a wife among them not that she was a pure injun neither she was a halfbreed  my mary was their only child she was a suckin babe at that time  adam had gin her no name when we first met an i remember him askin me one day what he should call her so i advised maryan thats how she come to git the name  adam an me was always together  we suited each other  for myself i had taen a skunner at mankind an womankind too so we lived wi the pawnees and hunted together an slep together when out on the tramp but one o them reptiles took a spite at him an tried by every way he could to raise the injuns agin him but couldnt so he detarmined to murder him  one day we was out huntin together an being too far from the pawnee lodges to return that night we encamped in the wood an biled our kettlethis iron one ye see here  adam had a kind o likin fort and always carried it at his saddlebow when he went out o horseback  wed just begun supper when up comes the wildcat as he was calledadams enemyan sits down beside us  of course we could not say we thought he was up to mischief though we suspected it so we gave him his supper an he spent the night with us nixt mornin he bade us goodday an went off  then adam said he would go an set beaver traps in a creek about a mile off  bein lazy that day i said id lie a bit in the camp  so away he went  the camp was on a hill  i could see him all the way and soon saw him in the water settin his traps  suddenly i seed the wildcat step out o the bushes with a bow an arrow  i knew what was up  i gave a roar that he might have heard ten miles off an ran towards them  but an arrow was in adams back before he could git to the shore  in a moment more he had the injun by the throat an the two struggled for life  adam could ha choked him easy but the arrow in his back let out the blood fast an he could barely hold his own  yet he strove like a true man  i was soon there for i nearly burst my heart in that race  they were on the edge of the water the wildcat had him down and was tryin to force him over the bank  i had my big sword wi me an hewed the reptiles head off with it at one blow sendin it into the river an tossin the body in after it  its too late says adam as i laid him softly on the bank  i could see that  the head of the shaft was nearly in his heart  he tried to speak but could only say take care o my wife an mary then he died and i buried him there  dick paused and clenched both hands convulsively as the thought of that black day came back upon him  but the glare in his eye soon melted into a look of sadness  well well he continued its long past now  why should i be angry with the dead  adams wife never got the better o that  she dropped her head like a prairie flower in the first blast of winter an was soon beside her husband  i waited till the little child could stump about on its own legs an then i mounted my horse an rode away with it in my arms  the only things belongin to poor adam i brought with me was the iron pot an his long rifle  there the rifle stands in the corner  ive used it ever since  and have you and mary lived here all alone since that day  ay  i came straight herenot carin where i went only anxious to get out o the sight o men an live alone wi the child  i sought out a dwellin in the wildest part o these mountains an fell upon this cave where weve lived happy enough together  do you mean to say the child has never played with other children inquired march amazed at this discovery  not much  i give her a run for a month or two at a time now an agin when i fall on a friendly set o welldisposed redskinsjust to keep the right sort o spirit in her and comfort her a bit  but shes always willin to live alone wi me  then shes never learned to read said march sadly  that has she  shes got one book  its a story about a giant an a fairy an a prince an princess  most xtraornar stuff  i got it from a blood injun who said he picked it up in a frontier settlement where the people had all been murdered  when we had nothin better to do i used to teach her her letters out o that book an the moment she got em off she seemed to pick up the words i dun know how  shes awful quick  she knows every word o that story by heart  an shes invented heaps o others o the most amazin kind  ive often thought o goin to the settlements to git her some books but  dick paused abruptly and a dark frown settled on his features as if the thoughts of civilised men and things revived unpleasant memories  the fact is he continued somewhat bitterly ive been a hater of my race  youd scarcely believe it lad but you are the first man ive ever told all this to  i cant tell why it is that i feel a likin for ye boy an a desire to have ye stop with me  but that must not be  i had but one friend  i must not make another to have him murdered mayhap before my eyes  yet he added in a gentle tone taking marchs hand in his and stroking it i feel a likin for ye boy that makes me sad to think o partin  but we dont need to part dick said march eagerly  i like you too and i like your style of life an he was going to have added that he liked mary and that he would live with them both all his days when the little cottage at pine point settlement and his loving mother rose before him and caused him to drop his head and terminate his speech abruptly  just then mary reentered the cavern and put an end to the conversation    chapter twenty one  march though willing in spirit finds his body weakhe makes mary a presentthe trappers set out to search for their lost comradean unexpected meetingbig waller waxes pugnaciousnews of marchdick becomes more mysterious than evera reckless proposal and a happy meeting  next morning before daybreak march marston attempted to set out for the mountain fort with dick but he was so thoroughly knocked up before the end of the first mile that he had to call a halt and admit that he could not think of going further  this was just what dick wanted so he laughed told him to go back and take care of mary and he would advance alone  march returned very much humbled excessively pained in all his joints and feeling as if he had reason to be ashamed of himself  oh you com back cried mary as he entered the cavern with a crestfallen air  me so glad  me know very well you no was possble for travel  mary was perfectly artless  she made no attempt whatever to conceal her satisfaction at the youths return so he felt amazingly comforted and even began to recover his selfesteem  yes mary ive come back cause i cant go forward  its o no use tryin id just have knocked up on the way which would have been awkward for dick you know as well as for me  besides i couldnt fight just now to save my life  well you is right  you stop here an git strong an well  me tell you stories bout dick or other mans if you likes  well have no fightin to do  if there is me take care of you  me can doos a littil in that way  march opened his eyes very wide at this and stared at the pretty little vision in leather but there was no smile or sly wrinkle on her countenance  she was looking quite gravely and sedately into the iron pot which she happened to be stirring at that moment  mary he said sitting down beside her dick tells me you can read  yis me can read littil  but me only got one book  she sighed slightly as she said this  would you like to have another book  oh yis very very much  have you got one  ay one the only one i have in the world mary an youre the only person in the world id give it to  but ill give it to you cause youve no chance of gettin one like it here  its a biblethe one my mother gave me when i left home  march pulled the little volume out of the breast of his coat as he spoke and handed it to the girl who received it eagerly and looked at it with mingled feelings of awe and curiosity for some time before she ventured to open it  the bibil  dick have oftin speak to me bout it an try to member some of it  but he no can member much  he tell me it speak about the great good spirit  injins call him manitow  so it does mary  ill leave it with you when i go away  you say dick couldnt remember much of it neither can i mary  more shame to me for many an many a time has my poor mother tried to make me learn it off by heart  you mother repeated mary earnestly  is you mother livin  that is she  at least i left her well an hearty in pine point settlement not many weeks agone  me wish me had mother said mary with a sigh  march gazed at the sad face of his fair companion with a perplexed yet sympathetic look  this was a new idea to him  never having been without a mother it had never entered into his head to think of such a thing as wishing for one  what you mother called said the girl looking up quickly  her name is mary  yis that very strange  call same as me  not very strange after all  there are a good number of marys in the world replied march with a laugh  see here is her name on the flyleaf of the bible written with her own hand too to my dear march from his loving mother mary marston pine point settlement  isnt it a good round hand o write  very pritty replied mary  but she had now begun to spell out the words of the book which had at last fallen into her hands and march could not again draw her into general talk so he was fain to sit down and help her to read the bible  leaving them thus occupied we will now return to the trappers three of whom it will be rememberedbounce redhand and gibaulthad reached the mountain fort and given the alarm  soon afterwards the indians arrived there but finding everything in readiness to give them a warm reception they retired at once preferring to wait their opportunity rather than have a fair standup fight with the white men  about an hour after they had retired big waller hawkswing and the artist came tearing towards the fort and were at once admitted  they had nothing new to tell  they had met together by accident as the others had done on nearing the fort and would have been in sooner had not big waller been obliged to take charge of poor bertram who owing to the suddenness and violence of all these recent events in savage life had got into a muddled condition of mind that rendered him peculiarly helpless  but they knew nothing of march marstonthey had expected to find him there before them  as march was well mounted and known to be well qualified to take care of himself his nonarrival threw his friends into a state of the utmost anxiety and suspense  they waited a couple of hours in order to give him a chance of coming in hoping that he might have merely been detained by some trifling accident such as having lost his way for a time  but when at the end of that period there was still no sign of him they gave up all hope of his arriving and at once set out to sweep the whole country round in search of him vowing in their hearts that they would never return to pine point settlement without him if he were alive  mcleod tried to persuade them to remain at the fort for a few days but feeling sympathy with them he soon ceased to press the matter  as for the wretched chief of the fort macgregorthe excitement of the recent transactions being overhe had returned to his bosom friend and bitterest enemy the bottle and was at that time lying in a state of drivelling idiocy in his private chamber  a few days after quitting the fort bounce and gibault who chanced to be riding considerably in advance of their companions halted on the top of a ridge and began to scan the country before them  in the midst of their observations bounce broke the silence with a grunt  fat now inquired his companion  what now replied bounce contemptuously  use yer eyes now dye see nothin  non no ting  that comes o the want of obsarvation now said bounce in a grave reproachful tone  ye shouldnt ought to be so lightheaded lad  if ye wos left to yer lone in them sort o places yed soon lose yer scalp  its obsarvation as does it all an in yer partikler case its the want o that same as doesnt do it dye see  non vraiment me shockable blind dis day mais praps git more cliver de morrow replied the goodhumoured canadian with a grin  fat you see  i see futprints replied bounce dismounting an as futprints implies feet an feet indicates critters human or otherwise it becomes men wot be lookin for a lost comrade to examine em with more nor ornary care  hah shouted gibault with unwonted energy  look voila behold bounce you hab great want of obsarvation  see  now it chanced that while bounce was on his knees carefully turning over every leaf and blade of grass his comrade who remained on horseback and kept gazing at the horizon without any particular object in view did suddenly behold an object coming towards them at full gallop  hence the sudden outburst and the succeeding exclamation from bounceits a hoss  a hoss repeated gibault  him be one buffalo i see hims bump  the bumps that ye see is neither more nor less than a man leanin forardit is  at this moment the rest of the party rode up and redhand confirmed bounces opinion  theres only one i guess an hes in a powerful hurry observed big waller  but we may as well be ready to fix his flint if he means to cut up rough  he brought forward his gun as he spoke and examined the priming  i blieve hes an evil spirit i do said bounce wot a pace  more like to de wild man of de vest observed gibault  think you so whispered bertram in an anxious tone with an involuntary motion of his hand to the pouch in which lay that marvellous sketchbook of his  think its him said redhand to hawkswing  the indian gave a slight grunt of assent  but the strange horseman soon put all doubt on the point at rest by bearing down upon them like a whirlwind his long hair and tags and scalplocks streaming in the wind as usual  dick had a distinct purpose in thus acting  he wished to terrify men or at least to impress them with a wholesome dread of him in order that he might simply be let alone  he did not check his slashing pace until within four or five bounds of the party  reining up so violently that he tore up the turf for a couple of yards under his horses heels he looked at the trappers with a grave almost fierce expression for a second or two  you come from the mountain fort he said  yes replied redhand  all right there  all right  the redskins threatened an attack but we were too quick for em  a gleam of satisfaction passed across dicks face as he added youve lost a comrade hant ye  we jist have cried big waller in surprise  if youve seed him i guess yed as well take us to his whereabouts  see you yonder pine said dick pointing back in the direction whence he had come  one days journey beyond that as the crow flies will bring you to a valley level and well watered with plenty o beaver in it  youll find him there  without waiting a reply dick turned to ride away  i say stranger cried waller dick paused air you or air you not the wild man o the west  wild fools of the west call me so replied dick with a ferocious frown that went far to corroborate the propriety of the cognomen in the opinion of the trappers  wall i tell ee wot it is stranger wild man or not i guess youll ha to take us to our comrade yourself for im inclined to opine that you know more about him thans good for ye so if ye try to ride off ill see whether a ballsixteen to the poundll not stop ye for all yer bigness  a grim smile curled dicks moustache as he replied if ye think that a trappers word aint to be trusted or that committin murder ll do yer comrade a service heres your chancefire away  dick wheeled about and cantered coolly away into the thickest part of the forest leaving the trappers gazing at each other in amazement bertram was the first to speak  oh why did you not delay him a few seconds longer  see i have him hereall but the legs of his splendid charger  the others burst into a laugh  if yeve got the body all crect its easy to calculate the legs by the rules o proportion dye see observed bounce  come lads thats good news about march anyhow cried redhand an im of opinion that the wild man o the west ant just so wild as people think  i for one will trust him  theres somethin about the corner of a mans eye that tells pretty plain whether hes false or true depend ont we shall find march where he told us so the sooner we set off the better  without waiting for a reply redhand urged his horse into a gallop and followed by his comrades made for the valley indicated by the wild man  meanwhile the wild man himself was already far ahead of them keeping out of sight among the woods and galloping nearly in the same directionfor his cave lay not more than four miles from the valley in question  being much better mounted than they he soon left the trappers far behind him and when night closed in he continued his journey instead of halting to eat and take a few hours rest as they did  the consequence was that he reached his cave several hours before the trappers arrived at the valley where they expected to find their missing comrade  of course march was filled with surprise at this second unexpected return of dick but the latter relieved his mind by explaining in an offhand way that he had met a man who had told him the mountain fort was all safe and that his comrades also were safe and wandering about in that part of the country in search of him  after a good deal of desultory conversation dick turned to his guest with a sad serious air and fixing his large blue eyes on him said  march lad you an me must part soon  part exclaimed the youth in surprise glancing at mary who sat opposite to him embroidering a pair of moccasins  ay we must part  youll be well enough in a day or two to travel about with yer comrades  now lad i want ye to understand me  ive lived here off and on for the last fourteen or fifteen yearsit may be more it may be less i dont well rememberan ive niver suffered men to interfere wi me  i dont want them an they dont want me  he paused  there was a slight dash of bitterness in the tone in which the last words were uttered but it was gone when he resumed in his usual low and musical voice  now although i chose to bring you to my cave because i found ye amost in a dyin state an have let ye into one or two o my secrets because i couldnt help it seein that i couldnt stop up yer eyesan yer earsyet i dont choose to let yer comrades know anything about me theyve no right to an you have no right to tell em so when ye meet em again ye mustnt talk about me or my cave dye see  certainly said march who was both surprised and annoyed by his speech certainly you have a perfect right to command me to hold my tongue and seein that youve bin so kind to me dick im in duty bound to obey but how can you ask me to put myself in such an awkward fix  you dont suppose i can make my comrades believe ive bin livin on air or grass for some days past an theyll see easy enough that ive not bin in a condition to help myself  besides whatever your notions may be about truth mine are of such a sort that they wont let me tell a parcel o lies to please anybody  far be it from me boy to ask ye to tell lies  you can tell yer comrades that youve bin took care of by a trapper as lives in a cave among the mountains but you dont need to tell em where the cave is an if they worry ye to guide em to it ye can refuse  moreover jist speak o me in an offhand careless sort o way dye see an be particular not to tell what im like cause it might make em take a fancy to hunt me up  there appeared to be a dash of vanity in the latter part of this remark which surprised march not a little for it seemed to him quite inconsistent with the stout hunters wonted modesty of demeanour and speech  well im bound to think only o your wishes in this matter replied march in a disappointed tone an ill do my best to prevent my comrades interfering with ye tho to say truth i dont think you need be so cautious for they aint overcuriousnone of em  but here march paused and glanced at mary who he observed had dropped her head very much during the conversation and from whose eye at that moment a bright tear fell like a diamond on the work with which she was engaged  butam ithe fact is dick i feel a little sore that you should say ye had a likin for me an then tell me i must be off an never look near ye again  thats wot i never did say boy returned dick smiling  ye may come alone to see me as often as ye like while ye remain in these parts an if it please ye yer at liberty to come an live wi me  theres room in the mountains for both of us  the cave can hold three if need be  march marstons heart beat quick  he was on the eve of forming a great resolve  his bosom heaved and his eye sparkled as he was about to close hastily with this proposal when again the memory of his mother crossed him and a deep sigh burst from his lips as he shook his head and said sorrowfully it cant be done dick  i cant forsake my mother  no more ye should lad no more ye should said dick nodding approvingly but theres nothin to prevent your spendin the winter and spring here an returnin to yer mother next summer  done cried march springing up as well as his bruised muscles would permit him and seizing his friend enthusiastically by the hand  ill stop with you and send home word by my comrades that ill be back in summer  thats capital  mary seemed to be quite of the same opinion for she looked quickly up with a beaming smile  well so it is a good plan said dick somewhat gravely but dont act in haste else ye may ha to repent at leisure  go an speak to yer comrades see what they advise ye to do an come again an let me know and now were on that pint i may tell ye that yer friends will be at the head of a valley not four miles from here this very night an they expect ye there  how dye know that cried march breathless with amazement  well ye see the wild man o the west knows that youre in them parts he has seed you an knows where ye are an he met yer comrades the trappers no later than yesterday an told em theyd find ye in the valley i spoke of just now so we must be up an away to meet em  dick rose as he spoke and began to make preparation to depart  but how came you to know this inquired the astonished youth  why the wild man an mes oncommon intimate dye see  in fact i may say were jist inseparable companions an so i come to know it that way  but make haste  weve no time to lose  goodbye mary cried march with a cheerful smile as he hurried out of the cave after his eccentric companion  ill be back before long depend ont  mary nodded and the two men were soon mounted and out of sight  i say dick observed march as they rode along you must get me to see the wild man of the west if youre so intimate with him you can easily bring him into the cave now wont you dick  well as i cant help doin it i spose i may say yes at once  cant help it dick  what mean you  i wish yed talk sense  hist exclaimed the hunter pulling up suddenly under the shelter of a cliff  yonder come yer friends sooner than i expected  ill leave ye here  theyve not seed us yit an that wood ll hide me till i git away  now march he added solemnly remember yer promise  in another moment the wild hunter was gone and march rode forward to meet his comrades who having now caught sight of him came up the valley at full speed shouting and waving their caps joyfully as they approached  in a shorter space of time than it takes to tell march was surrounded dragged off his horse passed from one to another to be handled roughly in order to make sure that it was really himself and finally was swallowed up by bounce in a masculine embrace that might almost have passed for the hug of a grisly bear    chapter twenty two  march marston is perplexed so are his friendsan unlookedfor meetingterrible newsthe attackthe wild man of the west once again renders signal service to the trapperswild doings in general and march marstons chagrin in particular  march marston said bounceand bounce was sitting beside the camp fire smoking his pipe after supper when he said ityou may think yere a cute feller you may oncommon cute but if youll listen to wot an oldish hunter says an take his advice youll come to think in a feelosophical way dye see that yere not quite so cute as ye suppose  bounce delivered this oracularly and followed it up with a succession of puffs each of which was so solidly yellow as to suggest to the mind of bertram who chanced to be taking his portrait at that moment that the next puff would burst out in pure flame  gibault and big waller nodded their heads in testimony of their approval of the general scope of the remark the latter even went the length of guessing that it was a fact and redhand smiled  hawkswing looked if possible graver than usual  as resumed bounce after a considerable pause during which march looked and felt very uncomfortable the natral eyes of the old men becomes more dimmer dye see their mental eyes so to speak becomes sharper so as that they can see through no end o figurative millstones  that bein the case when theres no millstone to be seen through at all but only a oncommon thin transtrans  ollification suggested waller modestly  not at all retorted bounce with much severity in his tone  i wos goin to have saidtransparientsy but ill not say that now seein its too feelosophical for the likes o you but as i wos sayin that bein the case dye see its quite plain that  here bounce having got into depths unusually profound even for his speculative and philosophical turn of mind sought refuge in a series of voluminous puffs and wound up finally with an emphatic assertion that there wos somethin wrong an it wos o no manner o use to try to throw dust in his eyes seein that his winkin powers wos sich as to enable him to keep it out no matter how thick or fast it should come  ah thats yer sort  i calclate youre floored there march said waller gravely  the fact is boy that it wont do youve got somethin in the background that mr bertram talks sich a heap about you ought to be fair an aboveboard with comrades ye ought  oui added gibault  of course you have lived somewhere an somehow all dis time  it am not posseeble for live nowhere on noting  well i tell you i have lived with a hunter who treated me very well and told me id find you here having learned that as i understand from the wild man o the west himself  very true said bounce but where does the hunter live  in the mountains replied march  so does the blackfeet an the peigans an the crows an the foxes an wolves an grisly bars retorted bounce dryly  ill tell ye what it is cried the exasperated march the curiosity of you fellers beats the squaws out an out  now ill be open with ye an then ye must hold your tongues  this man that ive been stayin with is a very fine fellow an a very wonderful fellow an his names dick  dick what inquired bounce  dick nothing said march  ay thats a odd name  no i mean hes only called dick an he wouldnt tell me his other name if he has one  well he said to me i was not to tell where he lived as he dont like company an so he made me promise an i did promise dye see so i mean to stick to my promise and thats all about it  i would like to tell ye about him comrades but you wouldnt have me break my word would you  cernly not by no means said bounce  does he live all by his lone  noehah  well i fancy its not breakin my word to tell ye that no hes got a little gal an adopted daughter livin with him  is she goodlookin inquired bounce quickly with a sharp glance at the youth  march looked a little confused and in a hesitating manner admitted that she was  ah  i thought so observed bounce gravely shaking his head and looking unutterably profound while gibault gave a low whistle and winked to big waller who returned the mystic signal with the addition of a knowing nod all of which movements were observed by poor march who became very red in the face and felt very angry and remarkably uncomfortable and quite unable to decide whether it were better to laugh or storm  he was saved from all further perplexity on this point however by the sudden appearance of a horseman on the distant plain who seemed to be approaching the valley in which they were encamped  at first he looked like a black speck or a crow on the horizon and in the uncertain light of the rapidly closing day it would have been difficult for any unaccustomed eye to make out what the object was  in a short time he drew near enough to be distinguished clearly and the rapid patter of the horses hoofs on the turf told that the rider was flying over the ground at an unusual speed  passing round a clump of low trees that stretched out from the mouth of the valley into the plain he came dashing towards the campa wildlooking dishevelled creature seemingly in a state of reckless insanity  the wild man again surely said bounce who with his companions had risen to await the coming up of the stranger  dyou think so cried march marston eagerly  yeeh why i do blieve its mr macgregor cried the astonished bounce as the reckless rider dashed up to the camp fire and springing from his horse with a yell that savoured more of a savage than a civilised spirit cried  look out lads up with a pile o rocks an trees  theyll be on us in a jiffy  theres five hundred o the red reptiles if theres one  the mountain forts burned to cindersevery man and woman dead and scalpedlook alive  these words were uttered hastily in broken exclamations as macgregor seized the logs that had been cut for firewood and began violently to toss them together in a pile while the trappers although much amazed and horrified at the news seized their hatchets and began to make instant preparation to resist an attack without wasting time in useless questions  they observed that the commander of the mountain fort was pale as death that his eyes were bloodshot his clothes torn and his hands and face begrimed with powder and stained with blood  march marston worked like a hero at the rude breastwork for some time although the effort caused him so much pain that he could not help showing it on his countenance  march said bounce seizing him suddenly by the shoulder youre not fit to work an much less fit to fight  ill tell ye wot to do lad jump on my horse an away to yer friend the trapper an bring him here to help us  one stout arm ll do us more good this night than ten battered bodies sich as yours poor feller  march felt the truth of this so without delay turned to obey  just as he was about to leave he heard a deep groan and turning round saw macgregor fall to the ground  youre ill he cried running to him and kneeling down  nonot ill just a scratch from an arrow gasped the trader with an oath  i believe the heads stickin in my back  away march cried redhand well look to this  waller out wi the fire man ye used to be more spry whenah too late there they are theyve seen us  into the fort boys cried bounce alluding to the breastwork we dont need to care with plenty o powder and lead we can keep five thousand redskins off  march heard no more  dashing up the glen at full speed he disappeared from the spot just as the distant yell of the savage host came floating upon the wings of the night air apprising the trappers that their fire had been observed and that they would have to fight manfully if they hoped to carry their scalps home with them  in a few minutes the indians drew near and scattering themselves round the little entrenchment began to discharge clouds of arrows at it but fortunately without doing any damage  an inaccessible cliff protected their rear and behind a projection of this the trappers horses were secured  the breastwork lay immediately in front  again and again the savages let fly their shafts but without drawing any reply from the trappers who kept close under cover and reserved their fire  this tempted their enemies to approach and when within short range they seemed about to make a rush supposing no doubt that the party concealed behind the breastwork must be indians since they did not use firearms  just then redhand gave a preconcerted signal three sheets of flame spouted from their guns and three of the foremost indians fell dead from their horses  with a terrible yell the others turned to fly but before they had retreated a yard three more shots were fired with deadly effect  they now took shelter behind trees and rocks and attempted to dislodge the trappers by discharging arrows into the air at such an angle that they should drop into their fortress  one or two endeavoured to ascend the steep cliff but the instant an arm or a shoulder appeared a ball from redhands deadly rifle struck it so the attempt was abandoned  while this was going on march marston galloped to dicks cave and startled poor mary not a little by the abruptness of his entrance  but to his mortification dick was not at home  it so chanced that that wild individual had taken it into his head to remain concealed in the woods near the spot where he had parted from his late guest and had not only witnessed the meeting of march with his friends but had seen the arrival of macgregor the subsequent departure of march in the direction of the cave and the attack made by the indians  when therefore the youth was speeding towards his cavern the wild man who was not sorry to see him go off on such an errand was busily planning the best mode of attacking the enemy so as to render effectual aid to the trappers  observing that the indians had clustered together at the foot of a rugged cliff apparently for the purpose of holding a council of war dick made his way quickly to the summit of the cliff and leaving his charger on an eminence that sloped down towards the entrance of the valley quickly and noiselessly carried several huge stones to the edge of the precipice intending to throw them down on the heads of his foes just as he was about to do so he observed an overhanging mass of rock many tons in weight which the frosts of winter had detached from the precipice  placing his feet against this and leaning his back against the solid rock he exerted himself with all his might like a second samson  no human power could have moved such a rock had it not been almost overbalanced but being so dicks effort moved it  again he strained until the great veins seemed about to burst through the skin of his neck and forehead  gradually the rock toppled and fell and the wild man fell along with it  in the agony of that moment he uttered a cry so terrible that it might well have been supposed to have come from the throat of a supernatural being  the indians had not time to evade the danger  the ponderous mass in its descent hit a projecting crag and burst into smaller fragments which fell in a rattling shower killing two men and wounding others  those of the group who escaped as well as those who chanced to be beyond the danger saw by the dim moonlight the wild man of the west descending as it were like a furious demon in the midst of the dire confusion of dust and rocks  they knew him well  it wanted but this to fill them to overflow with superstitious dread  they turned and fled  the trappers although amazed beyond measure and half suspecting who it was that had thus suddenly come to their aid mounted their horses and leaping over their barricade rushed down the valley in pursuit firing a volley at starting and loading as they rode at full speed  in his descent dick made what might well be termed a miraculous escape  near the foot of the cliff he went crashing through a thick bush which broke his fall  still he retained impetus sufficient to have seriously injured if not killed him had he not alighted in the midst of another bush which saved him so completely that he was not even hurt  dick could scarcely believe his own senses but he was not a man given to indulge much wandering thought in times of action  giving himself one shake to make sure of his being actually sound in wind and limb he bounded away up the precipice by a path with which he was well acquainted reached his horse flew by a short cut to the mouth of the valley and wheeling suddenly round met the horrified indians in the very teeth  the roar with which he met them was compound in its nature and altogether hideous  his mind was in a mingled condition of amazement and satisfaction at his escape triumph at the success of his plan and indignation at the cowardly wickedness of the savages  a rollicking species of mad pugnacity took possession of him and the consequence was that the sounds which issued from his leathern throat were positively inhuman  the rushing mass of terrorstricken men thus caught as it were between two fires divided in order to escape him  dick was not sorry to observe this  he felt that the day was gained without further bloodshed  he knew that the superstitious dread in which he was held was a guarantee that the savages would not return so instead of turning with the trappers to join in the pursuit he favoured them with a concluding and a peculiarly monstrous howl and then rode quietly away by a circuitous route to his own cavern  thus he avoided march marston who on finding that his friend dick was out had returned at full speed to aid his comrades and arrived just in time to meet them returning triumphant and panting from their pursuit of the foe  are they gone cried march in amazement  ay right slick away into the middle o nowhar replied big waller laughing heartily  did ye iver hear such a roarer comrades  have you licked em out an out continued the incredulous march ay out an out an no mistake replied bounce dismounting  well that is lucky said march for my friend dick i found was not  ah we not have need him interrupted gibault wiping the perspiration from his forehead de wild man of de west hims come anoh you should see what hims have bin do  the wild man again exclaimed march in dismayan me absent  gibault nodded and laughed  at that moment an exclamation from redhand attracted the attention of the whole party  he was kneeling beside macgregor who had dismounted and lain down  i believe theyve done for me said the fur trader faintly  that arrow must have gone deeper than i thought  youd better let me see the wound sir said redhand your shirt is covered with blood  no no said the wounded man savagely let me restsee im better now  you will find a flask in the bag at my saddlebow  bring it here  i know that dickthe hunteris a good hand at doctoring said march what a pity he is not here  we might carry you there sir  carry me laughed the fur trader fiercely no ill never be carried till im carried to my grave  how far off is his place  where stays he  four miles from this  ill take you if you can ride said march  ay that i can bravely cried the trader who having taken a deep draught of spirits seemed to be imbued with new life  come young sir mount  the trappers endeavoured to dissuade the violent man from the attempt but he could not be controlled so march hastily observing that he would see him safe to the hunters abode and return without delay mounted his horse and rode away followed by the wounded man    chapter twenty three  the wounded fur trader  when they reached the entrance to the cavern march and his companion dismounted but the latter was so weak from loss of blood that he stumbled at the foot of the track and fell to the earth insensible  march ran hastily in for assistance and was not a little surprised to find dick sitting alone by the side of the fire and so absorbed in the perusal of a little book that he had not noticed his entrancea very singular and unaccountable piece of absence of mind in one so well trained in the watchful ways of the backwoods  ho  dick cried the youth  what marchmarch marston exclaimed the wild man springing up seizing him by the shoulders and gazing intently into his face as if to assure himself that he was not dreaming  ay no doubt im march marston though how you came to find out my name i dont know  easy enough that lad when you leave your mothers bible behind ye cried dick with a wild laugh  she must be a good mother that o yours is she alive yet boy  that is she an well i trust  an your father interrupted dick hows he lad eh  i dont know said march frowning he forsook us fourteen years agone but its little good talking o such matters now when theres a poor fellow dyin outside  dyin  ay so it seems to me  ive brought him to see if ye can stop the bleedin but hes fainted and i cant lift  dick waited for no more but hastening out raised macgregor in his arms and carried him into the inner cave where mary was lying sound asleep on her lowly couch  come mary lass make way for this poor feller  the child leaped up and throwing a deerskin round her stepped aside to allow the wounded man to be placed on her bed  her eye immediately fell on march who stood in the entrance and she ran to him in surprise  whats de matter march  hush mary said dick in a low voice well have to speak soft  poor macgregor wont be long for this world im afeard  fetch me the box o things  you know him then whispered march in surprise  ay ive often bin to the mountain fort and seed him there  see hes comin to  put that torch more behind me lad  itll be better for him not to see me  as he spoke the wounded man sighed faintly  opening his eyes he said where am i  speak to him whispered dick looking over his shoulder at march who advanced and kneeling at the side of the couch said  youre all right mr macgregor  ive brought you to the hunters home  hell dress your wound and take care of you so make your mind easy  but youll have to keep quiet  youve lost much blood  the fur trader turned round and seemed to fall asleep while dick bound his wound and then leaving him to rest he and march returned to the other cave  during that night dick seemed in an unaccountably excited state sometimes he sat down by the fire and talked with march in an absent manner on all kinds of subjectshis adventures his intentions his home at pine point but from his looks it seemed as if his thoughts were otherwise engaged and occasionally he started up and paced the floor hurriedly while his brows darkened and his broad chest heaved as though he were struggling with some powerful feeling or passion  could it be thought march that there was some mysterious connection between dick and the wounded fur trader  not being able to find a satisfactory reply to the thought he finally dismissed it and turned his attentions altogether towards mary whose looks of surprise and concern showed that she too was puzzled by the behaviour of her adopted father  during that night and all the next day the wounded man grew rapidly worse and march stayed with him partly because he felt a strong interest in and pity for him and partly because he did not like to leave to mary the duty of watching a dying man  dick went out during the day in the same excited state and did not return till late in the evening  during his absence the dying mans mind wandered frequently and in order to check this as well as to comfort him march read to him from his mothers bible  at times he seemed to listen intently to the words that fell from marchs lips but more frequently he lay in a state apparently of stupor  boy said he starting suddenly out of one of those heavy slumbers whats the use of reading the bible to me  im not a christian an its too late nowtoo late  the bible tells me that now is gods time  i forget where the words are an i cant find em said march earnestly but i know theyre in this book  besides dont you remember the thief who was saved when he hung on the cross in a dyin state  the fur trader shook his head slowly and still muttered too late too late  march now became deeply anxious about the dying man who seemed to him like one sinking in the sea yet refusing to grasp the rope that was flung to him  he turned over the sacred pages hurriedly to find appropriate texts and blamed himself again and again for not having made himself better acquainted with the word of god  he also repeated all he could think of from memory but still the dying man shook his head and muttered too late  suddenly march bent over him and said  christ is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto god through him  the fur trader looked up in silence for a few seconds  ay said he many a time have i heard the old minister at pine point say that  pine point exclaimed march in surprise  perhaps theyre true after all continued macgregor not noticing the interruption  oh  mary mary surely i did the uttermost when i forsook ye  let me see the words boy are they there  a strange suspicion flashed suddenly on the mind of march as he listened to these words and he trembled violently as he handed him the book  whatwhats this  where got ye my wifes bible  you must he added between his teeth in a sudden burst of anger have murdered my boy  father exclaimed march seizing macgregors hand  the dying man started up with a countenance of ashy paleness and leaning on one elbow gazed earnestly into the youths facemarch can it be my boy and fell back with a heavy groan  the bandages had been loosened by the exertion and blood was pouring freely from his wound the case admitted of no delay  march hurriedly attempted to stop the flow of the vital stream assisted by mary who had been sitting at the foot of the couch bathed in tears during the foregoing scene  just then dick returned and seeing how matters stood quickly staunched the wound but his aid came too late  macgregor or rather obadiah marston opened his eyes but once after that and seemed as if he wished to speak  march bent down quickly and put his ear close to his mouth there was a faint whisper god bless you march my son and then all was still  march gazed long and breathlessly at the dead countenance then looking slowly up in dicks face he said pointing to the dead man my father and fell insensible on the couch beside him  we will pass over the first few days that succeeded the event just narrated during which poor march marston went about the wild region in the vicinity of the cave like one in a dream  it may be imagined with what surprise the trappers learned from him the near relationship that existed between himself and the fur trader  they felt and expressed the deepest sympathy with their young comrade and offered to accompany him when he laid his father in the grave  but dick had firmly refused to allow the youth to bring the trappers near his abode so they forbore to press him and the last sad rites were performed by himself and dick alone  the grave was made in the centre of a little green vale which lay like an emerald in the heart of that rocky wilderness and a little wooden cross with the name and date cut thereon by march was erected at the head of the low mound to mark the fur traders last lonely restingplace  march marston had never known his father in early life having been an infant when he deserted his family and the little that he had seen of him at the mountain fort and amid the wild scenes of the rocky mountains had not made a favourable impression on him  but now that he was gone the natural instinct of affection arose within his breast  he called to remembrance the last few and sad hours which he had spent by his parents dying bed  he thought of their last few words on the momentous concerns of the soul and of the eagerness with which at times the dying man listened to the lifegiving word of god and the tear of sorrow that fell upon the grave as he turned to quit that solitary spot was mingled with a tear of joy and thankfulness that god had brought him there to pour words of comfort and hope into his dying fathers ear  that night he spent in the cave with dick he felt indisposed to join his old comrades just then  the grave tenderness of his eccentric friend and the sympathy of little mary were more congenial to him  march said dick in a low sad tone as they sat beside the fire that funeral reminds me o my friend i told ye of once  its a lonesome grave his with nought but a wooden cross to mark it  had you known him long dick  no not long  he left the settlement in a huffbein i blieve crossed in love as i told ye  dick paused and clasping both hands over his knee gazed with a look of mingled sternness and sorrow at the glowing fire  did ye ever he resumed abruptly hear o a feller called louis who once lived at pine pointbefore ye was born lad did ye ever hear yer mother speak of him  louis  yeswell i believe i do think ive heard the name before  oh yes  people used to say he was fond o my mother when she was a girl but i never heard her speak of him  now ye mention it i remember the only time i ever asked her about it she burst into tears and told me never to speak of him again  thadwick was his namelouis thadwick but he was better known as louis the trapper  but hes almost forgotten at the settlement now its so long ago  every one thinks him dead  why dye ask  think hes dead repeated dick slowly  an why not  my poor friend that was killed when he left his native place swore hed never go back an no more he didno more he did though he little thought that death would step in so soon to make him keep his word  was louis your friend who died inquired march with much interest and not a little pity for he observed that his companion was deeply affected  dick did not reply  his thoughts seemed to be wandering again so march forbore to interrupt him and turning to mary said in a more cheerful tone  whether would ye like to go to pine point settlement and stay with my mother or that i should come here and spend the winter with you and dick  mary looked puzzled and after some moments consideration replied me dont know  then looking up quickly she added which you like  indeed i must make the same reply maryi dont know  but as i cant expect my friend dick to give up his wild life i suppose i must make up my mind to come here  march said dick quickly ive changed my mind lad  it wont do youll have to spend next winter at homeanyhow ye cant spend it with me  had a thunderbolt struck the earth between march and mary they would not have been filled with half so much consternation as they were on hearing these words  it was plain that both had thoroughly made up their minds that they were to be together for many months to come  dick noted the effect of his remark and a peculiar frown crossed his countenance for a moment but it gave place to a smile as he said  im sorry to disappoint ye lad but the thing cannot be  cannot be repeated march in a tone of exasperation for he felt that this was an unwarrantable piece of caprice on the part of his friend surely you dont claim to be chief of the rocky mountains  if i choose to come an spend the winter in this region you have no right to prevent me  and if i offer to bring you furs and venison besides pretty good company will ye be such a surly knave as to refuse me a corner of your cave  nay lad  right welcome would ye be with or without furs or venison but i mean to leave the caveto quit this part of the country altogether  the fact is im tired of it an want a change  very good all right an whats to hinder my going with you  im fond o change myself  id as soon go one way as another  dick shook his head  its o no use march ive my own reasons for desirin to travel alone  the thing cannot be  this was said in such a decided tone that march looked at mary in dismay  he gathered no consolation from her countenance however  march said dick firmly im sorry to grieve ye lad but it cant be helped  all i can say is that if ye choose to come back here next summer youll be heartily welcome and ill engage that yell find me here but im quite sartin ye wont want to come  wont want to come  ill bet ye a hundred thousand million dollars ill want to come ay and will come cried march  done said dick seizing the youths hand an marys a witness to the wager  it is needless to say that the conversation did not rest here  the greater part of that night and during great part of the week that march remained there he continued to press the wild man of the west to alter his purpose but without avail  each day he passed with his comrades hunting and trapping and each night he bade them adieu and returned to sup and sleep in the cave and of course persecuted dick all that time but dick was immovable  of course the trappers renewed their attempts to get march to show them dicks abode but he persistently refused and they were too goodnatured to annoy him and too honest to follow his trail which they might easily have done had they been so disposed  at last the time arrived when it became necessary that the trappers should return to pine point settlement  in the midst of all their alarms and fights they had found time to do what big waller termed a pretty considerable stroke o business  that is to say they had killed a large number of furbearing animals by means of trap snare and gun so that they were in a position to return home with a heavy load of valuable skins  the day of their departure was therefore arranged and march mounting his steed galloped for the last time and with a heavy heart towards the cave of his friend dick  as he passed rapidly over the wild country and entered the gloomy recesses that surrounded the wild mans home he thought over the arguments and persuasive speeches with which he meant to make a last and he still hoped successful appeal  but march might have spared himself the trouble of all this thought for when he reached the cave dick was absent  this grieved him deeply because every preparation had been made by his companions for starting on their homeward journey that evening so that he had no time to spare  mary was at home however so march felt a little consoled and seating himself in his wonted place beside the fire he said  when will dick be home mary  me no can know xactly  tomorray hims say perhaps  then its all up sighed march leaning recklessly back against the wall all up  im off tonight so ill not be able to spend the winter with you after all  had mary burst into tears on hearing this march would have felt satisfied  had she groaned or sobbed or even sighed he would have experienced some degree of relief to his annoyed and disappointed spirit but when mary instead of any such demonstration hung down her head so that the heavy masses of her soft brown hair hid her pretty face and said in a tone which march fancied was not very genuine what a pity he became extremely exasperated and deemed himself illused  during the halfhour that succeeded he endeavoured to converse in a pleasant tone of voice but without success  at last he rose to go  must you go way dis night said mary with a look of concern  ay mary an its not much matter for ye dont seem to care  the girl looked at him reproachfully you is not please with me marchwhy  the question puzzled the youth  he certainly was displeased but he could not make up his mind to say that he was so because mary had not fallen into a state of violent grief at the prospect of a separation but the anxious gaze of marys truthful blue eyes was too much for him he suddenly grasped both her hands and kissing her forehead said  mary dear im not displeased  im only sorry and sad and annoyed and miserablevery miserablei can scarcely tell why  i suppose im not well or im cross or something or other  but this i know mary dick has invited me to come back to see him next year and i certainly shall come if life and limb hold out till then  marys eyes filled with tears and as she smiled through them march being very near her face beheld in each eye an excessively miniature portrait of himself gazing out at him lovingly  perhaps faltered mary you no want for come when it be nixt year  poor march was overwhelmed again absolutely disgusted that she could entertain a doubt upon that point  we shall see he cried with a sudden impulse pressing his lips again to her forehead  may the great spirit bless and keep you  goodbye marytill next spring  march burst away from her rushed out of the cave in a tumult of conflicting feelings and great resolves and despite a little stiffness that still remained to remind him of his late accident flung himself into the saddle with a bound that would have done credit to the wild man himself and galloped down the rocky gorge at a pace that threatened a sudden and total smash to horse and man  had any of his old comrades or friends witnessed that burst they would certainly have said that march marston was madmadder perhaps than the most obstreperous march hare that ever marched madly through the wild regions of insanity    chapter twenty four  march marston at homehis astonishing behaviournarration of his extraordinary adventureswidow marstons bowerthe rendezvous of the trappersa strange interruption to marchs narrativea wild surprise and recovery of a lost lovergreat destruction of household goodsa double wedding and tremendous excitementthe wild man of the west the wisest man in pine point settlement  three months passed away and at the end of that period march marston found himself back again in pine point settlement sitting on a low stool at that fireside where the yelling and kicking days of his infancy had been spent and looking up in the face of that buxom blueeyed mother with whom he had been wont to hold philosophical converse in regard to fighting and other knottynot to say naughtyquestions in those bright but stormy days of childhood when he stood exactly twofootten and when he looked and felt as if he stood upwards of ten feet two  three months passed away and during the passage of that period march marstons bosom became a theatre in which unseen by the naked eye were a legion of spirits good middling and bad among whom were hope fear despair joy fun delight interest surprise mischief exasperation and a military demon named general jollity who overbore and browbeat all the rest by turns  these scampered through his brain and tore up his heart and tumbled about in his throat and lungs and maintained a furious harlequinade and in short behaved in a way that was quite disgraceful and that caused the poor young man alternately to amuse annoy astonish and stun his comrades who beheld the exterior results of those private theatricals but had no conception of the terrific combats that took place so frequently on the stage within  during those three months march saw many things  he saw his old friends the prairie dogs and the pronghorned antelopes and the grisly bears and the wolves more than that he chased and shot and ate many of them  he also saw clouds of locusts flying high in the air so thick that they sometimes darkened the very sky and herds of buffaloes so large that they often darkened the whole plain  during those three months march learned a good deal  he learned that there was much more of every sort of thing in this world than he had had any idea ofthat there was much very much to be thankful forthat there were many very many things to be grieved for and many also to be glad aboutthat the fields of knowledge were inimitably large and that his own individual acquirements were preposterously humblingly small  he thought much too  he thought of the past present and future in quite a surprising way  he thought of his mother and her loneliness of dick and his obstinacy of mary and her sweetness of the wild man of the west and his invisibility  when this latter thought arose it had the effect invariably of rousing within him demon despair also general jollity for the general had a particular spite against that demon and whenever he showed symptoms of vitality attacked him with a species of frenzy that was quite dreadful to feel and the outward manifestations of which were such as to cause the trappers to fear seriously that the poor youth had gone out of his mind as they expressed it  but they were wrongquite wrongit was only the natural consequence of those demons and sprites having gone into his mind where they were behaving themselvesas bounce when march made him his confidant saidwith horrible obstropolosity  well as we have said march was seated on a low stool looking up in his mothers face  he had already been three days at home and during every spare minute he had he sat himself down on the same stool and went on with his interminable narrations of the extraordinary adventures through which he had passed while among the rocky mountains and out upon the great prairies  widow marstonfor she knew that she was a widow now though the knowledge added but little to the feeling of widowhood to which she had been doomed for so many yearswidow marston we say listened to this interminable narration with untiring patience and unmitigated pleasure there was as yet no symptom of the narrative drawing to a close neither was there the slightest evidence of the widow marston becoming wearied we have seen a cat worried and pulled and poked by its kitten almost beyond endurance and we have observed that the cat endured it meekly nay evidently rejoiced in the annoyance it was pleasurable pain  as it is with feline so is it with human mothers  their love overbears and outweighs everything  ah good cause have the rugged males of this world to rejoice that such is the fact and although they know it well we hold that it is calculated to improve the health and refresh the spirit of men to have that fact brought prominently and pointedly to their remembrance  had march marston talked the most unutterable balderdash widow marston would have listened with unwearied delight as long we believe as her eyes and ears could do their duty  but march did not talk balderdash for a madman he spoke a great deal of common besides a considerable amount of uncommon sense and his mother listened with intelligent interest commenting on what he said in her quiet way as she found opportunitywe say this advisedly for opportunities were not so frequent as one might suppose  march had always been possessed of a glib tongue and he seemed as bounce remarked to have oiled the hinges since his return to pine point settlement  mother said march after a short pause that had succeeded an unusually long burst do you know its only a few months since i left you to go to this trip to the mountains  i know it well my son replied the widow smiling at the question  and do you know he continued that it seems to me more like five years  when i think of all that ive heard and all that ive done and all that ive seen it seems to me as if it had tookas if it must have tookfive years to have heard and done and seen it all in  and yet said the widow musingly you failed to see the wild man o the west after all  mother ill be angry with you if you say that again  well i wont she replied taking his hand in hers and stroking it tell me again march about dick of the cave and his little girl  i like to hear about them they were so kind to you and that dick from your account seems to be such a fine fellow tell me all about them over again  i will mother said march clearing his throat and commencing in a tone that showed clearly his intention of going on indefinitely  widow marstons cottage had a pretty comfortablelooking flower garden behind it  in front the windows looked out upon a portion of the native woods which had been left standing when the spot for the settlement was cleared  in the back garden there was a bower which the widows brother the blacksmith had erected and the creepers on which had been planted by the widows own hand when she was mary west the belle of the settlement  in this bower which was a capacious one sat a number of sedate quiet jolly conversable fellows nearly all of whom smoked and one of whom sketched  they were our friends redhand bounce big waller gibault hawkswing and bertram  it is observable among men who travel long in company together in a wild country that when they return again to civilised or to semicivilised life they feel a strong inclination to draw closer together either from the force of habit or sympathy or both  on reaching pine point the trappers after visiting their friends and old chums drew together again as if by a species of electrical attraction  in whatever manner they chanced to spend their days theyfor the first week at least found themselves trending gradually each evening a little before sunset to a common centre  widow marston was always at home  march marston was always with his motherdeep in his longwinded yarns  the bower was always invitingly open in the back garden hence the bower was the regular rendezvous of the trappers  it was a splendid evening that on which we now see them assembled there  the sun was just about to set in a flood of golden clouds  birds wildfowl and frogs held an uproarious concert in wood and swamp and the autumnal foliage glowed richly in the slanting beams as it hung motionless in the still atmosphere  dye know said redhand removing his pipe for a few minutes and blowing aside the heavy wreaths of tobacco smoke that seemed unwilling to ascend and dissipate themselvesdye know now that this trips over im inclined to think its about the roughest one ive had for many a year  an its a curous fact that the rougher a trip is the more i like it  bertram who was as a matter of course sketching turned over a few leaves and made a note of the observation  i guess it was pretty much of a meddlin jolly one said big waller smoking enthusiastically and with an expression of intense satisfaction on his weatherbeaten countenance  an profitable observed bounce gravely  ah oui ver proftable echoed gibault  dat is de main ting  we have git plenty skins an have bring hom our own skins wich i was not moche sure of one or two times  true said bounce thats wot weve got for to be thankful for skins is skins but the skin of a human aint to be put in the balance wi the skin o a beaver dye see  bounce glanced at hawkswing as he spoke but the indian only looked stolid and smoked solemnly  yes he continued a whole skins better nor a broken one an its well to bring back a whole one though im not agoin for to deny that theres some advantage in bringing back other sorts o skins too dye see wich goes for to prove the true feelosophy of the fact dye see  bounce paused in the midst of his mental energy to take a parenthetic whiff  his thoughts however seemed too deep for utterance for he subsided quietly into a state of silent fumigation  what a splendidly picturesque scene exclaimed bertram pushing back his brigandish hat in order the better to get a view at arms length of his sketch and compare it with the original  wots the meanin o pikteresk inquired bounce  theodore bertram looked and felt puzzled  he was not the first man who thought that he knew the signification of terms well and found himself much perplexed on being suddenly called upon to give a correct definition of a wellknown word  while he is labouring to enlighten his friend we shall leave the bower and return to the hall or kitchen or reception roomfor it might be appropriately designated by any of these terms where march is as usual engaged in expounding backwoods life to his mother  we have only to pass through the open door and are with them at once  cottages in pine point settlement were of simple construction the front door opened out of one side of the hall the back door out of the other  as the weather was mild both were wide open  march had just reached an intensely interesting point in his narrative and was describing with flashing eyes and heightened colour his first interview with the vision in leather when his attention was attracted by the sound of horses hoofs coming at a rapid pace along the road that led to the cottage  the wood above referred to hid any object approaching by the road until within fifty yards or so of the front door  they seem in a hurry whoever they be said march as he and his mother rose and hastened to the door an theres more than one rider if ive not forgot how to judge by sounds  i should say that theres hallo  the exclamation was not unnatural by any means for at that moment a very remarkable horseman dashed round the point of the wood and galloped towards the cottage  both man and horse were gigantic  the former wore no cap and his voluminous brown locks floated wildly behind him  on they came with a heavy thunderous tread stones sticks and dust flying from the chargers heels  there was a rude paling in front of the cottage  the noble horse put its ears forward as it came up took two or three short strides and went over with the light bound of a deer showing that the strength of bone muscle and sinew was in proportion to the colossal size of the animal  the gravel inside the paling flew like splashing water as they alighted with a crash and widow marston uttering a faint cry shrank within the doorway as the wild horseman seemed about to launch himself with quixotic recklessness against the cottage  dick shouted march who stared like one thunderstruck as the rider leaped from the saddle to the ground sprang with a single bound to the widows side seized her right hand in both of his and stooping down gazed intently into her alarmed countenance  suddenly the blood rushed violently to her temples as the man pronounced her name in a low deep tone and with a look of wild surprise mingled with terror she exclaimedlouis  the colour fled from her cheeks and uttering a piercing cry she fell forward on the breast of her longlost lover  march marston stood for some time helpless but he found his voice just as redhand and the other trappers rushing through the house burst upon the scenedick shouted march again in the highest pitch of amazement  the wild man o the west roared bounce with the expression of one who believes he gazes on a ghost  fetch a drop o water one o you fellers said the wild man looking anxiously at the paleface that rested on his arm  every one darted off to obey excepting bertram who with eyes almost starting out of their sockets was already seated on the paling sketching the scene for he entertained an irresistible belief that the wild man of the west would as he had already done more than once vanish from the spot before he could get him transferred to the pages of his immortal book  trappers are undoubtedly men who can act with vigorous promptitude in their own peculiar sphere but when out of that sphere they are rather clumsy and awkward  had they been in the forest each man would have fetched a draught of clear water from the nearest spring with the utmost celerity but being in a settlement they knew not where to turn  big waller dashed towards a very small pond which lay near the cottage and dipping his cap into it brought up a compound of diluted mud and chickweed  gibault made an attempt on a tiny rivulet with the like success which was not surprising seeing that its fountainhead lay at the bottom of the said pond  bounce and hawkswing bolted into the cottage in search of the needful fluid but being unused to furniture they upset three chairs and a small table in their haste and scattered on the floor a mass of crockery with a crash that made them feel as if they had been the means of causing some dire domestic calamity and which almost terrified the household kitten into fits  then bounce made a hopeful grasp at a teapot which having happily been placed on a side table had survived the wreck of its contemporary cups and saucers and the indian made an insane effort to wrench the top off a butterchurn in the belief that it contained a wellspring of water  of all the party old redhand alone stood still with his bald head glistening in the last rays of the sinking sun and his kindly face wrinkled all over with a sympathetic smile  he knew well that the young widow would soon recover with or without the aid of water so he smoked his pipe complacently leaned against the doorpost and looked on  he was right  in a few minutes mrs marston recovered and was tenderly led into the cottage by her old lover louis thadwick or as we still prefer to call him the wild man of the west  there seated by her side in the midst of the wreck and debris of her household goods the wild man quite regardless of appearances began boldly to tell the same old tale and commit the same offence that he told and committed upwards of sixteen years before when he was louis the trapper and she was mary west  seeing what was going forward the judicious trappers and the enthusiastic artist considerately retired to the bower behind the house what transpired at that strange interview no one can tell for no one was present except the kitten  that creature having recovered from its consternation discovered to its inexpressible joy that an enormous jug having been smashed by bounce along with the other things the floor was covered in part with a lakelet of rich cream  with almost closed eyes intermittent purring quicklapping tongue and occasional indications of a tendency to choke that fortunate animal revelled in this unexpected flood of delectation and listened to the conversation but not being gifted with the power of speech it never divulged what was saidat least to human ears though we are by no means sure that it did not create a considerable amount of talk among the cat population of the settlement  be this as it may when the wild man at length opened the door and cried come in lads its all right they found the widow marston with confusion and happiness beaming on her countenance and the wild man himself in a condition that fully justified bounces suggestion that they had better send for a straitwaistcoat or a pair of handcuffs  as for march he had all along been and still was speechless  that the wild man of the west was dick and dick the wild man of the west and that both should come home at the same time in one body and propose to marry his mother was past beliefso of course he didnt believe it  hallo wait a bit i do blieve i was forgettin cried the wild man springing up in his own violent impulsive way upsetting his chair as a matter of course being unused to such delicacies dashing through the lake of cream to the all but annihilation of the kitten opening the door and giving vent to a shrill whistle  all rushed out to witness the result  they were prepared for anything nowfrom a mad bison to a red warriors ghost and would have been rather disappointed had anything feebler appeared  immediately there was a clatter of hoofs a beautiful white pony galloped round the corner of the wood and made straight for the cottage  seated thereon was the vision in leathernot seated as a woman sits but after the fashion of her own adopted father and having on her leathern dress with a pair of long leggings highly ornamented with porcupine quills and bead work  the vision leaped the fence like her father bounded from her pony as he had done and rushed into the wild mans arms exclaiming be she here an well dear fader  ay all right he replied but he had no time to say more for at that moment march marston darted at the vision seized one of her hands put his arm round her waist and swung her rather than led her into his mothers presence  heres mary mother cried march with a very howl of delight  the widow had already guessed it  she rose and extended her arms  mary gazed for one moment eagerly at her and then rushed into them  turning sharp round march threw his arms round bounces neck and embraced him for want of a better subject then hurling him aside he gave another shout and began to dance a violent hornpipe on the floor to the still further horrification of the kitten which was now a feline maniac and the general scatteration of the mingled mass of crockery and cream seeing this bounce uttered a hysterical cheer  hawkswing being excited beyond even savage endurance drew his scalpingknife yelled the warcry and burst into the wardance of the seneca indians  in short the widows cottage became the theatre of a scene that would have done credit to the violent wards of a lunatic asyluma scene which is utterly beyond the delineative powers of pen or pencila scene which defies description repudiates adequate conception and will dwell for ever on the memories of those who took part in it like the wild phantasmagoria of a tremendous dream  of course a wild man could not be induced like an ordinary mortal to wait a reasonable time in order to give his bride an opportunity of preparing her trousseau  he was a selfwilled man and a man of a strong mind  he insisted upon being married out of hand and have done with it  so he was marriedwhether out of hand or not we cannot tellby the excellent clergyman of pine point settlement  on the same day and the same hour march marston was marriedout of hand also no doubtto the vision in leather  there was something rather precipitate in these proceedings unquestionably but those who feel disposed to object to them must bear in mind first that backwoodsmen are addicted to precipitancy at times and secondly that facts cannot be altered in order to please the fastidious taste of the socalled civilised world  public opinion in the settlement was strongly in favour of the doings of the wild man of the west  delay was deemed by all to be unnecessary and all the more so that the double weddingday was to be celebrated as a species of public event  the romance connected with the previous life of dick and especially his singular and unexpected return to his first love created quite a sensation even in a region in which wild deeds and wonderful events were so common that it required a man to be a real hero to enable him to rise conspicuous above his fellows  many trappers came in from a considerable distance to take part in the rejoicings of that day and from the dance which followed the ceremony there was not absent a living creature belonging to the settlement  every dog was there of course adding its vocal melody to the dulcet tones of the blacksmiths violin  even the cats of the settlement were present including that celebrated kitten which had been reduced to a state of drivelling imbecility by the furious advent of the wild man owls and other sagacious birds also came from afar to see the fun attracted by the light of the fire for the ballroom was the green sward of the forest which was illuminated for the occasion by a bonfire that would have roasted a megatherium whole and also would have furnished accommodation for a pot large enough to boil an elephant  dont think reader in the vanity of your heart that you have conceived that fire you have not as a yankee would say the most distant conception of the small end of a notion of what it was  a hundred brawny arms accustomed to wield the broad axe had lent their aid to rear the mighty pile and feed the ravening flame  it was kindled on a wide level plot in the outskirts of the settlement around which the trees spread their sheltering arms  on a plank raised on two casks sat the blacksmith with his fiddle  the carpenter sat beside him with a kettledrum more literally a kettledrum even than the real thing for that drum was a kettle  on a little mound that rose in the centre of the plot sat in state dick and mary march and the vision in leather their respective thrones being empty flourcasks around them danced the youth and beauty of the settlement  these were enclosed by a dense circle composed of patriarchal middleaged and extremely juvenile admirers  the background of the picture was filled up with the monstrous fire which saturated that spot in the forest with lightbright as the broadest day  the extreme foreground was composed of the trunk of a fallen tree on which sat our friend the artist delineating the whole with the eagerness of an enthusiast who had at last fallen upon a scene truly worthy of his genius  how bounce did dance to be sure  how the young trappers and the blooming backwoods maidens did whirl and bound on heel and toe and to a large extent on the whole sole of the foot  yes their souls were in the work and their spirits too and that although there was not a drop of spirits in the settlement  happily owing to the unaccountable delay of a provision boat there was not a glass of firewater in the place at that time  the whole affair was got up carried on and concluded on tea  it was a great teetotal gathering which would have drawn tears of joy from the heart of father mathew and all his successors whether romanist or protestant had they witnessed it  yet the excitement was tremendous  the wild man of the west strange to say and owing to some peculiar contradictoriness of character which was unaccountable was almost the only sane man of the whole party  he flung himself on the ground beside his wife and locking his arm round the tough root of a pine tree refused to budge from the spot  as the united efforts of all the men who could lay hold of him at one time failed to root him up he was suffered to lie there and amuse himself by watching the dancers looking up occasionally at marys blue eyes and playing with such of the juveniles as he could attract within the reach of his long arm  as for march marston he was mad now if ever he had been so in his life he danced with all the girls and wrestled with all the men and played hideandseek with all the boys and fraternised with all the old people and chased all the dogs and astonished not to say horrified all the cats  yet although he did all this he did not neglect the vision in leather by no manner of means  long before the dawn of early morning that jovial party drank a parting cup of cold tea and dispersing to their several homes left the field in possession of the village curs  now dear readerwith a feeling of sadness we write itall things must have an end  we make this unquestionable assertion in order to break to you as gently as may be the news that our tale has reached its close had we taken in hand to write the life and adventures of our hero and his friends from first to last we should have had to prepare pens ink and paper for a work equal in size to the encyclopaedia britannica we have only detailed one or two episodes in their wild career  what they did and said and saw in after years must be left to future historians or to the imagination of romantic readers  this only will we say in conclusion that of all the men who dwelt in pine point settlement for many years after the events narrated in these pages the kindest the wisest the gentlest the heartiest the wildest and the most courageous wasthe wild man of the west  the end
