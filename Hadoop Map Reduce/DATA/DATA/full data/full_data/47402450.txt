happened he had ceased to be prime minister during the first nine months after he had left office he and the duchess remained in england then they had gone abroad taking with them their three children the eldest lord silverbridge had been at oxford but had had his career there cut short by some more than ordinary youthful folly which had induced his father to agree with the college authorities that his name had better be taken off the college booksall which had been cause of very great sorrow to the duke the other boy was to go to cambridge but his father had thought it well to give him a twelvemonths run on the continent under his own inspection lady mary the only daughter was the youngest of the family and she also had been with them on the continent they remained the full year abroad travelling with a large accompaniment of tutors ladysmaids couriers and sometimes friends i do not know that the duchess or the duke had enjoyed it much but the young people had seen something of foreign courts and much of foreign scenery and had perhaps perfected their french the duke had gone to work at his travels with a full determination to create for himself occupation out of a new kind of life he had studied dante and had striven to arouse himself to ecstatic joy amidst the loveliness of the italian lakes but through it all he had been aware that he had failed the duchess had made no such resolutionhad hardly perhaps made any attempt but in truth they had both sighed to be back among the wartrumpets they had both suffered much among the trumpets and yet they longed to return he told himself from day to day that though he had been banished from the house of commons still as a peer he had a seat in parliament and that though he was no longer a minister still he might be useful as a legislator she in her career as a leader of fashion had no doubt met with some troublewith some trouble but with no disgrace and as she had been carried about among the lakes and mountains among the pictures and statues among the counts and countesses she had often felt that there was no happiness except in that dominion which circumstances had enabled her to achieve once and might enable her to achieve againin the realms of london society  then in the early spring of 187 they came back to england having persistently carried out their project at any rate in regard to time lord gerald the younger son was at once sent up to trinity for the eldest son a seat was to be found in the house of commons and the fact that a dissolution of parliament was expected served to prevent any prolonged sojourn abroad lady mary palliser was at that time nineteen and her entrance into the world was to be her mothers great care and great delight in march they spent a few days in london and then went down to matching priory when she left town the duchess was complaining of cold sore throat and debility a week after their arrival at matching she was dead  had the heavens fallen and mixed themselves with the earth had the people of london risen in rebellion with french ideas of equality had the queen persistently declined to comply with the constitutional advice of her ministers had a majority in the house of commons lost its influence in the countrythe utter prostration of the bereft husband could not have been more complete it was not only that his heart was torn to pieces but that he did not know how to look out into the world it was as though a man should be suddenly called upon to live without hands or even arms he was helpless and knew himself to be helpless hitherto he had never specially acknowledged to himself that his wife was necessary to him as a component part of his life though he had loved her dearly and had in all things consulted her welfare and happiness he had at times been inclined to think that in the exuberance of her spirits she had been a trouble rather than a support to him but now it was as though all outside appliances were taken away from him there was no one of whom he could ask a question  for it may be said of this man that though throughout his life he had had many honourable and right honourable friends and that though he had entertained guests by the score and though he had achieved for himself the respect of all good men and the thorough admiration of some few who knew him he had hardly made for himself a single intimate friendexcept that one who had now passed away from him to her he had been able to say what he thought even though she would occasionally ridicule him while he was declaring his feelings but there had been no other human soul to whom he could open himself there were one or two whom he loved and perhaps liked but his loving and his liking had been exclusively political he had so habituated himself to devote his mind and his heart to the service of his country that he had almost risen above or sunk below humanity but she who had been essentially human had been a link between him and the world  there were his three children the youngest of whom was now nearly nineteen and they surely were links at the first moment of his bereavement they were felt to be hardly more than burdens a more loving father there was not in england but nature had made him so undemonstrative that as yet they had hardly known his love in all their joys and in all their troubles in all their desires and all their disappointments they had ever gone to their mother she had been conversant with everything about them from the boys bills and the girls gloves to the innermost turn in the heart and the disposition of each she had known with the utmost accuracy the nature of the scrapes into which lord silverbridge had precipitated himself and had known also how probable it was that lord gerald would do the same the results of such scrapes she of course deplored and therefore she would give good counsel pointing out how imperative it was that such evildoings should be avoided but with the spirit that produced the scrapes she fully sympathised the father disliked the spirit almost worse than the results and was therefore often irritated and unhappy  and the difficulties about the girl were almost worse to bear than those about the boys she had done nothing wrong she had given no signs of extravagance or other juvenile misconduct but she was beautiful and young how was he to bring her out into the world how was he to decide whom she should or whom she should not marry how was he to guide her through the shoals and rocks which lay in the path of such a girl before she can achieve matrimony  it was the fate of the family that with a world of acquaintance they had not many friends from all close connection with relatives on the side of the duchess they had been dissevered by old feelings at first and afterwards by want of any similitude in the habits of life she had when young been repressed by male and female guardians with an iron hand such repression had been needed and had been perhaps salutary but it had not left behind it much affection and then her nearest relatives were not sympathetic with the duke he could obtain no assistance in the care of his girl from that source nor could he even do it from his own cousins wives who were his nearest connections on the side of the pallisers they were women to whom he had ever been kind but to whom he had never opened his heart when in the midst of the stunning sorrow of the first week he tried to think of all this it seemed to him that there was nobody  there had been one lady a very dear ally staying in the house with them when the duchess died this was mrs finn the wife of phineas finn who had been one of the dukes colleagues when in office how it had come to pass that mrs finn and the duchess had become singularly bound together has been told elsewhere but there had been close bondsso close that when the duchess on their return from the continent had passed through london on her way to matching ill at the time and very comfortless it had been almost a thing of course that mrs finn should go with her and as she had sunk and then despaired and then died it was this woman who had always been at her side who had ministered to her and had listened to the fears and the wishes and hopes she had expressed respecting the children  at matching amidst the ruins of the old priory there is a parish buryingground and there in accordance with her own wish almost within sight of her own bedroomwindow she was buried on the day of the funeral a dozen relatives came pallisers and mcloskies who on such an occasion were bound to show themselves as members of the family with them and his two sons the duke walked across to the graveyard and then walked back but even to those who stayed the night at the house he hardly spoke by noon on the following day they had all left him and the only stranger in the house was mrs finn  on the afternoon of the day after the funeral the duke and his guest met almost for the first time since the sad event there had been just a pressure of the hand just a glance of compassion just some murmur of deep sorrowbut there had been no real speech between them now he had sent for her and she went down to him in the room in which he commonly sat at work he was seated at his table when she entered but there was no book open before him and no pen ready to his hand he was dressed of course in black that indeed was usual with him but now the tailor by his funereal art had added some deeper dye of blackness to his appearance when he rose and turned to her she thought that he had at once become an old man his hair was grey in parts and he had never accustomed himself to use that skill in managing his outside person by which many men are able to preserve for themselves a look if not of youth at any rate of freshness he was thin of an adust complexion and had acquired a habit of stooping which when he was not excited gave him an appearance of age all that was common to him but now it was so much exaggerated that he who was not yet fifty might have been taken to be over sixty  he put out his hand to greet her as she came up to him silverbridge he said tells me that you go back to london tomorrow  i thought it would be best duke my presence here can be of no comfort to you  i will not say that anything can be of comfort but of course it is right that you should go i can have no excuse for asking you to remain while there was yet a hope for her then he stopped unable to say a word further in that direction and yet there was no sign of a tear and no sound of a sob  of course i would stay duke if i could be of any service  mr finn will expect you to return to him  perhaps it would be better that i should say that i would stay were it not that i know that i can be of no real service  what do you mean by that mrs finn  lady mary should have with her at such a time some other friend  there was none other whom her mother loved as she loved younone none this he said almost with energy  there was no one lately duke with whom circumstances caused her mother to be so closely intimate but even that perhaps was unfortunate  i never thought so  that is a great compliment but as to lady mary will it not be as well that she should have with her as soon as possible someoneperhaps someone of her own kindred if it be possible or if not that at least one of her own kind  who is there whom do you mean  i mean no one it is hard duke to say what i do mean but perhaps i had better try there will beprobably there have beensome among your friends who have regretted the great intimacy which chance produced between me and my lost friend while she was with us no such feeling would have sufficed to drive me from her she had chosen for herself and if others disapproved her choice that was nothing to me but as regards lady mary it will be better i think that from the beginning she should be taught to look for friendship and guidance to thoseto those who are more naturally connected with her  i was not thinking of any guidance said the duke  of course not but with one so young where there is intimacy there will be guidance there should be somebody with her it was almost the last thought that occupied her mothers mind i could not tell her duke but i can tell you that i cannot with advantage to your girl be that somebody  cora wished it  her wishes probably were sudden and hardly fixed  who should it be then asked the father after a pause  who am i duke that i should answer such a question  after that there was another pause and then the conference was ended by a request from the duke that mrs finn would stay at matching for yet two days longer at dinner they all metthe father the three children and mrs finn how far the young people among themselves had been able to throw off something of the gloom of death need not here be asked but in the presence of their father they were sad and sombre almost as he was on the next day early in the morning the younger lad returned to his college and lord silverbridge went up to london where he was supposed to have his home  perhaps you would not mind reading these letters the duke said to mrs finn when she again went to him in compliance with a message from him asking for her presence then she sat down and read two letters one from lady cantrip and the other from a mrs jeffrey palliser each of which contained an invitation for his daughter and expressed a hope that lady mary would not be unwilling to spend some time with the writer lady cantrips letter was long and went minutely into circumstances if lady mary would come to her she would abstain from having other company in the house till her young friends spirits should have somewhat recovered themselves nothing could be more kind or proposed in a sweeter fashion there had however been present to the dukes mind as he read it a feeling that a proposition to a bereaved husband to relieve him of the society of an only daughter was not one which would usually be made to a father in such a position a childs company would probably be his best solace but he knewat this moment he painfully rememberedthat he was not as are other men he acknowledged the truth of this but he was not the less grieved and irritated by the reminder the letter from mrs jeffrey palliser was to the same effect but was much shorter if it would suit mary to come to them for a month or six weeks at their place in gloucestershire they would both be delighted  i should not choose her to go there said the duke as mrs finn refolded the latter letter my cousins wife is a very good woman but mary would not be happy with her  lady cantrip is an excellent friend for her  excellent i know no one whom i esteem more than lady cantrip  would you wish her to go there duke  there came a wistful piteous look over the fathers face why should he be treated as no other father would be treated why should it be supposed that he would desire to send his girl away from him but yet he felt that it would be better that she should go it was his present purpose to remain at matching through a portion of the summer what could he do to make a girl happy what comfort would there be in his companionship  i suppose she ought to go somewhere he said  i had not thought of it said mrs finn  i understood you to say replied the duke almost angrily that she ought to go to someone who would take care of her  i was thinking of some friend coming to her  who would come who is there that i could possibly ask you will not stay  i certainly would stay if it were for her good i was thinking duke that perhaps you might ask the greys to come to you  they would not come he said after a pause  when she was told that it was for her sake she would come i think  then there was another pause i could not ask them he said for his sake i could not have it put to her in that way perhaps mary had better go to lady cantrip perhaps i had better be alone here for a time i do not think that i am fit to have any human being here with me in my sorrow     chapter ii  lady mary palliser   it may as well be said at once that mrs finn knew something of lady mary which was not known to the father and which she was not yet prepared to make known to him the last winter abroad had been passed at rome and there lady mary palliser had become acquainted with a certain mr tregearfrancis oliphant tregear the duchess who had been in constant correspondence with her friend had asked questions by letter as to mr tregear of whom she had only known that he was the younger son of a cornish gentleman who had become lord silverbridges friend at oxford in this there had certainly been but little to recommend him to the intimacy of such a girl as lady mary palliser nor had the duchess when writing ever spoken of him as a probable suitor for her daughters hand she had never connected the two names together but mrs finn had been clever enough to perceive that the duchess had become fond of mr tregear and would willingly have heard something to his advantage and she did hear something to his advantagesomething also to his disadvantage at his mothers death this young man would inherit a property amounting to about fifteen hundred a year and i am told said mrs finn that he is quite likely to spend his money before it comes to him there had been nothing more written specially about mr tregear but mrs finn had feared not only that the young man loved the girl but that the young mans love had in some imprudent way been fostered by the mother  then there had been some fitful confidence during those few days of acute illness why should not the girl have the man if he were lovable and the duchess referred to her own early days when she had loved and to the great ruin which had come upon her heart when she had been severed from the man she had loved not but that it has been all for the best she had said not but that plantagenet has been to me all that a husband should be only if she can be spared what i suffered let her be spared even when these things had been said to her mrs finn had found herself unable to ask questions she could not bring herself to inquire whether the girl had in truth given her heart to this young tregear the one was nineteen and the other as yet but twoandtwenty but though she asked no questions she almost knew that it must be so and she knew also that the father as yet was quite in the dark on the matter how was it possible that in such circumstances she should assume the part of the girls confidential friend and monitress were she to do so she must immediately tell the father everything in such a position no one could be a better friend than lady cantrip and mrs finn had already almost made up her mind that should lady cantrip occupy the place she would tell her ladyship all that had passed between herself and the duchess on the subject  of what hopes she might have or what fears about her girl the duchess had said no word to her husband but when she had believed that the things of the world were fading away from her and when he was sitting by her bedsidedumb because at such a moment he knew not how to express the tenderness of his heartholding her hand and trying so to listen to her words that he might collect and remember every wish she had murmured something about the ultimate division of the great wealth with which she herself had been endowed she had never she said even tried to remember what arrangements had been made by lawyers but she hoped that mary might be so circumstanced that if her happiness depended on marrying a poor man want of money need not prevent it the duke suspecting nothing believing this to be a not unnatural expression of maternal interest had assured her that marys fortune would be ample  mrs finn made the proposition to lady mary in respect to lady cantrips invitation lady mary was very like her mother especially in having exactly her mothers tone of voice her quick manner of speech and her sharp intelligence she had also her mothers eyes large and round and almost blue full of life and full of courage eyes which never seemed to quail and her mothers dark brown hair never long but very copious in its thickness she was however taller than her mother and very much more graceful in her movement and she could already assume a personal dignity of manner which had never been within her mothers reach she had become aware of a certain brusqueness of speech in her mother a certain aptitude to say sharp things without thinking whether the sharpness was becoming to the position which she held and taking advantage of the example the girl had already learned that she might gain more than she would lose by controlling her words  papa wants me to go to lady cantrip she said  i think he would like itjust for the present lady mary  though there had been the closest possible intimacy between the duchess and mrs finn this had hardly been so as to the intercourse between mrs finn and the children of mrs finn it must be acknowledged that she was perhaps fastidiously afraid of appearing to take advantage of her friendship with the dukes family she would tell herself that though circumstances had compelled her to be the closest and nearest friend of a duchess still her natural place was not among dukes and their children and therefore in her intercourse with the girl she did not at first assume the manner and bearing which her position in the house would have seemed to warrant hence the lady mary  why does he want to send me away mrs finn  it is not that he wants to send you away but that he thinks it will be better for you to be with some friend here you must be so much alone  why dont you stay but i suppose mr finn wants you to be back in london  it is not that only or to speak the truth not that at all mr finn could come here if it were suitable or for a week or two he might do very well without me but there are other reasons there is no one whom your mother respected more highly than lady cantrip  i never heard her speak a word of lady cantrip  both he and she are your fathers intimate friends  does papa want to bealone here  it is you not himself of whom he is thinking  therefore i must think of him mrs finn i do not wish him to be alone i am sure it would be better that i should stay with him  he feels that it would not be well that you should live without the companionship of some lady  then let him find some lady you would be the best because he knows you so well i however am not afraid of being alone i am sure he ought not to be here quite by himself if he bids me go i must go and then of course i shall go where he sends me but i wont say that i think it best that i should go and certainly i do not want to go to lady cantrip this she said with great decision as though the matter was one on which she had altogether made up her mind then she added in a lower voice why doesnt papa speak to me about it  he is thinking only of what may be best for you  it would be best for me to stay near him whom else has he got  all this mrs finn repeated to the duke as closely as she could and then of course the father was obliged to speak to his daughter  dont send me away papa she said at once  your life here mary will be inexpressibly sad  it must be sad anywhere i cannot go to college like gerald or live anywhere just as i please like silverbridge  do you envy them that  sometimes papa only i shall think more of poor mamma by being alone and i should like to be thinking of her always he shook his head mournfully i do not mean that i shall always be unhappy as i am now  no my dear you are too young for that it is only the old who suffer in that way  you will suffer less if i am with you wont you papa i do not want to go to lady cantrip i hardly remember her at all  she is very good  oh yes that is what they used to say to mamma about lady midlothian papa pray do not send me to lady cantrip  of course it was decided that she should not go to lady cantrip at once or to mrs jeffrey palliser and after a short interval of doubt it was decided also that mrs finn should remain at matching for at least a fortnight the duke declared that he would be glad to see mr finn but she knew that in his present mood the society of any one man to whom he would feel himself called upon to devote his time would be a burden to him and she plainly said that mr finn had better not come to matching at present there are old associations she said which will enable you to bear with me as you will with your butler or your groom but you are not as yet quite able to make yourself happy with company this he bore with perfect equanimity and then as it were handed over his daughter to mrs finns care  very quickly there came to be close intimacy between mrs finn and lady mary for a day or two the elder woman though the place she filled was one of absolute confidence rather resisted than encouraged the intimacy she always remembered that the girl was the daughter of a great duke and that her position in the house had sprung from circumstances which would not perhaps in the eyes of the world at large have recommended her for such friendship she knewthe reader may possibly knowthat nothing had ever been purer nothing more disinterested than her friendship but she knew alsono one knew betterthat the judgment of men and women does not always run parallel with facts she entertained too a conviction in regard to herself that hard words and hard judgments were to be expected from the worldwere to be accepted by her without any strong feeling of injusticebecause she had been elevated by chance to the possession of more good things than she had merited she weighed all this with a very fine balance and even after the encouragement she had received from the duke was intent on confining herself to some position about the girl inferior to that which such a friend as lady cantrip might have occupied but the girls manner and the girls speech about her own mother overcame her it was the unintentional revelation of the duchesss constant reference to herthe way in which lady mary would assert that mamma used always to say this of you mamma always knew that you would think so and so mamma used to say that you had told her it was the feeling thus conveyed that the mother who was now dead had in her daily dealings with her own child spoken of her as her nearest friend which mainly served to conquer the deference of manner which she had assumed  then gradually there came confidencesand at last absolute confidence the whole story about mr tregear was told yes she loved mr tregear she had given him her heart and had told him so  then my dear your father ought to know it said mrs finn  no not yet mamma knew it  did she know all that you have told me  yes all and mr tregear spoke to her and she said that papa ought not to be told quite yet  mrs finn could not but remember that the friend she had lost was not among women the one best able to give a girl good counsel in such a crisis  why not yet dear  well because it is very hard to explain in the first place because mr tregear himself does not wish it  that is a very bad reason the worst in the world  of course you will say so of course everybody would say so but when there is one person whom one loves better than all the rest for whom one would be ready to die to whom one is determined that everything shall be devoted surely the wishes of a person so dear as that ought to have weight  not in persuading you to do that which is acknowledged to be wrong  what wrong i am going to do nothing wrong  the very concealment of your love is wrong after that love has been not only given but declared a girls position in such matters is so delicate especially that of such a girl as you  i know all about that said lady mary with something almost approaching to scorn in her tone of course i have to bedelicate i dont quite know what the word means i am not a bit ashamed of being in love with mr tregear he is a gentleman highly educated very clever of an old familyolder i believe than papas and he is manly and handsome just what a young man ought to be only he is not rich  if he be all that you say ought you not to trust your papa if he approve of it he could give you money  of course he must be told but not now he is nearly brokenhearted about dear mamma he could not bring himself to care about anything of that kind at present and then it is mr tregear that should speak to him first  not now mary  how do you mean not now  if you had a mother you would talk to her about it  mamma knew  if she were still living she would tell your father  but she didnt tell him though she did know she didnt mean to tell him quite yet she wanted to see mr tregear here in england first of course i shall do nothing till papa does know  you will not see him  how can i see him here he will not come here if you mean that  you do not correspond with him here for the first time the girl blushed oh mary if you are writing to him your father ought to know it  i have not written to him but when he heard how ill poor mamma was then he wrote to metwice you may see his letters it is all about her no one worshipped mamma as he did  gradually the whole story was told these two young persons considered themselves to be engaged but had agreed that their engagement should not be made known to the duke till something had occurred or some time had arrived as to which mr tregear was to be the judge in mrs finns opinion nothing could be more unwise and she said much to induce the girl to confess everything to her father at once but in all her arguments she was opposed by the girls reference to her mother mamma knew it and it did certainly seem to mrs finn as though the mother had assented to this imprudent concealment when she endeavoured in her own mind to make excuse for her friend she felt almost sure that the duchess with all her courage had been afraid to propose to her husband that their daughter should marry a commoner without an income but in thinking of all that there could now be nothing gained what ought she to doat once the girl in telling her had exacted no promise of secrecy nor would she have given any such promise but yet she did not like the idea of telling the tale behind the girls back it was evident that lady mary had considered herself to be safe in confiding her story to her mothers old friend lady mary no doubt had had her confidences with her motherconfidences from which it had been intended by both that the father should be excluded and now she seemed naturally to expect that this new ally should look at this great question as her mother had looked at it the father had been regarded as a great outside power which could hardly be overcome but which might be evaded or made inoperative by stratagem it was not that the daughter did not love him she loved him and venerated him highlythe veneration perhaps being stronger than the love the duchess too had loved him dearlymore dearly in late years than in her early life but her husband to her had always been an outside power which had in many cases to be evaded lady mary though she did not express all this evidently thought that in this new friend she had found a woman whose wishes and aspirations for her would be those which her mother had entertained  but mrs finn was much troubled in her mind thinking that it was her duty to tell the story to the duke it was not only the daughter who had trusted her but the father also and the fathers confidence had been not only the first but by far the holier of the two and the question was one so important to the girls future happiness there could be no doubt that the peril of her present position was very great  mary she said one morning when the fortnight was nearly at an end your father ought to know all this i should feel that i had betrayed him were i to go away leaving him in ignorance  you do not mean to say that you will tell said the girl horrified at the idea of such treachery  i wish that i could induce you to do so every day that he is kept in the dark is an injury to you  i am doing nothing what harm can come it is not as though i were seeing him every day  this harm will come your father of course will know that you became engaged to mr tregear in italy and that a fact so important to him has been kept back from him  if there is anything in that the evil has been done already of course poor mamma did mean to tell him  she cannot tell him now and therefore you ought to do what she would have done  i cannot break my promise to him him always meant mr tregear i have told him that i would not do so till i had his consent and i will not  this was very dreadful to mrs finn and yet she was most unwilling to take upon herself the part of a stern elder and declare that under the circumstances she must tell the tale the story had been told to her under the supposition that she was not a stern elder that she was regarded as the special friend of the dear mother who was gone that she might be trusted to assist against the terrible weight of parental authority she could not endure to be regarded at once as a traitor by this young friend who had sweetly inherited the affection with which the duchess had regarded her and yet if she were to be silent how could she forgive herself the duke certainly ought to know at once said she repeating her words merely that she might gain some time for thinking and pluck up courage to declare her purpose should she resolve on betraying the secret  if you tell him now i will never forgive you said lady mary  i am bound in honour to see that your father knows a thing which is of such vital importance to him and to you having heard all this i have no right to keep it from him if mr tregear really loves youlady mary smiled at the doubt implied by this suggestionhe ought to feel that for your sake there should be no secret from your father then she paused a moment to think will you let me see mr tregear myself and talk to him about it  to this lady mary at first demurred but when she found that in no other way could she prevent mrs finn from going at once to the duke and telling him everything she consented under mrs finns directions she wrote a note to her lover which mrs finn saw and then undertook to send it with a letter from herself to mr tregears address in london the note was very short and was indeed dictated by the elder lady with some dispute however as to certain terms in which the younger lady had her way it was as follows      dearest frank     i wish you to see mrs finn who as you know was dear    mammas most particular friend please go to her as she    will ask you to do when you hear what she says i think    you ought to do what she advises     yours for ever and always     m p   this mrs finn sent enclosed in an envelope with a few words from herself asking the gentleman to call upon her in park lane on a day and at an hour fixed     chapter iii  francis oliphant tregear   mr francis oliphant tregear was a young man who might not improbably make a figure in the world should circumstances be kind to him but as to whom it might be doubted whether circumstances would be sufficiently kind to enable him to use serviceably his unquestionable talents and great personal gifts he had taught himself to regard himself as a young english gentleman of the first water qualified by his birth and position to live with all that was most noble and most elegant and he could have lived in that sphere naturally and gracefully were it not that the part of the sphere which he specially affected requires wealth as well as birth and intellect wealth he had not and yet he did not abandon the sphere as a consequence of all this it was possible that the predictions of his friends as to that figure which he was to make in the world might be disappointed  he had been educated at eton from whence he had been sent to christ church and both at school and at college had been the most intimate friend of the son and heir of a great and wealthy duke he and lord silverbridge had been always together and they who were interested in the career of the young nobleman had generally thought he had chosen his friend well tregear had gone out in honours having been a secondclass man his friend silverbridge we know had been allowed to take no degree at all but the terrible practical joke by which the whole front of the deans house had been coloured scarlet in the middle of the night had been carried on without any assistance from tregear the two young men had then been separated for a year but immediately after taking his degree tregear at the invitation of lord silverbridge had gone to italy and had there completely made good his footing with the duchesswith what effect on another member of the palliser family the reader already knows  the young man was certainly clever when the duchess found that he could talk without any shyness that he could speak french fluently and that after a month in italy he could chatter italian at any rate without reticence or shame when she perceived that all the women liked the lads society and impudence and that all the young men were anxious to know him she was glad to find that silverbridge had chosen so valuable a friend and then he was beautiful to look atputting her almost in mind of another man on whom her eyes had once loved to dwell he was dark with hair that was almost black but yet was not black with clear brown eyes a nose as regular as apollos and a mouth in which was ever to be found that expression of manliness which of all characteristics is the one which women love the best he was five feet ten in height he was always well dressed and yet always so dressed as to seem to show that his outside garniture had not been matter of trouble to him before the duchess had dreamed what might take place between this young man and her daughter she had been urgent in her congratulations to her son as to the possession of such a friend  for though she now and then would catch a glimpse of the outer man which would remind her of that other beautiful one whom she had known in her youth and though as these glimpses came she would remember how poor in spirit and how unmanly that other one had been though she would confess to herself how terrible had been the heartshipwreck which that other one had brought upon herself still she was able completely to assure herself that this man though not superior in external grace was altogether different in mind and character she was old enough now to see all this and to appreciate it young tregear had his own ideas about the politics of the day and they were ideas with which she sympathised though they were antagonistic to the politics of her life he had his ideas about books too as to manners of life as to art and even ethics whether or no in all this there was not much that was superficial only she was not herself deep enough to discover nor would she have been deterred from admiring him had she been told that it was tinsel such were the acquirements such the charms that she loved here was a young man who dared to speak and had always something ready to be spoken who was not afraid of beauty nor daunted by superiority of rank who if he had not money could carry himself on equal terms among those who had in this way he won the duchesss heart and having done that was it odd that he should win the heart of the daughter also  his father was a cornwall squire of comfortable means having joined the property of his wife to his own for the period of his own life she had possessed land also in cornwall supposed to be worth fifteen hundred a year and his own paternal estate at polwenning was said to be double that value being a prudent man he lived at home as a country gentleman and thus was able in his county to hold his head as high as richer men but frank tregear was only his second son and though frank would hereafter inherit his mothers fortune he was by no means now in a position to assume the right of living as an idle man yet he was idle the elder brother who was considerably older than frank was an odd man much addicted to quarrelling with his family and who spent his time chiefly in travelling about the world franks mother who was not the mother of the heir also would sometimes surmise in franks hearing that the entire property must ultimately come to him that other tregear who was now supposed to be investigating the mountains of crim tartary would surely never marry and frank was the favourite also with his father who paid his debts at oxford with not much grumbling who was proud of his friendship with a future duke who did not urge as he ought to have urged that vital question of a profession and who when he allowed his son four hundred pounds a year was almost content with that sons protestations that he knew how to live as a poor man among rich men without chagrin and without trouble  such was the young man who now in lieu of a profession had taken upon himself the responsibility of an engagement with lady mary palliser he was tolerably certain that should he be able to overcome the parental obstacles which he would no doubt find in his path money would be forthcoming sufficient for the purposes of matrimonial life the dukes wealth was fabulous and as a great part of it if not the greater had come from his wife there would probably be ample provision for the younger children and when the duchess had found out how things were going and had yielded to her daughter after an opposition which never had the appearance even of being in earnest she had taken upon herself to say that she would use her influence to prevent any great weight of trouble from pecuniary matters frank tregear young and bright and full of hearty ambitions was certainly not the man to pursue a girl simply because of her fortune nor was he weak enough to be attracted simply by the glitter of rank but he was wise enough with worldly wisdom to understand thoroughly the comforts of a good income and he was sufficiently attached to high position to feel the advantage of marrying a daughter of the duke of omnium  when the duchess was leaving italy it had been her declared purpose to tell her husband the story as soon as they were at home in england and it was on this understanding that frank tregear had explained to the girl that he would not as yet ask her father for his permission to be received into the family as a suitor everyone concerned had felt that the duke would not easily be reconciled to such a soninlaw and that the duchess should be the one to bell the cat  there was one member of the family who had hitherto been halfhearted in the matter lord silverbridge had vacillated between loyalty to his friend and a certain feeling as to the impropriety of such a match for his sister he was aware that something very much better should be expected for her and still was unable to explain his objections to tregear he had not at first been admitted into confidence either by his sister or by tregear but had questioned his friend when he saw what was going on certainly i love your sister tregear had said do you object lord silverbridge was the weaker of the two and much subject to the influence of his friend but he could on occasion be firm and he did at first object but he did not object strongly and allowed himself at last to be content with declaring that the duke would never give his consent  while tregear was with his love or near her his hopes and fears were sufficient to occupy his mind and immediately on his return all the world was nothing to him except as far as the world was concerned with lady mary palliser he had come back to england somewhat before the ducal party and the pleasures and occupations of london life had not abated his love but enabled him to feel that there was something in life over and beyond his love whereas to lady mary down at matching there had been nothing over and beyond her loveexcept the infinite grief and desolation produced by her mothers death  tregear when he received the note from mrs finn was staying at the dukes house in carlton terrace silverbridge was there and on leaving matching had asked the dukes permission to have his friend with him the duke at that time was not well pleased with his son as to a matter of politics and gave his sons friend credit for the evil counsel which had produced this displeasure but still he had not refused his assent to this proposition had he done so silverbridge would probably have gone elsewhere and though there was a matter in respect to tregear of which the duke disapproved it was not a matter as he thought which would have justified him in expelling the young man from his house the young man was a strong conservative and now silverbridge had declared his purpose of entering the house of commons if he did enter it as one of the conservative party  this had been a terrible blow to the duke and he believed that it all came from this young tregear still he must do his duty and not more than his duty he knew nothing against tregear that a tregear should be a conservative was perhaps natural enoughat any rate was not disgraceful that he should have his political creed sufficiently at heart to be able to persuade another man was to his credit he was a gentleman well educated superior in many things to silverbridge himself there were those who said that silverbridge had redeemed himself from contemptfrom that sort of contempt which might be supposed to await a young nobleman who had painted scarlet the residence of the head of his collegeby the fact of his having chosen such a friend the duke was essentially a just man and though at the very moment in which the request was made his heart was half crushed by his sons apostasy he gave the permission asked  you know mrs finn tregear said to his friend one morning at breakfast  i remember her all my life she used to be a great deal with my grandfather i believe he left her a lot of diamonds and money and that she wouldnt have them i dont know whether the diamonds are not locked up somewhere now so that she can take them when she pleases  what a singular woman  it was odd but she had some fad about it what makes you ask about mrs finn  she wants me to go and see her  what about  i think i have heard your mother speak of her as though she loved her dearly said tregear  i dont know about loving her dearly they were intimate and mrs finn used to be with her very much when she was in the country she was at matching just now when my poor mother died why does she want to see you  she has written to me from matching she wants to see me  well  to tell you the truth i do not know what she has to say to me though i can guess  what do you guess  it is something about your sister  you will have to give that up tregear  i think not  yes you will my father will never stand it  i dont know what there is to stand i am not noble nor am i rich but i am as good a gentleman as he is  my dear fellow said the young lord you know very well what i think about all that a fellow is not any better to me because he has got a title nor yet because he owns half a county but men have their ideas and feelings about it my father is a rich man and of course hell want his daughter to marry a rich man my father is noble and hell want his daughter to marry a nobleman you cant very well marry mary without his permission and therefore you had better let it alone  i havent even asked his permission as yet  even my mother was afraid to speak to him about it and i never knew her to be afraid to say anything else to him  i shall not be afraid said tregear looking grimly  i should thats the difference between us  he cant very well eat me  nor even bite younor will he abuse you but he can look at you and he can say a word or two which you will find it very hard to bear my governor is the quietest man i know but he has a way of making himself disagreeable when he wishes that i never saw equalled  at any rate i had better go and see your mrs finn then tregear wrote a line to mrs finn and made his appointment     chapter iv  park lane   from the beginning of the affair tregear had found the necessity of bolstering himself up inwardly in his great attempt by mottoes proverbs and instigations to courage addressed to himself none but the brave deserve the fair de laudace et encore de laudace et toujours de laudace he was a man naturally of good heart in such matters who was not afraid of his brothermen nor yet of women his sisters but in this affair he knew very much persistence would be required of him and that even with such persistence he might probably fail unless he should find a more than ordinary constancy in the girl that the duke could not eat him indeed that nobody could eat him as long as he carried himself as an honest man and a gentleman was to him an inward assurance on which he leaned much and yet he was conscious almost with a feeling of shame that in italy he had not spoken to the duke about his daughter because he was afraid lest the duke might eat him in such an affair he should have been careful from the first to keep his own hands thoroughly clean had it not been his duty as a gentleman to communicate with the father if not before he gained the girls heart at any rate as soon as he knew he had done so he had left italy thinking that he would certainly meet the duchess and her daughter in london and that then he might go to the duke as though this love of his had arisen from the sweetness of those meetings in london but all these ideas had been dissipated by the great misfortune of the death of lady marys mother from all this he was driven to acknowledge to himself that his silence in italy had been wrong that he had been weak in allowing himself to be guided by the counsel of the duchess and that he had already armed the duke with one strong argument against him  he did not doubt but that mrs finn would be opposed to him of course he could not doubt but that all the world would now be opposed to himexcept the girl herself he would find no other friend so generous so romantic so unworldly as the duchess had been it was clear to him that lady mary had told the story of her engagement to mrs finn and that mrs finn had not as yet told it to the duke from this he was justified in regarding mrs finn as the girls friend the request made was that he should at once do something which mrs finn was to suggest he could hardly have been so requested and that in terms of such warm affection had it been mrs finns intention to ask him to desist altogether from his courtship this woman was regarded by lady mary as her mothers dearest friend it was therefore incumbent on him now to induce her to believe in him as the duchess had believed  he knocked at the door of mrs finns little house in park lane a few minutes before the time appointed and found himself alone when he was shown into the drawingroom he had heard much of this lady though he had never seen her and had heard much also of her husband there had been a kind of mystery about her people did not quite understand how it was that she had been so intimate with the duchess nor why the late duke had left to her an enormous legacy which as yet had never been claimed there was supposed too to have been something especially romantic in her marriage with her present husband it was believed also that she was very rich the rumours of all these things together had made her a person of note and tregear when he found himself alone in the drawingroom looked round about him as though a special interest was to be attached to the belongings of such a woman it was a pretty room somewhat dark because the curtains were almost closed across the windows but furnished with a pretty taste and now in these early april days filled with flowers  i have to apologise mr tregear for keeping you waiting she said as she entered the room  i fear i was before my time  i know that i am after minea few minutes said the lady  he told himself that though she was not a young woman yet she was attractive she was dark and still wore her black hair in curls such as are now seldom seen with ladies perhaps the reduced light of the chamber had been regulated with some regard to her complexion and to her age the effect however was good and frank tregear felt at once interested in her  you have just come up from matching he said  yes only the day before yesterday it is very good of you to come to me so soon  of course i came when you sent for me i am afraid the duke felt his loss severely  how should he not such a loss as it was few people knew how much he trusted her and how dearly he loved her  silverbridge has told me that he is awfully cut up  you have seen lord silverbridge then  just at present i am living with him at carlton terrace  in the dukes house she asked with some surprise  yes in the dukes house silverbridge and i have been very intimate of course the duke knows that i am there is there any chance of his coming to town  not yet i fear he is determined to be alone i wish it were otherwise as i am sure he would better bear his sorrow if he would go about among other men  no doubt he would suffer less said tregear then there was a pause each wished that the other should introduce the matter which both knew was to be the subject of their conversation but tregear would not begin when i left them all at florence he said i little thought that i should never see her again  you had been intimate with them mr tregear  yes i think i may say i have been intimate with them i had been at eton and at christ church with silverbridge and we have always been much together  i have understood that have you and the duke been good friends  we have never been enemies  i suppose not that  the duke i think does not much care about young people i hardly know what he used to do with himself when i dined with them i saw him but i did not often do that i think he used to read a good deal and walk about alone we were always riding  lady mary used to ride  oh yes and lord silverbridge and lord gerald and the duchess used to drive one of us would always be with her  and so you became intimate with the whole family  so i became intimate with the whole family  and especially so with lady mary this she said in her sweetest possible tone and with a most gracious smile  especially so with lady mary he replied  it will be very good of you mr tregear if you endure and forgive all this crossquestioning from me who am a perfect stranger to you  but you are not a perfect stranger to her  that is it of course now if you will allow me i will explain to you exactly what my footing with her is when the duchess returned and when i found her to be so ill as she passed through london i went down with her into the countryquite as a matter of course  so i understand  and there she diedin my arms i will not try to harass you by telling you what those few days were how absolutely he was struck to the ground how terrible was the grief of the daughter how the boys were astonished by the feeling of their loss after a few days they went away it was i think their fathers wish that they should go and i too was going awayand had felt indeed directly her spirit had parted from her that i was only in the way in his house but i stayed at his request because he did not wish his daughter to be alone  i can easily understand that mrs finn  i wanted her to go to lady cantrip who had invited her but she would not in that way we were thrown together in the closest intercourse for two or three weeks then she told me the story of your engagement  that was natural i suppose  surely so think of her position left as she is without a mother it was incumbent on her to tell someone there was however one other person in whom it would have been much better that she should have confided  what person  her father  i rather fancy that it is i who ought to tell him  as far as i understand these things mr tregearwhich indeed is very imperfectlyi think it is natural that a girl should at once tell her mother when a gentleman has made her understand that he loves her  she did so mrs finn  and i suppose that generally the mother would tell the father  she did not  no and therefore the position of the young lady is now one of great embarrassment the duchess has gone from us and we must now make up our minds as to what had better be done it is out of the question that lady mary should be allowed to consider herself to be engaged and that the father should be kept in ignorance of her position she paused for his reply but as he said nothing she continued either you must tell the duke or she must do so or i must do so  i suppose she told you in confidence  no doubt she told it me presuming that i would not betray her but i shallif that be a betrayal the duke must know it it will be infinitely better that he should know it through you or through her than through me but he must be told  i cant quite see why said tregear  for her sakewhom i suppose you love  certainly i love her  in order that she may not suffer i wonder you do not see it mr tregear perhaps you have a sister  i have no sister as it happens  but you can imagine what your feelings would be should you like to think of a sister as being engaged to a man without the knowledge of any of her family  it was not so the duchess knew it the present condition of things is altogether an accident  it is an accident that must be brought to an end  of course it must be brought to an end i am not such a fool as to suppose that i can make her my wife without telling her father  i mean at once mr tregear  it seems to me that you are rather dictating to me mrs finn  i owe you an apology of course for meddling in your affairs at all but as it will be more conducive to your success that the duke should hear this from you than from me and as i feel that i am bound by my duty to him and to lady mary to see that he be not left in ignorance i think that i am doing you a service  i do not like to have a constraint put upon me  that mr tregear is what gentlemen i fancy very often feel in regard to ladies but the constraint of which you speak is necessary for their protection are you unwilling to see the duke  he was very unwilling but he would not confess so much he gave various reasons for delay urging repeatedly that the question of his marriage was one which he could not press upon the duke so soon after the death of the duchess and when she assured him that this was a matter of importance so great that even the death of the mans wife should not be held by him to justify delay he became angry and for awhile insisted that he must be allowed to follow his own judgment but he gave her a promise that he would see the duke before a week was over nevertheless he left the house in dudgeon having told mrs finn more than once that she was taking advantage of lady marys confidence they hardly parted as friends and her feeling was on the whole hostile to him and to his love it could not she thought be for the happiness of such a one as lady mary that she should give herself to one who seemed to have so little to recommend him  he when he had left her was angry with his own weakness he had not only promised that he would make his application to the duke but that he would do so within the period of a week who was she that she should exact terms from him after this fashion and prescribe days and hours and now because this strange woman had spoken to him he was compelled to make a journey down to the dukes country house and seek an interview in which he would surely be snubbed  this occurred on a wednesday and he resolved that he would go down to matching on the next monday he said nothing of his plan to any one and not a word passed between him and lord silverbridge about lady mary during the first two or three days but on the saturday silverbridge appeared at breakfast with a letter in his hand the governor is coming up to town he said  immediately  in the course of next week he says that he thinks he shall be here on wednesday  it immediately struck tregear that this sudden journey must have some reference to lady mary and her engagement do you know why he is coming  because of these vacancies in parliament  why should that bring him up  i suppose he hopes to be able to talk me into obedience he wants me to stand for the countyas a liberal of course i intend to stand for the borough as a conservative and i have told them so down at silverbridge i am very sorry to annoy him and all that kind of thing but what the deuce is a fellow to do if a man has got political convictions of his own of course he must stick to them this the young lord said with a good deal of selfassurance as though he by the light of his own reason had ascertained on which side the truth lay in political contests of the day  there is a good deal to be said on both sides of the question my boy at this particular moment tregear felt that the duke ought to be propitiated  you wouldnt have me give up my convictions  a seat in parliament is a great thing  i can probably secure that whichever side i take i thought you were so devilish hot against the radicals  so i am but then you are as it were bound by family allegiance  ill be shot if i am one never knows how to understand you nowadays it used to be a great doctrine with you that nothing should induce a man to vote against his political opinions  so it isif he has really got any however as your father is coming to london i need not go down to matching  you dont mean to say that you were going to matching  i had intended to beard the lion in his country den but now the lion will find me in his own town den and i must beard him here  then tregear wrote a most chilling note to mrs finn informing her with great precision that as the duke of omnium intended to be in town one day next week he would postpone the performance of his promise for a day or two beyond the allotted time     chapter v  it is impossible   down at matching lady marys life was very dull after mrs finn had left her she had a horse to ride but had no one to ride with her she had a carriage in which to be driven but no one to be driven with her and no special places whither to go her father would walk daily for two hours and she would accompany him when he encouraged her to do so but she had an idea that he preferred taking his walks alone and when they were together there was no feeling of confidence between them there could be none on her part as she knew that she was keeping back information which he was entitled to possess on this matter she received two letters from mrs finn in the first of which she was told that mr tregear intended to present himself at matching within a few days and was advised in the same letter not to endeavour to see her lover on that occasion and then in the second she was informed that this interview with her father was to be sought not at matching but in london from this latter letter there was of course some disappointment though some feeling of relief had he come there she might possibly have seen him after the interview but she would have been subjected to the immediate sternness of her fathers anger that she would now escape she would not be called on to meet him just when the first blow had fallen upon him she was quite sure that he would disapprove of the thing she was quite sure that he would be very angry she knew that he was a peculiarly just man and yet she thought that in this he would be unjust had she been called upon to sing the praises of her father she would have insisted above all things on the absolute integrity of his mind and yet knowing as she did that he would be opposed to her marriage with mr tregear she assured herself every day and every hour that he had no right to make any such objection the man she loved was a gentleman and an honest man by no means a fool and subject to no vices her father had no right to demand that she should give her heart to a rich man or to one of high rank rank as for rank she told herself that she had the most supreme contempt for it she thought that she had seen it near enough already to be sure that it ought to have no special allurements what was it doing for her simply restraining her choice among comparatively a few who seemed to her by no means the best endowed of gods creatures  of one thing she was very sure that under no pressure whatsoever would she abandon her engagement with mr tregear that to her had become a bond almost as holy as matrimony itself could be she had told the man that she loved him and after that there could be no retreat he had kissed her and she had returned his caress he had told her that she was his as his arm was round her and she had acknowledged that it was so that she belonged to him and could not be taken away from him all this was to her a compact so sacred that nothing could break it but a desire on his part to have it annulled no other man had ever whispered a word of love to her of no other man had an idea entered her mind that it could be pleasant to join her lot in life with his with her it had been all new and all sacred love with her had that religion which nothing but freshness can give it that freshness that bloom may last through a long life but every change impairs it and after many changes it has perished for ever there was no question with her but that she must bear her fathers anger should he be angry put up with his continued opposition should he resolutely oppose her bear all that the countesses of the world might say to herfor it was thus that she thought of lady cantrip now any retrogression was beyond her power  she was walking with her father when she first heard of his intended visit to london at that time she had received mrs finns first letter but not the second i suppose youll see silverbridge she said she knew then that frank tregear was living with her brother  i am going up on purpose to see him he is causing me much annoyance  is he extravagant  it is not thatat present he winced even as he said this for he had in truth suffered somewhat from demands made upon him for money which had hurt him not so much by their amount as by their nature lord silverbridge had taken upon himself to own a horse or two very much to his fathers chagrin and was at this moment part proprietor of an animal supposed to stand well for the derby the fact was not announced in the papers with his lordships name but his father was aware of it and did not like it the better because his son held the horse in partnership with a certain major tifto who was well known in the sporting world  what is it papa  of course he ought to go into parliament  i think he wishes it himself  yes but how by a piece of extreme good fortune west barsetshire is open to him the two seats are vacant together there is hardly another agricultural county in england that will return a liberal and i fear i am not asserting too much in saying that no other liberal could carry the seat but one of our family  you used to sit for silverbridge papa  yes i did in those days the county returned four conservatives i cannot explain it all to you but it is his duty to contest the county on the liberal side  but if he is a conservative himself papa asked lady mary who had had some political ideas suggested to her own mind by her lover  it is all rubbish it has come from that young man tregear with whom he has been associating  but papa said lady mary who felt that even in this matter she was bound to be firm on what was now her side of the question i suppose it is asasas respectable to be a conservative as a liberal  i dont know that at all said the duke angrily  i thought thatthe two sides were  she was going to express an opinion that the two parties might be supposed to stand as equal in the respect of the country when he interrupted her the pallisers have always been liberal it will be a blow to me indeed if silverbridge deserts his colours i know that as yet he himself has had no deep thoughts on the subject that unfortunately he does not give himself much to thinking and that in this matter he is being talked over by a young man whose position in life has hardly justified the great intimacy which has existed  this was very far from being comfortable to her but of course she said nothing in defence of tregears politics nor at present was she disposed to say anything as to his position in life though at some future time she might not be so silent a few days later they were again walking together when he spoke to her about herself i cannot bear that you should be left here alone while i am away he said  you will not be long gone i suppose  only for three or four days now  i shall not mind that papa  but very probably i may have to go into barsetshire would you not be happier if you would let me write to lady cantrip and tell her that you will go to her  no papa i think not there are times when one feels that one ought to be almost alone dont you feel that  i do not wish you to feel it nor would you do so long if you had other people around you with me it is different i am an old man and cannot look for new pleasures in society it has been the fault of my life to be too much alone i do not want to see my children follow me in that  it is so very short a time as yet said she thinking of her mothers death  but i think that you should be with somebodywith some woman who would be kind to you i like to see you with books but books alone should not be sufficient at your age how little she thought did he know of the state either of her heart or mind do you dislike lady cantrip  i do not know her i cant say that i dislike a person whom i dont think i ever spoke to and never saw above once or twice but how can i say that i like her she did however know that lady cantrip was a countess all over and would be shocked at the idea of a daughter of a duke of omnium marrying the younger son of a country squire nothing further was then said on the matter and when the duke went to town lady mary was left quite alone with an understanding that if he went into barsetshire he should come back and take her with him  he arrived at his own house in carlton terrace about five oclock in the afternoon and immediately went to his study intending to dine and spend the evening there alone his son had already pleaded an engagement for that afternoon but had consented to devote the following morning to his fathers wishes of the other sojourner in his house the duke had thought nothing but the other sojourner had thought very much of the duke frank tregear was fully possessed of that courage which induces a man who knows that he must be thrown over a precipice to choose the first possible moment for his fall he had sounded silverbridge about this change in his politics and had found his friend quite determined not to go back to the family doctrine such being the case the dukes illwill and hardness and general severity would probably be enhanced by his interview with his son tregear therefore thinking that nothing could be got by delay sent his name in to the duke before he had been an hour in the house and asked for an interview the servant brought back word that his grace was fatigued but would see mr tregear if the matter in question was one of importance franks heart quailed for a moment but only for a moment he took up a pen and wrote a note      my dear duke of omnium     if your grace can spare a moment i think you will find    that what i have to say will justify the intrusion     your very faithful servant     f o tregear   of course the duke admitted him there was but one idea in his head as to what was coming his son had taken this way of making some communication to him respecting his political creed some overture or some demand was to be preferred through tregear if so it was proof of a certain anxiety as to the matter on his sons part which was not displeasing to him but he was not left long in this mistake after tregear had entered the room sir he said speaking quite at once as soon as the door was closed behind him but still speaking very slowly looking beautiful as apollo as he stood upright before his wishedfor fatherinlawsir i have come to you to ask you to give me the hand of your daughter the few words had been all arranged beforehand and were now spoken without any appearance of fear or shame no one hearing them would have imagined that an almost penniless young gentleman was asking in marriage the daughter of the richest and greatest nobleman in england  the hand of my daughter said the duke rising from his chair  i know how very great is the prize said frank and how unworthy i am of it butas she thinks me worthy  she what she  lady mary  she think you worthy  yes your grace  i do not believe it on hearing this frank simply bowed his head i beg your pardon mr tregear i do not mean to say that i do not believe you i never yet gave the lie to a gentleman and i hope i never may be driven to do so but there must be some mistake in this  i am complying with lady marys wishes in asking your permission to enter your house as her suitor the duke stood for a moment biting his lips in silence i cannot believe it he said at last i cannot bring myself to believe it there must be some mistake my daughter lady mary palliser again the young man bowed his head what are your pretensions  simply her regard  of course it is impossible you are not so ignorant but that you must have known as much when you came to me  there was so much scorn in his words and in the tone in which they were uttered that tregear in his turn was becoming angry he had prepared himself to bow humbly before the great man before the duke before the croesus before the late prime minister before the man who was to be regarded as certainly one of the most exalted of the earth but he had not prepared himself to be looked at as the duke looked at him the truth my lord duke is this he said that your daughter loves me and that we are engaged to each otheras far as that engagement can be made without your sanction as her father  it cannot have been made at all said the duke  i can only hopewe can both of us only hope that a little time may soften  it is out of the question there must be an end of this altogether you must neither see her nor hear from her nor in any way communicate with her it is altogether impossible i believe sir that you have no means  very little at present duke  how did you think you were to live but it is altogether unnecessary to speak of such a matter as that there are so many reasons to make this impossible that it would be useless to discuss one as being more important than others has any other one of my family known of this this he added wishing to ascertain whether lord silverbridge had disgraced himself by lending his hand to such a disposition of his sister  oh yes said tregear  who has known it  the duchess sir we had all her sympathy and approval  i do not believe a word of it said the duke becoming extremely red in the face he was forced to do now that which he had just declared that he had never done in his lifedriven by the desire of his heart to acquit the wife he had lost of the terrible imprudence worse than imprudence of which she was now accused  that is the second time my lord that you have found it necessary to tell me that you have not believed direct assertions which i made you but luckily for me the two assertions are capable of the earliest and most direct proof you will believe lady mary and she will confirm me in the one and the other  the duke was almost beside himself with emotion and grief he did knowthough now at this moment he was most loath to own to himself that it was sothat his dear wife had been the most imprudent of women and he recognised in her encouragement of this most pernicious courtshipif she had encouraged ita repetition of that romantic folly by which she had so nearly brought herself to shipwreck in her own early life if it had been soeven whether it had been so or nothe had been wrong to tell the man that he did not believe him and the man had rebuked him with dignity at any rate it is impossible he repeated  i cannot allow that it is impossible  that is for me to judge sir  i trust that you will excuse me when i say that i also must hold myself to be in some degree a judge in the matter if you were in my place you would feel  i could not possibly be in your place  if your grace were in my place you would feel that as long as you were assured by the young lady that your affection was valued by her you would not be deterred by the opposition of her father that you should yield to me of course i do not expect that lady mary should be persistent in her present feelings when she knows your mind perhaps i have no right to hope but should she be so persistent as to make you feel that her happiness depends as mine does on our marriage then i shall believe that you will yield at last  never said the duke never i shall never believe that my daughters happiness can be assured by a step which i should regard as disgraceful to her  disgraceful is a violent word my lord  it is the only word that will express my meaning  and one which i must be bold enough to say you are not justified in using should she become my wife tomorrow no one in england would think she had disgraced herself the queen would receive her on her marriage all your friends would hold out their hands to uspresuming that we had your goodwill  but you would not have it  her disgrace would not depend upon that my lord should your daughter so dispose of herself as to disgrace herselfwhich i think to be impossibleyour countenance could not set her right nor can the withdrawal of your countenance condemn her before the world if she does that with herself which any other lady might do and remain a lady  the duke when he heard this even in the midst of his wrath which was very violent and in the midst of his anger which was very acute felt that he had to deal with a manwith one whom he could not put off from him into the gutter and there leave as buried in the mud and there came too a feeling upon him which he had no time to analyse but of which he was part aware that this terrible indiscretion on the part of his daughter and of his late wife was less wonderful than it had at first appeared to be but not on that account was he the less determined to make the young man feel that his parental opposition would be invincible  it is quite impossible sir i do not think that i need say anything more then while tregear was meditating whether to make any reply the duke asked a question which had better have been left unasked the asking of it diminished somewhat from that ducal grandducal quasiarchducal almost godlike superiority which he had assumed and showed the curiosity of a mere man has anybody else been aware of this he said still wishing to know whether he had cause for anger against silverbridge in the matter  mrs finn is aware of it answered tregear  mrs finn exclaimed the duke as though he had been stung by an adder  this was the woman whom he had prayed to remain awhile with his daughter after his wife had been laid in her grave in order that there might be someone near whom he could trust and this very woman whom he had so trustedwhom in his early associations with her he had disliked and distrusted but had taught himself both to like and to trust because his wife had loved herthis woman was the shepandarus who had managed matters between tregear and his daughter his wife had been too much subject to her influence that he had always known and now in this last act of her life she had allowed herself to be persuaded to give up her daughter by the baneful wiles of this most pernicious woman such were the workings of the dukes mind when the young man told him that mrs finn was acquainted with the whole affair as the reader is aware nothing could have been more unjust  i mentioned her name said tregear because i thought she had been a friend of the family  that will do sir i have been greatly pained as well as surprised by what i have heard of the real state of the case i can form no opinion till i see my daughter you of course will hold no further intercourse with her he paused as though for a promise but tregear did not feel himself called upon to say a word in one direction or in the other it will be my care that you shall not do so goodmorning sir  tregear who during the interview had been standing then bowed turned upon his heel and left the room  the duke seated himself and crossing his arms upon his chest sat for an hour looking up at the ceiling why was it that for him such a world of misery had been prepared what wrong had he done of what imprudence had he been guilty that at every turn of life something should occur so grievous as to make him think himself the most wretched of men no man had ever loved his wife more dearly than he had done and yet now in that very excess of tenderness which her death had occasioned he was driven to accuse her of a great sin against himself in that she had kept from him her knowledge of this affairfor when he came to turn the matter over in his mind he did believe tregears statement as to her encouragement then too he had been proud of his daughter he was a man so reticent and undemonstrative in his manner that he had never known how to make confidential friends of his children in his sons hitherto he had not taken pride they were gallant wellgrown handsome boys with a certain dash of clevernessmore like their mother than their father but they had not as yet done anything as he would have had them do it but the girl in the perfection of her beauty in the quiescence of her manner in the nature of her studies and in the general dignity of her bearing had seemed to be all that he had desired and now she had engaged herself behind his back to the younger son of a little county squire  but his anger against mrs finn was hotter than his anger against any one in his own family     chapter vi  major tifto   major tifto had lately become a member of the beargarden club under the auspices of his friend lord silverbridge it was believed by those who had made some inquiry into the matter that the major had really served a campaign as a volunteer in the carlist army in the north of spain when therefore it was declared by someone that he was not a major at all his friends were able to contradict the assertion and to impute it to slander instances were brought updeclared by these friends to be innumerable but which did in truth amount to three or fourof english gentlemen who had come home from a former carlist war bearing the title of colonel without any contradiction or invidious remark had this gallant officer appeared as colonel tifto perhaps less might have been said about it there was a little lack of courage in the title which he did choose but it was accepted at last and as major tifto he was proposed seconded and elected at the beargarden  but he had other points in his favour besides the friendship of lord silverbridgepoints which had probably led to that friendship he was without doubt one of the best horsemen in england there were some who said that across country he was the very best and that as a judge of a hunter few excelled him of late years he had crept into credit as a bettingman no one supposed that he had much capital to work with but still when he lost a bet he paid it  soon after his return from spain he was chosen as master of the runnymede foxhounds and was thus enabled to write the letters mfh after his name the gentlemen who rode with the runnymede were not very liberal in their terms and had lately been compelled to change their master rather more frequently than was good for that quasisuburban hunt but now they had fitted themselves well how he was to hunt the country five days a fortnight finding servants and horses and feeding the hounds for eight hundred pounds a year no one could understand but major tifto not only undertook to do it but did it and he actually succeeded in obtaining for the runnymede a degree of popularity which for many years previous it had not possessed such a maneven though no one did know anything of his father or mother though no one had ever heard him speak of a brother or a sister though it was believed that he had no real incomewas felt by many to be the very man for the beargarden and when his name was brought up at the committee lord silverbridge was able to say so much in his favour that only two blackballs were given against him under the mild rule of the club three would have been necessary to exclude him and therefore major tifto was now as good a member as any one else  he was a wellmade little man goodlooking for those who like such good looks he was lighthaired and blueeyed with regular and yet not inexpressive features but his eyes were small and never tranquil and rarely capable of looking at the person who was speaking to him he had small welltrimmed glossy whiskers with the bestkept moustache and the bestkept tuft on his chin which were to be seen anywhere his face still bore the freshness of youth which was a marvel to many who declared that from facts within their knowledge tifto must be far on the wrong side of forty at a first glance you would hardly have called him thirty no doubt when on close inspection you came to look into his eyes you could see the hand of time even if you believed the common assertion that he paintedwhich it was very hard to believe of a man who passed the most of his time in the huntingfield or on a racecourseyet the paint on his cheeks would not enable him to move with the elasticity which seemed to belong to all his limbs he rode flat races and steeple chasesif jump races may still be so called and with his own hounds and with the queens did incredible things on horseback he could jump over chairs toothe backs of four chairs in a diningroom after dinnera feat which no gentleman of fortyfive could perform even though he painted himself ever so  so much in praise of major tifto honesty has compelled the present chronicler to say but there were traits of character in which he fell off a little even in the estimation of those whose pursuits endeared him to them he could not refrain from boastingand especially from boasting about women his desire for glory in that direction knew no bounds and he would sometimes mention names and bring himself into trouble it was told of him that at one period of his life when misfortune had almost overcome him when sorrow had produced prostration and prostration some expression of truth he had owned to a friend his own conviction that could he have kept his tongue from talking of women he might have risen to prosperity in his profession from these misfortunes he had emerged and no doubt had often reflected on what he himself had then said but we know that the drunkard though he hates drunkenness cannot but drinkthat the gambler cannot keep from the dice major tifto still lied about women and could not keep his tongue from the subject he would boast too about other mattersmuch to his own disadvantage he was too very deep and some men who could put up with his other failings could not endure that whatever he wanted to do he would attempt round three corners though he could ride straight he could do nothing else straight he was full of mysteries if he wanted to draw charter wood he would take his hounds out of the street at egham directly in the other direction if he had made up his mind to ride lord pottlepots horse for the great leamington handicap he would be sure to tell even his intimate friends that he was almost determined to take the baronets offer of a mount this he would do even where there was no possible turn in the betting to be affected by such falsehood so that his companions were apt to complain that there was no knowing where to have tifto and then they who were old enough in the world to have had some experience in men had perceived that peculiar quality of his eyes which never allowed him to look any one in the face  that major tifto should make money by selling horses was perhaps a necessity of his position no one grumbled at him because he did so or thought that such a pursuit was incompatible with his character as a sporting gentleman but there were some who considered that they had suffered unduly under his hands and in their bargains with him had been made to pay more than a proper amount of tax for the advantages of his general assistance when a man has perhaps made fifty pounds by using a straight tip as to a horse at newmarket in doing which he had of course encountered some risks he feels he ought not to be made to pay the amount back into the pockets of the tipper and at the same time to find himself saddled with the possession of a perfectly useless animal in this way there were rocks in the course through which tifto was called on to steer his bark of course he was anxious when preying upon his acquaintances to spare those who were useful friends to him now and again he would sell a serviceable animal at a fair price and would endeavour to make such sale in favour of someone whose countenance would be a rock to him he knew his business well but yet there would be mistakes  now at this very moment was the culmination of the majors life he was master of the runnymede hounds he was partner with the eldest son of a duke in the possession of that magnificent colt the prime minister and he was a member of the beargarden he was a man who had often been despondent about himself but was now disposed to be a little triumphant he had finished his season well with the runnymede and were it not that let him work as he would his expenses always exceeded his means he would have been fairly comfortable  at eight oclock lord silverbridge and his friend met in the diningroom of the beargarden have you been here before asked the lord  not in here my lord i just looked in at the smokingroom last night glasslough and nidderdale were there i thought we should have got up a rubber but they didnt seem to see it  there is whist here generally youll find out all about it before long perhaps they are a little afraid of you  im the worst hand at cards i suppose in england a dash at loo for about an hour and halfadozen cuts at blind hookeythats about my form i know i drop more than i pick up if i knew what i was about i should never touch a card  horses eh tifto  horses yes theyve pretty good claret here eh silverbridge he could never hit off his familiarity quite right he had mylorded his young friend at first and now brought out the name with a hesitating twang which the young nobleman appreciated but then the young nobleman was quite aware that the major was a friend for club purposes and sporting purposes and not for home use  everything of that kind is pretty good here said the lord  you were sayinghorses  i dare say you do better with them than with cards  if i didnt i dont know where i should be seeing what a lot pass through my hands in the year any one of our fellows who has a horse to sell thinks that i am bound to buy him and i do buy em last may i had fortytwo hunters on my hands  how many of them have you got now  three three of that lotthough a goodish many have come up since but what does it amount to when i have anything that is very good some fellow that i like gets him from me  after paying for him  after paying for him yes i dont mean that i make a fellow a present but the man who buys has a deal the best of it did you ever get anything better than that spotted chestnut in your life  what old sarcinet  you had her for one hundred and sixty pounds now if you were on your oath what is she worth  she suits me major and of course i shouldnt sell her  i rather think not i knew what that mare was well enough a dealer would have had three hundred and fifty pounds for her i could have got the money easily if i had taken her down into the shires and ridden her a day or two myself  i gave you what you asked  yes you did it isnt often that i take less than i ask but the fact is about horses i dont know whether i shouldnt do better if i never owned an animal at all but those i want for my own use when i am dealing with a man i call a friend i cant bear to make money of him i dont think fellows give me all the credit they should do for sticking to them  the major as he said this leaned back in his chair put his hand up to his moustache and looked sadly away into the vacancy of the room as though he was meditating sorrowfully on the ingratitude of the world  i suppose its all right about cream cheese asked the lord  well it ought to be and now the major spoke like an oracle leaning forward on the table uttering his words in a low voice but very plainly so that not a syllable might be lost when you remember how he ran at the craven with 9 st 12 lb on him that it took archbishop all he knew to beat him with only 9 st 2 lb and what the lot at chester are likely to be i dont think that there can be seven to one against him i should be very glad to take it off your hands only the figures are a little too heavy for me  i suppose sunflowerll be the best animal there  not a doubt of it if hes all right and if his temper will stand think what a course chester is for an illconditioned brute like that and then hes the most uncertain horse in training there are times he wont feed from what i hear i shouldnt wonder if he dont turn up at all  solomon says hes all right  you wont get solomon to take four to one against him nor yet four and a half i suppose youll go down my lord  well yes if theres nothing else doing just then i dont know how it may be about this electioneering business i shall go and smoke upstairs  at the beargarden there werei was going to say two smokingrooms but in truth the house was a smokingroom all over it was however the custom of those who habitually played cards to have their cigars and coffee upstairs into this sanctum major tifto had not yet been introduced but now he was taken there under lord silverbridges wing there were already four or five assembled among whom was mr adolphus longstaff a young man of about thirtyfive years of age who spent very much of his time at the beargarden do you know my friend tifto said the lord tifto this is mr longstaff whom men within the walls of this asylum sometimes call dolly whereupon the major bowed and smiled graciously  i have heard of major tifto said dolly  who has not said lord nidderdale another middleaged young man who made one of the company again the major bowed  last season i was always intending to get down to your country and have a day with the tiftoes said dolly dont they call your hounds the tiftoes  they shall be called so if you like said the major and why didnt you come  it always was such a grind  train down from paddington every day at halfpast ten  thats all very well if you happen to be up well silverbridge hows the prime minister  how is he tifto asked the noble partner  i dont think theres a man in england just at present enjoying a very much better state of health said the major pleasantly  safe to run asked dolly  safe to run why shouldnt he be safe to run  i mean sure to start  i think we mean him to start dont we silverbridge said the major  there was something perhaps in the tone in which the last remark was made which jarred a little against the young lords dignity at any rate he got up and declared his purpose of going to the opera he should look in he said and hear a song from mdlle stuffa mdlle stuffa was the nightingale of the season and lord silverbridge when he had nothing else to do would sometimes think that he was fond of music soon after he was gone major tifto had some whiskyandwater lit his third cigar and began to feel the glory of belonging to the beargarden with lord silverbridge to whom it was essentially necessary that he should make himself agreeable at all times he was somewhat overweighted as it were though he attempted an easy familiarity he was a little afraid of lord silverbridge with dolly longstaff he felt that he might be comfortablenot perhaps understanding that gentlemans character with lord nidderdale he had previously been acquainted and had found him to be goodnatured so as he sipped his whisky he became confidential and comfortable  i never thought so much about her good looks he said they were talking of the singer the charms of whose voice had carried lord silverbridge away  did you ever see her off the stage asked nidderdale  oh dear yes  she does not go about very much i fancy said someone  i dare say not said tifto but she and i have had a day or two together for all that  you must have been very much favoured said dolly  weve been pals ever since she has been over here said tifto with an enormous lie  how do you get on with her husband asked dollyin the simplest voice as though not in the least surprised at his companions statement  husband exclaimed the major who was not possessed of sufficient presence of mind to suppress all signs of his ignorance  ah said dolly you are not probably aware that your pal has been married to mr thomas jones for the last year and a half soon after that major tifto left the clubwith considerably enhanced respect for mr longstaff     chapter vii  conservative convictions   lord silverbridge had engaged himself to be with his father the next morning at halfpast nine and he entered the breakfastroom a very few minutes after that hour he had made up his mind as to what he would say to his father he meant to call himself a conservative and to go into the house of commons under that denomination all the men among whom he lived were conservatives it was a matter on which as he thought his father could have no right to control him down in barsetshire as well as up in london there was some little difference of opinion in this matter the people of silverbridge declared that they would prefer to have a conservative member as indeed they had one for the last session they had loyally returned the duke himself while he was a commoner but they had returned him as being part and parcel of the omnium appendages that was all over now as a constituency they were not endowed with advanced views and thought that a conservative would suit them best that being so and as they had been told that the dukes son was a conservative they fancied that by electing him they would be pleasing everybody but in truth by so doing they would by no means please the duke he had told them on previous occasions that they might elect whom they pleased and felt no anger because they had elected a conservative they might send up to parliament the most antediluvian old tory they could find in england if they wished only not his son not a palliser as a tory or conservative and then though the little town had gone back in the ways of the world the county or the dukes division of the county had made so much progress that a liberal candidate recommended by him would almost certainly be returned it was just the occasion on which a palliser should show himself ready to serve his country there would be an expense but he would think nothing of expense in such a matter ten thousand pounds spent on such an object would not vex him the very contest would have given him new life all this lord silverbridge understood but had said to himself and to all his friends that it was a matter in which he did not intend to be controlled  the duke had passed a very unhappy night he had told himself that any such marriage as that spoken of was out of the question he believed that the matter might be so represented to his girl as to make her feel that it was out of the question he hardly doubted but that he could stamp it out though he should have to take her away into some further corner of the world he would stamp it out but she when this foolish passion of hers should have been thus stamped out could never be the pure the bright the unsullied unsoiled thing of the possession of which he had thought so much he had never spoken of his hopes about her even to his wife but in the silence of his very silent life he had thought much of the day when he would give her to some noble youthnoble with all gifts of nobility including rank and wealthwho might be fit to receive her now even though no one else should know itand all would know itshe would be the girl who had condescended to love young tregear  his own duchess she whose loss to him now was as though he had lost half his limbshad not she in the same way loved a tregear or worse than a tregear in her early days ah yes and though his cora had been so much to him had he not often felt had he not been feeling all his days that fate had robbed him of the sweetest joy that is given to man in that she had not come to him loving him with her early spring of love as she had loved that poor neerdowell how infinite had been his regrets how often had he told himself that with all that fortune had given him still fortune had been unjust to him because he had been robbed of that not to save his life could he have whispered a word of this to any one but he had felt it he had felt it for years dear as she had been she had not been quite what she should have been but for that and now this girl of his who was so much dearer to him than anything else left to him was doing exactly as her mother had done the young man might be stamped out he might be made to vanish as that other young man had vanished but the fact that he had been there cherished in the girls heartthat could not be stamped out  he struggled gallantly to acquit the memory of his wife he could best do that by leaning with the full weight of his mind on the presumed iniquity of mrs finn had he not known from the first that the woman was an adventuress and had he not declared to himself over and over again that between such a one and himself there should be no intercourse no common feeling he had allowed himself to be talked into an intimacy to be talked almost into an affection and this was the result  and how should he treat this matter in his coming interview with his sonor should he make an allusion to it at first it seemed as though it would be impossible for him to give his mind to that other subject how could he enforce the merits of political liberalism and the duty of adhering to the old family party while his mind was entirely preoccupied with his daughter it had suddenly become almost indifferent to him whether silverbridge should be a conservative or a liberal but as he dressed he told himself that as a man he ought to be able to do a plain duty marked out for him as this had been by his own judgment without regard to personal suffering the hedger and ditcher must make his hedge and clean his ditch even though he be tormented by rheumatism his duty by his son he must do even though his heart were torn to pieces  during breakfast he tried to be gracious and condescended to ask his son a question about prime minister racing was an amusement to which english noblemen had been addicted for many ages and had been held to be serviceable rather than disgraceful if conducted in a noble fashion he did not credit tifto with much nobility he knew but little about the major he would much have preferred that his son should have owned a horse alone if he must have anything to do with ownership would it not be better to buy the other share asked the duke  it would take a deal of money sir the major would ask a couple of thousand i should think  that is a great deal  and then the major is a very useful man he thoroughly understands the turf  i hope he doesnt live by it  oh no he doesnt live by it that is he has a great many irons in the fire  i do not mind a young man owning a horse if he can afford the expenseas you perhaps can do but i hope you dont bet  nothing to speak of  nothing to speak of is so apt to grow into that which has to be spoken of so much the father said at breakfast hardly giving his mind to the matter discussedhis mind being on other things but when their breakfast was eaten then it was necessary that he should begin silverbridge he said i hope you have thought better of what we were talking about as to these coming elections  well sirof course i have thought about it  and you can do as i would have you  you see sir a mans political opinion is a kind of thing he cant get rid of  you can hardly as yet have any very confirmed political opinion you are still young and i do not suppose that you have thought much about politics  well sir i think i have ive got my own ideas weve got to protect our position as well as we can against the radicals and communists  i cannot admit that at all silverbridge there is no great political party in this country anxious either for communism or for revolution but putting all that aside for the present do you think that a mans political opinions should be held in regard to his own individual interests or to the much wider interests of others whom we call the public  to his own interest said the young man with decision  it is simply selfprotection then  his own and his class the people will look after themselves and we must look after ourselves we are so few and they are so many that we shall have quite enough to do  then the duke gave his son a somewhat lengthy political lecture which was intended to teach him that the greatest benefit of the greatest number was the object to which all political studies should tend the son listened to it with attention and when it was over expressed his opinion that there was a great deal in what his father had said i trust if you will consider it said the duke that you will not find yourself obliged to desert the school of politics in which your father has not been an inactive supporter and to which your family has belonged for many generations  i could not call myself a liberal said the young politician  why not  because i am a conservative  and you wont stand for the county on the liberal interest  i should be obliged to tell them that i should always give a conservative vote  then you refuse to do what i ask  i do not know how i can help refusing if you wanted me to grow a couple of inches taller i couldnt do it even though i should be ever so anxious to oblige you  but a very young man as you are may have so much deference for his elders as to be induced to believe that he has been in error  oh yes of course  you cannot but be aware that the political condition of the country is the one subject to which i have devoted the labour of my life  i know that very well and of course i know how much they all think of you  then my opinion might go for something with you  so it does sir i shouldnt have doubted at all only for that little still you see as the thing ishow am i to help myself  you believe that you must be rightyou who have never given an hours study to the subject  no sir in comparison with a great many men i know that i am a fool perhaps it is because i know that that i am a conservative the radicals are always saying that a conservative must be a fool then a fool ought to be a conservative  hereupon the father got up from his chair and turned round facing the fire with his back to his son he was becoming very angry but endeavoured to restrain his anger the matter in dispute between them was of so great importance that he could hardly be justified in abandoning it in consequence of arguments so trifling in themselves as these which his son adduced as he stood there for some minutes thinking of it all he was tempted again and again to burst out in wrath and threaten the ladto threaten him as to money as to his amusements as to the general tenure of his life the pity was so great that the lad should be so stubborn and so foolish he would never ask his son to be a slave to the liberal party as he had been but that a palliser should not be a liberaland his son as the first recreant palliserwas wormwood to him as he stood there he more than once clenched his fist in eager desire to turn upon the young man but he restrained himself telling himself that in justice he should not be angry for such offence as this to become a conservative when the path to liberalism was so fairly open might be the part of a fool but could not fairly be imputed as a crime to endeavour to be just was the study of his life and in no condition of life can justice be more imperatively due than from a father to his son  you mean to stand for silverbridge he said at last  not if you object sir  this made it worse it became now still more difficult for him to scold the young man  you are aware that i should not meddle in any way  that was what i supposed they will return a conservative at any rate  it is not that i care about said the duke sadly  upon my word sir i am very sorry to vex you but what would you have me do i will give up parliament altogether if you say that you wish it  no i do not wish that  you wouldnt have me tell a lie  no  what can i do then  learn what there is to learn from some master fit to teach you  there are so many masters  i believe it to be that most arrogant illbehaved young man who was with me yesterday who has done this evil  you mean frank tregear  i do mean mr tregear  hes a conservative of course and of course he and i have been much together was he with you yesterday sir  yes he was  what was that about asked lord silverbridge in a voice that almost betrayed fear for he knew very well what cause had produced the interview  he has been speaking to me when the duke had got so far as this he paused finding himself to be hardly able to declare the disgrace which had fallen upon himself and his family as he did tell the story both his face and his voice were altered so that the son in truth was scared he has been speaking to me about your sister did you know of this  i knew there was something between them  and you encouraged it  no sir just the contrary i have told him that i was quite sure it would never do  and why did you not tell me  well sir that was hardly my business was it  not to guard the honour of your sister  you see sir how many things have happened all at once  what things  my dear mother sir thought well of him the duke uttered a deep sigh and turned again round to the fire i always told him that you would never consent  i should think not  it has come so suddenly i should have spoken to you about it as soon asas soon as he had meant to say as soon as the husbands grief for the loss of his wife had been in some degree appeased but he could not speak the words the duke however perfectly understood him in the meantime they were not seeing each other  nor writing  i think not  mrs finn has known it all  mrs finn  certainly she has known it all through  i do not see how it can have been so  he told me so himself said the duke unwittingly putting words into tregears mouth which tregear had never uttered there must be an end of this i will speak to your sister in the meantime the less i think you see of mr tregear the better of course it is out of the question he should be allowed to remain in this house you will make him understand that at once if you please  oh certainly said silverbridge     chapter viii  he is a gentleman   the duke returned to matching an almost brokenhearted man he had intended to go down into barsetshire in reference to the coming electionsnot with the view of interfering in any unlordly or rather unpeerlike fashion but thinking that if his eldest son were to stand for the county in a proper constitutional spirit as the eldest son of so great a county magnate ought to do his presence at gatherum castle among his own people might probably be serviceable and would certainly be gracious there would be no question of entertainment his bereavement would make that impossible but there would come from his presence a certain savour of proprietorship and a sense of power which would be beneficial to his son and would not as the duke thought be contrary to the spirit of the constitution but all this was now at an end he told himself that he did not care how the elections might gothat he did not care much how anything might go silverbridge might stand for silverbridge if he so pleased he would give neither assistance nor obstruction either in the county or in the borough he wrote to this effect to his agent mr mortonbut at the same time desired that gentleman to pay lord silverbridges electioneering expenses feeling it to be his duty as a father to do so much for his son  but though he endeavoured to engage his thoughts in these parliamentary matters though he tried to make himself believe that this political apostasy was the trouble which vexed him in truth that other misery was so crushing as to make the affairs of his son insignificant how should he express himself to her that was the thought present to his mind as he went down to matching should he content himself with simply telling her that such a wish on her part was disgraceful and that it could never be fulfilled or should he argue the matter with her endeavouring as he did so to persuade her gently that she was wrong to place her affections so low and so to obtain from her an assurance that the idea should be abandoned  the latter course would be infinitely the betterif only he could accomplish it but he was conscious of his own hardness of manner and was aware that he had never succeeded in establishing confidence between himself and his daughter it was a thing for which he had longedas a plain girl might long to possess the charms of an acknowledged beautyas a poor little fellow five feet in height might long to have a cubit added to his stature  though he was angry with her how willingly would he take her into his arms and assure her of his forgiveness how anxious he would be to make her understand that nothing should be spared by him to add beauty and grace to her life only as a matter of course mr tregear must be abandoned but he knew of himself that he would not know how to begin to be tender and forgiving he knew that he would not know how not to be stern and hard  but he must find out the history of it all no doubt the man had been his sons friend and had joined his party in italy at his sons instance but yet he had come to entertain an idea that mrs finn had been the great promoter of the sin and he thought that tregear had told him that that lady had been concerned with the matter from the beginning in all this there was a craving in his heart to lessen the amount of culpable responsibility which might seem to attach itself to the wife he had lost  he reached matching about eight and ordered his dinner to be brought to him in his own study when lady mary came to welcome him he kissed her forehead and bade her come to him after his dinner shall i not sit with you papa whilst you are eating it she asked but he merely told her that he would not trouble her to do that even in saying this he was so unusually tender to her that she assured herself that her lover had not as yet told his tale  the dukes meals were not generally feasts for a lucullus no man living perhaps cared less what he ate or knew less what he drank in such matters he took what was provided for him making his dinner off the first bit of meat that was brought and simply ignoring anything offered to him afterwards and he would drink what wine the servant gave him mixing it whatever it might be with seltzer water he had never been much given to the pleasures of the table but this habit of simplicity had grown on him of late till the duchess used to tell him that his wants were so few that it was a pity he was not a hermit vowed to poverty  very shortly a message was brought to lady mary saying that her father wished to see her she went at once and found him seated on a sofa which stood close along the bookshelves on one side of the room the table had already been cleared and he was alone he not only was alone but had not even a pamphlet or newspaper in his hand  then she knew that tregear must have told the story as this occurred to her her legs almost gave way under her come and sit down mary he said pointing to the seat on the sofa beside himself  she sat down and took one of his hands within her own then as he did not begin at once she asked a question will silverbridge stand for the county papa  no my dear  but for the town  yes my dear  and he wont be a liberal  i am afraid not it is a cause of great unhappiness to me but i do not know that i should be justified in any absolute opposition a man is entitled to his own opinion even though he be a very young man  i am so sorry that it should be so papa because it vexes you  i have many things to vex methings to break my heart  poor mamma she exclaimed  yes that above all others but life and death are in gods hands and even though we may complain we can alter nothing but whatever our sorrows are while we are here we must do our duty  i suppose he may be a good member of parliament though he has turned conservative  i am not thinking about your brother i am thinking about you the poor girl gave a little start on the sofa do you knowmr tregear he added  yes papa of course i know him you used to see him in italy  i believe i did i understand that he was there as a friend of silverbridge  his most intimate friend papa  i dare say he came to me in london yesterday and told me oh mary can it be true  yes papa she said covered up to her forehead with blushes and with her eyes turned down in the ordinary affairs of life she was a girl of great courage who was not given to be shaken from her constancy by the pressure of any present difficulty but now the terror inspired by her fathers voice almost overpowered her  do you mean to tell me that you have engaged yourself to that young man without my approval  of course you were to have been asked papa  is that in accordance with your idea of what should be the conduct of a young lady in your position  nobody meant to conceal anything from you papa  it has been so far concealed and yet this young man has the selfconfidence to come to me and to demand your hand as though it were a matter of course that i should accede to so trivial a request it is as a matter of course quite impossible you understand that do you not when she did not answer him at once he repeated the question i ask you whether you do not feel that it is altogether impossible  no papa she said in the lowest possible whisper but still in such a whisper that he could hear the word and with so much clearness that he could judge from her voice of the obstinacy of her mind  then mary it becomes my duty to tell you that it is quite impossible i will not have it thought of there must be an end of it  why papa  why i am astonished that you should ask me why  i should not have allowed him papa to go to you unless i hadunless i had loved him  then you must conquer your love it is disgraceful and must be conquered  disgraceful  yes i am sorry to use such a word to my own child but it is so if you will promise to be guided by me in this matter if you will undertake not to see him any more i willif not forget itat any rate pardon it and be silent i will excuse it because you were young and were thrown imprudently in his way there has i believe been someone at work in the matter with whom i ought to be more angry than with you say that you will obey me and there is nothing within a fathers power that i will not do for you to make your life happy it was thus that he strove not to be stern his heart indeed was tender enough but there was nothing tender in the tone of his voice or in the glance of his eye though he was very positive in what he said yet he was shy and shamefaced even with his own daughter he too had blushed when he told her that she must conquer her love  that she should be told that she had disgraced herself was terrible to her that her father should speak of her marriage with this man as an event that was impossible made her very unhappy that he should talk of pardoning her as for some great fault was in itself a misery but she had not on that account the least idea of giving up her lover young as she was she had her own peculiar theory on that matter her own code of conduct and honour from which she did not mean to be driven of course she had not expected that her father would yield at the first word he no doubt would wish that she should make a more exalted marriage she had known that she would have to encounter opposition though she had not expected to be told that she had disgraced herself as she sat there she resolved that under no pretence would she give up her loverbut she was so far abashed that she could not find words to express herself he too had been silent for a few moments before he again asked her for her promise  will you tell me mary that you will not see him again  i dont think that i can say that papa  why not  oh papa how can i when of all the people in the world i love him the best  it is not without a pang that any one can be told that she who is of all the dearest has some other one who to her is the dearest such pain fathers and mothers have to bear and though i think the arrow is never so blunted but that it leaves something of a wound behind there is in most cases if not a perfect salve still an ample consolation the mother knows that it is good that her child should love some man better than all the world beside and that she should be taken away to become a wife and a mother and the father when that delight of his eyes ceases to assure him that he is her nearest and dearest though he abandon the treasure of that nearestness and dearestness with a soft melancholy still knows that it is as it should be of course that other him is the person she loves the best in the world were it not so how evil a thing it would be that she should marry him were it not so with reference to some him how void would her life be but now to the poor duke the wound had no salve no consolation when he was told that this young tregear was the owner of his girls sweet love was the treasure of her heart he shrank as though arrows with sharp points were pricking him all over i will not hear of such love he said  what am i to say papa  say that you will obey me  then she sat silent do you not know that he is not fit to be your husband  no papa  then you cannot have thought much either of your position or of mine  he is a gentleman papa  so is my private secretary there is not a clerk in one of our public offices who does not consider himself to be a gentleman the curate of the parish is a gentleman and the medical man who comes here from bradstock the word is too vague to carry with it any meaning that ought to be serviceable to you in thinking of such a matter  i do not know any other way of dividing people said she showing thereby that she had altogether made up her mind as to what ought to be serviceable to her  you are not called upon to divide people that division requires so much experience that you are bound in this matter to rely upon those to whom your obedience is due i cannot but think you must have known that you were not entitled to give your love to any man without being assured that the man would be approved of bybyby me he was going to say your parents but was stopped by the remembrance of his wifes imprudence  she saw it all and was too noble to plead her mothers authority but she was not too dutiful to cast a reproach upon him when he was so stern to her you have been so little with me papa  that is true he said after a pause that is true it has been a fault and i will mend it it is a reason for forgiveness and i will forgive you but you must tell me that there shall be an end to this  no papa  what do you mean  that as i love mr tregear and as i have told him so and as i have promised him i will be true to him i cannot let there be an end to it  you do not suppose that you will be allowed to see him again  i hope so  most assuredly not do you write to him  no papa  never  never since we have been back in england  you must promise me that you will not write  she paused a moment before she answered him and now she was looking him full in the face i shall not write to him i do not think i shall write to him but i will not promise  not promise meyour father  no papa it might be thatthat i should do it  you would not wish me so to guard you that you should have no power of sending a letter but by permission  i should not like that  but it will have to be so  if i do write i will tell you  and show me what you write  no papa not that but i will tell you what i have written  then it occurred to him that this bargaining was altogether derogatory to his parental authority and by no means likely to impress upon her mind the conviction that tregear must be completely banished from her thoughts he began already to find how difficult it would be for him to have the charge of such a daughterhow impossible that he should conduct such a charge with sufficient firmness and yet with sufficient tenderness at present he had done no good he had only been made more wretched than ever by her obstinacy surely he must pass her over to the charge of some ladybut of some lady who would be as determined as was he himself that she should not throw herself away by marrying mr tregear  there shall be no writing he said no visiting no communication of any kind as you refuse to obey me now you had better go to your room     chapter ix  in medias res   perhaps the method of rushing at once in medias res is of all the ways of beginning a story or a separate branch of a story the least objectionable the reader is made to think that the gold lies so near the surface that he will be required to take very little trouble in digging for it and the writer is enabledat any rate for a time and till his neck has become as it were warm to the collarto throw off from him the difficulties and dangers the tedium and prolixity of description this rushing in medias res has doubtless the charm of ease certainly when i threw her from the garret window to the stony pavement below i did not anticipate that she would fall so far without injury to life or limb when a story has been begun after this fashion without any prelude without description of the garret or of the pavement or of the lady thrown or of the speaker a great amount of trouble seems to have been saved the mind of the reader fills up the blanksif erroneously still satisfactorily he knows at least that the heroine has encountered a terrible danger and has escaped from it with almost incredible good fortune that the demon of the piece is a bold demon not ashamed to speak of his own iniquity and that the heroine and the demon are so far united that they have been in a garret together but there is the drawback on the systemthat it is almost impossible to avoid the necessity of doing sooner or later that which would naturally be done at first it answers perhaps for halfadozen chaptersand to carry the reader pleasantly for halfadozen chapters is a great matterbut after that a certain nebulous darkness gradually seems to envelope the characters and the incidents is all this going on in the country or is it in townor perhaps in the colonies how old was she was she tall is she fair is she heroinelike in her form and gait and after all how high was the garret window i have always found that the details would insist on being told at last and that by rushing in medias res i was simply presenting the cart before the horse but as readers like the cart the best i will do it once againtrying it only for a branch of my storyand will endeavour to let as little as possible of the horse be seen afterwards  and so poor frank has been turned out of heaven said lady mabel grex to young lord silverbridge  who told you that i have said nothing about it to anybody  of course he told me himself said the young beauty i am aware that in the word beauty and perhaps also in the word young a little bit of the horse is appearing and i am already sure that i shall have to show his head and neck even if not his very tail poor frank did you hear it all  i heard nothing lady mab and know nothing  you know that your awful governor wont let him stay any longer in carlton terrace  yes i know that  and why not  would lord grex allow percival to have his friends living here earl grex was lady mabels father lord percival was the earls sonand the earl lived in belgrave square all these are little bits of the horse  certainly not in the first place i am here  that makes a difference certainly  of course it makes a difference they would be wanting to make love to me  no doubt i should i know  and therefore it wouldnt do for you to live here and then papa is living here himself and then the permission never has been given i suppose frank did not go there at first without the duke knowing it  i daresay that i had mentioned it  you might as well tell me all about it we are cousins you know frank tregear through his mothers family was second cousin to lady mabel as was also lord silverbridge one of the grexes having at some remote period married a palliser this is another bit of the horse  the governor merely seemed to think that he would like to have his own house to himselflike other people what an ass tregear was to say anything to you about it  i dont think he was an ass at all of course he had to tell us that he was changing his residence he says that he is going to take a back bedroom somewhere near the seven dials  he has got very nice rooms in duke street  have you seen him then  of course i have  poor fellow i wish he had a little money he is so nice and now lord silverbridge do you mean to say that there is not something in the wind about lady mary  if there were i should not talk about it said lord silverbridge  you are a very innocent young gentleman  and you are a very interesting young lady  you ought to think me so for i interest myself very much about you was the duke very angry about your not standing for the county  he was vexed  i do think it is so odd that a man should be expected to be this or that in politics because his father happened to be so before him i dont understand how he should expect that you should remain with a party so utterly snobbish and down in the world as the radicals everybody that is worth anything is leaving them  he has not left them  no i dont suppose he could but you have  i never belonged to them lady mab  and never will i hope i always told papa that you would certainly be one of us all this took place in the drawingroom of lord grexs house there was no lady grex alive but there lived with the earl a certain elderly lady reported to be in some distant way a cousin of the family named miss cassewary who in the matter of looking after lady mab did what was supposed to be absolutely necessary she now entered the room with her bonnet on having just returned from church what was the text asked lady mab at once  if you had gone to church as you ought to have done my dear you would have heard it  but as i didnt  i dont think the text alone will do you any good  and probably you forget it  no i dont my dear how do you do lord silverbridge  he is a conservative miss cass  of course he is i am quite sure that a young nobleman of so much taste and intellect would take the better side  you forget that all you are saying is against my father and my family miss cassewary  i dare say it was different when your father was a young man and your father too was not very long since at the head of a government which contained many conservatives i dont look upon your father as a radical though perhaps i should not be justified in calling him a conservative  well certainly not i think  but now it is necessary that all noblemen in england should rally to the defence of their order miss cassewary was a great politician and was one of those who are always foreseeing the ruin of their country my dear i will go and take my bonnet off perhaps you will have tea when i come down  dont you go said lady mabel when silverbridge got up to take his departure  i always do when tea comes  but you are going to dine here  not that i know of in the first place nobody has asked me in the second place i am engaged thirdly i dont care about having to talk politics to miss cass and fourthly i hate family dinners on sunday  in the first place i ask you secondly i know you were going to dine with frank tregear at the club thirdly i want you to talk to me and not to miss cass and fourthly you are an uncivil youngyoungyoungi should say cub if i dared to tell me that you dont like dining with me any day of the week  of course you know what i mean is that i dont like troubling your father  leave that to me i shall tell him you are coming and frank too of course you can bring him then he can talk to me when papa goes down to his club and you can arrange your politics with miss cass so it was settled and at eight oclock lord silverbridge reappeared in belgrave square with frank tregear  earl grex was a nobleman of very ancient family the grexes having held the parish of grex in yorkshire from some time long prior to the conquest in saying all this i am i know allowing the horse to appear wholesalebut i find that he cannot be kept out i may as well go on to say that the present earl was better known at newmarket and the beaufortwhere he spent a large part of his life in playing whistthan in the house of lords he was a greyhaired handsome wornout old man who through a long life of pleasure had greatly impaired a fortune which for an earl had never been magnificent and who now strove hard but not always successfully to remedy that evil by gambling as he could no longer eat and drink as he had used to do and as he cared no longer for the light that lies in a ladys eye there was not much left to him in the world but cards and racing nevertheless he was a handsome old man of polished manners when he chose to use them a staunch conservative and much regarded by his party for whom in his early life he had done some work in the house of commons  silverbridge is all very well he had said but i dont see why that young tregear is to dine here every night of his life  this is the second time since he has been up in town papa  he was here last week i know  silverbridge wouldnt come without him  thats d nonsense said the earl miss cassewary gave a startnot we may presume because she was shocked for she could not be much shocked having heard the same word from the same lips very often but she thought it right always to enter a protest then the two young men were announced  frank tregear having been known by the family as a boy was frank to all of themas was lady mabel mabel to him somewhat to the disgust of the father and not altogether with the approbation of miss cass but lady mabel had declared that she would not be guilty of the folly of changing old habits silverbridge being silverbridge to all his own people hardly seemed to have a christian namehis godfathers and godmothers had indeed called him plantagenetbut having only become acquainted with the family since his oxford days he was lord silverbridge to lady mabel lady mabel had not as yet become mabel to him but as by her very intimate friends she was called mab had allowed herself to be addressed by him as lady mab there was thus between them all considerable intimacy  im deuced glad to hear it said the earl when dinner was announced for though he could not eat much lord grex was always impatient when the time of eating was at hand then he walked down alone lord silverbridge followed with his daughter and frank tregear gave his arm to miss cassewary if that woman cant clear her soup better than that she might as well go to the d said the earlupon which remark no one in the company made any observation as there were two menservants in the room when it was made the cook probably had the advantage of it it may be almost unnecessary to add that though the earl had polished manners for certain occasions he would sometimes throw them off in the bosom of his own family  my lord said miss cassewaryshe always called him my lordlord silverbridge is going to stand for the dukes borough in the conservative interest  i didnt know the duke had a borough said the earl  he had one till he thought it proper to give it up said the son taking his fathers part  and you are going to pay him off for what he has done by standing against him its just the sort of thing for a son to do in these days if i had a borough percival would go down and make radical speeches there  there isnt a better conservative in england than percival said lady mabel bridling up  nor a worse son said the father i believe he would do anything he could lay his hand on to oppose me during the past week there had been some little difference of opinion between the father and the son as to the signing of a deed  my father does not take it in bad part at all said silverbridge  perhaps hes ratting himself said the earl when a man lends himself to a coalition he is as good as half gone  i do not think that in all england there is so thorough a liberal as my father said lord silverbridge and when i say that he doesnt take this badly i dont mean that it doesnt vex him i know it vexes him but he doesnt quarrel with me he even wrote down to barsetshire to say that all my expenses at silverbridge were to be paid  i call that very bad politics said the earl  it seems to me to be very grand said frank  perhaps sir you dont know what is good or what is bad in politics said the earl trying to snub his guest  but it was difficult to snub frank i know a gentleman when i see him i think he said of course silverbridge is right to be a conservative nobody has a stronger opinion about that than i have but the duke is behaving so well that if i were he i should almost regret it  and so i do said silverbridge  when the ladies were gone the old earl turned himself round to the fire having filled his glass and pushed the bottles away from him as though he meant to leave the two young men to themselves he sat leaning with his head on his hand looking the picture of woe it was now only nine oclock and there would be no whist at the beaufort till eleven there was still more than an hour to be endured before the brougham would come to fetch him i suppose we shall have a majority said frank trying to rouse him  who does we mean asked the earl  the conservatives of whom i take the liberty to call myself one  it sounded as though you were a very influential member of the party  i consider myself to be one of the party and so i say we  upstairs in the drawingroom miss cassewary did her duty loyally it was quite right that young ladies and young gentlemen should be allowed to talk together and very right indeed that such a young gentleman as lord silverbridge should be allowed to talk to such a young lady as lady mabel what could be so nice as a marriage between the heir of the house of omnium and lady mabel grex lady mabel looked indeed to be the elderbut they were in truth the same age all the world acknowledged that lady mabel was very clever and very beautiful and fit to be a duchess even the earl when miss cassewary hinted at the matter to him grunted an assent lady mabel had already refused one or two not ineligible offers and it was necessary that something should be done there had been at one time a fear in miss cassewarys bosom lest her charge should fall too deeply in love with frank tregearbut miss cassewary knew that whatever danger there might have been in that respect had passed away frank was willing to talk to her while mabel and lord silverbridge were in a corner together  i shall be on tenterhooks now till i know how it is to be at silverbridge said the young lady  it is very good of you to feel so much interest  of course i feel an interest are not you one of us when is it to be  they say that the elections will be over before the derby  and which do you care for the most  i should like to pull off the derby i own  from what papa says i should think the other event is the more probable  doesnt the earl stand to win on prime minister  i never know anything about his betting butyou know his wayhe said you were going to drop a lot of money like a i cant quite tell you what he likened you to  the earl may be mistaken  you are not betting much i hope  not plunging but i have a little money on  dont get into a way of betting  whywhat difference does it maketo you  is that kind lord silverbridge  i meant to say that if i did make a mess of it you wouldnt care about it  yes i should i should care very much i dare say you could lose a great deal of money and care nothing about it  indeed i could not  what would be a great deal of money to me but you would want to get it back again and in that way you would be regularly on the turf  and why not  i want to see better things from you  you ought not to preach against the turf lady mab  because of papa but i am not preaching against the turf if i were such as you are i would have a horse or two myself a man in your position should do a little of everything you should hunt and have a yacht and stalk deer and keep your own trainer at newmarket  i wish youd say all that to my father  of course i mean if you can afford it i like a man to like pleasure but i despise a man who makes a business of his pleasures when i hear that this man is the best whistplayer in london and that man the best billiardplayer i always know that they can do nothing else and then i despise them  you neednt despise me because i do nothing well said he as he got up to take his leave  i do so hope youll get the seatand win the derby  these were her last words to him as she wished him goodnight     chapter x  why not like romeo if i feel like romeo   thats nonsense miss cass and i shall said lady mabel they were together on the morning after the little dinnerparty described in the last chapter in a small back sittingroom which was supposed to be lady mabels own and the servant had just announced the fact that mr tregear was below  then i shall go down too said miss cassewary  youll do nothing of the kind will you please to tell me what it is you are afraid of do you think that frank is going to make love to me again  no  or that if i chose that he should i would let you stop me he is in love with somebody elseand perhaps i am too and we are two paupers  my lord would not approve of it  if you know what my lord approves of and what he disapproves you understand him a great deal better than i do and if you mind what he approves or disapproves you care for his opinion a great deal more than i do my cousin is here now to talk to meabout his own affairs and i mean to see himalone then she left the little room and went down to that in which frank was waiting for her without the company of miss cassewary  do you really mean she said after they had been together for some minutes that you had the courage to ask the duke for his daughters hand  why not  i believe you would dare do anything  i couldnt very well take it without asking him  as i am not acquainted with the young lady i dont know how that might be  and if i took her so i should have to take her emptyhanded  which wouldnt suitwould it  it wouldnt suit for herwhose comforts and happiness are much more to me than my own  no doubt of course you are terribly in love  very thoroughly in love i think i am  for the tenth time i should say  for the second only i dont regard myself as a monument of constancy but i think i am less fickle than some other people  meaning me  not especially  frank that is illnatured and almost unmanlyand false also when have i been fickle you say that there was one before with you i say that there has never really been one with me at all no one knows that better than yourself i cannot afford to be in love till i am quite sure that the man is fit to be and will be my husband  i doubt sometimes whether you are capable of being in love with any one  i think i am she said very gently but i am at any rate capable of not being in love till i wish it come frank do not quarrel with me you knowyou ought to knowthat i should have loved you had it not been that such love would have been bad for both of us  it is a kind of selfrestraint i do not understand  because you are not a woman  why did you twit me with changing my love  because i am a woman cant you forgive as much as that to me  certainly only you must not think that i have been false because i now love her so dearly  i do not think you are false i would do anything to help you if there were anything i could do but when you spoke so like a romeo of your love  why not like a romeo if i feel like a romeo  but i doubt whether romeo talked much to rosaline of his love for juliet but you shall talk to me of yours for lady mary and i will listen to you patiently and encourage you and will not even think of those former vows  the former vows were foolish  ohof course  you at least used to say so  i say so now and they shall be as though they had been never spoken so you bearded the duke in his den and asked him for lady marys handjust as though you had been a young duke yourself and owned half a county  just the same  and what did he say  he swore that it was impossibleof course i knew all that before  how will it be now you will not give it up  certainly not  and lady mary  one human being can perhaps never answer for another with perfect security  but you feel sure of her  i do  he i should think can be very imperious  and so can she the pallisers are all obstinate  is silverbridge obstinate she asked  stiffnecked as a bull if he takes it into his head to be so  i shouldnt have thought it  nobecause he is so soft in his manner and often finds it easier to be led by others than to direct himself  then she remained silent for a few seconds they were both thinking of the same thing and both wishing to speak of it but the words came to her first i wonder what he thinks of me whereupon tregear only smiled i suppose he has spoken to you about me  why do you ask  why  and why should i tell you suppose he should have said to me in the confidence of friendship that he thinks you ugly and stupid  i am sure he has not said that he has eyes to see and ears to hear but though i am neither ugly nor stupid he neednt like me  do you want him to like you  yes i do oh yes you may laugh but if i did not think that i could be a good wife to him i would not take his hand even to become duchess of omnium  do you mean that you love him mabel  no i do not mean that but i would learn to love him you do not believe that here he smiled again and shook his head it is as i said before because you are not a woman and do not understand how women are trammelled do you think ill of me because i say this  no indeed  do not think ill of me if you can help it because you are almost the only friend that i can trust i almost trust dear old cass but not quite she is oldfashioned and i shock her as for other women there isnt one anywhere to whom i would say a word only think how a girl such as i am is placed or indeed any girl you if you see a woman that you fancy can pursue her can win her and triumph or lose her and gnaw your heartat any rate you can do something you can tell her that you love her can tell her so again and again even though she should scorn you you can set yourself about the business you have taken in hand and can work hard at it what can a girl do  girls work hard too sometimes  of course they dobut everybody feels that they are sinning against their sex of love such as a mans is a woman ought to know nothing how can she love with passion when she should never give her love till it has been asked and not then unless her friends tell her that the thing is suitable love such as that to me is out of the question but as it is fit that i should be married i wish to be married well  and you will love him after a fashion  yesafter a very sterling fashion i will make his wishes my wishes his ways my ways his party my party his home my home his ambition my ambitionhis honour my honour as she said this she stood up with her hands clenched and head erect and her eyes flashing do you not know me well enough to be sure that i should be loyal to him  yesi think that you would be loyal  whether i loved him or not he should love me  and you think that silverbridge would do  yes i think that silverbridge would do you no doubt will say that i am flying high  not too high why should you not fly high if i can justify myself surely i cannot accuse you  it is hardly the same thing frank of course there is not a girl in london to whom lord silverbridge would not be the best match that she could make he has the choice of us all  most girls would think twice before refusing him  very few would think twice before accepting him perhaps he wishes to add to his wealth by marrying richlyas his father did  no thought on that subject will ever trouble him that will be all as it happens as soon as he takes a sufficient fancy to a girl he will ask her straight off i do not say that he might not change afterwards but he would mean it at the time  if he had once said the word to me he should not change but then what right have i to expect it what has he ever said about me  very little but had he said much i should not tell you  you are my friendbut you are his too and he perhaps is more to you than i am as his friend it may be your duty to tell him all that i am saying if so i have been wrong  do you think that i shall do that mabel  i do not know men are so strong in their friendships  mine with you is the older and the sweeter though we may not be more than friends i will say that it is the more tender in my heart of hearts i do not think that silverbridge could do better  thanks for that frank  i shall tell him nothing of you that can set him against you  and you would be glad to see me his wife she said  as you must be somebodys wife and not mine  i cannot be yours frank can i  and not mine he repeated i will endeavour to be glad who can explain his feelings in such a matter though i most truly love the girl i hope to marry yet my heart goes back to former things and opens itself to past regrets  i know it all she whispered  but you and i must be too wise to permit ourselves to be tormented by such foolish melancholy as he said this he took her hand half with the purpose of bidding her goodbye but partly with the idea of giving some expression to the tenderness of his feelings but as he did so the door was opened and the old earl shambled into the room  what the deuce are you doing here he said  i have been talking to lady mabel  for about an hour  indeed i do not know for how long  papa he is going to be married when she said this frank tregear turned round and looked at her almost in anger  going to be married is he who is the fortunate woman  i dont think he will let me tell you  not yet i think said frank gloomily there is nothing settled  the old earl looked puzzled but lady mabels craft had been successful if this objectionable young secondcousin had come there to talk about his marriage with another young woman the conversation must have been innocent where is miss cassewary asked the earl  i asked her not to come down with me because frank wished to speak to me about his own affairs you have no objection to his coming papa  there had been objections raised to any intimacy with frank tregear but all that was now nearly two years since he had been assured over and over again by miss cassewary that he need not be afraid of frank tregear and had in a sort of way assented to the young mans visits i think he might find something better to do with his time than hanging about here all day frank shrugging his shoulders and having shaken hands both with the daughter and father took his hat and departed who is the girl asked the earl  you heard him say that i was not to tell  has she got money  i believe she will have a great deal  then she is a great fool for her pains said the earl shambling off again  lady mabel spent the greater part of the afternoon alone endeavouring to recall to her mind all that she had said to frank tregear and questioning herself as to the wisdom and truth of her own words she had intended to tell the truthbut hardly perhaps the whole truth the life which was before herwhich it was necessary that she should leadseemed to her to be so difficult she could not clearly see her way to be pure and good and feminine and at the same time wise she had been false nowso far false that she had told her friend that she had never been in love but she was in lovein love with him frank tregear she knew it as thoroughly as it was possible for her to know anythingand had acknowledged it to herself a score of times  but she could not marry him and it was expected nay almost necessary that she should marry someone to that someone how good she would be how she would strive by duty and attention and if possible by affection to make up for that misfortune of her early love  and so i hope that i have brought my cart in to its appointed place in the front without showing too much of the horse     chapter xi  cruel   for two or three days after the first scene between the duke and his daughterthat scene in which she was forbidden either to see or to write to her lovernot a word was said at matching about mr tregear nor were any steps taken towards curtailing her liberty of action she had said she would not write to him without telling her father and the duke was too proud of the honour of his family to believe it to be possible that she should deceive him nor was it possible not only would her own idea of duty prevent her from writing to her lover although she had stipulated for the right to do so in some possible emergencybut carried far beyond that in her sense of what was right and wrong she felt it now incumbent on her to have no secret from her father at all the secret as long as it had been a secret had been a legacy from her motherand had been kept at her lovers instance during that period of mourning for her mother in which it would she thought have been indecorous that there should be any question of love or of giving in marriage it had been a burden to her though a necessary burden she had been very clear that the revelation should be made to her father when it was made by her lover that had been doneand now it was open to her to live without any secrecyas was her nature she meant to cling to her lover she was quite sure of that nothing could divide her from him but his death or hersor falseness on his part but as to marriage that would not be possible till her father had assented and as to seeing the manah yes if she could do so with her fathers assent she would not be ashamed to own her great desire to see him she would tell her father that all her happiness depended upon seeing him she would not be coy in speaking of her love but she would obey her father  she had a strong idea that she would ultimately prevailan idea also that that ultimately should not be postponed to some undefined middleaged period of her life as she intended to belong to frank tregear she thought it expedient that he should have the best of her days as well as what might be supposed to be the worst and she therefore resolved that it would be her duty to make her father understand that though she would certainly obey him she would look to be treated humanely by him and not to be made miserable for an indefinite term of years  the first word spoken between them on the subjectthe first word after that discussionbegan with him and was caused by his feeling that her present life at matching must be sad and lonely lady cantrip had again written that she would be delighted to take herbut lady cantrip was in london and must be in london at any rate when parliament should again be sitting a london life would perhaps at present hardly suit lady mary then a plan had been prepared which might be convenient the duke had a house at richmond on the river called the horns that should be lent to lady cantrip and mary should there be her guest so it was settled between the duke and lady cantrip but as yet lady mary knew nothing of the arrangement  i think i shall go up to town tomorrow said the duke to his daughter  for long  i shall be gone only one night it is on your behalf that i am going  on my behalf papa  i have been writing to lady cantrip  not about mr tregear  nonot about mr tregear said the father with a mixture of anger and solemnity in his tone it is my desire to regard mr tregear as though he did not exist  that is not possible papa  i have alluded to the inconvenience of your position here  why is it inconvenient  you are too young to be without a companion it is not fit that you should be so much alone  i do not feel it  it is very melancholy for you and cannot be good for you they will go down to the horns so that you will not be absolutely in london and you will find lady cantrip a very nice person  i dont care for new people just now papa she said but to this he paid but little heed nor was she prepared to say that she would not do as he directed when therefore he left matching she understood that he was going to prepare a temporary home for her nothing further was said about tregear she was too proud to ask that no mention of his name should be made to lady cantrip and he when he left the house did not think that he would find himself called upon to allude to the subject  but when lady cantrip made some inquiry about the girl and her habitsasking what were her ordinary occupations how she was accustomed to pass her hours to what she chiefly devoted herselfthen at last with much difficulty the duke did bring himself to tell the story perhaps it is better you should know it all he said as he told it  poor girl yes duke upon the whole it is better that i should know it all said lady cantrip of course he will not come here  oh dear i hope not  nor to the horns  i hope he will never see her again anywhere said the duke  poor girl  have i not been right is it not best to put an end to such a thing at once  certainly at once if it has to be put an end toand can be put an end to  it must be put an end to said the duke very decidedly do you not see that it must be so who is mr tregear  i suppose they were allowed to be together  he was unfortunately intimate with silverbridge who took him over to italy he has nothing not even a profession lady cantrip could not but smile when she remembered the immense wealth of the man who was speaking to herand the duke saw the smile and understood it you will understand what i mean lady cantrip if this young man were in other respects suitable of course i could find an income for them but he is nothing just an idle seeker for pleasure without the means of obtaining it  that is very bad  as for rank continued the duke energetically i do not think that i am specially wedded to it i have found myself as willing to associate with those who are without it as with those who have it but for my child i would wish her to mate with one of her own class  it would be best  when a young man comes to me who though i believe him to be what is called a gentleman has neither rank nor means nor profession nor name and asks for my daughter surely i am right to say that such a marriage shall not be thought of was i not right demanded the duke persistently  but it is a pity that it should be so it is a pity that they should ever have come together  it is indeed indeed to be lamentedand i will own at once that the fault was not hers though i must be firm in this you are not to suppose that i am angry with her i have myself been to blame this he said with a resolution thatas he and his wife had been one fleshall faults committed by her should now that she was dead be accepted by him as his faults it had not occurred to me that as yet she would love any man  has it gone deep with her duke  i fear that all things go deep with her  poor girl  but they shall be kept apart as long as your great kindness is continued to her they shall be kept apart  i do not think that i should be found good at watching a young lady  she will require no watching  then of course they will not meet she had better know that you have told me  she shall know it  and let her know also that anything i can do to make her happy shall be done but duke there is but one cure  time you mean  yes time but i did not mean time then she smiled as she went on you must not suppose that i am speaking against my own sex if i say that she will not forget mr tregear till someone else has made himself agreeable to her we must wait till she can go out a little into society then she will find out that there are others in the world besides mr tregear it so often is the case that a girls love means her sympathy for him who has chanced to be nearest to her  the duke as he went away thought very much of what lady cantrip had said to himparticularly of those last words till some one else has made himself agreeable to her was he to send his girl into the world in order that she might find a lover there was something in the idea which was thoroughly distasteful to him he had not given his mind much to the matter but he felt that a woman should be sought forsought for and extracted cunningly as it were from some hidingplace and not sent out into a market to be exposed as for sale in his own personal history there had been a misfortunea misfortune the sense of which he could never at any moment have expressed to any ears the memory of which had been always buried in his own bosombut a misfortune in that no such cunning extraction on his part had won for him the woman to whose hands had been confided the strings of his heart his wife had undergone that process of extraction before he had seen her and his marriage with her had been a matter of sagacious bargaining he was now told that his daughter must be sent out among young men in order that she might become sufficiently fond of some special one to be regardless of tregear there was a feeling that in doing so she must lose something of the freshness of the bloom of her innocence how was this transfer of her love to be effected let her go here because she will meet the heir of this wealthy house who may probably be smitten by her charms or there because that other young lordling would make a fit husband for her let us contrive to throw her into the arms of this man or put her into the way of that man was his girl to be exposed to this surely that method of bargaining to which he had owed his own wife would be better than that let it be saidonly he himself most certainly could not be the person to say itlet it be said to some man of rank and means and fairly good character here is a wife for you with so many thousand pounds with beauty as you can see for yourself with rank and belongings of the highest very good in every respectonly that as regards her heart she thinks she has given it to a young man named tregear no marriage there is possible but perhaps the young lady might suit you it was thus he had been married there was an absence in it of that romance which though he had never experienced it in his own life was always present to his imagination his wife had often ridiculed him because he could only live among figures and official details but to her had not been given the power of looking into a mans heart and feeling all that was there yesin such bargaining for a wife in such bargaining for a husband there could be nothing of the tremulous delicacy of feminine romance but it would be better than standing at a stall in the market till the sufficient purchaser should come it never occurred to him that the delicacy the innocence the romance the bloom might all be preserved if he would give his girl to the man whom she said she loved could he have modelled her future course according to his own wishes he would have had her live a gentle life for the next three years with a pencil perhaps in her hand or a musicbook before herand then come forth cleaned as it were by such quarantine from the impurity to which she had been subjected  when he was back at matching he at once told his daughter what he had arranged for her and then there took place a prolonged discussion both as to his view of her future life and as to her own you did tell her then about mr tregear she asked  as she is to have charge of you for a time i thought it best  perhaps it is perhapsyou were afraid  no i was not afraid he said angrily  you need not be afraid i shall do nothing elsewhere that i would not do here and nothing anywhere without telling you  i know i can trust you  but papa i shall always intend to marry mr tregear  no he exclaimed  yesalways i want you to understand exactly how it is nothing you can do can separate me from him  mary that is very wicked  it cannot be wicked to tell the truth papa i mean to try to do all that you tell me i shall not see him or write to himunless there should be some very particular reason and if i did see him or write to him i would tell you and of course i should not think ofof marrying without your leave but i shall expect you to let me marry him  never  then i shall think you arecruel and you will break my heart  you should not call your father cruel  i hope you will not be cruel  i can never permit you to marry this man it would be altogether improper i cannot allow you to say that i am cruel because i do what i feel to be my duty you will see other people  a great many perhaps  and will learn tototo forget him  never i will not forget him i should hate myself if i thought it possible what would love be worth if it could be forgotten in that way as he heard this he reflected whether his own wife this girls mother had ever forgotten her early love for that burgo fitzgerald whom in her girlhood she had wished to marry  when he was leaving her she called him back again there is one other thing i think i ought to say papa if lady cantrip speaks to me about mr tregear i can only tell her what i have told you i shall never give him up when he heard this he turned angrily from her almost stamping his foot upon the ground when she quietly left the room  cruel she had told him that he would be cruel if he opposed her love he thought he knew of himself that he could not be crueleven to a fly even to a political opponent there could be no cruelty without dishonesty and did he not always struggle to be honest cruel to his own daughter     chapter xii  at richmond   the pity of it the pity of it it was thus that lady cantrip looked at it from what the girls father had said to her she was disposed to believe that the malady had gone deep with her all things go deep with her he had said and she too from other sources had heard something of this girl she was afraid that it would go deep it was a thousand pities then she asked herself whether the marriage ought to be regarded as impossible the duke had been very positivehad declared again and again that it was quite impossible had so expressed himself as to make her aware that he intended her to understand that he would not yield whatever the sufferings of the girl might be but lady cantrip knew the world well and was aware that in such matters daughters are apt to be stronger than their fathers he had declared tregear to be a young man with very small means and intent on such pleasures as require great means for their enjoyment no worse character could be given to a gentleman who had proposed himself as a soninlaw but lady cantrip thought it possible that the duke might be mistaken in this she had never seen mr tregear but she fancied that she had heard his name and that the name had been connected with a character different from that which the duke had given him  lady cantrip who at this time was a younglooking woman not much above forty had two daughters both of whom were married the younger about a year since had become the wife of lord nidderdale a middleaged young man who had been long about town a cousin of the late duchess the heir to a marquisate and a member of parliament the marriage had not been considered to be very brilliant but the husband was himself goodnatured and pleasant and lady cantrip was fond of him in the first place she went to him for information  oh yes i know him hes one of our set at the beargarden  not your set now i hope she said laughing  welli dont see so much of them as i used to do tregear is not a bad fellow at all hes always with silverbridge when silverbridge does what tregear tells him he goes along pretty straight but unfortunately theres another man called tifto and when tifto is in the ascendant then silverbridge is apt to get a little astray  hes not in debt then  whotregear i should think hes the last man in the world to owe a penny to any one  is he a betting man  oh dear no quite the other way up hes a severe sarcastic bookish sort of fellowa chap who knows everything and turns up his nose at people who know nothing  has he got anything of his own  not much i should say if he had had any money he would have married lady mab grex last year  lady cantrip was inclined from what she now learned to think that the duke must be wrong about the young man but before lady mary joined her she made further inquiry she too knew lady mabel and knowing lady mabel she knew miss cassewary she contrived to find herself alone with miss cassewary and asked some further questions about mr tregear he is a cousin of my lords said miss cass  so i thought i wonder what sort of a young man he is he is a good deal with lord silverbridge  then miss cassewary spoke her opinion very plainly if lord silverbridge had nobody worse about him than mr tregear he would not come to much harm  i suppose hes not very well off  nocertainly not he will have a property of some kind i believe when his mother dies i think very well of mr tregearonly i wish that he had a profession but why are you asking about him lady cantrip  nidderdale was talking to me about him and saying that he was so much with lord silverbridge lord silverbridge is going into parliament now and as it were beginning the world and it would be a thousand pities that he should get into bad hands it may however be doubted whether miss cassewary was hoodwinked by this little story  early in the second week in may the duke brought his daughter up to the horns and at the same time expressed his intention of remaining in london when he did so lady mary at once asked whether she might not be with himbut he would not permit it the house in london would he said be more gloomy even than matching  i am quite ashamed of giving you so much trouble lady mary said to her new friend  we are delighted to have you my dear  but i know that you have been obliged to leave london because i am with you  there is nothing i like so much as this place which your father has been kind enough to lend us as for london there is nothing now to make me like being there both my girls are married and therefore i regard myself as an old woman who has done her work dont you think this place very much nicer than london at this time of the year  i dont know london at all i had only just been brought out when poor mamma went abroad  the life they led was very quiet and must probably have been felt to be dull by lady cantrip in spite of her old age and desire for retirement but the place itself was very lovely may of all the months of the year is in england the most insidious the most dangerous and the most inclement a greatcoat cannot be endured and without a greatcoat who can endure a may wind and live but of all months it is the prettiest the grasses are then the greenest and the young foliage of the trees while it has all the glory and all the colour of spring vegetation does not hide the form of the branches as do the heavy masses of the larger leaves which come in the advancing summer and of all villas near london the horns was the sweetest the broad green lawn swept down to the very margin of the thames which absolutely washed the fringe of grass when the tide was high and here along the bank was a row of flowering ashes the drooping boughs of which in places touched the water it was one of those spots which when they are first seen make the beholder feel that to be able to live there and look at it always would be happiness enough for life  at the end of the week there came a visitor to see lady mary a very pretty carriage was driven up to the door of the horns and the servant asked for lady mary palliser the owner of that carriage was mrs finn now it must be explained to the reader that there had never been any friendship between mrs finn and lady cantrip though the ladies had met each other the great political intimacy which had existed between the duke and lord cantrip had created some intimacy also between their wives the duchess and lady cantrip had been friendsafter a fashion but mrs finn had never been cordially accepted by those among whom lady cantrip chiefly lived when therefore the name was announced the servant expressly stating that the visitor had asked for lady mary lady cantrip who was with her guest had to bethink herself what she would do the duke who was at this time very full of wrath against mrs finn had not mentioned this ladys name when delivering up the charge of his daughter to lady cantrip at this moment it occurred to her that not improbably mrs finn would cease to be included in the intimacies of the palliser family from the time of the death of the duchessthat the duke would not care to maintain the old relations and that he would be as little anxious to do it for his daughter as for himself if so could it be right that mrs finn should come down here to a house which was now in the occupation of a lady with whom she was not on inviting terms in order that she might thus force herself on the dukes daughter mrs finn had not left her carriage but had sent in to ask if lady mary could see her in all this there was considerable embarrassment she looked round at her guest who had at once risen from her chair would you wish to see her asked lady cantrip  oh yes certainly  have you seen her sincesince you came home from italy  oh dear yes she was down at matching when poor mamma died and papa persuaded her to remain afterwards of course i will see her then the servant was desired to ask mrs finn to come inand while this was being done lady cantrip retired  mrs finn embraced her young friend and asked after her welfare and after the welfare of the house in which she was stayinga house with which mrs finn herself had been well acquaintedand said halfadozen pretty little things in her own quiet pretty way before she spoke of the matter which had really brought her to the horns on that day  i have had a correspondence with your father mary  indeed  and unfortunately one that has been far from agreeable to me  i am sorry for that mrs finn  so am i very sorry i may say with perfect truth that there is no man in the world except my own husband for whom i feel so perfect an esteem as i do for your father if it were not that i do not like to be carried away by strong language i would speak of more than esteem through your dear mother i have watched his conduct closely and have come to think that there is perhaps no other man at the same time so just and so patriotic now he is very angry with meand most unjustly angry  is it about me  yesit is about you had it not been altogether about you i would not have troubled you  and about  yesabout mr tregear also when i tell you that there has been a correspondence i must explain that i have written one long letter to the duke and that in answer i have received a very short one that has been the whole correspondence here is your fathers letter to me then she brought out of her pocket a note which lady mary readcovered with blushes as she did so the note was as follows      the duke of omnium understands from mrs finns letter    that mrs finn while she was the dukes guest at    matching was aware of a certain circumstance affecting    the dukes honour and happinesswhich circumstance she    certainly did not communicate to the duke the duke thinks    that the trust which had been placed in mrs finn should    have made such a communication imperative the duke feels    that no further correspondence between himself and mrs    finn on the matter could lead to any good result   do you understand it asked mrs finn  i think so  it simply means thisthat when at matching he had thought me worthy of having for a time the charge of you and of your welfare that he had trusted me who was the friend of your dear mother to take for a time in regard to you the place which had been so unhappily left vacant by her death and it means also that i deceived him and betrayed that trust by being privy to an engagement on your part of which he disapproves and of which he was not then aware  i suppose he does mean that  yes lady mary that is what he means and he means further to let me know that as i did so foully betray the trust which he had placed in methat as i had consented to play the part of assistant to you in that secret engagementtherefore he casts me off as altogether unworthy of his esteem and acquaintance it is as though he had told me in so many words that among women he had known none more vile or more false than i  not that mrs finn  yes thatall of that he tells me that and then says that there shall be no more words spoken or written about it i can hardly submit to so stern a judgment you know the truth lady mary  do not call me lady mary do not quarrel with me  if your father has quarrelled with me it would not be fit that you and i should be friends your duty to him would forbid it i should not have come to you now did i not feel that i am bound to justify myself the thing of which i am accused is so repugnant to me that i am obliged to do something and to say something even though the subject itself be one on which i would so willingly be silent  what can i do mrs finn  it was mr tregear who first told me that your father was angry with me he knew what i had done and why and he was bound to tell me in order that i might have an opportunity of setting myself right with the duke then i wrote and explained everythinghow you had told me of the engagement and how i had then urged mr tregear that he should not keep such a matter secret from your father in answer to my letter i have receivedthat  shall i write and tell papa  he should be made to understand that from the moment in which i heard of the engagement i was urgent with you and with mr tregear that he should be informed of it you will remember what passed  i remember it all  i did not conceive it to be my duty to tell the duke myself but i did conceive it to be my duty to see he should be told now he writes as though i had known the secret from the first and as though i had been concealing it from him at the very moment in which he was asking me to remain at matching on your behalf that i consider to be hardand unjust i cannot deny what he says i did know of it while i was at matching for it was at matching that you told me but he implies that i knew it before when you told me your story i did feel that it was my duty to see that the matter was not kept longer from himand i did my duty now your father takes upon himself to rebuke meand takes upon himself at the same time to forbid me to write to him again  i will tell him all mrs finn  let him understand this i do not wish to write to him again after what has passed i cannot say i wish to see him again but i think he should acknowledge to me that he has been mistaken he need not then fear that i shall trouble him with any reply but i shall know that he has acquitted me of a fault of which i cannot bear to think i should be accused then she took a somewhat formal though still an affectionate farewell of the girl  i want to see papa as soon as possible said lady mary when she was again with lady cantrip the reason for her wish was soon given and then the whole story told you do not think that she should have gone to papa at once lady mary asked it was a point of moral law on which the elder woman who had had girls of her own found it hard to give an immediate answer it certainly is expedient that parents should know at once of any engagement by which their daughters may seek to contract themselves it is expedient that they should be able to prevent any secret contracts lady cantrip felt strongly that mrs finn having accepted the confidential charge of the daughter could not without gross betrayal of trust allow herself to be the depositary of such a secret but she did not allow herself said lady mary pleading for her friend  but she left the house without telling him my dear  but it was because of what she did that he was told  that is true but i doubt whether she should have left him an hour in ignorance  but it was i who told her she would have betrayed me  she was not a fit recipient for your confidence mary but i do not wish to accuse her she seems to be a highminded woman and i think that your papa has been hard upon her  and mamma knew it always said mary to this lady cantrip could give no answer whatever cause for anger the duke might have against mrs finn there had been cause for much more against his wife but she had freed herself from all accusation by death  lady mary wrote to her father declaring that she was most particularly anxious to see him and talk to him about mrs finn     chapter xiii  the dukes injustice   no advantage whatever was obtained by lady marys interview with her father he persisted that mrs finn had been untrue to him when she left matching without telling him all that she knew of his daughters engagement with mr tregear no doubt by degrees that idea which he at first entertained was expelled from his headthe idea that she had been cognisant of the whole thing before she came to matching but even this was done so slowly that there was no moment at which he became aware of any lessened feeling of indignation to his thinking she had betrayed her trust and he could not be got by his daughter to say that he would forgive her he certainly could not be got to say that he would apologise for the accusation he had made it was nothing less that his daughter asked and he could hardly refrain himself from anger when she asked it there should not have been a moment he said before she came to me and told me all poor lady marys position was certainly uncomfortable enough the great sinthe sin which was so great that to have known it for a day without revealing it was in itself a damning sin on the part of mrs finnwas lady marys sin and she differed so entirely from her father as to think that this sin of her own was a virtue and that to have spoken of it to him would have been on the part of mrs finn a treachery so deep that no woman ought to have forgiven it when he spoke of a matter which deeply affected his honourshe could hardly refrain from asserting that his honour was quite safe in his daughters hands and when in his heart he declared that it should have been mrs finns first care to save him from disgrace lady mary did break out papa there could be no disgrace that for a moment shall be laid aside he said with that manner by which even his peers in council had never been able not to be awed but if you communicate with mrs finn at all you must make her understand that i regard her conduct as inexcusable  nothing had been gained and poor lady mary was compelled to write a few lines which were to her most painful in writing      my dear mrs finn     i have seen papa and he thinks that you ought to have    told him when i told you it occurs to me that that would    have been a cruel thing to do and most unfair to mr    tregear who was quite willing to go to papa and had only    put off doing so because of poor mammas death as i had    told mamma of course it was right that he should tell    papa then i told you because you were so kind to me i    am so sorry that i have got you into this trouble but    what can i do     i told him i must write to you i suppose it is better    that i should although what i have to say is so    unpleasant i hope it will all blow over in time    because i love you dearly you may be quite sure of one    thingthat i shall never change in this assurance the    writer was alluding not to her friendship for her friend    but her love for her loverand so the friend understood    her i hope things will be settled some day and then we    may be able to meet     your very affectionate friend     mary palliser   mrs finn when she received this was alone in her house in park lane her husband was down in the north of england on this subject she had not spoken to him fearing that he would feel himself bound to take some steps to support his wife under the treatment she had received even though she must quarrel with the duke she was most anxious that her husband should not be compelled to do so their connection had been political rather than personal there were many reasons why there should be no open cause of disruption between them but her husband was hotheaded and were all this to be told him and that letter shown to him which the duke had written there would be words between him and the duke which would probably make impossible any further connection between them  it troubled her very much she was by no means not alive to the honour of the dukes friendship throughout her intimacy with the duchess she had abstained from pressing herself on him not because she had been indifferent about him but that she had perceived that she might make her way with him better by standing aloof than by thrusting herself forward and she had known that she had been successful she could tell herself with pride that her conduct towards him had been always such as would become a lady of high spirit and fine feeling she knew that she had deserved well of him that in all her intercourse with him with his uncle and with his wife she had given much and had taken little she was the last woman in the world to let a word on such a matter pass her lips but not the less was she conscious of her merit towards him and she had been led to act as she had done by sincere admiration for the man in all their political troubles she had understood him better than the duchess had done looking on from a distance she had understood the mans character as it had come to her both from his wife and from her own husband  that he was unjust to hercruelly unjust she was quite sure he accused her of intentional privity to a secret which it behoved him to know and of being a party to that secrecy whereas from the moment in which she had heard the secret she had determined that it must be made known to him she felt that she had deserved his good opinion in all things but in nothing more than in the way in which she had acted in this matter and yet he had treated her with an imperious harshness which amounted to insolence what a letter it was that he had written to her the very tips of her ears tingled with heat as she read it again to herself none of the ordinary courtesies of epistlecraft had been preserved either in the beginning or in the end it was worse even than if he had called her madam without an epithet the duke understands the duke thinks the duke feels feels that he should not be troubled with either letters or conversation the upshot of it all being that the duke declared her to have shown herself unworthy of being treated like a lady and this after all that she had done  she would not bear it that at present was all that she could say to herself she was not angry with lady mary she did not doubt but that the girl had done the best in her power to bring her father to reason but because lady mary had failed she mrs finn was not going to put up with so grievous an injury and she was forced to bear all this alone there was none with whom she could communicateno one from whom she could ask advice she would not bring her husband into a quarrel which might be prejudicial to his position as a member of his political party there was no one else to whom she would tell the secret of lady marys love and yet she could not bear this injustice done to her  then she wrote as follows to the duke      mrs finn presents her compliments to the duke of omnium    mrs finn finds it to be essential to her that she should    see the duke in reference to his letter to her if his    grace will let her know on what day and at what hour he    will be kind enough to call on her mrs finn will be at    home to receive him     park lane thursday 12th may 18     chapter xiv  the new member for silverbridge   lord silverbridge was informed that it would be right that he should go down to silverbridge a few days before the election to make himself known to the electors as the day for the election drew near it was understood that there would be no other candidate the conservative side was the popular side among the tradesmen of silverbridge silverbridge had been proud to be honoured by the services of the heir of the house of omnium even while that heir had been a liberalhad regarded it as so much a matter of course that the borough should be at his disposal that no question as to politics had ever arisen while he retained the seat and had the duke chosen to continue to send them liberals one after another when he went into the house of lords there would have been no question as to the fitness of the man or men so sent silverbridge had been supposed to be a liberal as a matter of coursebecause the pallisers were liberals but when the matter was remitted to themselveswhen the duke declared that he would not interfere any more for it was thus that the borough had obtained its freedomthen the borough began to feel conservative predilections if his grace really does mean us to do just what we please ourselves which is a thing we never thought of asking from his grace then we find having turned the matter over among ourselves that we are upon the whole conservative in this spirit the borough had elected a certain mr fletcher but in doing so the borough had still a shade of fear that it would offend the duke the house of palliser gatherum castle the duke of omnium and this special duke himself were all so great in the eyes of the borough that the first and only strong feeling in the borough was the one of duty the borough did not altogether enjoy being enfranchised but when the duke had spoken once twice and thrice then with a hesitating heart the borough returned mr fletcher now mr fletcher was wanted elsewhere having been persuaded to stand for the county and it was a comfort to the borough that it could resettle itself beneath the warmth of the wings of the pallisers  so the matter stood when lord silverbridge was told that his presence in the borough for a few hours would be taken as a compliment hitherto no one knew him at silverbridge during his boyhood he had not been much at gatherum castle and had done his best to eschew the place since he had ceased to be a boy all the pallisers took a pride in gatherum castle but they all disliked it oh yes ill go down he said to mr morton who was up in town i neednt go to the great barrack i suppose the great barrack was the castle ill put up at the inn mr morton begged the heir to come to his own house but silverbridge declared that he would prefer the inn and so the matter was settled he was to meet sundry politiciansmr sprugeon and mr sprout and mr du boungwho would like to be thanked for what they had done but who was to go with him he would naturally have asked tregear but from tregear he had for the last week or two been not perhaps estranged but separated he had been much taken up with racing he had gone down to chester with major tifto and under the majors auspicious influences had won a little moneyand now he was very anxiously preparing himself for the newmarket second spring meeting he had therefore passed much of his time with major tifto and when this visit to silverbridge was pressed on him he thoughtlessly asked tifto to go with him tifto was delighted lord silverbridge was to be met at silverbridge by various wellknown politicians from the neighbourhood and major tifto was greatly elated by the prospect of such an introduction into the political world  but no sooner had the offer been made by lord silverbridge than he saw his own indiscretion tifto was very well for chester or newmarket very well perhaps for the beargarden but not very well for an electioneering expedition an idea came to the young nobleman that if it should be his fate to represent silverbridge in parliament for the next twenty years it would be well that silverbridge should entertain respecting him some exalted estimationthat silverbridge should be taught to regard him as a fit son of his father and a worthy specimen of the british political nobility struck by serious reflections of this nature he did open his mind to tregear i am very fond of tifto he said but i dont know whether hes just the sort of fellow to take down to an election  i should think not said tregear very decidedly  hes a very good fellow you know said silverbridge i dont know an honester man than tifto anywhere  i dare say or rather i dont dare say i know nothing about the majors honesty and i doubt whether you do he rides very well  what has that to do with it  nothing on earth therefore i advise you not to take him to silverbridge  you neednt preach  you may call it what you like tifto would not hold his tongue and there is nothing he could say there which would not be to your prejudice  will you go  if you wish it said tregear  what will the governor say  that must be your lookout in a political point of view i shall not disgrace you i shall hold my tongue and look like a gentlemanneither of which is in tiftos power  and so it was settled that on the day but one after this conversation lord silverbridge and tregear should go together to silverbridge but the major when on the same night his noble friends altered plans were explained to him did not bear the disappointment with equanimity isnt that a little strange he said becoming very red in the face  what do you call strange said the lord  wellid made all my arrangements when a man has been asked to do a thing like that he doesnt like to be put off  the truth is tifto when i came to think of it i saw that going down to these fellows about parliament and all that sort of thing i ought to have a political atmosphere and not a racing or a betting or a hunting atmosphere  there isnt a man in london who cares more about politics than i doand not very many perhaps who understand them better to tell you the truth my lord i think you are throwing me over  ill make it up to you said silverbridge meaning to be kind ill go down to newmarket with you and stick to you like wax  no doubt youll do that said tifto who like a fool failed to see where his advantage lay i can be useful at newmarket and so youll stick to me  look here major tifto said silverbridge if you are dissatisfied you and i can easily separate ourselves  i am not dissatisfied said the little man almost crying  then dont talk as though you were as to silverbridge i shall not want you there when i asked you i was only thinking what would be pleasant to both of us but since that i have remembered that business must be business even this did not reconcile the angry little man who as he turned away declared within his own little bosom that he would take it out of silverbridge for that  lord silverbridge and tregear went down to the borough together and on the journey something was said about lady maryand something also about lady mabel from the first you know said lady marys brother i never thought it would answer  why not answer  because i knew the governor would not have it money and rank and those sort of things are not particularly charming to me but still things should go together it is all very well for you and me to be pals but of course it will be expected that mary should marry some  some swell  some swell if you will have it  you mean to call yourself a swell  yes i do said silverbridge with considerable resolution you ought not to make yourself disagreeable because you understand all about it as well as anybody chance has made me the eldest son of a duke and heir to an enormous fortune chance has made my sister the daughter of a duke and an heiress also my intimacy with you ought to be proof at any rate to you that i dont on that account set myself up above other fellows but when you come to talk of marriage of course it is a serious thing  but you have told me more than once that you have no objection on your own score  nor have i  you are only saying what the duke will think  i am telling you that it is impossible and i told you so before you and she will be kept apart and so  and so shell forget me  something of that kind  of course i have to trust to her for that if she forgets me well and good  she neednt forget you lord bless me you talk as though the thing were not done every day youll hear some morning that she is going to marry some fellow who has a lot of money and a good position and what difference will it make then whether she has forgotten you or not it might almost have been supposed that the young man had been acquainted with his mothers history  after this there was a pause and there arose conversation about other things and a cigar was smoked then tregear returned once more to the subject there is one thing i wish to say about it all  what is that  i want you to understand that nothing else will turn me away from my intention but such a marriage on her part as that of which you speak nothing that your father can do will turn me  she cant marry without his leave  perhaps not  that hell never giveand i dont suppose you look forward to waiting till his death  if he sees that her happiness really depends on it he will give his leave it all depends on that if i judge your father rightly hes just as softhearted as other people the man who holds out is not the man of the firmest opinion but the man of the hardest heart  somebody will talk mary over  if so the thing is over it all depends on her then he went on to tell his friend that he had spoken of his engagement to lady mabel i have mentioned it to no soul but to your father and to her  why to her  because we were friends together as children i never had a sister but she has been more like a sister to me than any one else do you object to her knowing it  not particularly it seems to me now that everybody knows everything there are no longer any secrets  but she is a special friend  of yours said silverbridge  and of yours said tregear  well yesin a sort of way she is the jolliest girl i know  take her all round for beauty intellect good sense and fun at the same time i dont know any one equal to her  its a pity you didnt fall in love with her  we knew each other too early for that and then she has not a shilling i should think myself dishonest if i did not tell you that i could not afford to love any girl who hadnt money a man must liveand a woman too  at the station they were met by mr sprugeon and mr sprout who with many apologies for the meanness of such entertainment took them up to the george and vulture which was supposed for the nonce to be the conservative hotel in the town here they were met by other men of importance in the borough and among them by mr du boung now mr sprout and mr sprugeon were conservatives but mr du boung was a strong liberal  we are all of us particularly glad to see your lordship among us said mr du boung  i have told his lordship how perfectly satisfied you are to see the borough in his lordships hands said mr sprugeon  i am sure it could not be in better said mr du boung for myself i am quite willing to postpone any peculiar shade of politics to the advantage of having your fathers son as our representative  this mr du boung said with much intention of imparting both grace and dignity to the occasion he thought that he was doing a great thing for the house of omnium and that the house of omnium ought to know it  thats very kind of you said lord silverbridge who had not read as carefully as he should have done the letters which had been sent to him and did not therefore quite understand the position  mr du boung had intended to stand himself said mr sprout  but retired in your lordships favour said mr sprugeon  in doing which i considered that i studied the interest of the borough said mr du boung  i thought you gave it up because there was hardly a footing for a liberal said his lordship very imprudently  the borough was always liberal till the last election said mr du boung drawing himself up  the borough wishes on this occasion to be magnanimous said mr sprout probably having on his mind some confusion between magnanimity and unanimity  as your lordship is coming among us the borough is anxious to sink politics altogether for the moment said mr sprugeon there had no doubt been a compact between the sprugeon and sprout party and the du boung party in accordance with which it had been arranged that mr du boung should be entitled to a certain amount of glorification in the presence of lord silverbridge  and it was in compliance with that wish on the part of the borough my lord said mr du boungas to which my own feelings were quite as strong as that of any other gentleman in the boroughthat i conceived it to be my duty to give way  his lordship is quite aware how much he owes to mr du boung said tregear whereupon lord silverbridge bowed  and now what are we to do said lord silverbridge  then there was a little whispering between mr sprout and mr sprugeon perhaps mr du boung said sprugeon his lordship had better call first on dr tempest  perhaps said the injured brewer as it is to be a party affair after all i had better retire from the scene  i thought all that was to be given up said tregear  oh certainly said sprout suppose we go to mr walker first  im up to anything said lord silverbridge but of course everybody understands that i am a conservative  oh dear yes said sprugeon  we are all aware of that said sprout  and very glad weve all of us been to hear it said the landlord  though there are some in the borough who could have wished my lord that you had stuck to the old palliser politics said mr du boung  but i havent stuck to the palliser politics just at present i think that order and all that sort of thing should be maintained  hear hear said the landlord  and now as i have expressed my views generally i am willing to go anywhere  then well go to mr walker first said sprugeon now it was understood that in the borough among those who really had opinions of their own mr walker the old attorney stood first as a liberal and dr tempest the old rector first as a conservative  i am glad to see your lordship in the town which gives you its name said mr walker who was a hale old gentleman with silverywhite hair over seventy years of age i proposed your father for this borough on i think six or seven different occasions they used to go in and out then whenever they changed their offices  we hope youll propose lord silverbridge now said mr sprugeon  oh wellyes hes his fathers son and i never knew anything but good of the family i wish you were going to sit on the same side my lord  times are changed a little perhaps said his lordship  the matter is not to be discussed now said the old attorney i understand that only i hope youll excuse me if i say that a man ought to get up very early in the morning if he means to see further into politics than your father  very early indeed said mr du boung shaking his head  thats all right said lord silverbridge  ill propose you my lord i need not wish you success because there is no one to stand against you  then they went to dr tempest who was also an old man yes my lord i shall be proud to second you said the rector i didnt think that i should ever do that to one of your name in silverbridge  i hope you think ive made a change for the better said the candidate  youve come over to my school of course and i suppose i am bound to think that a change for the better nevertheless i have a kind of idea that certain people ought to be tories and that other certain people ought to be whigs what does your father say about it  my father wishes me to be in the house and that he has not quarrelled with me you may know by the fact that had there been a contest he would have paid my expenses  a father generally has to do that whether he approves of what his son is about or not said the caustic old gentleman  there was nothing else to be done they all went back to the hotel and mr sprugeon with mr sprout and the landlord drank a glass of sherry at the candidates expense wishing him political long life and prosperity there was no one else whom it was thought necessary that the candidate should visit and the next day he returned to town with the understanding that on the day appointed in the next week he should come back again to be elected  and on the day appointed the two young men again went to silverbridge and after he had been declared duly elected the new member of parliament made his first speech there was a meeting in the townhall and many were assembled anxious to hearnot the lads opinions for which probably nobody cared muchbut the tone of his voice and to see his manner of what sort was the eldest son of the man of whom the neighbourhood had been so proud for the county was in truth proud of their duke of this son whom they had now made a member of parliament they at present only knew that he had been sent away from oxfordnot so very long agofor painting the deans house scarlet the speech was not very brilliant he told them that he was very much obliged to them for the honour they had done him though he could not follow exactly his fathers political opinionshe would always have before his eyes his fathers political honesty and independence he broke down two or three times and blushed and repeated himself and knocked his words a great deal too quickly one on the top of another but it was taken very well and was better than was expected when it was over he wrote a line to the duke      my dear father     i am member of parliament for silverbridgeas you used    to be in the days which i can first remember i hope you    wont think that it does not make me unhappy to have    differed from you indeed it does i dont think that    anybody has ever done so well in politics as you have    but when a man does take up an opinion i dont see how    he can help himself of course i could have kept myself    quietbut then you wished me to be in the house they    were all very civil to me at silverbridge but there was    very little said     your affectionate son     silverbridge     chapter xv  the duke receives a letterand writes one   the duke when he received mrs finns note demanding an interview thought much upon the matter before he replied she had made her demand as though the duke had been no more than any other gentleman almost as though she had a right to call upon him to wait upon her he understood and admired the courage of thisbut nevertheless he would not go to her he had trusted her with that which of all things was the most sacred to him and she had deceived him he wrote to her as follows      the duke of omnium presents his compliments to mrs finn    as the duke thinks that no good could result either to    mrs finn or to himself from an interview he is obliged    to say that he would rather not do as mrs finn has    requested     but for the strength of this conviction the duke would    have waited upon mrs finn most willingly   mrs finn when she received this was not surprised she had felt sure that such would be the nature of the dukes answer but she was also sure that if such an answer did come she would not let the matter rest the accusation was so bitter to her that she would spare nothing in defending herselfnothing in labour and nothing in time she would make him know that she was in earnest as she could not succeed in getting into his presence she must do this by letterand she wrote her letter taking two days to think of her words      may 18 18     my dear duke of omnium     as you will not come to me i must trouble your grace    to read what i fear will be a long letter for it is    absolutely necessary that i should explain my conduct to    you that you have condemned me i am sure you will not    denynor that you have punished me as far as the power    of punishment was in your hands if i can succeed in    making you see that you have judged me wrongly i think    you will admit your error and beg my pardon you are not    one who from your nature can be brought easily to do this    but you are one who will certainly do it if you can be    made to feel that by not doing so you would be unjust i    am myself so clear as to my own rectitude of purpose and    conduct and am so well aware of your perspicuity that    i venture to believe that if you will read this letter i    shall convince you     before i go any further i will confess that the matter is    onei was going to say almost of life and death to me    circumstances not of my own seeking have for some years    past thrown me so closely into intercourse with your    family that now to be cast off and to be put on one side    as a disgraced personand that so quickly after the    death of her who loved me so dearly and who was so dear to    meis such an affront as i cannot bear and hold up my    head afterwards i have come to be known as her whom your    uncle trusted and loved as her whom your wife trusted and    lovedobscure as i was beforeand as her whom may i    not say you yourself trusted as there was much of honour    and very much of pleasure in this so also was there    something of misfortune friendships are safest when the    friends are of the same standing i have always felt there    was danger and now the thing i feared has come home to    me     now i will plead my case i fancy that when first you    heard that i had been cognisant of your daughters    engagement you imagined that i was aware of it before i    went to matching had i been so i should have been guilty    of that treachery of which you accuse me i did know    nothing of it till lady mary told me on the day before i    left matching that she should tell me was natural enough    her mother had known it and for the momentif i am    not assuming too much in saying soi was filling her    mothers place but in reference to you i could not    exercise the discretion which a mother might have used    and i told her at once most decidedly that you must be    made acquainted with the fact     then lady mary expressed to me her wishnot that this    matter should be kept any longer from you for that it    should be told she was as anxious as i was myselfbut    that it should be told to you by mr tregear it was not    for me to raise any question as to mr tregears fitness    or unfitnessas to which indeed i could know nothing    all i could do was to say that if mr tregear would make    the communication at once i should feel that i had done    my duty the upshot was that mr tregear came to me    immediately on my return to london and agreeing with me    that it was imperative that you be informed went to you    and did inform you in all of that if i have told the    story truly where has been my offence i suppose you will    believe me but your daughter can give evidence as to    every word that i have written     i think that you have got it into your mind that i have    befriended mr tregears suit and that having received    this impression you hold it with the tenacity which is    usual to you there never was a greater mistake i went to    matching as the friend of my dear friendbut i stayed    there at your request as your friend had i been when    you asked me to do so a participator in that secret i    could not have honestly remained in the position you    assigned to me had i done so i should have deserved your    ill opinion as it is i have not deserved it and your    condemnation of me has been altogether unjust should i    not now receive from you a full withdrawal of all charge    against me i shall be driven to think that after all    the insight which circumstances have given me into your    character i have nevertheless been mistaken in the    reading of it     i remain    dear duke of omnium    yours truly     m finn     i find on looking over my letter that i must add one word    further it might seem that i am asking for a return of    your friendship such is not my purpose neither can you    forget that you have accused menor can i what i expect    is that you should tell me that you in your conduct to me    have been wrong and that i in mine to you have been right    i must be enabled to feel that the separation between us    has come from injury done to me and not by me   he did read the letter more than once and read it with tingling ears and hot cheeks and a knitted brow as the letter went on and as the womans sense of wrong grew hot from her own telling of her own story her words became stronger and still stronger till at last they were almost insolent in their strength were it not that they came from one who did think herself to have been wronged then certainly they would be insolent a sense of injury a burning conviction of wrong sustained will justify language which otherwise would be unbearable the duke felt that and though his ears were tingling and his brow knitted he could have forgiven the language if only he could have admitted the argument he understood every word of it when she spoke of tenacity she intended to charge him with obstinacy though she had dwelt but lightly on her own services she had made her thoughts on the matter clear enough i mrs finn who am nobody have done much to succour and assist you the duke of omnium and this is the return which i have received and then she told him to his face that unless he did something which it would be impossible that he should do she would revoke her opinion of his honesty he tried to persuade himself that her opinion about his honesty was nothing to himbut he failed her opinion was very much to him though in his anger he had determined to throw her off from him he knew her to be one whose good opinion was worth having  not a word of overt accusation had been made against his wife every allusion to her was full of love but yet how heavy a charge was really made that such a secret should be kept from him the father was acknowledged to be a heinous faultbut the wife had known the secret and had kept it from him the father and then how wretched a thing it was for him that any one should dare to write to him about the wife that had been taken away from him in spite of all her faults her name was so holy to him that it had never once passed his lips since her death except in low whispers to himselflow whispers made in the perfect doubleguarded seclusion of his own chamber cora cora he had murmured so that the sense of the sound and not the sound itself had come to him from his own lips and now this woman wrote to him about her freely as though there were nothing sacred no religion in the memory of her  it was not for me to raise any question as to mr tregears fitness was it not palpable to all the world that he was unfit unfit how could a man be more unfit he was asking for the hand of one who was second only to royaltywho was possessed of everything who was beautiful wellborn rich who was the daughter of the duke of omnium and he had absolutely nothing of his own to offer  but it was necessary that he should at last come to the consideration of the actual point as to which she had written to him so forcibly he tried to set himself to the task in perfect honesty he certainly had condemned her he had condemned her and had no doubt punished her to the extent of his power and if he could be brought to see that he had done this unjustly then certainly must he beg her pardon and when he considered it all he had to own that her intimacy with his uncle and his wife had not been so much of her seeking as of theirs it grieved him now that it should have been so but so it was and after all thisafter the affectionate surrender of herself to his wifes caprices which the woman had madehe had turned upon her and driven her away with ignominy that was all true as he thought of it he became hot and was conscious of a quivering feeling round his heart these were bonds indeed but they were bonds of such a nature as to be capable of being rescinded and cut away altogether by absolute bad conduct if he could make it good to himself that in a matter of such magnitude as the charge of his daughter she had been untrue to him and had leagued herself against him with an unworthy lover then thenall bonds would be rescinded then would his wrath be altogether justified then would it have been impossible that he should have done aught else than cast her out as he thought of this he felt sure that she had betrayed him how great would be the ignominy to him should he be driven to own to himself that she had not betrayed him there should not have been a moment he said to himself over and over againnot a moment yesshe certainly had betrayed him  there might still be safety for him in that confident assertion of not a moment but had there been anything of that conspiracy of which he had certainly at first judged her to be guilty she had told her story and had then appealed to lady mary for evidence after five minutes of perfect stillnessbut five minutes of misery five minutes during which great beads of perspiration broke out from him and stood upon his brow he had to confess to himself that he did not want any evidence he did believe her story when he allowed himself to think she had been in league with tregear he had wronged her he wiped away the beads from his brow and again repeated to himself those words which were now his only comfort there should not have been a momentnot a moment  it was thus and only thus that he was enabled to assure himself that there need be no acknowledgment of wrong done on his part having settled this in his own mind he forced himself to attend a meeting at which his assistance had been asked as to a complex question on law reform the duke endeavoured to give himself up entirely to the matter but through it all there was the picture before him of mrs finn waiting for an answer to her letter if he should confirm himself in his opinion that he had been right then would any answer be necessary he might just acknowledge the letter after the fashion which has come up in official life than which silence is an insult much more bearable but he did not wish to insult nor to punish her further he would willingly have withdrawn the punishment under which she was groaning could he have done so without selfabasement or he might write as she had doneadvocating his own cause with all his strength using that last one strong argumentthere should not have been a moment but there would be something repulsive to his personal dignity in the continued correspondence which this would produce the duke of omnium regrets to say in answer to mrs finns letter that he thinks no good can be attained by a prolonged correspondence such or of such kind he thought must be his answer but would this be a fair return for the solicitude shown by her to his uncle for the love which had made her so patient a friend to his wife for the nobility of her own conduct in many things then his mind reverted to certain jewelssupposed to be of enormous valuewhich were still in his possession though they were the property of this woman they had been left to her by his uncle and she had obstinately refused to take them now they were lying packed in the cellars of certain bankersbut still they were in his custody what should he now do in this matter hitherto perhaps once in every six months he had notified to her that he was keeping them as her curator and she had always repeated that it was a charge from which she could not relieve him it had become almost a joke between them but how could he joke with a woman with whom he had quarrelled after this internecine fashion  what if he were to consult lady cantrip he could not do so without a pang that would be very bitter to himbut any agony would be better than that arising from a fear that he had been unjust to one who had deserved well of him no doubt lady cantrip would see it in the same light as he had done and then he would be able to support himself by the assurance that that which he had judged to be right was approved of by one whom the world would acknowledge to be a good judge on such a matter  when he got home he found his sons letter telling him of the election at silverbridge there was something in it which softened his heart to the young manor perhaps it was that in the midst of his many discomforts he wished to find something which at least was not painful to him that his son and his heir should insist on entering political life in opposition to him was of course a source of pain but putting that aside the thing had been done pleasantly enough and the young members letter had been written with some good feeling so he answered the letter as pleasantly as he knew how      my dear silverbridge     i am glad that you are in parliament and am glad also    that you should have been returned by the old borough    though i would that you could have reconciled yourself    to adhering to the politics of your family but there is    nothing disgraceful in such a change and i am able to    congratulate you as a father should a son and to wish you    long life and success as a legislator     there are one or two things i would ask you to    rememberand firstly this that as you have voluntarily    undertaken certain duties you are bound as an honest man    to perform them as scrupulously as though you were paid    for doing them there was no obligation in you to seek the    postbut having sought it and acquired it you cannot    neglect the work attached to it without being untrue to    the covenant you have made it is necessary that a young    member of parliament should bear this in his mind and    especially a member who has not worked his way up to    notoriety outside the house because to him there will be    great facility for idleness and neglect     and then i would have you always remember the purport for    which there is a parliament elected in this happy and free    country it is not that some men may shine there that    some may acquire power or that all may plume themselves    on being the elect of the nation it often appears to me    that some members of parliament so regard their success    in lifeas the fellows of our colleges do too often    thinking that their fellowships were awarded for their    comfort and not for the furtherance of any object as    education or religion i have known gentlemen who have    felt that in becoming members of parliament they had    achieved an object for themselves instead of thinking that    they had put themselves in the way of achieving something    for others a member of parliament should feel himself    to be the servant of his countryand like every other    servant he should serve if this be distasteful to a man    he need not go into parliament if the harness gall him he    need not wear it but if he takes the trappings then he    should draw the coach you are there as the guardian of    your fellowcountrymenthat they may be safe that they    may be prosperous that they may be well governed and    lightly burdenedabove all that they may be free if you    cannot feel this to be your duty you should not be there    at all     and i would have you remember also that the work of a    member of parliament can seldom be of that brilliant    nature which is of itself charming and that the young    member should think of such brilliancy as being possible    to him only at a distance it should be your first care to    sit and listen so that the forms and methods of the house    may as it were soak into you gradually and then you must    bear in mind that speaking in the house is but a very    small part of a members work perhaps that part which    he may lay aside altogether with the least strain on his    conscience a good member of parliament will be good    upstairs in the committee rooms good downstairs to make    and to keep a house good to vote for his party if it    may be nothing better but for the measures also which he    believes to be for the good of his country     gradually if you will give your thoughts to it and above    all your time the theory of legislation will sink into    your mind and you will find that there will come upon you    the ineffable delight of having served your country to the    best of your ability     it is the only pleasure in life which has been enjoyed    without alloy by your affectionate father     omnium   the duke in writing this letter was able for a few moments to forget mrs finn and to enjoy the work which he had on hand     chapter xvi  poor boy   the new member for silverbridge when he entered the house to take the oath was supported on the right and left by two staunch old tories mr monk had seen him a few minutes previouslymr monk who of all liberals was the firmest and than whom no one had been more staunch to the dukeand had congratulated him on his election expressing at the same time some gentle regrets i only wish you could have come among us on the other side he said  but i couldnt said the young lord  i am sure nothing but a conscientious feeling would have separated you from your fathers friends said the old liberal and then they were parted and the member for silverbridge was bustled up to the table between two staunch tories  of what else was done on that occasion nothing shall be said here no political work was required from him except that of helping for an hour or two to crowd the government benches but we will follow him as he left the house there were one or two others quite as anxious as to his political career as any staunch old liberal at any rate one other he had promised that as soon as he could get away from the house he would go to belgrave square and tell lady mabel grex all about it when he reached the square it was past seven but lady mabel and miss cassewary were still in the drawingroom  there seemed to be a great deal of bustle and i didnt understand much about it said the member  but you heard the speeches these were the speeches made on the proposing and seconding of the address  oh yeslupton did it very well lord george didnt seem to be quite so good then sir timothy beeswax made a speech and then mr monk after that i saw other fellows going away so i bolted too  if i were a member of parliament i would never leave it while the house was sitting said miss cassewary  if all were like that there wouldnt be seats for them to sit upon said silverbridge  a persistent member will always find a seat continued the positive old lady  i am sure that lord silverbridge means to do his duty said lady mabel  oh yesive thought a good deal about it and i mean to try as long as a man isnt called upon to speak i dont see why it shouldnt be easy enough  im so glad to hear you say so of course after a little time you will speak i should so like to hear you make your first speech  if i thought you were there im sure i should not make it at all  just at this period miss cassewary saying something as to the necessity of dressing and cautioning her young friend that there was not much time to be lost left the room  dressing does not take me more than ten minutes said lady mabel  miss cassewary declared this to be nonsense but she nevertheless left the room whether she would have done so if lord silverbridge had not been lord silverbridge but had been some young man with whom it would not have been expedient that lady mabel should fall in love may perhaps be doubted but then it may be taken as certain that under such circumstances lady mabel herself would not have remained she had quite realised the duties of life had had her little romanceand had acknowledged that it was foolish  i do so hope that you will do well she said going back to the parliamentary duties  i dont think i shall ever do much i shall never be like my father  i dont see why not  there never was anybody like him i am always amusing myself but he never cared for amusement  you are very young  as far as i can learn he was just as he is now at my age my mother has told me that long before she married him he used to spend all his time in the house i wonder whether you would mind reading the letter he wrote me when he heard of my election  then he took the epistle out of his pocket and handed it to lady mabel  he means all that he says  he always does that  and he really hopes that you will put your shoulder to the wheeleven though you must do so in opposition to him  that makes no difference i think my father is a very fine fellow  shall you do all that he tells you  welli suppose notexcept that he advises me to hold my tongue i think that i shall do that i mean to go down there you know and i daresay i shall be much the same as others  has he talked to you much about it  nohe never talks much every now and then he will give me a downright lecture or he will write me a letter like that but he never talks to any of us  how very odd  yes he is odd he seems to be fretful when we are with him a good many things make him unhappy  your poor mothers death  that firstand then there are other things i suppose he didnt like the way i came to an end at oxford  you were a boy then  of course i was very sorry for itthough i hated oxford it was neither one thing nor another you were your own master and yet you were not  now you must be your own master  i suppose so  you must marry and become a lord of the treasury when i was a child i acted as a child you know all about that  oh yes and now i must throw off childish things you mean that i mustnt paint any mans house eh lady mab  that and the rest of it you are a legislator now  so is popplecourt who took his seat in the house of lords two or three months ago hes the biggest young fool i know out he couldnt even paint a house  he is not an elected legislator it makes all the difference i quite agree with what the duke says lord popplecourt cant help himself whether hes an idle young scamp or not he must be a legislator but when a man goes in for it himself as you have done he should make up his mind to be useful  i shall vote with my party of course  more than that much more than that if you didnt care for politics you couldnt have taken a line of your own when she said this she knew that he had been talked into what he had done by tregearby tregear who had ambition and intelligence and capacity for forming an opinion of his own if you do not do it for your own sake you will for the sake of those whowhowho are your friends she said at last not feeling quite able to tell him that he must do it for the sake of those who loved him  there are not very many i suppose who care about it  your father  oh yesmy father  and tregear  tregear has got his own fish to fry  are there none others do you think we care nothing about it here  miss cassewary  wellmiss cassewary a man might have a worse friend than miss cassewaryand my father  i dont suppose lord grex cares a straw about me  indeed he doesa great many straws and so do i do you think i dont care a straw about it  i dont know why you should  because it is my nature to be earnest a girl comes out into the world so young that she becomes serious and steady as it were so much sooner than a man does  i always think that nobody is so full of chaff as you are lady mab  i am not chaffing now in recommending you to go to work in the world like a man  as she said this they were sitting on the same sofa but with some space between them when miss cassewary had left the room lord silverbridge was standing but after a little he had fallen into the seat at the extreme corner and had gradually come a little nearer to her now in her energy she put out her hand meaning perhaps to touch lightly the sleeve of his coat meaning perhaps not quite to touch him at all but as she did so he put out his hand and took hold of hers  she drew it away not seeming to allow it to remain in his grasp for a moment but she did so not angrily or hurriedly or with any flurry she did it as though it were natural that he should take her hand and as natural that she should recover it  indeed i have hardly more than ten minutes left for dressing she said rising from her seat  if you will say that you care about it you yourself i will do my best as he made this declaration blushes covered his cheeks and forehead  i do care about itvery much i myself said lady mabel not blushing at all then there was a knock at the door and lady mabels maid putting her head in declared that my lord had come in and had already been some time in his dressingroom goodbye lord silverbridge she said quite gaily and rather more aloud than would have been necessary had she not intended that the maid also should hear her  poor boy she said to herself as she was dressing poor boy then when the evening was over she spoke to herself again about him dear sweet boy and then she sat and thought how was it that she was so old a woman while he was so little more than a child how fair he was how far removed from conceit how capable of being made into a manin the process of time what might not be expected from him if he could be kept in good hands for the next ten years but in whose hands what would she be in ten years she who already seemed to know the town and all its belongings so well and yet she was as young in years as he he as she knew had passed his twentysecond birthdayand so had she that was all it might be good for her that she should marry him she was ambitious and such a marriage would satisfy her ambition through her fathers fault and her brothers she was likely to be poor this man would certainly be rich many of those who were buzzing around her from day to day were distasteful to her from among them she knew that she could not take a husband let their rank and wealth be what it might she was too fastidious too proud too prone to think that things should be with her as she liked them this last was in all things pleasant to her though he was but a boy there was a certain boyish manliness about him the very way in which he had grasped at her hand and had then blushed rubyred at his own daring had gone far with her how gracious he was to look at dear sweet boy love him noshe did not know that she loved him that dream was over she was sure however that she liked him  but how would it be with him it might be well for her to become his wife but could it be well for him that he should become her husband did she not feel that it would be better for him that he should become a man before he married at all perhaps sobut then if she desisted would others desist if she did not put out her bait would there not be other hooksothers and worse would not such a one so soft so easy so prone to be caught and so desirable for the catching be sure to be made prey of by some snare  but could she love him that a woman should not marry a man without loving him she partly knew but she thought she knew also that there must be exceptions she would do her very best to love him that other man should be banished from her very thoughts she would be such a wife to him that he should never know that he lacked anything poor boy sweet dear boy he as he went away to his dinner had his thoughts also about her of all the girls he knew she was the jolliestand of all his friends she was the pleasantest as she was anxious that he should go to work in the house of commons he would go to work there as for loving her wellof course he must marry someone and why not lady mab as well as any one else     chapter xvii  the derby   an attendance at the newmarket second spring meeting had unfortunately not been compatible with the silverbridge election major tifto had therefore been obliged to look after the affair alone a very useful mare as tifto had been in the habit of calling a leggy thoroughbred meagrelooking brute named coalition was on this occasion confided to the majors sole care and judgment but coalition failed as coalitions always do and tifto had to report to his noble patron that they had not pulled off the event it had been a match for four hundred pounds made indeed by lord silverbridge but made at the suggestion of tiftoand now tifto wrote in a very bad humour about it it had been altogether his lordships fault in submitting to carry two pounds more than tifto had thought to be fair and equitable the match had been lost would lord silverbridge be so good as to pay the money to mr green griffin and debit him tifto with the share of his loss  we must acknowledge that the unpleasant tone of the majors letter was due quite as much to the illusage he had received in reference to that journey to silverbridge as to the loss of the race within that little body there was a highmounting heart and that heart had been greatly wounded by his lordships treatment tifto had felt himself to have been treated like a servant hardly an excuse had even been made he had been simply told that he was not wanted he was apt sometimes to tell himself that he knew on which side his bread was buttered but perhaps he hardly knew how best to keep the butter going there was a little pride about him which was antagonistic to the best interests of such a trade as his perhaps it was well that he should inwardly suffer when injured but it could not be well that he should declare to such men as nidderdale and dolly longstaff and popplecourt that he didnt mean to put up with that sort of thing he certainly should not have spoken in this strain before tregear of all men living he hated and feared him the most and he knew that no other man loved silverbridge as did tregear had he been thinking of his breadandbutter instead of giving way to the mighty anger of his little bosom he would have hardly declared openly at the club that he would let lord silverbridge know that he did not mean to stand any mans airs but these extravagances were due perhaps to whiskyandwater and that kind of intoxication which comes to certain men from momentary triumphs tifto could always be got to make a fool of himself when surrounded by three or four men of rank who for the occasion would talk to him as an equal he almost declared that coalition had lost his match because he had not been taken down to silverbridge  tifto is in a deuce of a way with you said dolly longstaff to the young member  i know all about it said silverbridge who had had an interview with his partner since the race  if you dont take care hell dismiss you  silverbridge did not care much about this knowing that words of wisdom did not ordinarily fall from the mouth of dolly longstaff but he was more moved when his friend tregear spoke to him i wish you knew the kind of things that fellow tifto says behind your back  as if i cared  but you ought to care  do you care what every fellow says about you  i care very much what those say whom i choose to live with me whatever tifto might say about me would be quite indifferent to me because we have nothing in common but you and he are bound together  we have a horse or two in common thats all  but that is a great deal the truth is hes a nasty brawling boasting illconditioned little reptile  silverbridge of course did not acknowledge that this was true but he felt it and almost repented of his trust in tifto but still prime minister stood very well for the derby he was second favourite the odds against him being only four to one the glory of being part owner of a probable winner of the derby was so much to him that he could not bring himself to be altogether angry with tifto there was no doubt that the horses present condition was due entirely to tiftos care tifto spent in these few days just before the race the greatest part of his time in the close vicinity of the horse only running up to london now and then as a fish comes up to the surface for a breath of air it was impossible that lord silverbridge should separate himself from the majorat any rate till after the epsom meeting  he had paid the money for the match without a word of reproach to his partner but still with a feeling that things were not quite as they ought to be in money matters his father had been liberal but not very definite he had been told that he ought not to spend above two thousand pounds a year and had been reminded that there was a house for him to use both in town and in the country but he had been given to understand also that any application made to mr morton if not very unreasonable would be attended with success a solemn promise had been exacted from him that he would have no dealings with moneylendersand then he had been set afloat there had been a rather frequent correspondence with mr morton who had once or twice submitted a total of the money paid on behalf of his correspondent lord silverbridge who imagined himself to be anything but extravagant had wondered how the figures could mount up so rapidly but the money needed was always forthcoming and the raising of objections never seemed to be carried back beyond mr morton his promise to his father about the moneylenders had been scrupulously kept as long as ready money can be made to be forthcoming without any charge for interest a young man must be very foolish who will prefer to borrow it at twentyfive per cent  now had come the night before the derby and it must be acknowledged that the young lord was much fluttered by the greatness of the coming struggle tifto having seen his horse conveyed to epsom had come up to london in order that he might dine with his partner and hear what was being said about the race at the beargarden the party dining there consisted of silverbridge dolly longstaff popplecourt and tifto nidderdale was to have joined them but he told them on the day before with a sigh that domestic duties were too strong for him lady nidderdaleor if not lady nidderdale herself then lady nidderdales motherwas so far potent over the young nobleman as to induce him to confine his derby jovialities to the derby day another guest had also been expected the reason for whose nonappearance must be explained somewhat at length lord gerald palliser the dukes second son was at this time at cambridgebeing almost as popular at trinity as his brother had been at christ church it was to him quite a matter of course that he should see his brothers horse run for the derby but unfortunately in this very year a stand was being made by the university pundits against a practice which they thought had become too general for the last year or two it had been considered almost as much a matter of course that a cambridge undergraduate should go to the derby as that a member of parliament should do so against this three or four rigid disciplinarians had raised their voicesand as a result no young man up at trinity could get leave to be away on the derby pretext  lord gerald raged against the restriction very loudly he at first proclaimed his intention of ignoring the college authorities altogether of course he would be expelled but the order itself was to his thinking so absurdthe idea that he should not see his brothers horse run was so extravagantthat he argued that his father could not be angry with him for incurring dismissal in so excellent a cause but his brother saw things in a different light he knew how his father had looked at him when he had been sent away from oxford and he counselled moderation gerald should see the derby but should not encounter that heaviest wrath of all which comes from a mans not sleeping beneath his college roof there was a train which left cambridge at an early hour and would bring him into london in time to accompany his friends to the racecourseand another train a special which would take him down after dinner so that he and others should reach cambridge before the college gates were shut  the dinner at the beargarden was very joyous of course the state of the betting in regard to prime minister was the subject generally popular for the night mr lupton came in a gentleman well known in all fashionable circles parliamentary social and racing who was rather older than his company on this occasion but still not so much so as to be found to be an incumbrance lord glasslough too and others joined them and a good deal was said about the horse i never keep these things dark said tifto of course hes an uncertain horse  most horses are said lupton  just so mr lupton what i mean is the minister has got a bit of temper but if he likes to do his best i dont think any threeyearold in england can get his nose past him  for half a mile hed be nowhere with the provence filly said glasslough  im speaking of a derby distance my lord  thats a kind of thing nobody really knows said lupton  ive seen him ave his gallops said the little man who in his moments of excitement would sometimes fall away from that exact pronunciation which had been one of the studies of his life and have measured his stride i think i know what pace means of course im not going to answer for the orse hes a temper but if things go favourably no animal that ever showed on the downs was more likely to do the trick is there any gentleman here who would like to bet me fifteen to one in hundreds against the two eventsthe derby and the leger the desired odds were at once offered by mr lupton and the bet was booked  this gave rise to other betting and before the evening was over lord silverbridge had taken threeandahalf to one against his horse to such an extent that he stood to lose twelve hundred pounds the champagne which he had drunk and the news that quousque the first favourite had so gone to pieces that now there was a question which was the first favourite had so inflated him that had he been left alone he would almost have wagered even money on his horse in the midst of his excitement there came to him a feeling that he was allowing himself to do just that which he had intended to avoid but then the occasion was so peculiar how often can it happen to a man in his life that he shall own a favourite for the derby the affair was one in which it was almost necessary that he should risk a little money  tifto when he got into his bed was altogether happy he had added whiskyandwater to his champagne and feared nothing if prime minister should win the derby he would be able to pay all that he owed and to make a start with money in his pocket and then there would be attached to him all the infinite glory of being the owner of a winner of the derby the horse was run in his name thoughts as to great successes crowded themselves upon his heated brain what might not be open to him parliament the jockey club the mastership of one of the crack shire packs might it not come to pass that he should some day become the great authority in england upon races racehorses and hunters if he could be the winner of a derby and leger he thought that glasslough and lupton would snub him no longer that even tregear would speak to him and that his pal the dukes son would never throw him aside again  lord silverbridge had bought a drag with all its appendages there was a coach the four bay horses the harness and the two regulation grooms when making this purchase he had condescended to say a word to his father on the subject everybody belongs to the fourinhand club now said the son  i never did said the duke  ahif i could be like you  the duke had said that he would think about it and then had told mr morton that he was to pay the bill for this new toy he had thought about it and had assured himself that driving a coach and four was at present regarded as a fitting amusement for young men of rank and wealth he did not understand it himself it seemed to him to be as unnatural as though a gentleman should turn blacksmith and make horseshoes for his amusement driving four horses was hard work but the same might be said of rowing there were men he knew who would spend their days standing at a lathe making little boxes for their recreation he did not sympathise with it but the fact was so and this driving of coaches was regarded with favour he had been a little touched by that word his son had spoken ahif i could be like you so he had given the permission the drag horses harness and grooms had come into the possession of lord silverbridge and now they were put into requisition to take their triumphant owner and his party down to epsom dolly longstaffs team was sent down to meet them halfway gerald palliser who had come up from cambridge that morning was allowed to drive the first stage out of town to compensate him for the cruelty done to him by the university pundits tifto with a cigar in his mouth with a white hat and a blue veil and a new lightcoloured coat was by no means the least happy of the party  how that race was run and how both prime minister and quousque were beaten by an outsider named fishknife prime minister however coming in a good second the present writer having no aptitude in that way cannot describe such however were the facts and then dolly longstaff and lord silverbridge drove the coach back to london the coming back was not so triumphant though the young fellows bore their failure well dolly longstaff had lost a pot of money silverbridge would have to draw upon that inexhaustible mr morton for something over two thousand poundsin regard to which he had no doubt as to the certainty with which the money would be forthcoming but he feared that it would give rise to special notice from his father even the poor younger brother had lost a couple of hundred pounds for which he would have to make his own special application to mr morton  but tifto felt it more than any one the horse ought to have won fishknife had been favoured by such a series of accidents that the whole affair had been a miracle tifto had these circumstances at his fingers ends and in the course of the afternoon and evening explained them accurately to all who would listen to him he had this to say on his own behalfthat before the party had left the course their horse stood first favourite for the leger but tifto was unhappy as he came back to town and in spite of the lunch which had been very glorious sat moody and sometimes even silent within his gay apparel  it was the unfairest start i ever saw said tifto almost getting up from his seat on the coach so as to address dolly and silverbridge on the box  what the  is the good of that said dolly from the coachbox take your licking and dont squeal  thats all very well i can take my licking as well as another man but one has to look to the causes of these things i never saw peppermint ride so badly before he got round the corner i wished id been on the horse myself  i dont believe it was peppermints fault a bit said silverbridge  wellperhaps not only i did think that i was a pretty good judge of riding  then tifto again settled down into silence  but though much money had been lost and a great deal of disappointment had to be endured by our party in reference to the derby the most injurious and most deplorable event in the days history had not occurred yet dinner had been ordered at the beargarden at sevenan hour earlier than would have been named had it not been that lord gerald must be at the eastern counties railway station at nine pm an hour and a half for dinner and a cigar afterwards and half an hour to get to the railway station would not be more than time enough  but of all men alive dolly longstaff was the most unpunctual he did not arrive till eight the others were not there before halfpast seven and it was nearly eight before any of them sat down at halfpast eight silverbridge began to be very anxious about his brother and told him that he ought to start without further delay a hansom cab was waiting at the door but lord gerald still delayed he knew he said that the special would not start till halfpast nine there were a lot of fellows who were dining about everywhere and they would never get to the station by the hour fixed it became apparent to the elder brother that gerald would stay altogether unless he were forced to go and at last he did get up and pushed the young fellow out drive like the very devil he said to the cabman explaining to him something of the circumstances the cabman did do his best but a cab cannot be made to travel from the beargarden which as all the world knows is close to st jamess street to liverpool street in the city in ten minutes when lord gerald reached the station the train had started  at twenty minutes to ten the young man reappeared at the club why on earth didnt you take a special for yourself exclaimed silverbridge  they wouldnt give me one after that it was apparent to all of them that what had just happened had done more to ruffle our heros temper than his failure and loss at the races  i wouldnt have had it happen for any money you could name said the elder brother to the younger as he took him home to carlton terrace  if they do send me down whats the odds said the younger brother who was not quite as sober as he might have been  after what happened to me it will almost break the governors heart said the heir     chapter xviii  one of the results of the derby   on the following morning at about eleven silverbridge and his brother were at breakfast at an hotel in jermyn street they had slept in carlton terrace but lord gerald had done so without the knowledge of the duke lord silverbridge as he was putting himself to bed had made up his mind to tell the story to the duke at once but when the morning came his courage failed him the two young men therefore slunk out of the house and as there was no breakfasting at the beargarden they went to this hotel they were both rather gloomy but the elder brother was the more sad of the two id give anything i have in the world he said that you hadnt come up at all  things have been so unfortunate  why the deuce wouldnt you go when i told you  who on earth would have thought that theyd have been so punctual they never are punctual on the great eastern it was an infernal shame i think i shall go at once to harnage and tell him all about it mr harnage was lord geralds tutor  but youve been in ever so many rows before  wellive been gated and once when theyd gated me i came right upon harnage on the bridge at kings  what sort of a fellow is he  he used to be goodnatured now he has taken ever so many crotchets into his head it was he who began all this about none of the men going to the derby  did you ask him yourself for leave  yes and when i told him about your owning prime minister he got savage and declared that was the very reason why i shouldnt go  you didnt tell me that  i was determined i would go i wasnt going to be made a child of  at last it was decided that the two brothers should go down to cambridge together silverbridge would be able to come back to london the same evening so as to take his drag down to the oaks on the fridaya duty from which even his present misery would not deter him they reached cambridge at about three and lord silverbridge at once called at the masters lodge and sent in his card the master of trinity is so great that he cannot be supposed to see all comers but on this occasion lord silverbridge was fortunate with much trepidation he told his story such being the circumstances could anything be done to moderate the vials of wrath which must doubtless be poured out over the head of his unfortunate brother  why come to me said the master from what you say yourself it is evident that you know that this must rest with the college tutor  i thought sir if you would say a word  do you think it would be right that i should interfere for one special man and that a man of special rank  nobody thinks that would count for anything but  but what asked the master  if you knew my father sir  everybody knows your fatherevery englishman i mean of course i know your fatheras a public man and i know how much the country owes to him  yes it does but it is not that i mean if you knew how this wouldwouldwould break his heart then there came a tear into the young mans eyeand there was something almost like a tear in the eye of the old man too of course it was my fault i got him to come he hadnt the slightest intention of staying i think you will believe what i say about that sir  i believe every word you say my lord  i got into a row at oxford i daresay you heard there never was anything so stupid that was a great grief to my fathera very great grief it is so hard upon him because he never did anything foolish himself  you should try to imitate him silverbridge shook his head or at least not to grieve him  that is it he has got over the affair about me as im the eldest son ive got into parliament and he thinks perhaps that all has been forgotten an eldest son may i fancy be a greater ass than his younger brother the master could not but smile as he thought of the selection which had been made of a legislator but if gerald is sent down i dont know how hell get over it and now the tears absolutely rolled down the young mans face so that he was forced to wipe them from his eyes  the master was much moved that a young man should pray for himself would be nothing to him the discipline of the college was not in his hands and such prayers would avail nothing with him nor would a brother praying simply for a brother avail much a father asking for his son might be resisted but the brother asking pardon for the brother on behalf of the father was almost irresistible but this man had long been in a position in which he knew that no such prayers should ever prevail at all in the first place it was not his business if he did anything it would only be by asking a favour when he knew that no favour should be grantedand a favour which he of all men should not ask because to him of all men it could not be refused and then the very altitude of the great statesman whom he was invited to befriendthe position of this duke who had been so powerful and might be powerful again was against any such interference of himself he might be sure that he would certainly have done this as readily for any mr jones as for the duke of omnium but were he to do it it would be said of him that it had been done because the man was duke of omnium there are positions exalted beyond the reach of benevolence because benevolence would seem to be selfseeking your father if he were here said he would know that i could not interfere  and will he be sent down  i do not know all the circumstances from your own showing the case seems to be one of great insubordination to tell the truth lord silverbridge i ought not to have spoken to you on the subject at all  you mean that i should not have spoken to you  well i did not say so and if you have been indiscreet i can pardon that i wish i could have served you but i fear that it is not in my power then lord silverbridge took his leave and going to his brothers rooms waited there till lord gerald had returned from his interview with the tutor  its all up said he chucking down his cap striving to be at his ease i may pack up and gojust where i please he says that on no account will he have anything more to do with me i asked him what i was to do and he said that the governor had better take my name off the books of the college i did ask whether i couldnt go over to maclean  who is maclean  one of the other tutors but the brute only smiled  he thought you meant it for chaff  welli suppose i did mean to show him that i was not going to be exterminated by him he will write to the governor today and you will have to talk to the governor  yes as lord silverbridge went back that afternoon to london he thought very much of that talking to the governor never yet had he been able to say anything very pleasant to the governor he had himself been always in disgrace at eton and had been sent away from oxford he had introduced tregear into the family which of all the troubles perhaps was the worst he had changed his politics he had spent more money than he ought to have done and now at this very moment must ask for a large sum and he had brought gerald up to see the derby thereby causing him to be sent away from cambridge and through it all there was present to him a feeling that by no words which he could use would he be able to make his father understand how deeply he felt all this  he could not bring himself to see the duke that evening and the next morning he was sent for before he was out of bed he found his father at breakfast with the tutors letter before him do you know anything about this asked the duke very calmly  gerald ran up to see the derby and in the evening missed the train  mr harnage tells me that he had been expressly ordered not to go to these races  i suppose he was sir  then there was silence between them for some minutes you might as well sit down and eat your breakfast said the father then lord silverbridge did sit down and poured himself out a cup of tea there was no servant in the room and he dreaded to ring the bell is there anything you want asked the duke there was a small dish of fried bacon on the table and some cold mutton on the sideboard silverbridge declaring that he had everything that was necessary got up and helped himself to the cold mutton then again there was silence during which the duke crunched his toast and made an attempt at reading the newspaper but soon pushing that aside he again took up mr harnages letter silverbridge watched every motion of his father as he slowly made his way through the slice of cold mutton it seems that gerald is to be sent away altogether  i fear so sir  he has profited by your example at oxford did you persuade him to come to these races  i am afraid i did  though you knew the orders which had been given  i thought it was meant that he should not be away the night  he had asked permission to go to the derby and had been positively refused did you know that  silverbridge sat for some moments considering he could not at first quite remember what he had known and what he had not known perhaps he entertained some faint hope that the question would be allowed to pass unanswered he saw however from his fathers eye that that was impossible and then he did remember it all i suppose i did know it  and you were willing to imperil your brothers position in life and my happiness in order that he might see a horse of which i believe you call yourself part owner run a race  i thought there would be no risk if he got back the same night i dont suppose there is any good in my saying it but i never was so sorry for anything in all my life i feel as if i could go and hang myself  that is absurdand unmanly said the duke the expression of sorrow as it had been made might be absurd and unmanly but nevertheless it had touched him he was severe because he did not know how far his severity wounded it is a great blowanother great blow races a congregation of all the worst blackguards in the country mixed with the greatest fools  lord cantrip was there said silverbridge and i saw sir timothy beeswax  if the presence of sir timothy be an allurement to you i pity you indeed i have nothing further to say about it you have ruined your brother he had been driven to further anger by this reference to one man whom he respected and to another whom he despised  dont say that sir  what am i to say  let him be an attaché or something of that sort  do you believe it possible that he should pass any examination i think that my children between them will bring me to the grave you had better go now i suppose you will want to beat the races again then the young man crept out of the room and going to his own part of the house shut himself up alone for nearly an hour what had he better do to give his father some comfort should he abandon racing altogether sell his share of prime minister and coalition and go in hard and strong for committees debates and divisions should he get rid of his drag and resolve to read up parliamentary literature he was resolved upon one thing at any rate he would not go to the oaks that day and then he was resolved on another thing he would call on lady mab grex and ask her advice he felt so disconsolate and insufficient for himself that he wanted advice from someone whom he could trust  he found tifto dolly longstaff and one or two others at the stables from whence it was intended that the drag should start they were waiting and rather angry because they had been kept waiting but the news when it came was very sad indeed you wouldnt mind taking the team down and back yourself would you dolly he said to longstaff  you arent going said dolly assuming a look of much heroic horror  noi am not going today  whats up asked popplecourt  thats rather sudden isnt it asked the major  well yes i suppose it is sudden  its throwing us over a little isnt it  not that i see youve got the trap and the horses  yesweve got the trap and the horses said dolly and i vote we make a start  as you are not going yourself perhaps id better drive your horses said tifto  dolly will take the team said his lordship  yesdecidedly i will take the team said dolly there isnt a deal of driving wanted on the road to epsom but a man should know how to hold his reins this of course gave rise to some angry words but silverbridge did not stop to hear them  the poor duke had no one to whom he could go for advice and consolation when his son left him he turned to his newspaper and tried to read itin vain his mind was too ill at ease to admit of political matters he was greatly grieved by this new misfortune as to gerald and by lord silverbridges propensity to racing  but though these sorrows were heavy there was a sorrow heavier than these lady cantrip had expressed an opinion almost in favour of tregearand had certainly expressed an opinion in favour of mrs finn the whole affair in regard to mrs finn had been explained to her and she had told the duke that according to her thinking mrs finn had behaved well when the duke with an energy which was by no means customary with him had asked that question on the answer to which so much depended should there have been a moment lost lady cantrip had assured him that not a moment had been lost mrs finn had at once gone to work and had arranged that the whole affair should be told to him the duke in the proper way i think she did said lady cantrip what i myself should have done in similar circumstances  if lady cantrip was right then must his apology to mrs finn be ample and abject perhaps it was this feeling which at the moment was most vexatious to him     chapter xix  no my lord i do not   between two and three oclock lord silverbridge in spite of his sorrow found himself able to eat his lunch at his club the place was deserted the beargarden world having gone to the races as he sat eating cold lamb and drinking sodaandbrandy he did confirm himself in certain modified resolutions which might be more probably kept than those sterner laws of absolute renunciation to which he had thought of pledging himself in his halfstarved morning condition his father had spoken in very strong language against racingsaying that those who went were either fools or rascals he was sure that this was exaggerated half the house of lords and twothirds of the house of commons were to be seen at the derby but no doubt there were many rascals and fools and he could not associate with the legislators without finding himself among the fools and rascals he wouldas soon as he couldseparate himself from the major and he would not bet it was on that side of the sport that the rascals and the fools showed themselves of what service could betting be to him whom providence had provided with all things wanted to make life pleasant as to the drag his father had in a certain measure approved of that and he would keep the drag as he must have some relaxation but his great effort of all should be made in the house of commons he would endeavour to make his father perceive that he had appreciated that letter he would always be in the house soon after four and would remain therefor if possible as long as the speaker sat in the chair he had already begun to feel that there was a difficulty in keeping his seat upon those benches the halfhours there would be so much longer than elsewhere an irresistible desire of sauntering out would come upon him there were men the very sound of whose voices was already odious to him there had come upon him a feeling in regard to certain orators that when once they had begun there was no reason why they should ever stop words of some sort were always forthcoming like spiders webs he did not think that he could learn to take a pleasure in sitting in the house but he hoped that he might be man enough to do it though it was not pleasant he would begin today instead of going to the oaks  but before he went to the house he would see lady mabel grex and here it may be well to state that in making his resolutions as to a better life he had considered much whether it would not be well for him to take a wife his father had once told him that when he married the house in carlton terrace should be his own i will be a lodger if you will have me said the duke or if your wife should not like that i will find a lodging elsewhere this had been in the sadness and tenderness which had immediately followed the death of the duchess marriage would steady him were he a married man tifto would of course disappear upon the whole he thought it would be good that he should marry and if so who could be so nice as lady mabel that his father would be contented with lady mab he was inclined to believe there was no better blood in england and lady mabel was known to be clever beautiful and in her peculiar circumstances very wise  he was aware however of a certain drawback lady mabel as his wife would be his superior and in some degree his master though not older she was wiser than heand not only wiser but more powerful also and he was not quite sure but that she regarded him as a boy he thought that she did love himor would do so if he asked herbut that her love would be bestowed upon him as on an inferior creature he was already jealous of his own dignity and fearful lest he should miss the glory of being loved by this lovely one for his own sakefor his own manhood and his own gifts and his own character  and yet his attraction to her was so great that now in the day of his sorrow he could think of no solace but what was to be found in her company  not at the oaks she said as soon as he was shown into the drawingroom  nonot at the oaks lord grex is there i suppose  oh yesthat is a matter of course why are you a recreant  the house sits today  how virtuous is it coming to thatthat when the house sits you will never be absent  thats the kind of life im going to lead you havent heard about gerald  about your brother  yesyou havent heard  not a word i hope there is no misfortune  but indeed there isa most terrible misfortune then he told the whole story how gerald had been kept in london and how he had gone down to cambridgeall in vain how his father had taken the matter to heart telling him that he had ruined his brother and how he in consequence had determined not to go to the races then he said continued silverbridge that his children between them would bring him to his grave  that was terrible  very terrible  but what did he mean by that asked lady mabel anxious to hear something about lady mary and tregear  well of course what i did at oxford made him unhappy and now there is this affair of geralds  he did not allude to your sister  yes he did you have heard of all that tregear told you  he told me something  of course my father does not like it  do you approve of it  no said hecurtly and sturdily  why not you like tregear  certainly i like tregear he is the friend among men whom i like the best i have only two real friends  who are they she asked sinking her voice very low  he is oneand you are the other you know that  i hoped that i was one she said but if you love tregear so dearly why do you not approve of him for your sister  i always knew it would not do  but why not  mary ought to marry a man of higher standing  of higher rank you mean the daughters of dukes have married commoners before  it is not exactly that i dont like to talk of it in that way i knew it would make my father unhappy in point of fact he cant marry her what is the good of approving of a thing that is impossible  i wish i knew your sister is shefirm  indeed she is  i am not so sure that you are  no said he after considering awhile nor am i but she is not like gerald or me she is more obstinate  less fickle perhaps  yes if you choose to call it fickle i dont know that i am fickle if i were in love with a girl i should be true to her  are you sure of that  quite sure if i were really in love with her i certainly should not change it is possible that i might be bullied out of it  but she will not be bullied out of it  mary no that is just it she will stick to it if he does  i would if i were she where will you find any young man equal to frank tregear  perhaps you mean to cut poor mary out  that isnt a nice thing for you to say lord silverbridge frank is my cousinas indeed you are also but it so happens that i have seen a great deal of him all my life and though i dont want to cut your sister out as you so prettily say i love him well enough to understand that any girl whom he loves ought to be true to him so far what she said was very well but she afterwards added a word which might have been wisely omitted frank and i are almost beggars  what an accursed thing money is he exclaimed jumping up from his chair  i dont agree with you at all it is a very comfortable thing  how is anybody who has got it to know if anybody cares for him  you must find that out there is such a thing i suppose as real sympathy  you tell me to my face that you and tregear would have been lovers only that you are both poor  i never said anything of the kind  and that he is to be passed on to my sister because it is supposed that she will have some money  you are putting words into my mouth which i never spoke and ideas into my mind which i never thought  and of course i feel the same about myself how can a fellow help it i wish you had a lot of money i know  it is very kind of youbut why  welli cant explain myself he said blushing as was his wont i daresay it wouldnt make any difference  it would make a great difference to me as it is having none and knowing as i do that papa and percival are getting things into a worse mess every day i am obliged to hope that i may some day marry a man who has got an income  i suppose so said he still blushing but frowning at the same time  you see i can be very frank with a real friend but i am sure of myself in thisthat i will never marry a man i do not love a girl neednt love a man unless she likes it i suppose she doesnt tumble into love as she does into the fire it would not suit me to marry a poor man and so i dont mean to fall in love with a poor man  but you do mean to fall in love with a rich one  that remains to be seen lord silverbridge the rich man will at any rate have to fall in love with me first if you know of any one you need not tell him to be too sure because he has a good income  theres popplecourt hes his own master and fool as he is he knows how to keep his money  i dont want a fool you must do better for me than lord popplecourt  what do you say to dolly longstaff  he would be just the man only he never would take the trouble to come out and be married  or glasslough  im afraid he is cross and wouldnt let me have my own way  i can only think of one otherbut you would not take him  then you had better not mention him it is no good crowding the list with impossibles  i was thinking ofmyself  you are certainly one of the impossibles  why lady mab  for twenty reasons you are too young and you are bound to oblige your father and you are to be wedded to parliamentat any rate for the next ten years and altogether it wouldnt dofor a great many reasons  i suppose you dont like me well enough  what a question to ask no my lord i do not there thats what you may call an answer dont you pretend to look offended because if you do i shall laugh at you if you may have your joke surely i may have mine  i dont see any joke in it  but i do suppose i were to say the other thing oh lord silverbridge you do me so much honour and now i come to think about it there is no one in the world i am so fond of as you would that suit you  exactly  but it wouldnt suit me theres papa dont run away  its ever so much past five said the legislator and i had intended to be in the house more than an hour ago goodbye give my love to miss cassewary  certainly miss cassewary is your most devoted friend wont you bring your sister to see me some day  when she is in town i will  i should so like to know her goodbye  as he hurried down to the house in a hansom he thought over it all and told himself that he feared it would not do she might perhaps accept him but if so she would do it simply in order that she might become duchess of omnium she might he thought have accepted him then had she chosen he had spoken plainly enough but she had laughed at him he felt that if she loved him there ought to have been something of that feminine tremor of that doubting hesitating halfavowal of which he had perhaps read in novels and which his own instincts taught him to desire but there had been no tremor nor hesitating no my lord i do not she had said when he asked her to her face whether she liked him well enough to be his wife no my lord i do not it was not the refusal conveyed in these words which annoyed him he did believe that if he were to press his suit with the usual forms she would accept him but it was that there should be such a total absence of trepidation in her words and manner before her he blushed and hesitated and felt that he did not know how to express himself if she would only have done the same then there would have been an equality then he could have seized her in his arms and sworn that never never never would he care for any one but her  in truth he saw everything as it was only too truly though she might choose to marry him if he pressed his request she would never subject herself to him as he would have the girl do whom he loved she was his superior and in every word uttered between them showed that it was so but yet how beautiful she washow much more beautiful than any other thing he had ever seen  he sat on one of the high seats behind sir timothy beeswax and sir orlando drought listening or pretending to listen to the speeches of three or four gentlemen respecting sugar thinking of all this till halfpast sevenand then he went to dine with the proud consciousness of having done his duty the forms and methods of the house were he flattered himself soaking into him graduallyas his father had desired the theory of legislation was sinking into his mind the welfare of the nation depended chiefly on sugar but he thought that after all his own welfare must depend on the possession of mab grex     chapter xx  then he will come again   lady mabel when her young lover left her was for a time freed from the necessity of thinking about him by her father he had returned from the oaks in a very bad humour lord grex had been very badly treated by his son whom he hated worse than any one else in the world on the derby day he had won a large sum of money which had been to him at the time a matter of intense delightfor he was in great want of money but on this day he had discovered that his son and heir had lost more than he had won and an arrangement had been suggested to him that his winnings should go to pay percivals losings this was a mode of settling affairs to which the earl would not listen for a moment had he possessed the power of putting a veto upon it but there had been a transaction lately between him and his son with reference to the cutting off a certain entail under which money was to be paid to lord percival this money had not yet been forthcoming and therefore the earl was constrained to assent this was very distasteful to the earl and he came home therefore in a bad humour and said a great many disagreeable things to his daughter you know papa if i could do anything i would this she said in answer to a threat which he had made often before and now repeated of getting rid altogether of the house in belgrave square whenever he made this threat he did not scruple to tell her that the house had to be kept up solely for her welfare i dont see why the deuce you dont get married youll have to do it sooner or later that was not a pleasant speech for a daughter to hear from her father as to that she said it must come or not as chance will have it if you want me to sign anything i will sign itfor she had been asked to sign papers or in other words to surrender rightsbut for that other matter it must be left to myself then he had been very disagreeable indeed  they dined out togetherof course with all the luxury that wealth can give there was a wellappointed carriage to take them backwards and forwards to the next square such as an earl should have she was splendidly dressed as became an earls daughter and he was brilliant with some star which had been accorded to him by his sovereigns grateful minister in return for staunch parliamentary support no one looking at them could have imagined that such a father could have told such a daughter that she must marry herself out of the way because as an unmarried girl she was a burden  during the dinner she was very gay to be gay was the habitwe may almost say the workof her life it so chanced that she sat between sir timothy beeswax who in these days was a very great man indeed and that very dolly longstaff whom silverbridge in his irony had proposed to her as a fitting suitor for her hand  isnt lord silverbridge a cousin of yours asked sir timothy  a very distant one  he has come over to us you know it is such a triumph  i was so sorry to hear it this however as the reader knows was a fib  sorry said sir timothy surely lord grexs daughter must be a conservative  oh yesi am a conservative because i was born one i think that people in politics should remain as they are bornunless they are very wise indeed when men come to be statesmen and all that kind of thing of course they can change backwards and forwards  i hope that is not intended for me lady mabel  certainly not i dont know enough about it to be personal that however was again not quite true but i have the greatest possible respect for the duke and i think it a pity that he should be made unhappy by his son dont you like the duke  wellyesin a way he is a most respectable man and has been a good public servant  all our lot are ruined you know said dolly talking of the races  who are your lot mr longstaff  im one myself  i suppose so  im utterly smashed then theres percival  i hope he has not lost much of course you know hes my brother  oh lawsso he is i always put my foot in it wellhe has lost a lot and so have silverbridge and tifto perhaps you dont know tifto  i have not the pleasure of knowing mr tifto  he is a major i think youd like major tifto hes a sort of racing coach to silverbridge you ought to know tifto and tregear is pretty nearly cleared out  mr tregear frank tregear  im told he has been hit very heavy i hope hes not a friend of yours lady mabel  indeed he isa very dear friend and a cousin  thats what i hear hes very much with silverbridge you know  i cannot think that mr tregear has lost money  i hope he hasnt i know i have i wish someone would stick up for me and say that it was impossible  but that is not mr tregears way of living i can understand that lord silverbridge or percival should lose money  or me  or you if you like to say so  or tifto  i dont know anything about mr tifto  major tifto  or major tiftowhat does it signify  noof course we inferior people may lose our money just as we please but a man who can look as clever as mr tregear ought to win always  i told you just now that he was a friend of mine  but dont you think that he does look clever there could be no question but that tregear when he disliked his company could show his dislike by his countenance and it was not improbable that he had done so in the presence of mr adolphus longstaff now tell the truth lady mabel does he not look conceited sometimes  he generally looks as if he knew what he was talking about which is more than some other people do  of course he is a great deal more clever than i am i know that but i dont think even he can be so clever as he looks or you so stupid thats what you ought to say now  sometimes mr longstaff i deny myself the pleasure of saying what i think  when all this was over she was very angry with herself for the anxiety she had expressed about tregear this mr longstaff was she thought exactly the man to report all she had said in the public room at the club but she had been annoyed by what she had heard as to her friend she knew that he of all men should keep himself free from such follies those others had as it were a right to make fools of themselves it had seemed so natural that the young men of her own class should dissipate their fortunes and their reputations by every kind of extravagance her father had done so and she had never even ventured to hope that her brother would not follow her fathers example but tregear if he gave way to such follies as these would soon fall headlong into a pit from which there would be no escape and if he did fall she knew herself well enough to be aware that she could not stifle nor even conceal the misery which this would occasion her as long as he stood well before the world she would be well able to assume indifference but were he to be precipitated into some bottomless misfortunes then she could only throw herself after him she could see him marry and smileand perhaps even like his wife and while he was doing so she could also marry and resolve that the husband whom she took should be made to think that he had a loving wife but were frank to diethen must she fall upon his body as though he had been known by all the world to be her lover something of this feeling came upon her now when she heard that he had been betting and had been unfortunate she had been unable so to subdue herself as to seem to be perfectly careless about it she had begun by saying that she had not believed itbut she had believed it it was so natural that tregear should have done as the others did with whom he lived but then the misfortune would be to him so terribleso irremediable the reader however may as well know at once that there was not a word of truth in the assertion  after the dinner she went home alone there were other festivities to be attended had she pleased to attend them and poor miss cassewary was dressed ready to go with her as chaperonebut miss cassewary was quite satisfied to be allowed to go to bed in lieu of mrs montacute joness great ball and she had gone to her bedroom when lady mabel went to her i am glad you are alone she said because i want to speak to you  is anything wrong  everything is wrong papa says he must give up this house  he says that almost always when he comes back from the races and very often when he comes back from the club  percival has lost ever so much  i dont think my lord will hamper himself for your brother  i cant explain it but there is some horrible money complication it is hard upon you and me  who am i said miss cassewary  about the dearest friend that ever a poor girl had it is hard upon youand upon me i have given up everythingand what good have i done  it is hard my dear  but after all i do not care much for all that the thing has been going on so long that one is used to it  what is it then  ahyeswhat is it how am i to tell you  surely you can tell me said the old woman putting out her hand so as to caress the arm of the younger one  i could tell no one else i am sure of that frank tregear has taken to gamblinglike the rest of them  who says so  he has lost a lot of money at these races a man who sat next me at dinnerone of those stupid donothing fools that one meets everywheretold me so he is one of the beargarden set and of course he knows all about it  did he say how much  how is he to pay anything of all things that men do this is the worst a man who would think himself disgraced for ever if he accepted a present of money will not scruple to use all his wits to rob his friend of everything that he has by studying the run of cards or by watching the paces of some brutes of horses and they consider themselves to be fine gentlemen a real gentleman should never want the money out of another mans pocketshould never think of money at all  i dont know how that is to be helped my dear you have got to think of money  yes i have to think of it and do think of it and because i do so i am not what i call a gentleman  nomy dear youre a lady  psha you know what i mean i might have had the feelings of a gentleman as well as the best man that ever was born i havent but i have never done anything so mean as gambling now i have got something else to tell you  what is it you do frighten me so when you look like that  you may well be frightenedfor if this all comes round i shall very soon be able to dispense with you altogether his royal highness lord silverbridge  what do you mean mabel  hes next door to a royal highness at any rate and a much more topping man than most of them well thenhis serene highness the heir of the duke of omnium has done me the inexpressible honour of asking meto marry him  no  you may well say no and to tell the truth exactly he didnt  then why do you say he did  i dont think he did quite ask me but he gave me to understand that he would do so if i gave him any encouragement  did he mean it  yespoor boy he meant it with a wordwith a look he would have been down there kneeling he asked me whether i liked him well enough what do you think i did  what did you do  i spared himout of sheer downright christian charity i said to myself love your neighbours dont be selfish do unto him as you would he should do unto youthat is think of his welfare though i had him in my net i let him go shall i go to heaven for doing that  i dont know said miss cassewary who was so much perturbed by the news she had heard as to be unable to come to any opinion on the point just raised  or maynt i rather go to the other place from how much embarrassment should i have relieved my father what a friend i should have made for percival how much i might have been able to do for frank and then what a wife i should have made him  i think you would  hell never get another half so good and hell be sure to get one before long it is a sort of tenderness that is quite inefficacious he will become a prey as i should have made him a prey but where is there another who will treat him so well  i cannot bear to hear you speak of yourself in that way  but it is true i know the sort of girl he should marry in the first place she should be two years younger and four years fresher she should be able not only to like him and love him but to worship him how well i can see her she should have fair hair and bright greengray eyes with the sweetest complexion and the prettiest little dimplestwo inches shorter than me and the delight of her life should be to hang with two hands on his arm she should have a feeling that her silverbridge is an apollo upon earth to me he is a rather foolish but very very sweettempered young mananything rather than a god if i thought that he would get the fresh young girl with the dimples then i ought to abstain  if he was in earnest said miss cassewary throwing aside all this badinage and thinking of the main point if he was in earnest he will come again  he was quite in earnest  then he will come again  i dont think he will said lady mabel i told him that i was too old for him and i tried to laugh him out of it he does not like being laughed at he has been saved and he will know it  but if he should come again  i shall not spare him again nonot twice i felt it to be hard to do so once because i so nearly love him there are so many of them who are odious to me as to whom the idea of marrying them seems to be mixed somehow with an idea of suicide  oh mabel  but he is as sweet as a rose if i were his sister or his servant or his dog i could be devoted to him i can fancy that his comfort and his success and his name should be everything to me  that is what a wife ought to feel  but i could never feel him to be my superior that is what a wife ought in truth to feel think of those two young men and the difference between them welldont look like that at me i dont often give way and i dare say after all i shall live to be the duchess of omnium then she kissed her friend and went away to her own room     chapter xxi  sir timothy beeswax   there had lately been a great conservative reaction in the country brought about in part by the industry and good management of gentlemen who were strong on that sidebut due also in part to the blunders and quarrels of their opponents that these opponents should have blundered and quarrelled being men active and in earnest was to have been expected such blunderings and quarrellings have been a matter of course since politics have been politics and since religion has been religion when men combine to do nothing how should there be disagreement when men combine to do much how should there not be disagreement thirty men can sit still each as like the other as peas but put your thirty men up to run a race and they will soon assume different forms and in doing nothing you can hardly do amiss let the doers of nothing have something of action forced upon them and they too will blunder and quarrel  the wonder is that there should ever be in a reforming party enough of consentaneous action to carry any reform the reforming or liberal party in british politics had thus stumbledand stumbled till it fell and now there had been a great conservative reaction many of the most liberal constituencies in the country had been untrue to their old political convictions and as the result lord drummond was prime minister in the house of lordswith sir timothy beeswax acting as first man in the house of commons  it cannot be denied that sir timothy had his good points as a politician he was industrious patient clearsighted intelligent courageous and determined long before he had had a seat in the house when he was simply making his way up to the probability of a seat by making a reputation as an advocate he had resolved that he would be more than an attorneygeneral more than a judgemore as he thought it than a chief justice but at any rate something different this plan he had all but gainedand it must be acknowledged that he had been moved by a grand and manly ambition but there were drawbacks to the utility and beauty of sir timothys character as a statesman he had no idea as to the necessity or nonnecessity of any measure whatever in reference to the wellbeing of the country it may indeed be said that all such ideas were to him absurd and the fact that they should be held by his friends and supporters was an inconvenience he was not in accord with those who declare that a parliament is a collection of windbags which puff and blow and crack to the annoyance of honest men but to him parliament was a debating place by having a majority in which and by no other means heor anothermight become the great man of the day by no other than parliamentary means could such a one as he come to be the chief man and this use of parliament either on his own behalf or on behalf of others had been for so many years present to his mind that there seemed to be nothing absurd in an institution supported for such a purpose parliament was a club so eligible in its nature that all englishmen wished to belong to it they who succeeded were acknowledged to be the cream of the land they who dominated in it were the cream of the cream those two who were elected to be the chiefs of the two parties had more of cream in their composition than any others but he who could be the chief of the strongest party and who therefore in accordance with the prevailing arrangements of the country should have the power of making dukes and bestowing garters and appointing bishops he who by attaining the first seat should achieve the right of snubbing all before him whether friends or foes he according to the feelings of sir timothy would have gained an elysium of creaminess not to be found in any other position on the earths surface no man was more warmly attached to parliamentary government than sir timothy beeswax but i do not think that he ever cared much for legislation  parliamentary management was his forte there have been various rocks on which men have shattered their barks in their attempts to sail successfully into the harbours of parliamentary management there is the great senator who declares to himself that personally he will have neither friend nor foe there is his country before him and its welfare within his bosom is the fire of patriotism and within his mind the examples of all past time he knows that he can be just he teaches himself to be eloquent and he strives to be wise but he will not bendand at last in some great solitude though closely surrounded by those whose love he had neglected to acquirehe breaks his heart  then there is he who seeing the misfortune of that great one tells himself that patriotism judgment industry and eloquence will not suffice for him unless he himself can be loved to do great things a man must have a great following and to achieve that he must be popular so he smiles and learns the necessary wiles he is all for his country and his friendsbut for his friends first he too must be eloquent and well instructed in the ways of parliament must be wise and diligent but in all that he does and all that he says he must first study his party it is well with him for a timebut he has closed the door of his elysium too rigidly those without gradually become stronger than his friends within and so he falls  but may not the door be occasionally opened to an outsider so that the exterior force be diminished we know how great is the pressure of water and how the peril of an overwhelming weight of it may be removed by opening the way for a small current there comes therefore the statesman who acknowledges to himself that he will be pregnable that as a statesman he should have enemies is a matter of course against moderate enemies he will hold his own but when there comes one immoderately forcible violently inimical then to that man he will open his bosom he will tempt into his camp with an offer of high command any foe that may be worth his purchase this too has answered well but there is a nemesis the loyalty of officers so procured must be open to suspicion the man who has said bitter things against you will never sit at your feet in contented submission nor will your friend of old standing long endure to be superseded by such converts  all these dangers sir timothy had seen and studied and for each of them he had hoped to be able to provide an antidote love cannot do all fear may do more fear acknowledges a superior love desires an equal love is to be created by benefits done and means gratitude which we all know to be weak but hope which refers itself to benefits to come is of all our feelings the strongest and sir timothy had parliamentary doctrines concealed in the depths of his own bosom more important even than these the statesman who falls is he who does much and thus injures many the statesman who stands the longest is he who does nothing and injures no one he soon knew that the work which he had taken in hand required all the art of a great conjuror he must be possessed of tricks so marvellous that not even they who sat nearest to him might know how they were performed  for the executive or legislative business of the country he cared little the one should be left in the hands of men who liked workof the other there should be little or if possible none but parliament must be managedand his party of patriotism he did not know the meaningfew perhaps do beyond a feeling that they would like to lick the russians or to get the better of the americans in a matter of fisheries or frontiers but he invented a pseudopatriotic conjuring phraseology which no one understood but which many admired he was ambitious that it should be said of him that he was farandaway the cleverest of his party he knew himself to be clever but he could only be farandaway the cleverest by saying and doing that which no one could understand if he could become master of some great hocuspocus system which could be made to be graceful to the ears and eyes of many which might for awhile seem to have within it some semidivine attribute which should have all but divine power of mastering the loaves and fishes then would they who followed him believe in him more firmly than other followers who had believed in their leaders when you see a young woman read a closed book placed on her dorsal vertebræif you do believe that she so reads it you think that she is endowed with a wonderful faculty and should you also be made to believe that the same young woman had direct communication with abraham by means of some invisible wire you would be apt to do a great many things as that young woman might tell you conjuring when not known to be conjuring is very effective  much no doubt of sir timothys power had come from his praiseworthy industry though he cared nothing for the making of laws though he knew nothing of finance though he had abandoned his legal studies still he worked hard and because he had worked harder in a special direction than others around him therefore he was enabled to lead them the management of a party is a very great work in itself and when to that is added the management of the house of commons a man has enough upon his hands even though he neglects altogether the ordinary pursuits of a statesman those around sir timothy were fond of their party but they were for the most part men who had not condescended to put their shoulders to the wheel as he had done had there been any very great light among them had there been a pitt or a peel sir timothy would have probably become attorneygeneral and have made his way to the benchbut there had been no pitt and no peel and he had seen his opening he had studied the ways of members parliamentary practice had become familiar to him he had shown himself to be ready at all hours to fight the battle of the party he had joined and no man knew so well as did sir timothy how to elevate a simple legislative attempt into a good faction fight he had so mastered his tricks of conjuring that no one could get to the bottom of them and had assumed a look of preternatural gravity which made many young members think that sir timothy was born to be a king of men  there were no doubt some among his older supporters who felt their thraldom grievously there were some lords in the upper house and some sons of the lords in the lowerwith pedigrees going back far enough for pridewho found it irksome to recognise sir timothy as a master no doubt he had worked very hard and had worked for them no doubt he knew how to do the work and they did not there was no other man among them to whom the lead could be conveniently transferred but yet they were uncomfortableand perhaps a little ashamed  it had arisen partly from this cause that there had been something of a counterreaction at the last general election when the houses met the ministers had indeed a majority but a much lessened majority the old liberal constituencies had returned to an expression of their real feeling this reassertion of the progress of the tide this recovery from the partial ebb which checks the violence of every flow is common enough in politics but at the present moment there were many who said that all this had been accelerated by a feeling in the country that sir timothy was hardly all that the country required as the leader of the country party     chapter xxii  the duke in his study   it was natural that at such a time when success greater than had been expected had attended the efforts of the liberals when some dozen unexpected votes had been acquired the leading politicians of that party should have found themselves compelled to look about them and see how these good things might be utilised in february they certainly had not expected to be called to power in the course of the existing session perhaps they did not expect it yet there was still a conservative majoritythough but a small majority but the strength of the minority consisted not in the fact that the majority against them was small but that it was decreasing how quickly does the snowball grow into hugeness as it is rolled onbut when the change comes in the weather how quickly does it melt and before it is gone become a thing ugly weak and formless where is the individual who does not assert to himself that he would be more loyal to a falling than to a rising friend such is perhaps the nature of each one of us but when any large number of men act together the falling friend is apt to be deserted there was a general feeling among politicians that lord drummonds ministryor sir timothyswas failing and the liberals though they could not yet count the votes by which they might hope to be supported in power nevertheless felt that they ought to be looking to their arms  there had been a coalition they who are well read in the political literature of their country will remember all about that it had perhaps succeeded in doing that for which it had been intended the queens government had been carried on for two or three years the duke of omnium had been the head of that ministry but during those years had suffered so much as to have become utterly ashamed of the coalitionso much as to have said often to himself that under no circumstances would he again join any ministry at this time there was no idea of another coalition that is a state of things which cannot come about frequentlywhich can only be reproduced by men who have never hitherto felt the mean insipidity of such a condition but they who had served on the liberal side in that coalition must again put their shoulders to the wheel of course it was in every mans mouth that the duke must be induced to forget his miseries and once more to take upon himself the duties of an active servant of the state  but they who were most anxious on the subject such men as lord cantrip mr monk our old friend phineas finn and a few others were almost afraid to approach him at the moment when the coalition was broken up he had been very bitter in spirit apparently almost arrogant holding himself aloof from his late colleaguesand since that troubles had come to him which had aggravated the soreness of his heart his wife had died and he had suffered much through his children what lord silverbridge had done at oxford was matter of general conversation and also what he had not done  that the heir of the family should have become a renegade in politics was supposed greatly to have affected the father now lord gerald had been expelled from cambridge and silverbridge was on the turf in conjunction with major tifto something too had oozed out into general ears about lady marysomething which should have been kept secret as the grave it had therefore come to pass that it was difficult even to address the duke  there was one man and but one who could do this with ease to himselfand that man was at last put into motion at the instance of the leaders of the party the old duke of st bungay wrote the following letter to the duke of omnium the letter purported to be an excuse for the writers own defalcation but the chief object of the writer was to induce the younger duke once more to submit to harness      longroyston 3rd june 187     dear duke of omnium     how quickly the things come round i had thought that i    should never again have been called upon even to think of    the formation of another liberal ministry and now though    it was but yesterday that we were all telling ourselves    that we were thoroughly manumitted from our labours by the    altered opinions of the country sundry of our old friends    are again putting their heads together     did they not do so they would neglect a manifest duty    nothing is more essential to the political wellbeing    of the country than that the leaders on both sides in    politics should be prepared for their duties but for    myself i am bound at last to put in the old plea with    a determination that it shall be respected solve    senescentem it is now if i calculate rightly exactly    fifty years since i first entered public life in obedience    to the advice of lord grey i had then already sat five    years in the house of commons i assisted humbly in the    emancipation of the roman catholics and have learned by    the legislative troubles of just half a century that those    whom we then invited to sit with us in parliament have    been in all things our worst enemies but what then had    we benefited only those who love us would not the sinners    alsoor even the torieshave done as much as that     but such memories are of no avail now i write to say that    after so much of active political life i will at last    retire my friends when they see me inspecting a pigsty    or picking a peach are apt to remind me that i can still    stand on my legs and with more of compliment than of    kindness will argue therefore that i ought still to    undertake active duties in parliament i can select my    own hours for pigs and peaches and should i through the    dotage of age make mistakes as to the breeding of the one    or the flavour of the other the harm done will not go    far in politics i have done my work what you and others    in the arena do will interest me more than all other    things of this world i think and hope to my dying day    but i will not trouble the workers with the querulousness    of old age     so much for myself and now let me as i go say a parting    word to him with whom in politics i have been for many    years more in accord than with any other leading man as    nothing but age or infirmity would to my own mind have    justified me in retiring so do i think that you who can    plead neither age nor infirmity will find yourself at    last to want selfjustification if you permit yourself    to be driven from the task either by pride or by    indifference     i should express my feelings better were i to say by pride    and diffidence i look to our old friendship to the    authority given to me by my age and to the thorough    goodness of your heart for pardon in thus accusing you    that little men should have ventured to illuse you has    hurt your pride that these little men should have been    able to do so has created your diffidence put you to    a piece of work that a man may do you have less false    pride as to the way in which you may do it than any man    i have known and let the way be open to you as little    diffidence as any but in this political mill of ours    in england a man cannot always find the way open to do    things it does not often happen that an english statesman    can go in and make a great score off his own bat but not    the less is he bound to play the game and to go to the    wicket when he finds that his time has come     there are i think two things for you to consider in this    matter and two only the first is your capacity and the    other is your duty a man may have found by experience    that he is unfitted for public life you and i have known    men in regard to whom we have thoroughly wished that such    experience had been reached but this is a matter in which    a man who doubts himself is bound to take the evidence of    those around him the whole party is most anxious for your    cooperation if this be soand i make you the assurance    from most conclusive evidenceyou are bound to accept    the common consent of your political friends on that    matter you perhaps think that at a certain period of your    life you failed they all agree with me that you did not    fail it is a matter on which you should be bound by our    opinion rather than by your own     as to that matter of duty i shall have less difficulty    in carrying you with me though this renewed task may be    personally disagreeable to you even though your tastes    should lead you to some other lifewhich i think is not    the casestill if your country wants you you should    serve your country it is a work as to which such a one    as you has no option of most of those who choose public    lifeit may be said that were they not there there    would be others as serviceable but when a man such as you    has shown himself to be necessary as long as health and    age permit he cannot recede without breach of manifest    duty the work to be done is so important the numbers to    be benefited are so great that he cannot be justified in    even remembering that he has a self     as i have said before i trust that my own age and    your goodness will induce you to pardon this great    interference but whether pardoned or not i shall always    be     your most affectionate friend     st bungay   the dukeour dukeon reading this letter was by no means pleased by its contents he could ill bear to be reminded either of his pride or of his diffidence and yet the accusations which others made against him were as nothing to those with which he charged himself he would do this till at last he was forced to defend himself against himself by asking himself whether he could be other than as god had made him it is the last and the poorest makeshift of a defence to which a man can be brought in his own court was it his fault that he was so thinskinned that all things hurt him when some coarse man said to him that which ought not to have been said was it his fault that at every word a penknife had stabbed him other men had borne these buffets without shrinking and had shown themselves thereby to be more useful much more efficacious but he could no more imitate them than he could procure for himself the skin of a rhinoceros or the tusk of an elephant and this shrinking was what men called pridewas the pride of which his old friend wrote have i ever been haughty unless in my own defence he asked himself remembering certain passages of humility in his lifeand certain passages of haughtiness also  and the duke told him also that he was diffident of course he was diffident was it not one and the same thing the very pride of which he was accused was no more than that shrinking which comes from the want of trust in oneself he was a shy man all his friends and all his enemies knew thatit was thus that he still discoursed with himselfa shy selfconscious timid shrinking thinskinned man of course he was diffident then why urge him on to tasks for which he was by nature unfitted  and yet there was much in his old friends letter which moved him there were certain words which he kept on repeating to himself he cannot be justified in even remembering that he has a self it was a hard thing to say of any man but yet a true thing of such a man as his correspondent had described his correspondent had spoken of a man who should know himself to be capable of serving the state if a man were capable and was sure within his own bosom of his own capacity it would be his duty but what if he were not so satisfied what if he felt that any labours of his would be vain and all selfabnegation useless his friend had told him that on that matter he was bound to take the opinion of others perhaps so but if so had not that opinion been given to him very plainly when he was told that he was both proud and diffident that he was called upon to serve his country by good service if such were within his power he did acknowledge freely but not that he should allow himself to be stuck up as a ninepin only to be knocked down there are politicians for whom such occupation seems to be properand who like it too a little office a little power a little rank a little pay a little niche in the ephemeral history of the year will reward many men adequately for being knocked down  and yet he loved power and even when thinking of all this allowed his mind from time to time to run away into a dreamland of prosperous political labours he thought what it would be to be an allbeneficent prime minister with a loyal majority with a wellconditioned unanimous cabinet with a grateful people and an appreciative sovereign how well might a man spend himself night and day even to death in the midst of labours such as these  half an hour after receiving the dukes letter he suddenly jumped up and sat himself down at his desk he felt it to be necessary that he should at once write to his old friendand the more necessary that he should do so at once because he had resolved that he would do so before he had made up his mind on the chief subject of that letter it did not suit him to say either that he would or that he would not do as his friend advised him the reply was made in a very few words as to myself he said after expressing his regret that the duke should find it necessary to retire from public lifeas to myself pray understand that whatever i may do i shall never cease to be grateful for your affectionate and highspirited counsels  then his mind recurred to a more immediate and for the moment a heavier trouble he had as yet given no answer to that letter from mrs finn which the reader will perhaps remember it might indeed be passed over without an answer but to him that was impossible she had accused him in the very strongest language of injustice and had made him understand that if he were unjust to her then would he be most ungrateful he looking at the matter with his own lights had thought that he had been right but had resolved to submit the question to another person as judge in the matter he had chosen lady cantrip and lady cantrip had given judgment against him  he had pressed lady cantrip for a decided opinion and she had told him that she in the same position would have done just as mrs finn had done he had constituted lady cantrip his judge and had resolved that her judgment should be final he declared to himself that he did not understand it if a mans house be on fire do you think of certain rules of etiquette before you bid him send for the engines if a wild beast be loose do you go through some ceremony before you caution the wanderers abroad there should not have been a moment but nevertheless it was now necessary that he should conform himself to the opinion of lady cantrip and in doing so he must apologise for the bitter scorn with which he had allowed himself to treat his wifes most loyal and loving friend  the few words to the duke had not been difficult but this letter seemed to be an herculean task it was made infinitely more difficult by the fact that lady cantrip had not seemed to think that this marriage was impossible young people when they have set their minds upon it do so generally prevail at last these had been her words and they discomforted him greatly she had thought the marriage to be possible had she not almost expressed an opinion that they ought to be allowed to marry and if so would it not be his duty to take his girl away from lady cantrip as to the idea that young people because they have declared themselves to be in love were to have just what they wantedwith that he did not agree at all lady cantrip had told him that young people generally did prevail at last he knew the story of one young person whose position in her youth had been very much the same as that of his daughter now and she had not prevailed and in her case had not the opposition which had been made to her wishes been most fortunate that young person had become his wife his glencora his duchess had she been allowed to have her own way when she was a child what would have been her fate ah what then he had to think of it all might she not have been alive now and perhaps happier than she had ever been with him and had he remained always unmarried devoted simply to politics would not the troubles of the world have been lighter on him but what had that to do with it in these matters it was not the happiness of this or that individual which should be considered there is a propriety in thingsand only by an adherence to that propriety on the part of individuals can the general welfare be maintained a king in this country or the heir or the possible heir to the throne is debarred from what might possibly be a happy marriage by regard to the good of his subjects to the dukes thinking the maintenance of the aristocracy of the country was second only in importance to the maintenance of the crown how should the aristocracy be maintained if its wealth were allowed to fall into the hands of an adventurer  such were the opinions with regard to his own order of one who was as truly liberal in his ideas as any man in england and who had argued out these ideas to their consequences as by the spread of education and increase of general wellbeing every proletaire was brought nearer to a duke so by such action would the duke be brought nearer to a proletaire such drawingnearer of the classes was the object to which all this mans political action tended and yet it was a dreadful thing to him that his own daughter should desire to marry a man so much beneath her own rank and fortune as frank tregear  he would not allow himself to believe that the young people could ever prevail but nevertheless as the idea of the thing had not alarmed lady cantrip as it had him it was necessary that he should make some apology to mrs finn each moment of procrastination was a prick to his conscience he now therefore dragged out from the secrecy of some close drawer mrs finns letter and read it through to himself once again yesit was true that he had condemned her and that he had punished her though he had done nothing to her and said nothing and written but very little still he had punished her most severely  she had written as though the matter was almost one of life and death to her he could understand that too his uncles conduct to this woman and his wifes had created the intimacy which had existed through their efforts she had become almost as one of the family and now to be dismissed like a servant who had misbehaved herself and then her arguments in her own defence were all so goodif only that which lady cantrip had laid down as law was to be held as law he was aware now that she had had no knowledge of the matter till his daughter had told her of the engagement at matching then it was evident also that she had sent this tregear to him immediately on her return to london and at the end of the letter she accused him of what she had been pleased to call his usual tenacity in believing ill of her he had been obstinatetoo obstinate in this respect but he did not love her the better for having told him of it  at last he did put his apology into words      my dear mrs finn     i believe i had better acknowledge to you at once that i    have been wrong in my judgment as to your conduct in a    certain matter you tell me that i owe it to you to make    this acknowledgmentand i make it the subject is as    you may imagine so painful that i will spare myself if    possible any further allusion to it i believe i did you    a wrong and therefore i write to ask your pardon     i should perhaps apologise also for delay in my reply i    have had much to think of in this matter and have many    others also on my mind     believe me to be    yours faithfully     omnium   it was very short and as being short was infinitely less troublesome at the moment than a fuller epistle but he was angry with himself knowing that it was too short feeling that it was ungracious he should have expressed a hope that he might soon see her againonly he had no such wish there had been times at which he had liked her but he knew that he did not like her now and yet he was bound to be her friend if he could only do some great thing for her and thus satisfy his feeling of indebtedness towards her but all the favours had been from her to him and his     chapter xxiii  frank tregear wants a friend   six or seven weeks had passed since tregear had made his communication to the duke and during that time he had heard not a word about the girl he loved he knew indeed that she was at the horns and probably had reason to suppose that she was being guarded there as it were out of his reach this did not surprise him nor did he regard it as a hardship it was to be expected that she should be kept out of his sight but this was a state of things to which as he thought there should not be more than a moderate amount of submission six weeks was not a very long period but it was perhaps long enough for evincing that respect which he owed to the young ladys father something must be done some day how could he expect her to be true to him unless he took some means of showing himself to be true to her  in these days he did not live very much with her brother he not only disliked but distrusted major tifto and had so expressed himself as to give rise to angry words silverbridge had said that he knew how to take care of himself tregear had replied that he had his doubts on that matter then the member of parliament had declared that at any rate he did not intend to be taken care of by frank tregear in such a state of things it was not possible that there should be any close confidence as to lady mary nor does it often come to pass that the brother is the confidant of the sisters lover brothers hardly like their sisters to have lovers though they are often well satisfied that their sisters should find husbands tregears want of rank and wealth added something to this feeling in the mind of this brother so that silverbridge though he felt himself to be deterred by friendship from any open opposition still was almost inimical it wont do you know he had said to his brother gerald shaking his head  tregear however was determined to be active in the matter to make some effort to speak to somebody but how to make an effortand to whom should he speak thinking of all this he remembered that mrs finn had sent for him and had told him to go with his love story to the duke she had been almost severe with himbut after the interview was over he had felt that she had acted well and wisely he therefore determined that he would go to mrs finn  she had as yet received no answer from the duke though nearly a fortnight had elapsed since she had written her letter during that time she had become very angry she felt that he was not treating her as a gentleman should treat a lady and certainly not as the husband of her late friend should have treated the friend of his late wife she had a proud consciousness of having behaved well to the pallisers and now this head of the pallisers was rewarding her by evil treatment she had been generous he was ungenerous she had been honest he was deficient even in that honesty for which she had given him credit and she had been unable to obtain any of that consolation which could have come to her from talking of her wrongs she could not complain to her husband because there were reasons that made it essential that her husband should not quarrel with the duke she was hot with indignation at the very moment in which tregear was announced  he began by apologising for his intrusion and she of course assured him that he was welcome after the liberty which i took with you mr tregear i am only too well pleased that you should come to see me  i am afraid he said that i was a little rough  a little warmbut that was to be expected a gentleman never likes to be interfered with on such a matter  the position was and is difficult mrs finn  and i am bound to acknowledge the very ready way in which you did what i asked you to do  and now mrs finn what is to come next  ah  something must be done you know of course that the duke did not receive me with any great favour  i did not suppose he would  nor did i of course he would object to such a marriage but a man in these days cannot dictate to his daughter what husband she should marry  perhaps he can dictate to her what husband she shall not marry  hardly that he may put impediments in the way and the duke will do so but if i am happy enough to have won the affections of his daughterso as to make it essential to her happiness that she should become my wifehe will give way  what am i to say mr tregear  just what you think  why should i be made to say what i think on so delicate a matter or of what use would be my thoughts remember how far i am removed from her  you are his friend  not at all no one less so as she said this she could not hinder the colour from coming into her face i was her friendlady glencoras but with the death of my friend there was an end of all that  you were staying with himat his request you told me so yourself  i shall never stay with him again but all that mr tregear is of no matter i do not mean to say a word against himnot a word but if you wish to interest any one as being the dukes friend then i can assure you i am the last person in london to whom you should come i know no one to whom the duke is likely to entertain feelings so little kind as towards me this she said in a peculiarly solemn way that startled tregear but before he could answer her a servant entered the room with a letter she recognised at once the dukes handwriting here was the answer for which she had been so long waiting in silent expectation she could not keep it unread till he was gone will you allow me a moment she whispered and then she opened the envelope as she read the few words her eyes became laden with tears they quite sufficed to relieve the injured pride which had sat so heavy at her heart i believe i did you a wrong and therefore i ask your pardon it was so like what she had believed the man to be she could not be longer angry with him and yet the very last words she had spoken were words complaining of his conduct this is from the duke she said putting the letter back into its envelope  oh indeed  it is odd that it should have come while you were here  is itis itabout lady mary  noat leastnot directly i perhaps spoke more harshly about him than i should have done the truth is i had expected a line from him and it had not come now it is here but i do not suppose i shall ever see much of him my intimacy was with her but i would not wish you to remember what i said just now ifif  if what mrs finn you mean perhaps if i should ever be allowed to call myself his soninlaw it may seem to you to be arrogant but it is an honour which i expect to win  faint heartyou know mr tregear  exactly one has to tell oneself that very often you will help me  certainly not she said as though she were much startled how can i help you  by telling me what i should do i suppose if i were to go down to richmond i should not be admitted  if you ask me i think notnot to see lady mary lady cantrip would perhaps see you  she is acting the part ofduenna  as i should do also if lady mary were staying with me you dont suppose that if she were here i would let her see you in my house without her fathers leave  i suppose not  certainly not and therefore i conceive that lady cantrip will not do so either  i wish she were here  it would be of no use i should be a dragon in guarding her  i wish you would let me feel that you were like a sister to me in this matter  but i am not your sister nor yet your aunt nor yet your grandmother what i mean is that i cannot be on your side  can you not  no mr tregear think how long i have known these other people  but just now you said that he was your enemy  i did say so but as i have unsaid it since you as a gentleman will not remember my words at any rate i cannot help you in this  i shall write to her  it can be nothing to me if you write she will show your letter either to her father or to lady cantrip  but she will read it first  i cannot tell how that may be in fact i am the very last person in the world to whom you should come for assistance in this matter if i gave any assistance to anybody i should be bound to give it to the duke  i cannot understand that mrs finn  nor can i explain it but it would be so i shall always be very glad to see you and i do feel that we ought to be friendsbecause i took such a liberty with you but in this matter i cannot help you  when she said this he had to take his leave it was impossible that he should further press his case upon her though he would have been very glad to extract from her some kindly word it is such a help in a difficulty to have somebody who will express even a hope that the difficulty is perhaps not invincible he had no one to comfort him in this matter there was one dear friendas a friend dearer than any otherto whom he might go and who would after some fashion bid him prosper mabel would encourage him she had said that she would do so but in making that promise she had told him that romeo would not have spoken of his love for juliet to rosaline whom he had loved before he saw juliet no doubt she had gone on to tell him that he might come to her and talk freely of his love for lady marybut after what had been said before he felt that he could not do so without leaving a sting behind when a mans love goes well with himso well as to be in some degree oppressive to him even by its prosperitywhen the young lady has jumped into his arms and the father and mother have been quite willing then he wants no confidant he does not care to speak very much of the matter which among his friends is apt to become a subject for raillery when you call a man benedick he does not come to you with ecstatic descriptions of the beauty and the wit of his beatrice but no one was likely to call him benedick in reference to lady mary  in spite of his manner in spite of his apparent selfsufficiency this man was very soft within less than two years back he had been willing to sacrifice all the world for his cousin mabel and his cousin mabel had told him that he was wrong it does not pay to sacrifice the world for love so cousin mabel had said and had added something as to its being necessary that she should marry a rich man and expedient that he should marry a rich woman he had thought much about it and had declared to himself that on no account would he marry a woman for her money then he had encountered lady mary palliser there had been no doubt no resolution after that no thinking about itbut downright love there was nothing left of real regret for his cousin in his bosom she had been right that love had been impossible but this would be possibleah so deliciously possibleif only her father and mother would assist the mother imprudent in this as in all things had assented the reader knows the rest  it was in every way possible she will have money enough the duchess had said if only her father can be brought to give it you so tregear had set his heart upon it and had said to himself that the thing was to be done then his friend the duchess had died and the real difficulties had commenced from that day he had not seen his love or heard from her how was he to know whether she would be true to him and where was he to seek for that sympathy which he felt to be so necessary to him a wild idea had come into his head that mrs finn would be his friendbut she had repudiated him  he went straight home and at once wrote to the girl the letter was a simple loveletter and as such need not be given here in what sweetest language he could find he assured her that even though he should never be allowed to see her or to hear from her that still he should cling to her and then he added this passage if your love for me be what i think it to be no one can have a right to keep us apart pray be sure that i shall not change if you change let me know itbut i shall as soon expect the heavens to fall     chapter xxiv  she must be made to obey   lady mary palliser down at the horns had as much liberty allowed to her as is usually given to young ladies in these very free days there was indeed no restriction placed upon her at all had tregear gone down to richmond and asked for the young lady and had lady cantrip at the time been out and the young lady at home it would have depended altogether upon the young lady whether she would have seen her lover or not nevertheless lady cantrip kept her eyes open and when the letter came from tregear she was aware that the letter had come but the letter found its way into lady marys hands and was read in the seclusion of her own bedroom i wonder whether you would mind reading that she said very shortly afterwards to lady cantrip what answer ought i to make  do you think any answer ought to be made my dear  oh yes i must answer him  would your papa wish it  i told papa that i would not promise not to write to him i think i told him that he should see any letters that there were but if i show them to you i suppose that will do as well  you had better keep your word to him absolutely  i am not afraid of doing so if you mean that i cannot bear to give him pain but this is a matter in which i mean to have my own way  mean to have your own way said lady cantrip much surprised by the determined tone of the young lady  certainly i do i want you to understand so much i suppose papa can keep us from marrying for ever and ever if he pleases but he never will make me say that i will give up mr tregear and if he does not yield i shall think him cruel why should he wish to make me unhappy all my life  he certainly does not wish that my dear  but he will do it  i cannot go against your father mary  no i suppose not i shall write to mr tregear and then i will show you what i have written papa shall see it too if he pleases i will do nothing secret but i will never give up mr tregear  lord cantrip came down to richmond that evening and his wife told him that in her opinion it would be best that the duke should allow the young people to marry and should give them money enough to live upon is not that a strong order asked the earl the countess acknowledged that it was a strong order but suggested that for the happiness of them all it might as well be done at first as at last  the next morning lady mary showed her a copy of the reply which she had already sent to her lover      dear frank     you may be quite sure that i shall never give you up i    will not write more at present because papa does not wish    me to do so i shall show papa your letter and my answer     your own most affectionate     mary   has it gone asked the countess  i put it myself into the pillar letterbox then lady cantrip felt that she had to deal with a very selfwilled young lady indeed  that afternoon lady cantrip asked lady mary whether she might be allowed to take the two letters up to town with the express purpose of showing them to the duke oh yes said mary i think it would be so much the best give papa my kindest love and tell him from me that if he wants to make his poor little girl happy he will forgive her and be kind to her in all this then the countess made some attempt to argue the matter there were proprieties high rank might be a blessing or might be the reverseas people thought of itbut all men acknowledged that much was due to it noblesse oblige it was often the case in life that women were called upon by circumstances to sacrifice their inclinations what right had a gentleman to talk of marriage who had no means these things she said and very many more but it was to no purpose the young lady asserted that as the gentleman was a gentleman there need be no question as to rank and that in regard to money there need be no difficulty if one of them had sufficient but you have none but what your father may give you said lady cantrip papa can give it us without any trouble said lady mary this child had a clear idea of what she thought to be her own rights being the child of rich parents she had the right to money being a woman she had a right to a husband having been born free she had a right to choose one for herself having had a mans love given to her she had a right to keep it one doesnt know which she is most like her father or her mother lady cantrip said afterwards to her husband she has his cool determination and her hotheaded obstinacy  she did show the letters to the duke and in answer to a word or two from him explained that she could not take upon herself to debar her guest from the use of the post but she will write nothing without letting you know it  she ought to write nothing at all  what she feels is much worse than what she writes  if there were no intercourse she would forget him  ah i dont know said the countess sorrowfully i thought so once  all children are determined as long as they are allowed to have their own way  i mean to say that it is the nature of her character to be obstinate most girls are prone to yield they have not character enough to stand against opposition i am not speaking now only of affairs like this it would be the same with her in any thing have you not always found it so  then he had to acknowledge to himself that he had never found out anything in reference to his daughters character she had been properly educatedat least he hoped so he had seen her grow up pretty sweet affectionate always obedient to himthe most charming plaything in the world on the few occasions in which he had allowed himself to play but as to her actual disposition he had never taken any trouble to inform himself she had been left to her motheras other girls are left and his sons had been left to their tutors and now he had no control over any of them she must be made to obey like others he said at last speaking through his teeth  there was something in this which almost frightened lady cantrip she could not bear to hear him say that the girl must be made to yield with that spirit of despotic power under which women were restrained in years now passed if she could have spoken her own mind it would have been to this effect let us do what we can to lead her away from this desire of hers and in order that we may do so let us tell her that her marriage with mr tregear is out of the question but if we do not succeedsay in the course of the next twelve monthslet us give way let us make it a matter of joy that the young man himself is so acceptable and wellbehaved that was her idea and with that she would have indoctrined the duke had she been able but his was different she must be made to obey he said and as he said it he seemed to be indifferent as to the sorrow which such enforced obedience might bring upon his child in answer to this she could only shake her head what do you mean he asked do you think we ought to yield  not at once certainly  but at last  what can you do duke if she be as firm as you can you bear to see her pine away in her misery  girls do not do like that he said  girls like men are very different they generally will yield to external influences english girls though they become the most loving wives in the world do not generally become so riven by an attachment as to become deep sufferers when it is disallowed but here i fear we have to deal with one who will suffer after this fashion  why should she not be like others  it may be so we will try but you see what she says in her letter to him she writes as though your authority were to be nothing in that matter of giving up in all that she says to me there is the same spirit if she is firm duke you must yield  never she shall never marry him with my sanction  there was nothing more to be said and lady cantrip went her way but the duke though he could say nothing more continued to think of it hour after hour he went down to the house of lords to listen to a debate in which it was intended to cover the ministers with heavy disgrace but the duke could not listen even to his own friends he could listen to nothing as he thought of the condition of his children  he had been asked whether he could bear to see his girl suffer as though he were indifferent to the sufferings of his child did he not know of himself that there was no father who would do more for the welfare of his daughter was he not sure of the tenderness of his own heart in all that he was doing was he governed by anything but a sense of duty was it personal pride or love of personal aggrandisement he thought that he could assure himself that he was open to no such charge would he not die for heror for themif he could so serve them surely this woman had accused him most wrongfully when she had intimated that he could see his girl suffer without caring for it in his indignation he determinedfor awhilethat he would remove her from the custody of lady cantrip but then where should he place her he was aware that his own house would be like a grave to a girl just fit to come out into the world in this coming autumn she must go somewherewith someone he himself in his present frame of mind would be but a sorry travelling companion  lady cantrip had said that the best hope of escape would lie in the prospect of another lover the prescription was disagreeable but it had availed in the case of his own wife before he had ever seen her as lady glencora mccloskie she had been desirous of giving herself and all her wealth to one burgo fitzgerald who had been altogether unworthy the duke could remember well how a certain old lady midlothian had first hinted to him that lady glencoras property was very large and had then added that the young lady herself was very beautiful and he could remember how his uncle the late duke who had seldom taken much trouble in merely human affairs had said a word or twoi have heard a whisper about you and lady glencora mccloskie nothing could be better the result had been undoubtedly good his cora and all her money had been saved from a worthless spendthrift he had found a wife who he now thought had made him happy and she had found at any rate a respectable husband the idea when picked to pieces is not a nice idea let us look out for a husband for this girl so that we may get her marriedout of the way of her lover it is not nice but it had succeeded in one case and why should it not succeed in another  but how was it to be done who should do it whom should he select to play the part which he had undertaken in that other arrangement no worse person could be found than himself for managing such an affair when the idea had first been raised he had thought that lady cantrip would do it all but now he was angry with lady cantrip  how was it to be done how should it be commenced how had it been commenced in his own case he did not in the least know how he had been chosen was it possible that his uncle who was the proudest man in england should have condescended to make a bargain with an old dowager whom everybody had despised and in what way had he been selected no doubt he had been known to be the heirapparent to a dukedom and to ducal revenues in his case old lady midlothian had begun the matter with him it occurred to him that in royal marriages such beginnings are quite common  but who should be the happy man then he began to count up the requisite attributes he must be of high rank and an eldest son and the possessor of or the heir to a good estate he did despise himself when he found that he put these things firstas a matter of course nevertheless he did put them first he was ejecting this other man because he possessed none of these attributes he hurried himself on to add that the man must be of good character and such as a young girl might learn to love but yet he was aware that he added these things for his consciences sake tregears character was good and certainly the girl loved him but was it not clear to all who knew anything of such matters that mr francis tregear should not have dared even to think of marrying the daughter of the duke of omnium  who should be the happy man there were so many who evidently were unfit young lord percival was heir to a ruined estate and a beggared peerage lord glasslough was odious to all men there were three or four others of whom he thought that he knew some fatal objection but when he remembered lord popplecourt there seemed to be no objection which need be fatal  lord popplecourt was a young peer whose father had died two years since and whose estates were large and unembarrassed the late lord who had been a whig of the old fashion had been the dukes friend they had been at oxford and in the house of commons together and lord popplecourt had always been true to his party as to the son the duke remembered to have heard lately that he was not given to waste his money he drove a coach about london a good deal but had as yet not done anything very foolish he had taken his degree at oxford thereby showing himself to be better than silverbridge he had also taken his seat in the house of lords and had once opened his mouth he had not indeed appeared often again but at lord popplecourts age much legislation is not to be expected from a young peer then he thought of the mans appearance popplecourt was not specially attractive whereas tregear was a very handsome man but so also had been burgo fitzgeraldalmost abnormally beautiful while he plantagenet palliser as he was then had been quite as insignificant in appearance as lord popplecourt  lord popplecourt might possibly do but then how should the matter be spoken of to the young man after all would it not be best that he should trust lady cantrip     chapter xxv  a family breakfasttable   lord silverbridge had paid all his derby losses without any difficulty they had not been very heavy for a man in his position and the money had come without remonstrance when asking for it he was half ashamed of himself but could still find consolation by remembering how much worse had befallen many young men whom he knew he had never plunged in fact he had made the most prudent book in the world and had so managed affairs that even now the horse which had been beaten was worth more than all he had lost and paid this is getting serious he had said to his partner when on making out a rough account he had brought the major in a debtor to him of more than a thousand pounds the major had remarked that as he was halfowner of the horses his partner had good security for the money then something of an unwritten arrangement was made the prime minister was now one of the favourites for the leger if the horse won that race there would be money enough for everything if that race were lost then there should be a settlement by the transfer of the stud to the younger partner hes safe to pull it off said the major  at this time both his sons were living with the duke in london it had been found impracticable to send lord gerald back to cambridge the doors of trinity were closed against him but some interest had been made in his favour and he was to be transferred to oxford all the truth had been told and there had been a feeling that the lad should be allowed another chance he could not however go to his new alma mater till after the long vacation in the meantime he was to be taken by a tutor down to a cottage on dartmoor and there be made to readwith such amusement in the meantime as might be got from fishing and playing cricket with the west devon county club it isnt a very bright lookout for the summer his brother had said to him but its better than breaking out on the loose altogether you be a credit to the family and all that sort of thing then ill give up the borough to you but mind you stick to the liberals ive made an ass of myself however in these early days of june lord gerald had not yet got his tutor  though the father and the two young men were living together they did not see very much of each other the duke breakfasted at nine and the repast was a very simple one when they failed to appear he did not scoldbut would simply be disappointed at dinner they never met it was supposed that lord gerald passed his mornings in reading and some little attempts were made in that direction it is to be feared they did not come to much silverbridge was very kind to gerald feeling an increased tenderness for him on account of that cambridge mishap now they were much together and occasionally by a strong effort would grace their fathers breakfasttable with their company  it was not often that he either reproached them or preached to them though he could not live with them on almost equal terms as some fathers can live with their sons though he could not laugh at their fun or make them laugh at his wit he knew that it would have been better both for him and them if he had possessed this capacity though the life which they lived was distasteful to himthough racehorses were an abomination to him and the driving of coaches a folly and clublife a manifest waste of time still he recognised these things as being if not necessary yet unavoidable evils to gerald he would talk about oxford avoiding all allusions to past cambridge misfortunes but in the presence of silverbridge whose oxford career had been so peculiarly unfortunate he would make no allusion to either of the universities to his eldest son he would talk of parliament which of all subjects would have been the most congenial had they agreed in politics as it was he could speak more freely to him on that than any other matter  one thursday night as the two brothers went to bed on returning from the beargarden at a not very late hour they agreed that they would give the governor a turn the next morningby which they meant that they would drag themselves out of bed in time to breakfast with him the worst of it is that he never will let them get anything to eat said gerald but silverbridge explained that he had taken that matter into his own hands and had specially ordered broiled salmon and stewed kidneys he wont like it you know said gerald im sure he thinks it wicked to eat anything but toasted bacon before lunch  at a very little after nine silverbridge was in the breakfastroom and there found his father i suppose gerald is not up yet said the duke almost crossly  oh yes he is sir hell be here directly  have you seen him this morning  no i havent seen him but i know hell be here he said he would last night  you speak of it as if it were an undertaking  no not that sir but we are not always quite up to time  no indeed you are not perhaps you sit late at the house  sometimes i do said the young member with a feeling almost akin to shame as he remembered all the hours spent at the beargarden i have had gerald there in the gallery sometimes it is just as well he should know what is being done  quite as well  i shouldnt wonder if he gets a seat some day  i dont know how that may be  he wont change as i have done hell stick to your side indeed i think hed do better in the house than i shall he has more gift of the gab  that is not the first thing requisite  i know all that sir ive read your letter more than once and i showed it to him  there was something sweet and pleasant in the young mans manner by which the father could hardly not be captivated they had now sat down and the servant had brought in the unusual accessories for a morning feast what is all that asked the duke  gerald and i are so awfully hungry of a morning said the son apologising  wellits a very good thing to be hungrythat is if you can get plenty to eat salmon is it i dont think ill have any myself kidneys not for me i think ill take a bit of fried bacon i also am hungry but not awfully hungry  you never seem to me to eat anything sir  eating is an occupation from which i think a man takes the more pleasure the less he considers it a rural labourer who sits on the ditchside with his bread and cheese and an onion has more enjoyment out of it than any lucullus  but he likes a good deal of it  i do not think he ever overeats himselfwhich lucullus does i have envied a ploughman his powerhis dura iliabut never an epicure the appreciative skill of his palate if gerald does not make haste he will have to exercise neither the one nor the other upon that fish  i will leave a bit for him sirand here he is you are twenty minutes late gerald my father says that bread and cheese and onions would be better for you than salmon and stewed kidneys  no silverbridgei said no such thing but that if he were a hedger and ditcher the bread and cheese and onions would be as good  i should not mind trying them at all said gerald only one never does have such things for breakfast last winter a lot of us skated to ely and we ate two or three loaves of bread and a whole cheese at a pothouse and as for beer we drank the public dry  it was because for the time you had been a hedger and ditcher  proby was a ditcher i know when he went right through into one of the dykes just push on that dish silverbridge its no good you having the trouble of helping me halfadozen times i dont think things are a bit the nicer because they cost a lot of money i suppose that is what you mean sir  something of that kind gerald not to have money for your wantsthat must be troublesome  very bad indeed said silverbridge shaking his head wisely as a member of parliament might do who felt that something should be done to put down such a lamentable state of things  i dont complain said gerald no fellow ever had less right to complain but i never felt that i had quite enough of course it was my own fault  i should say so my boy but then there are a great many like you let their means be what they may they never have quite enough to be in any difficulty with regard to moneyto owe what you cannot pay or even to have to abstain from things which you have told yourself are necessary to yourself or to those who depend on youcreates a feeling of meanness  that is what i have always felt said silverbridge i cannot bear to think that i should like to have a thing and that i cannot afford it  you do not quite understand me i fear the only case in which you can be justified in desiring that which you cannot afford is when the thing is necessaryas bread may be or clothes  as when a fellow wants a lot of new breeches before he has paid his tailors bill  as when a poor man said the duke impressively may long to give his wife a new gown or his children boots to keep their feet from the mud and snow then he paused a moment but the serious tone of his voice and the energy of his words had sent gerald headlong among his kidneys i say that in such cases money must be regarded as a blessing  a tenpound note will do so much said silverbridge  but beyond that it ought to have no power of conferring happiness and certainly cannot drive away sorrow not though you build palaces out into the deep can that help you you read your horace i hope scandunt eodum quo dominus minæ  i recollect that said gerald black care sits behind the horseman  even though he have a groom riding after him beautiful with exquisite boots as far as i have been able to look out into the world  i suppose you know it as well as anybody said silverbridgewho was simply desirous of making himself pleasant to the dear old governor  as far as my experience goes the happiest man is he who being above the troubles which money brings has his hands the fullest of work if i were to name the class of men whose lives are spent with the most thorough enjoyment i think i should name that of barristers who are in large practice and also in parliament  isnt it a great grind sir asked silverbridge  a very great grind as you call it and there may be the grind and not the success but he had now got up from his seat at the table and was standing with his back against the chimneypiece and as he went on with his lectureas the word but came from his lipshe struck the fingers of one hand lightly on the palm of the other as he had been known to do at some happy flight of oratory in the house of commons but it is the grind that makes the happiness to feel that your hours are filled to overflowing that you can barely steal minutes enough for sleep that the welfare of many is entrusted to you that the world looks on and approves that some good is always being done to othersabove all things some good to your countrythat is happiness for myself i can conceive none other  books suggested gerald as he put the last morsel of the last kidney into his mouth  yes books cicero and ovid have told us that to literature only could they look for consolation in their banishment but then they speak of a remedy for sorrow not of a source of joy no young man should dare to neglect literature at some period of his life he will surely need consolation and he may be certain that should he live to be an old man there will be none otherexcept religion but for that feeling of selfcontentment which creates happinesshard work and hard work alone can give it to you  books are hard work themselves sometimes said gerald  as for money continued the father not caring to notice this interruption if it be regarded in any other light than as a shield against want as a rampart under the protection of which you may carry on your battle it will fail you i was born a rich man  few people have cared so little about it as you said the elder son  and you both of you have been born to be rich this assertion did not take the elder brother by surprise it was a matter of course but lord gerald who had never as yet heard anything as to his future destiny from his father was interested by the statement when i think of all thisof what constitutes happinessi am almost tempted to grieve that it should be so  if a large fortune were really a bad thing said gerald a man could i suppose get rid of it  noit is a thing of which a man cannot get ridunless by shameful means it is a burden which he must carry to the end  does anybody wish to get rid of it as sindbad did of the old man asked gerald pertinaciously at any rate i have enjoyed the kidneys  you assured us just now that the bread and cheese at ely were just as good the duke as he said this looked as though he knew that he had taken all the wind out of his adversarys sails though you add carriage to carriage you will not be carried more comfortably  a second horse out hunting is a comfort said silverbridge  then at any rate dont desire a third for show but such comforts will cease to be joys when they become matters of course that a boy who does not see a pudding once a year should enjoy a pudding when it comes i can understand but the daily pudding or the pudding twice a day is soon no more than simple daily breadwhich will or will not be sweet as it shall or shall not have been earned then he went slowly to the door but as he stood with the handle of it in his hand he turned round and spoke another word when hereafter gerald you may chance to think of that bread and cheese at ely always remember that you had skated from cambridge  the two brothers then took themselves to some remote part of the house where arrangements had been made for smoking and there they finished the conversation i was very glad to hear what he said about you old boy this of course came from silverbridge  i didnt quite understand him  he meant you to understand that you wouldnt be like other younger brothers  then what i have will be taken from you  there is lots for three or four of us i do agree that if a fellow has as much as he can spend he ought not to want anything more morton was telling me the other day something about the settled estates i sat in that office with him all one morning i could not understand it all but i observed that he said nothing about the scotch property youll be a laird and i wish you joy with all my heart the governor will tell you all about it before long hes going to have two eldest sons  what an unnatural piece of cruelty to meand so unnecessary  why  he says that a property is no better than a burden but ill try and bear it     chapter xxvi  dinner at the beargarden   the duke was in the gallery of the house of commons which is devoted to the use of peers and silverbridge having heard that his father was there had come up to him it was then about halfpast five and the house had settled down to business prayers had been read petitions had been presented and ministers had gone through their course of baiting with that equanimity and air of superiority which always belongs to a welltrained occupant of the treasury bench  the duke was very anxious that his son should attend to his parliamentary duties but he was too proud a man and too generous to come to the house as a spy it was his present habit always to be in his own place when the lords were sitting and to remain there while the lords sat it was not for many reasons an altogether satisfactory occupation but it was the best which his life afforded him he would never however come across into the other house without letting his son know of his coming and lord silverbridge had on this occasion been on the lookout and had come up to his father at once dont let me take you away said the duke if you are particularly interested in your chiefs defence for sir timothy beeswax was defending some measure of legal reform in which he was said to have fallen into trouble  i can hear it up here you know sir  hardly if you are talking to me  to tell the truth its a matter i dont care much about theyve got into some mess as to the number of judges and what they ought to do finn was saying that they had so arranged that there was one judge who never could possibly do anything  if mr finn said so it would probably be so with some little allowance for irish exaggeration he is a clever man with less of his countrys hyperbole than othersbut still not without his share  you know him well i suppose  yesas one man does know another in the political world  but he is a friend of yours i dont mean an honourable friend which is great bosh but you know him at home  oh yescertainly he has been staying with me at matching in public life such intimacies come from politics  you dont care very much about him then  the duke paused a moment before he answered yes i doand in what i said just now perhaps i wronged him i have been under obligations to mr finnin a matter as to which he behaved very well i have found him to be a gentleman if you come across him in the house i would wish you to be courteous to him i have not seen him since we came from abroad i have been able to see nobody but if ever again i should entertain my friends at my table mr finn would be one who would always be welcome there this he said with a sadly serious air as though wishing that his words should be noted at the present moment he was remembering that he owed recompense to mrs finn and was making an effort to pay the debt but your leader is striking out into unwonted eloquence surely we ought to listen to him  sir timothy was a fluent speaker and when there was nothing to be said was possessed of great plenty of words and he was gifted with that peculiar power which enables a man to have the last word in every encountera power which we are apt to call repartee which is in truth the readiness which comes from continual practice you shall meet two men of whom you shall know the one to be endowed with the brilliancy of true genius and the other to be possessed of but moderate parts and shall find the former never able to hold his own against the latter in a debate the man of moderate parts will seem to be greater than the man of genius but this skill of tongue this glibness of speech is hardly an affair of intellect at all it isas is style to the writernot the wares which he has to take to market but the vehicle in which they may be carried of what avail to you is it to have filled granaries with corn if you cannot get your corn to the consumer now sir timothy was a great vehicle but he had not in truth much corn to send he could turn a laugh against an adversaryno man better he could seize at the moment every advantage which the opportunity might give him the treasury bench on which he sat and the big box on the table before him were to him fortifications of which he knew how to use every stone the cheers and the jeers of the house had been so measured by him that he knew the value and force of every sound politics had never been to him a study but to parliamentary strategy he had devoted all his faculties no one knew so well as sir timothy how to make arrangements for business so that every detail should be troublesome to his opponents he could foresee a month beforehand that on a certain day a royal concert would make the house empty and would generously give that day to a less observant adversary he knew how to blind the eyes of members to the truth those on the opposite side of the house would find themselves checkmated by his astutenesswhen with all their pieces on the board there should be none which they could move and this to him was government it was to these purposes that he conceived that a great statesman should devote himself parliamentary management that in his mind was under this constitution of ours the one act essential for government  in all this he was very great but when it might fall to his duty either to suggest or to defend any real piece of proposed legislation he was less happy on this occasion he had been driven to take the matter in hand because he had previously been concerned in it as a lawyer he had allowed himself to wax angry as he endeavoured to answer certain personal criticisms now sir timothy was never stronger than when he simulated anger his mock indignation was perhaps his most powerful weapon but real anger is a passion which few men can use with judgment and now sir timothy was really angry and condescended to speak of our old friend phineas who had made the onslaught as a bellicose irishman there was an overtrue story as to our friend having once been seduced into fighting a duel and those who wished to decry him sometimes alluded to the adventure sir timothy had been called to order but the speaker had ruled that bellicose irishman was not beyond the latitude of parliamentary animadversion then sir timothy had repeated the phrase with emphasis and the duke hearing it in the gallery had made his remark as to the unwonted eloquence of his sons parliamentary chief  surely we ought to listen to him said the duke and for a short time they did listen sir timothy is not a man i like you know said the son feeling himself obliged to apologise for his subjection to such a chief  i never particularly loved him myself  they say that he is a sort of necessity  a conservative fate said the duke  well yes he is soso awfully clever we all feel that we could not get on without him when you were in he was one of your party  oh yeshe was one of us i have no right to complain of you for using him but when you say you could not get on without him does it not occur to you that should helet us say be taken up to heavenyou would have to get on without him  then he would beout of the way sir  what you mean perhaps is that you do not know how to get rid of him  of course i dont pretend to understand much about it but they all think that he does know how to keep the party together i dont think we are proud of him  hardly that  he is awfully useful a man has to look out so sharp to be always ready for those other fellows i beg your pardon sir but i mean your side  i understand who the other fellows are  and it isnt everybody who will go through such a grind a man to do it must be always ready he has so many little things to think of as far as i can see we all feel that we could not get along very well without him upon the whole the duke was pleased with what he heard from his son the young mans ideas about politics were boyish but they were the ideas of a clearheaded boy silverbridge had picked up some of the ways of the place though he had not yet formed any sound political opinions  then sir timothy finished a long speech with a flowery peroration in which he declared that if parliament were desirous of keeping the realms of her majesty free from the invasions of foreigners it must be done by maintaining the dignity of the judicial bench there were some clamours at this and although it was now dinnertime phineas finn who had been called a bellicose irishman was able to say a word or two the right honourable gentleman no doubt means said phineas that we must carry ourselves with some increased external dignity the world is bewigging itself and we must buy a bigger wig than any we have got in order to confront the world with proper selfrespect turveydrop and deportment will suffice for us against any odds  about halfpast seven the house became very empty where are you going to dine sir asked silverbridge the duke with something like a sigh said he supposed he should dine at home  you never were at the beargardenwere you sir asked silverbridge suddenly  never said the duke  come and dine with me  i am not a member of the club  we dont care at all about that anybody can take in anybody  does not that make it promiscuous  wellno i dont know that it does it seems to go on very well i daresay there are some cads there sometimes but i dont know where one doesnt meet cads there are plenty in the house of commons  there is something in that silverbridge which makes me think that you have not realised the difference between private and public life in the former you choose your own associates and are responsible for your choice in the latter you are concerned with others for the good of the state and though even for the states sake you would not willingly be closely allied with those whom you think dishonest the outward manners and fashions of life need create no barriers i should not turn up my nose at the house of commons because some constituency might send them an illiterate shoemaker but i might probably find the illiterate shoemaker an unprofitable companion for my private hours  i dont think there will be any shoemakers at the beargarden  even if there were i would go and dine with you i shall be glad to see the place where you i suppose pass many hours  i find it a very good shop to dine at the place at the house is so stuffy and nasty besides one likes to get away for a little time  certainly i never was an advocate for living in the house one should always change the atmosphere then they got into a cab and went to the club silverbridge was a little afraid of what he was doing the invitation had come from him on the spur of the moment and he hardly ventured to think that his father would accept it and now he did not quite know how the duke would go through the ceremony the other fellows would all come and stare at a man whom they had all been taught to regard as the most unbeargardenish of men but he was especially anxious to make things pleasant for his father  what shall i order said the son as he took the duke into a dressingroom to wash his hands the duke suggested that anything sufficient for his son would certainly be sufficient for him  nothing especial occurred during the dinner which the duke appeared to enjoy very much yes i think it is very good soup he said i dont think they ever give me any soup at home then the son expressed his opinion that unless his father looked about rather more sharply they very soon would provide no dinner at all remarking that experience had taught him that the less people demanded the more they were sat upon the duke did like his dinneror rather he liked the feeling that he was dining with his son a report that the duke of omnium was with lord silverbridge soon went round the room and they who were justified by some previous acquaintance came up to greet him to all who did so he was very gracious and was specially so to lord popplecourt who happened to pass close by the table  i think he is a fool whispered silverbridge as soon as popplecourt had passed  what makes you think so  we thought him an ass at eton  he has done pretty well however  oh yes in a way  somebody has told me that he is a careful man about his property  i believe he is all that said silverbridge  then i dont see why you should think him a fool  to this silverbridge made no reply partly perhaps because he had nothing to saybut hindered also by the coming in of tregear this was an accident the possibility of which had not crossed him unfortunately too the dukes back was turned so that tregear as he walked up the room could not see who was sitting at his friends table tregear coming up stood close to the dukes elbow before he recognised the man and spoke some word or two to silverbridge how do you do mr tregear said the duke turning round  oh my lord i did not know that it was you  you hardly would i am quite a stranger here silverbridge and i came up from the house together and he has been hospitable enough to give me a dinner i will tell you an odd thing for a london man mr tregear i have not dined at a london club for fifteen years before this  i hope you like it sir said silverbridge  very much indeed goodevening mr tregear i suppose you have to go to your dinner now  then they went into one of the rooms upstairs to have coffee the son declining to go into the smokingroom and assuring his father that he did not in the least care about a cigar after dinner you would be smothered sir the duke did as he was bidden and went upstairs there was in truth a strong reason for avoiding the publicity of the smokingroom when bringing his father to the club he had thought nothing about tregear but he had thought about tifto as he entered he had seen tifto at a table dining alone and had bobbed his head at him then he had taken the duke to the further end of the room and had trusted that fear would keep the major in his place fear had kept the major in his place when the major learned who the stranger was he had become silent and reserved before the father and son had finished their dinner tifto had gone to his cigar and so that danger was over  by george theres silverbridge has got his governor to dinner said tifto standing in the middle of the room and looking round as though he were announcing some confusion of the heavens and earth  why shouldnt lord silverbridge have his father to dine with him asked mr lupton  i believe i know silverbridge as well as any man and by george it is the very last thing of the kind that i should have expected there have been no end of quarrels  there has been no quarrel at all said tregear who had then just entered the room nothing on earth would make silverbridge quarrel with his father and i think it would break the dukes heart to quarrel with his son tifto endeavoured to argue the matter out but tregear having made the assertion on behalf of his friend would not allow himself to be enticed into further speech nevertheless there was a good deal said by others during which the major drank two glasses of whiskyandwater in the diningroom he had been struck with awe by the dukes presence and had certainly no idea of presenting himself personally to the great man but bacchus lent him aid and when the discussion was over and the whisky had been swallowed it occurred to him that he would go upstairs and ask to be introduced  in the meantime the duke and his son were seated in close conversation on one of the upstairs sofas it was a rule at the beargarden that men might smoke all over the house except in the diningroombut there was one small chamber called the library in which the practice was not often followed the room was generally deserted and at this moment the father and son were the only occupants a club said the duke as he sipped his coffee is a comfortable and economical residence a man gets what he wants wellserved and gets it cheap but it has its drawbacks  you always see the same fellows said silverbridge  a man who lives much at a club is apt to fall into a selfish mode of life he is taught to think that his own comfort should always be the first object a man can never be happy unless his first objects are outside himself personal selfindulgence begets a sense of meanness which sticks to a man even when he has got beyond all hope of rescue it is for that reasonamong othersthat marriage is so desirable  a man should marry i suppose  unless a man has on his shoulders the burden of a wife and children he should i think feel that he has shirked out of school he is not doing his share of the work of the commonwealth  pitt was not married sir  noand a great many other good men have remained unmarried do you mean to be another pitt  i dont intend to be a prime minister  i would not recommend you to entertain that ambition pitt perhaps hardly had time for marriage you may be more lucky  i suppose i shall marry some day  i should be glad to see you marry early said the duke speaking in a low voice almost solemnly but in his quietest sweetest tone of voice you are peculiarly situated though as yet you are only the heir to the property and honours of our family still were you married almost everything would be at your disposal there is so much which i should only be too ready to give up to you  i cant bear to hear you talking of giving up anything said silverbridge energetically  then the father looked round the room furtively and seeing that the door was shut and that they were assuredly alone he put out his hand and gently stroked the young mans hair it was almost a caressas though he would have said to himself were he my daughter i would kiss him there is much i would fain give up he said if you were a married man the house in carlton terrace would be fitter for you than for me i have disqualified myself for taking that part in society which should be filled by the head of our family you who have inherited so much from your mother would if you married pleasantly do all that right well he paused for a moment and then asked a straightforward question very quicklyyou have never thought of any one yet i suppose  silverbridge had thought very much of somebody he was quite aware that he had almost made an offer to lady mabel she certainly had not given him any encouragement but the very fact that she had not done so allured him the more he did believe that he was thoroughly in love with lady mabel she had told him that he was too youngbut he was older than lady mab herself by a week she was beautifulthat was certain it was acknowledged by all that she was clever as for blood of which he believed his father thought much there was perhaps none better in england he had heard it said of heras he now well remembered in his fathers presencethat she had behaved remarkably well in trying circumstances she had no fortuneeverybody knew that but then he did not want fortune would not this be a good opportunity for breaking the matter to his father you have never thought of any one said the dukeagain very sweetly very softly  but i have lord silverbridge as he made the announcement blushed up to the eyes  then there came over the father something almost of fear if he was to be told how would it be if he could not approve  yes i have said silverbridge recovering himself if you wish it i will tell you who it is  nay my boyas to that consult your own feelings are you sure of yourself  oh yes  have you spoken to her  wellyes in part she has not accepted me if you mean that rather the contrary now the duke would have been very unwilling to say that his son would certainly be accepted by any girl in england to whom he might choose to offer his hand but when the idea of a doubt was suggested to him it did seem odd that his son should ask in vain what other young man was there who could offer so much and who was at the same time so likely to be loved for his own sake he smiled however and was silent i suppose i may as well out with it continued silverbridge you know lady mabel grex  lady mabel grex yesi know her  is there any objection  is she not your senior  no sir no she is younger than i am  her father is not a man i esteem  but she has always been so good then the duke was again silent have you not heard that sir  i think i have  is not that a great deal  a very great deal to be good must of all qualities be the best she is very beautiful  i think so sir of course she has no money  it is not needed it is not needed i have no objection to make if you are sure of your own mind  i am quite sure of that sir  then i will raise no objection lady mabel grex her father i fear is not a worthy man i hear that he is a gambler  he is so poor  that makes it worse silverbridge a man who gambles because he has money that he can afford to lose is to my thinking a fool but he who gambles because he has none iswell let us hope the best of him you may give her my love  she has not accepted me  but should she do so you may  she almost rejected me but i am not sure that she was in earnest and i mean to try again just at that moment the door was opened and major tifto walked into the room     chapter xxvii  major tifto and the duke   i beg your pardon silverbridge said the major entering the room but i was looking for longstaff  he isnt here said silverbridge who did not wish to be interrupted by his racing friend  your father i believe said tifto he was red in the face but was in other respects perhaps improved in appearance by his liquor in his more sober moments he was not always able to assume that appearance of equality with his companions which it was the ambition of his soul to achieve but a second glass of whiskyandwater would always enable him to cock his tail and bark before the company with all the courage of my ladys pug would you do me the great honour to introduce me to his grace  silverbridge was not prone to turn his back upon a friend because he was low in the world he had begun to understand that he had made a mistake by connecting himself with the major but at the club he always defended his partner though he not unfrequently found himself obliged to snub the major himself he always countenanced the little master of hounds and was true to his own idea of standing to a fellow nevertheless he did not wish to introduce his friend to his father the duke saw it all at a glance and felt that the introduction should be made perhaps said he getting up from his chair this is major tifto  yesmy lord duke i am major tifto  the duke bowed graciously  my father and i were engaged about private matters said silverbridge  i beg ten thousand pardons exclaimed the major i did not intend to intrude  i think we had done said the duke pray sit down major tifto the major sat down though now i bethink myself i have to beg your pardonthat i a stranger should ask you to sit down in your own club  dont mention it my lord duke  i am so unused to clubs that i forgot where i was  quite so my lord duke i hope you think that silverbridge is looking well  yesyes i think so  silverbridge bit his lips and turned his face away to the door  we didnt make a very good thing of our derby nag the other day perhaps your grace has heard all that  i did hear that the horse in which you are both interested had failed to win the race  yes he did the prime minister we call him your graceout of compliment to a certain ministry which i wish it was going on today instead of the seedy lot weve got in i think my lord duke that any one you may ask will tell you that i know what running is welli can assure youyour grace that isthat since ive seen orses ive never seen a orse fitter than him when he got his canter that morning it was nearly even betting not that i or silverbridge were fools enough to put on anything at that rate but i never saw a orse so bad ridden i dont mean to say anything my lord duke against the man but if that fellow hadnt been squared or else wasnt drunk or else wasnt off his head that orse must have wonmy lord duke  i do not know anything about racing major tifto  i suppose not your grace but as i and silverbridge are together in this matter i thought id just let your grace know that we ought to have had a very good thing i thought that perhaps your grace might like to know that  tifto you are making an ass of yourself said silverbridge  making an ass of myself exclaimed the major  yesconsiderably  i think you are a little hard upon your friend said the duke with an attempt at a laugh it is not to be supposed that he should know how utterly indifferent i am to everything connected with the turf  i thought my lord duke you might care about learning how silverbridge was going on this the poor little man said almost with a whine his partners roughness had knocked out of him nearly all the courage which bacchus had given him  so i do anything that interests him interests me but perhaps of all his pursuits racing is the one to which i am least able to lend an attentive ear that every horse has a head and that all did have tails till they were illused is the extent of my stable knowledge  very good indeed my lord duke very good indeed ha ha haall horses have heads and all have tails heads and tails upon my word that is the best thing i have heard for a long time i will do myself the honour of wishing your grace goodnight bybye silverbridge then he left the room having been made supremely happy by what he considered to have been the dukes joke nevertheless he would remember the snubbing and would be even with silverbridge some day did lord silverbridge think that he was going to look after his lordships orses and do this always on the square and then be snubbed for doing it  i am very sorry that he should have come in to trouble you said the son  he has not troubled me much i do not know whether he has troubled you if you are coming down to the house again i will walk with you silverbridge of course had to go down to the house again and they started together that man did not trouble me silverbridge but the question is whether such an acquaintance must not be troublesome to you  im not very proud of him sir  but i think one ought to be proud of ones friends  he isnt my friend in that way at all  in what way then  he understands racing  he is the partner of your pleasure thenthe man in whose society you love to enjoy the recreation of the racecourse  it is sir because he understands it  i thought that a gentleman on the turf would have a trainer for that purposenot a companion you mean to imply that you can save money by leaguing yourself with major tifto  no sirindeed  if you associate with him not for pleasure then it surely must be for profit that you should do the former would be to me so surprising that i must regard it as impossible that you should do the latteris i think a reproach this he said with no tone of anger in his voiceso gently that silverbridge at first hardly understood it but gradually all that was meant came in upon him and he felt himself to be ashamed of himself  he is bad he said at last  whether he be bad i will not say but i am sure that you can gain nothing by his companionship  i will get rid of him said silverbridge after a considerable pause i cannot do so at once but i will do it  it will be better i think  tregear has been telling me the same thing  is he objectionable to mr tregear asked the duke  oh yes tregear cannot bear him you treated him a great deal better than tregear ever does  i do not deny that he is entitled to be treated wellbut so also is your groom let us say no more about him and so it is to be mabel grex  i did not say so sir how can i answer for her only it was so pleasant for me to know that you would approve if it should come off  yesi will approve when she has accepted you  but i dont think she will  if she should tell her that i will go to her at once it will be much to have a new daughtervery much that you should have a wife where would she like to live  oh sir we havent got as far as that yet  i dare say not i dare say not said the duke gatherum is always thought to be dull  she wouldnt like gatherum im sure  have you asked her  no sir but nobody ever did like gatherum  i suppose not and yet silverbridge what a sum of money it cost  i believe it did  all vanity and vexation of spirit  the duke no doubt was thinking of certain scenes passed at the great house in question which scenes had not been delightful to him no i dont suppose she would wish to live at gatherum the horns was given expressly by my uncle to your dear mother and i should like mary to have the place  certainly  you should live among your tenantry i dont care so very much for matching  it is the one place you do like sir  however we can manage all that carlton terrace i do not particularly like but it is a good house and there you should hang up your hat when in london when it is settled let me know at once  but if it should never be settled  i will ask no questions but if it be settled tell me then in palace yard he was turning to go but before he did so he said another word leaning on his sons shoulder i do not think that mabel grex and major tifto would do well together at all  there shall be an end to that sir  god bless you my boy said the duke  lord silverbridge sat in the houseor to speak more accurately in the smokingroom of the housefor about an hour thinking over all that had passed between himself and his father he certainly had not intended to say anything about lady mab but on the spur of the moment it had all come out now at any rate it was decided for him that he must in set terms ask her to be his wife the scene which had just occurred had made him thoroughly sick of major tifto he must get rid of the major and there could be no way of doing this at once so easy and so little open to observation as marriage if he were but once engaged to mabel grex the dismissal of tifto would be quite a matter of course he would see lady mabel again on the morrow and ask her in direct language to be his wife     chapter xxviii  mrs montacute joness gardenparty   it was known to all the world that mrs montacute joness first great gardenparty was to come off on wednesday 16th june at roehampton mrs montacute jones who lived in grosvenor place and had a country house in gloucestershire and a place for young men to shoot at in scotland also kept a suburban elysium at roehampton in order that she might give two gardenparties every year when it is said that all these costly luxuries appertained to mrs montacute jones it is to be understood that they did in truth belong to mr jones of whom nobody heard much but of mrs jonesthat is mrs montacute joneseverybody heard a great deal she was an old lady who devoted her life to the amusement ofnot only her friends but very many who were not her friends no doubt she was fond of lords and countesses and worked very hard to get round her all the rank and fashion of the day it must be acknowledged that she was a worldly old woman but no more goodnatured old woman lived in london and everybody liked to be asked to her gardenparties on this occasion there was to be a considerable infusion of royal bloodgerman belgian french spanish and of native growth everybody who was asked would go and everybody had been askedwho was anybody lord silverbridge had been asked and lord silverbridge intended to be there lady mary his sister could not even be asked because her mother was hardly more than three months dead but it is understood in the world that women mourn longer than men  silverbridge had mounted a private hansom cab in which he could be taken about rapidlyand as he said himself without being shut up in a coffin in this vehicle he had himself taken to roehampton purporting to kill two birds with one stone he had not as yet seen his sister since she had been with lady cantrip he would on this day come back by the horns  he was well aware that lady mab would be at the gardenparty what place could be better for putting the question he had to ask he was by no means so confident as the heir to so many good things might perhaps have been without overdue selfconfidence  entering through the house into the lawn he encountered mrs montacute jones who with a seat behind her on the terrace surrounded by flowers was going through the immense labour of receiving her guests  how very good of you to come all this way lord silverbridge to eat my strawberries  how very good of you to ask me i did not come to eat your strawberries but to see your friends  you ought to have said you came to see me you know have you met miss boncassen yet  the american beauty no is she here  yes and she particularly wants to be introduced to you you wont betray me will you  certainly not i am as true as steel  she wanted she said to see if the eldest son of the duke of omnium really did look like any other man  then i dont want to see her said silverbridge with a look of vexation  there you are wrong for there was real downright fun in the way she said it there they are and i shall introduce you then mrs montacute jones absolutely left her post for a minute or two and taking the young lord down the steps of the terrace did introduce him to mr boncassen who was standing there amidst a crowd and to miss boncassen the daughter  mr boncassen was an american who had lately arrived in england with the object of carrying out certain literary pursuits in which he was engaged within the british museum he was an american who had nothing to do with politics and nothing to do with trade he was a man of wealth and a man of letters and he had a daughter who was said to be the prettiest young woman either in europe or in america at the present time  isabel boncassen was certainly a very pretty girl i wish that my reader would believe my simple assurance but no such simple assurance was ever believed and i doubt even whether any description will procure for me from the reader that amount of faith which i desire to achieve but i must make the attempt general opinion generally considered miss boncassen to be small but she was in truth something above the average height of english women she was slight without that look of slimness which is common to girls and especially to american girls that her figure was perfect the reader must believe on my word as any detailed description of her arms feet bust and waist would be altogether ineffective her hair was dark brown and plentiful but it added but little to her charms which depended on other matters perhaps what struck the beholder first was the excessive brilliancy of her complexion no pink was ever pinker no alabaster whiteness was ever more like alabaster but under and around and through it all there was a constantly changing hue which gave a vitality to her countenance which no fixed colours can produce her eyes too were full of life and brilliancy and even when she was silent her mouth would speak nor was there a fault within the oval of her face upon which the hypercritics of mature age could set a finger her teeth were excellent both in form and colour but were seen but seldom who does not know that look of ubiquitous ivory produced by teeth which are too perfect in a face which is otherwise poor her nose at the base spread a littleso that it was not purely grecian but who has ever seen a nose to be eloquent and expressive which did not so spread it was i think the vitality of her countenancethe way in which she could speak with every feature the command which she had of pathos of humour of sympathy of satire the assurance which she gave by every glance of her eye every elevation of her brow every curl of her lip that she was alive to all that was going onit was all this rather than those feminine charms which can be catalogued and labelled that made all acknowledge that she was beautiful  lord silverbridge said mr boncassen speaking a little through his nose i am proud to make your acquaintance sir your father is a man for whom we in our country have a great respect i think sir you must be proud of such a father  oh yesno doubt said silverbridge awkwardly then mr boncassen continued his discourse with the gentlemen around him upon this our friend turned to the young lady have you been long in england miss boncassen  long enough to have heard about you and your father she said speaking with no slightest twang  i hope you have not heard any evil of me  well  im sure you cant have heard much good  i know you didnt win the derby  youve been long enough to hear that  do you suppose we dont interest ourselves about the derby in new york why when we arrived at queenstown i was leaning over the taffrail so that i might ask the first man on board the tender whether the prime minister had won  and he said he hadnt  i cant conceive why you of all men should call your horse by such a name if my father had been president of the united states i dont think id call a horse president  i didnt name the horse  id have changed it but is it not very impudent in me to be finding fault with you the first time i have ever seen you shall you have a horse at ascot  there will be something going i suppose nothing that i care about lord silverbridge had made up his mind that he would go to no races with tifto before the leger the leger would be an affair of such moment as to demand his presence after that should come the complete rupture between him and tifto  then there was a movement among the elders and lord silverbridge soon found himself walking alone with miss boncassen it seemed to her to be quite natural to do so and there certainly was no reason why he should decline anything so pleasant it was thus that he had intended to walk with mabel grexonly as yet he had not found her oh yes said miss boncassen when they had been together about twenty minutes we shall be here all the summer and all the fall and all the winter indeed father means to read every book in the british museum before he goes back  hell have something to do  he reads by steam and he has two or three young men with him to take it all down and make other books out of itjust as youll see a lady take a lace shawl and turn it all about till she has trimmed a petticoat with it it is the same lace all throughand so i tell father its the same knowledge  but he puts it where more people will find it  the lady endeavours to do the same with the lace that depends on whether people look up or down father however is a very learned man you mustnt suppose that i am laughing at him he is going to write a very learned book only everybody will be dead before it can be half finished they still went on together and then he gave her his arm and took her into the place where the strawberries and cream were prepared as he was going in he saw mabel grex walking with tregear and she bowed to him pleasantly and playfully is that lady a great friend of yours asked miss boncassen  a very great friend indeed  she is very beautiful  and clever as welland good as gold  dear me do tell me who it is that owns all these qualities  lady mabel grex she is daughter of lord grex that man with her is my particular friend his name is frank tregear and they are cousins  i am so glad they are cousins  why glad  because his being with her wont make you unhappy  supposing i was in love with herwhich i am notdo you suppose it would make me jealous to see her with another man  in our country it would not a young lady may walk about with a young gentleman just as she might with another young lady but i thought it was different here do you know judging by english ways i believe i am behaving very improperly in walking about with you so long ought i not to tell you to go away  pray do not  as i am going to stay here so long i wish to behave well to english eyes  people know who you are and discount all that  if the difference be very marked they do for instance i neednt wear a hideous long bit of cloth over my face in constantinople because i am a woman but when the discrepancies are small then they have to be attended to so i shant walk about with you any more  oh yes you will said silverbridge who began to think that he liked walking about with miss boncassen  certainly not there is mr sprottle he is fathers secretary he will take me back  cannot i take you back as well as mr sprottle  indeed noi am not going to monopolise such a man as you do you think that i dont understand that everybody will be making remarks upon the american girl who wont leave the son of the duke of omnium alone there is your particular friend lady mabel and here is my particular friend mr sprottle  may i come and call  certainly father will only be too proudand i shall be prouder mother will be the proudest of all mother very seldom goes out till we get a house we are at the langham thank you mr sprottle i think well go and find father  lord silverbridge found himself close to lady mabel and tregear and also to miss cassewary who had now joined lady mabel he had been much struck with the american beauty but was not on that account the less anxious to carry out his great plan it was essentially necessary that he should do so at once because the matter had been settled between him and his father he was anxious to assure her that if she would consent then the duke would be ready to pour out all kinds of paternal blessings on their heads come and take a turn among the haycocks he said  frank declares said lady mabel that the hay is hired for the occasion i wonder whether that is true  anybody can see said tregear that it has not been cut off the grass it stands upon  if i could find mrs montacute jones id ask her where she got it said lady mabel  are you coming asked silverbridge impatiently  i dont think i am i have been walking round the haycocks till i am tired of them  anywhere else then  there isnt anywhere else what have you done with your american beauty the truth is lord silverbridge you ask me for my company when she wont give you hers any longer doesnt it look like it miss cassewary  i dont think lord silverbridge is the man to forget an old friend for a new one  not though the new friend be as lovely as miss boncassen  i dont know that i ever saw a prettier girl said tregear  i quite admit it said lady mabel but that is no salve for my injured feelings i have heard so much about miss boncassens beauty for the last week that i mean to get up a company of british females limited for the express purpose of putting her down who is miss boncassen that we are all to be put on one side for her  of course he knew that she was joking but he hardly knew how to take her joke there is a manner of joking which carries with it much serious intention he did feel that lady mabel was not gracious to him because he had spent half an hour with this new beauty and he was half inclined to be angry with her was it fitting that she should be cross with him seeing that he was resolved to throw at her feet all the good things that he had in the world bother miss boncassen he said you might as well come and take a turn with a fellow  come along miss cassewary said she we will go round the haycocks yet once again so they turned and the two ladies accompanied lord silverbridge  but this was not what he wanted he could not say what he had to say in the presence of miss cassewarynor could he ask her to take herself off in another direction nor could he take himself off now that he had joined himself to these two ladies he must make with them the tour of the gardens all this made him cross these kind of things are a great bore he said  i dare say you would rather be in the house of commonsor better still at the beargarden  you mean to be illnatured when you say that lady mab  you ask us to come and walk with you and then you tell us that we are bores  i did nothing of the kind  i should have thought that you would be particularly pleased with yourself for coming here today seeing that you have made miss boncassens acquaintance to be allowed to walk half an hour alone with the acknowledged beauty of the two hemispheres ought to be enough even for lord silverbridge  that is nonsense lady mab  nothing gives so much zest to admiration as novelty a republican charmer must be exciting after all the blasées habituées of the london drawingrooms  how can you talk such nonsense mabel said miss cassewary  but it is so i feel that people must be sick of seeing me i know i am very often sick of seeing them here is something freshand not only unlike but so much more lovely i quite acknowledge that i may be jealous but no one can say that i am spiteful i wish that some republican adonis or apollo would crop upso that we might have our turn but i dont think the republican gentlemen are equal to the republican ladies do you lord silverbridge  i havent thought about it  mr sprottle for instance  i have not the pleasure of knowing mr sprottle  now weve been round the haycocks and really lord silverbridge i dont think we have gained much by it those forced marches never do any good and so they parted  he was thinking with a bitter spirit of the illresult of his mornings work when he again found himself close to miss boncassen in the crowd of departing people on the terrace mind you keep your word she said and then she turned to her father lord silverbridge has promised to call  mrs boncassen will be delighted to make his acquaintance  he got into his cab and was driven off towards richmond as he went he began to think of the two young women with whom he had passed his morning mabel had certainly behaved badly to him even if she suspected nothing of his object did she not owe it to their friendship to be more courteous to him than she had been and if she suspected that object should she not at any rate have given him the opportunity  or could it be that she was really jealous of the american girl nothat idea he rejected instantly it was not compatible with the innate modesty of his disposition but no doubt the american girl was very lovely merely as a thing to be looked at she was superior to mabel he did feel that as to mere personal beauty she was in truth superior to anything he had ever seen before and she was clever tooand goodhumouredwhereas mabel had been both illnatured and unpleasant     chapter xxix  the lovers meet   lord silverbridge found his sister alone i particularly want you said he to come and call on mabel grex she wishes to know you and i am sure you would like her  but i havent been out anywhere yet she said i dont feel as though i wanted to go anywhere  nevertheless she was very anxious to know lady mabel grex of whom she had heard much a girl if she has had a former love passage says nothing of it to her new lover but a man is not so reticent frank tregear had perhaps not told her everything but he had told her something i was very fond of hervery fond of her he had said and so i am still he had added as you are my love of loves she is my friend of friends lady mary had been satisfied by the assurance but had become anxious to see the friend of friends she resisted at first her brothers entreaties she felt that her father in delivering her over to the seclusion of the horns had intended to preclude her from showing herself in london she was conscious that she was being treated with cruelty and had a certain pride in her martyrdom she would obey her father to the letter she would give him no right to call her conduct in question but he and any other to whom he might entrust the care of her should be made to know that she thought him cruel he had his power to which she must submit but she also had hersto which it was possible he might be made to submit i do not know that papa would wish me to go she said  but it is just what he would wish he thinks a good deal about mabel  why should he think about her at all  i cant exactly explain said silverbridge but he does  if you mean to tell me that mabel grex is anything particular to you and that papa approves of it i will go all round the world to see her but he had not meant to tell her this the request had been made at lady mabels instance when his sister had spoken of her fathers possible objection then he had become eager in explaining the dukes feeling not remembering that such anxiety might betray himself at that moment lady cantrip came in and the question was referred to her she did not see any objection to such a visit and expressed her opinion that it would be a good thing that mary should be taken out she should begin to go somewhere said lady cantrip and so it was decided on the next friday he would come down early in his hansom and drive her up to belgrave square then he would take her to carlton terrace and lady cantrips carriage should pick her up there and bring her home he would arrange it all  what did you think of the american beauty asked lady cantrip when that was settled  i thought she was a beauty  so i perceived you had eyes for nobody else said lady cantrip who had been at the gardenparty  somebody introduced her to me and then i had to walk about the grounds with her thats the kind of thing one always does in those places  just so that is what those places are meant for i suppose but it was not apparently a great infliction lord silverbridge had to explain that it was not an inflictionthat it was a privilege seeing that miss boncassen was both clever and lovely but that it did not mean anything in particular  when he took his leave he asked his sister to go out into the grounds with him for a moment this she did almost unwillingly fearing that he was about to speak to her of tregear but he had no such purpose on his mind of course you know he began all that was nonsense you were saying about mabel  i did not know  i was afraid you might blurt out something before her  i should not be so imprudent  girls do make such fools of themselves sometimes they are always thinking about people being in love but it is the truth that my father said to me the other day how very much he liked what he had heard of her and that he would like you to know her  on that same evening silverbridge wrote from the beargarden the shortest possible note to lady mabel telling her what he had arranged i and mary propose to call in b square on friday at two i must be early because of the house you will give us lunch s there was no word of endearmentnone even of those ordinary words which people who hate each other use to one another but he received the next day at home a much more kindlywritten note from her      dear lord silverbridge     you are so good you always do just what you think people    will like best nothing could please me so much as seeing    your sister of whom of course i have heard very very    much there shall be nobody here but miss cass     yours most sincerely     m g   how i do wish i were a man his sister said to him when they were in the hansom together  youd have a great deal more trouble  but id have a hansom of my own and go where i pleased how would you like to be shut up at a place like the horns  you can go out if you like it  not like you papa thinks its the proper place for me to live in and so i must live there i dont think a woman ever chooses how or where she shall live herself  you are not going to take up womans rights i hope  i think i shall if i stay at the horns much longer what would papa say if he heard that i was going to give a lecture at an institute  the governor has had so many things to bear that a trifle such as that would make but little difference  poor papa  he was dreadfully cut up about gerald and then he is so good he said more to me about gerald than he ever did about my own little misfortune at oxford but to gerald himself he said almost nothing now he has forgiven me because he thinks i am constant at the house  and are you  not so much as he thinks i do go therefor his sake he has been so good about my changing sides  i think you were quite right there  i am beginning to think i was quite wrong what did it matter to me  i suppose it did make papa unhappy  of course it didand then this affair of yours as soon as this was said lady mary at once hardened her heart against her father whether silverbridge was or was not entitled to his own political opinionsseeing that the pallisers had for ages been known as staunch whigs and liberalsmight be a matter for question but that she had a right to her own lover she thought that there could be no question as they were sitting in the cab he could hardly see her face but he was aware that she was in some fashion arming herself against opposition i am sure that this makes him very unhappy continued silverbridge  it cannot be altered she said  it will have to be altered  nothing can alter it he might die indeedor so might i  or he might see that it is no goodand change his mind suggested silverbridge  of course that is possible said lady mary very curtlyshowing plainly by her manner that the subject was one which she did not choose to discuss any further  it is very good of you to come to me said lady mabel kissing her new acquaintance i have heard so much about you  and i also of you  i you know am one of your brothers stern mentors there are three or four of us determined to make him a pattern young legislator miss cassewary is another only she is not quite so stern as i am  he ought to be very much obliged  but he is notnot a bit are you lord silverbridge  not so much as i ought to be perhaps  of course there is an opposing force there are the racehorses and the drag and major tifto no doubt you have heard of major tifto the major is the mr worldlywiseman who wont let christian go to the strait gate i am afraid he hasnt read his pilgrims progress but we shall prevail lady mary and he will get to the beautiful city at last  what is the beautiful city he asked  a seat in the cabinet i supposeor that general respect which a young nobleman achieves when he has shown himself able to sit on a bench for six consecutive hours without appearing to go to sleep  then they went to lunch and lady mary did find herself to be happy with her new acquaintance her life since her mothers death had been so sad that this short escape from it was a relief to her now for awhile she found herself almost gay there was an easy liveliness about lady mabela grain of humour and playfulness conjoinedwhich made her feel at home at once and it seemed to her as though her brother was at home he called the girl lady mab and queen mab and once plain mabel and the old woman he called miss cass it surely she thought must be the case that lady mabel and her brother were engaged  come upstairs into my own roomit is nicer than this said lady mabel and they went from the diningroom into a pretty little sittingroom with which silverbridge was very well acquainted have you heard of miss boncassen mary said she had heard something of miss boncassens great beauty everybody is talking about her your brother met her at mrs montacute joness gardenparty and was made a conquest of instantly  i wasnt made a conquest of at all said silverbridge  then he ought to have been made a conquest of i should be if i were a man i think she is the loveliest person to look at and the nicest person to listen to that i ever came across we all feel that as far as this season is concerned we are cut out but we dont mind it so much because she is a foreigner then just as she said this the door was opened and frank tregear was announced  everybody there present knew as well as does the reader what was the connexion between tregear and lady mary palliser and each knew that the other knew it it was therefore impossible for them not to feel themselves guilty among themselves the two lovers had not seen each other since they had been together in italy now they were brought face to face in this unexpected manner and nobody except tregear was at first quite sure whether somebody had not done something to arrange the meeting mary might naturally suspect that lady mabel had done this in the interest of her friend tregear and silverbridge could not but suspect that it was so lady mabel who had never before met the other girl could hardly refrain from thinking that there had been some underhand communicationand miss cassewary was clearly of opinion that there had been some understanding  silverbridge was the first to speak halloo tregear i didnt know that we were to see you  nor i that i should see you said he then of course there was a shaking of hands all round in the course of which ceremony he came to mary the last she gave him her hand but had not a word to say to him if i had known that you were here he said i should not have come but i need hardly say how glad i am to see youeven in this way then the two girls were convinced that the meeting was accidental but miss cass still had her doubts  conversation became at once very difficult tregear seated himself near but not very near to lady mary and made some attempt to talk to both the girls at once lady mabel plainly showed that she was not at her easewhereas mary seemed to be stricken dumb by the presence of her lover silverbridge was so much annoyed by a feeling that this interview was a treason to his father that he sat cudgelling his brain to think how he should bring it to an end miss cassewary was dumbfounded by the occasion she was the one elder in the company who ought to see that no wrong was committed she was not directly responsible to the duke of omnium but she was thoroughly permeated by a feeling that it was her duty to take care that there should be no clandestine love meetings in lord grexs house at last silverbridge jumped up from his chair upon my word tregear i think you had better go said he  so do i said miss cassewary if it is an accident  of course it is an accident said tregear angrilylooking round at mary who blushed up to her eyes  i did not mean to doubt it said the old lady but as it has occurred mabel dont you think that he had better go  he wont bite anybody miss cass  she would not have come if she had expected it said silverbridge  certainly not said mary speaking for the first time but now he is here then she stopped herself rose from the sofa sat down and then rising again stepped up to her lover who rose at the same momentand threw herself into his arms and put up her lips to be kissed  this wont do at all said silverbridge miss cassewary clasped her hands together and looked up to heaven she probably had never seen such a thing done before lady mabels eyes were filled with tears and though in all this there was much to cause her anguish still in her heart of hearts she admired the brave girl who could thus show her truth to her lover  now go said mary through her sobs  my own one ejaculated tregear  yes yes yes always your own gogo go she was weeping and sobbing as she said this and hiding her face with her handkerchief he stood for a moment irresolute and then left the room without a word of adieu to any one  you have behaved very badly said the brother  she has behaved like an angel said mabel throwing her arms round mary as she spoke like an angel if there had been a girl whom you loved and who loved you would you not have wished it would you not have worshipped her for showing that she was not ashamed of her love  i am not a bit ashamed said mary  and i say that you have no cause no one knows him as i do how good he is and how worthy immediately after that silverbridge took his sister away and lady mabel escaping from miss cass was alone she loves him almost as i have loved him she said to herself i wonder whether he can love her as he did me     chapter xxx  what came of the meeting   not a word was said in the cab as lord silverbridge took his sister to carlton terrace and he was leaving her without any reference to the scene which had taken place when an idea struck him that this would be cruel mary he said i was very sorry for all that  it was not my doing  i suppose it was nobodys doing but i am very sorry that it occurred i think that you should have controlled yourself  no she almost shouted  i think so  noif you mean by controlling myself holding my tongue he is the man i lovewhom i have promised to marry  but marydo ladies generally embrace their lovers in public  nonor should i i never did such a thing in my life before but as he was there i had to show that i was not ashamed of him do you think i should have done it if you all had not been there then again she burst into tears  he did not quite know what to make of it mabel grex had declared that she had behaved like an angel but yet as he thought of what he had seen he shuddered with vexation i was thinking of the governor he said  he shall be told everything  that you met tregear  certainly and that ikissed him i will do nothing that i am ashamed to tell everybody  he will be very angry  i cannot help it he should not treat me as he is doing mr tregear is a gentleman why did he let him come why did you bring him but it is of no use the thing is settled papa can break my heart but he cannot make me say that i am not engaged to mr tregear  on that night mary told the whole of her story to lady cantrip there was nothing that she tried to conceal i got up she said and threw my arms round him is he not all the world to me  had it been planned asked lady cantrip  nono nothing had been planned they are cousins and very intimate and he goes there constantly now i want you to tell papa all about it  lady cantrip began to think that it had been an evil day for her when she had agreed to take charge of this very determined young lady but she consented at once to write to the duke as the girl was in her hands she must take care not to lay herself open to reproaches as this objectionable lover had either contrived a meeting or had met her without contriving it was necessary that the duke should be informed i would rather you wrote the letter said lady mary but pray tell him that all along i have meant him to know all about it  till lady cantrip seated herself at her writingtable she did not know how great the difficulty would be it cannot in any circumstance be easy to write to a father as to his daughters love for an objectionable lover but the dukes character added much to the severity of the task and then that embrace she knew that the duke would be struck with horror as he read of such a tale and she found herself almost struck with horror as she attempted to write it when she came to the point she found she could not write it i fear there was a good deal of warmth shown on both sides she said feeling that she was calumniating the man as to whose warmth she had heard nothing it is quite clear she added that this is not a passing fancy on her part  it was impossible that the duke should be made to understand exactly what had occurred that silverbridge had taken mary he did understand and that they had together gone to lord grexs house he understood also that the meeting had taken place in the presence of silverbridge and of lady mabel no doubt it was all an accident lady cantrip wrote how could it be an accident  you had mary up in town on friday he said to his son on the following sunday morning  yes sir  and that friend of yours came in  yes sir  do you not know what my wishes are  certainly i dobut i could not help his coming you do not suppose that anybody had planned it  i hope not  it was simply an accident such an accident as must occur over and over againunless mary is to be locked up  who talks of locking anybody up what right have you to speak in that way  i only meant that of course they will stumble across each other in london  i think i will go abroad said the duke he was silent for awhile and then repeated his words i think i will go abroad  not for long i hope sir  yesto live there why should i stay here what good can i do here everything i see and everything i hear is a pain to me the young man of course could not but go back in his mind to the last interview which he had had with his father when the duke had been so gracious and apparently so well pleased  is there anything else wrongexcept about mary silverbridge asked  i am told that gerald owes about fifteen hundred pounds at cambridge  so much as that i knew he had a few horses there  it is not the money but the absence of principlethat a young man should have no feeling that he ought to live within certain prescribed means do you know what you have had from mr morton  not exactly sir  it is different with you but a man let him be who he may should live within certain means as for your sister i think she will break my heart silverbridge found it to be quite impossible to say anything in answer to this are you going to church asked the duke  i was not thinking of doing so particularly  do you not ever go  yessometimes i will go with you now if you like it sir  i had thought of going but my mind is too much harassed i do not see why you should not go  but silverbridge though he had been willing to sacrifice his morning to his fatherfor it was i fear in that way that he had looked at itdid not see any reason for performing a duty which his father himself omitted and there were various matters also which harassed him on the previous evening after dinner he had allowed himself to back the prime minister for the leger to a very serious amount in fact he had plunged and now stood to lose some twenty thousand pounds on the doings of the last night and he had made these bets under the influence of major tifto it was the remembrance of this after the promise made to his father that annoyed him the most he was imbued with a feeling that it behoved him as a man to pull himself together as he would have said himself and to live in accordance with certain rules he could make the rules easily enough but he had never yet succeeded in keeping any one of them he had determined to sever himself from tifto and in doing that had intended to sever himself from affairs of the turf generally this resolution was not yet a week old it was on that evening that he had resolved that tifto should no longer be his companion and now he had to confess to himself that because he had drunk three or four glasses of champagne he had been induced by tifto to make those wretched bets  and he had told his father that he intended to ask mabel grex to be his wife he had so committed himself that the offer must now be made he did not specially regret that though he wished that he had been more reticent what a fool a man is to blurt out everything he said to himself a wife would be a good thing for him and where could he possibly find a better wife than mabel grex in beauty she was no doubt inferior to miss boncassen there was something about miss boncassen which made it impossible to forget her but miss boncassen was an american and on many accounts out of the question it did not occur to him that he would fall in love with miss boncassen but still it seemed hard to him that this intention of marriage should stand in his way of having a good time with miss boncassen for a few weeks no doubt there were objections to marriage it clipped a fellows wings but then if he were married he might be sure that tifto would be laid aside it was such a great thing to have got his fathers assured consent to a marriage it meant complete independence in money matters  then his mind ran away to a review of his fathers affairs it was a genuine trouble to him that his father should be so unhappy of all the griefs which weighed upon the dukes mind that in reference to his sister was the heaviest the money which gerald owed at cambridge would be nothing if that other sorrow could be conquered nor had tifto and his own extravagance caused the duke any incurable wounds if tregear could be got out of the way his father he thought might be reconciled to other things he felt very tenderhearted about his father but he had no remorse in regard to his sister as he made up his mind that he would speak very seriously to tregear  he had wandered into st jamess park and had lighted by this time halfadozen cigarettes one after another as he sat on one of the benches he was a handsome youth all but six feet high with light hair with round blue eyes and with all that aristocratic look which had belonged so peculiarly to the late duke but which was less conspicuous in the present head of the family he was a young man whom you would hardly pass in a crowd without observingbut of whom you would say after due observation that he had not as yet put off all his childish ways he now sat with his legs stretched out with his cane in his hands looking down upon the water he was trying to think he worked hard at thinking but the bench was hard and upon the whole he was not satisfied with his position he had just made up his mind that he would look up tregear when tregear himself appeared on the path before him  tregear exclaimed silverbridge  silverbridge exclaimed tregear  what on earth makes you walk about here on a sunday morning  what on earth makes you sit there that i should walk here which i often do does not seem to me odd but that i should find you is marvellous do you often come  never was here in my life before i strolled in because i had things to think of  questions to be asked in parliament notices of motions amendments in committee and that kind of thing  go on old fellow  or perhaps major tifto has made important revelations  d major tifto  with all my heart said tregear  sit down here said silverbridge as it happened at the moment when you came up i was thinking of you  that was kind  and i was determined to go to you all this about my sister must be given up  must be given up  it can never lead to any good i mean that there never can be a marriage then he paused but tregear was determined to hear him out it is making my father so miserable that you would pity him if you could see him  i dare say i should when i see people unhappy i always pity them what i would ask you to think of is this if i were to commission you to tell your sister that everything between us should be given up would not she be so unhappy that you would have to pity her  she would get over it  and so will your father  he has a right to have his own opinion on such a matter  and so have i and so has she his rights in this matter are very clear and very potential i am quite ready to admit that we cannot marry for many years to come unless he will provide the money you are quite at liberty to tell him that i say so i have no right to ask your father for a penny and i will never do so the power is all in his hands as far as i know my own purposes i shall not make any immediate attempt even to see her we did meet as you saw the other day by the merest chance after that do you think that your sister wishes me to give her up  as for supposing that girls are to have what they wish that is nonsense  for young men i suppose equally so life ought to be a life of selfdenial no doubt perhaps it might be my duty to retire from this affair if by doing so i should sacrifice only myself the one person of whom i am bound to think in this matter is the girl i love  that is just what she would say about you  i hope so  in that way you support each other if it were any other man circumstanced just like you are and any other girl placed like mary you would be the first to say that the man was behaving badly i dont like to use hard language to you but in such a case you would be the first to say of another manthat he was looking after the girls money  silverbridge as he said this looked forward steadfastly on to the water regretting much that cause for quarrel should have arisen but thinking that tregear would find himself obliged to quarrel but tregear after a few moments silence having thought it out determined that he would not quarrel i think i probably might he said laying his hand on silverbridges arm i think i perhaps might express such an opinion  well then  i have to examine myself and find out whether i am guilty of the meanness which i might perhaps be too ready to impute to another i have done so and i am quite sure that i am not drawn to your sister by any desire for her money i did not seek her because she was a rich mans daughter norbecause she is a rich mans daughterwill i give her up she shall be mistress of the occasion nothing but a word from her shall induce me to leave herbut a word from her if it comes from her own lipsshall do so then he took his friends hand in his and having grasped it walked away without saying another word     chapter xxxi  miss boncassens riverparty no 1   thrice within the next three weeks did lord silverbridge go forth to ask mabel to be his wife but thrice in vain on one occasion she would talk on other things on the second miss cassewary would not leave her on the third the conversation turned in a very disagreeable way on miss boncassen as to whom lord silverbridge could not but think that lady mabel said some very illnatured things it was no doubt true that he during the last three weeks had often been in miss boncassens company that he had danced with her ridden with her taken her to the house of lords and to the house of commons and was now engaged to attend upon her at a riverparty up above maidenhead but mabel had certainly no right to complain had he not thrice during the same period come there to lay his coronet at her feetand now at this very moment was it not her fault that he was not going through the ceremony  i suppose she said laughing that it is all settled  what is all settled  about you and the american beauty  i am not aware that anything particular has been settled  then it ought to beoughtnt it for her sake i mean  that is so like an english woman said lord silverbridge because you cannot understand a manner of life a little different from your own you will impute evil  i have imputed no evil lord silverbridge and you have no right to say so  if you mean to assert said miss cass that the manners of american young ladies are freer than those of english young ladies it is you that are taking away their characters  i dont say it would be at all bad continued lady mabel she is a beautiful girl and very clever and would make a charming duchess and then it would be such a delicious change to have an american duchess  she wouldnt be a duchess  well countess with duchessship before her in the remote future wouldnt it be a change miss cass  oh decidedly said miss cass  and very much for the better quite a case of new blood you know pray dont suppose that i mean to object everybody who talks about it approves i havent heard a dissentient voice only as it has gone so far and as english people are too stupid you know to understand all these new waysdont you think perhaps  no i dont think i dont think anything except that you are very illnatured then he got up and after making formal adieux to both the ladies left the house  as soon as he was gone lady mabel began to laugh but the least apprehensive ears would have perceived that the laughter was affected miss cassewary did not laugh at all but sat bolt upright and looked very serious upon my honour said the younger lady he is the most beautifully simpleminded human being i ever knew in my life  then i wouldnt laugh at him  how can one help it but of course i do it with a purpose  what purpose  i think he is making a fool of himself if somebody does not interfere he will go so far that he will not be able to draw back without misbehaving  i thought said miss cassewary in a very low voice almost whispering i thought that he was looking for a wife elsewhere  you need not think of that again said lady mab jumping up from her seat i had thought of it too but as i told you before i spared him he did not really mean it with menor does he mean it with this american girl such young men seldom mean they drift into matrimony but she will not spare him it would be a national triumph all the states would sing a pæan of glory fancy a new york belle having compassed a duke  i dont think it possible it would be too horrid  i think it quite possible as for me i could teach myself to think it best as it is were i not so sure that i should be better for him than so many others but i shouldnt love him  why not love him  he is such a boy i should always treat him like a boyspoiling him and petting him but never respecting him dont run away with any idea that i should refuse him from conscientious motives if he were really to ask me i too should like to be a duchess i should like to bring all this misery at home to an end  but you did refuse him  not exactlybecause he never asked me for the moment i was weak and so i let him have another chance i shall not have been a good friend to him if it ends in his marrying this yankee  lord silverbridge went out of the house in a very ill humourwhich however left him when in the course of the afternoon he found himself up at maidenhead with miss boncassen miss boncassen at any rate did not laugh at him and then she was so pleasant so full of common sense and so completely intelligent i like you she had said because i feel that you will not think that you ought to make love to me there is nothing i hate so much as the idea that a young man and a young woman cant be acquainted with each other without some such tomfoolery as that this had exactly expressed his own feeling nothing could be so pleasant as his intimacy with isabel boncassen  mrs boncassen seemed to be a homely person with no desire either to speak or to be spoken to she went out but seldom and on those rare occasions did not in any way interfere with her daughter mr boncassen filled a prouder situation everybody knew that miss boncassen was in england because it suited mr boncassen to spend many hours in the british museum but still the daughter hardly seemed to be under control from the father she went alone where she liked talked to those she liked and did what she liked some of the young ladies of the day thought that there was a good deal to be said in favour of the freedom which she enjoyed  there is however a good deal to be said against it all young ladies cannot be miss boncassens with such an assurance of admirers as to be free from all fear of loneliness there is a comfort for a young lady in having a piedàterre to which she may retreat in case of need in american circles where girls congregate without their mothers there is a danger felt by young men that if a lady be once taken in hand there will be no possibility of getting rid of herno mamma to whom she may be taken and under whose wings she may be dropped my dear said an old gentleman the other day walking through an american ballroom and addressing himself to a girl whom he knew wellmy dear but the girl bowed and passed on still clinging to the arm of the young man who accompanied her but the old gentleman was cruel and possessed of a determined purpose my dear said he again catching the young man tight by the collar and holding him fast dont be afraid ive got him he shant desert you ill hold him here till you have told me how your father does the young lady looked as if she didnt like it and the sight of her misery gave rise to a feeling that after all mammas perhaps may be a comfort  but in her present phase of life miss boncassen suffered no misfortune of this kind it had become a privilege to be allowed to attend upon miss boncassen and the feeling of this privilege had been enhanced by the manner in which lord silverbridge had devoted himself to her fashion of course makes fashion had not lord silverbridge been so very much struck by the charm of the young lady lords glasslough and popplecourt would not perhaps have found it necessary to run after her as it was even that most unenergetic of young men dolly longstaff was moved to profound admiration  on this occasion they were all up the river at maidenhead mr boncassen had looked about for some means of returning the civilities offered to him and had been instigated by mrs montacute jones to do it after this fashion there was a magnificent banquet spread in a summerhouse on the river bank there were boats and there was a band and there was a sward for dancing there was lawntennis and fishingrodswhich nobody usedand better still long shady secluded walks in which gentlemen might strolland ladies too if they were kind enough the whole thing had been arranged by mrs montacute jones as the day was fine as many of the old people had abstained from coming as there were plenty of young men of the best sort and as nothing had been spared in reference to external comforts the party promised to be a success every most lovely girl in london of course was thereexcept lady mabel grex lady mabel was in the habit of going everywhere but on this occasion she had refused mrs boncassens invitation i dont want to see her triumphs she had said to miss cass  everybody went down by railway of course and innumerable flies and carriages had been provided to take them to the scene of action some immediately got into boats and rowed themselves up from the bridgewhich as the thermometer was standing at eighty in the shade was an inconsiderate proceeding i dont think i am quite up to that said dolly longstaff when it was proposed to him to take an oar miss amazon will do it she rows so well and is so strong whereupon miss amazon not at all abashed did take the oar and as lord silverbridge was on the seat behind her with the other oar she probably enjoyed her task  what a very nice sort of person lady cantrip is this was said to silverbridge by that generally silent young nobleman lord popplecourt the remark was the more singular because lady cantrip was not at the partyand the more so again because as silverbridge thought there could be but little in common between the countess who had his sister in charge and the young lord beside him who was not fast only because he did not like to risk his money  wellyes i dare say she is  i thought so peculiarly i was at that place at richmond yesterday  the devil you were what were you doing at the horns  lady cantrips grandmother wasi dont quite know what she was but something to us i know ive got a picture of her at popplecourt lady cantrip wanted to ask me something about it and so i went down i was so glad to make acquaintance with your sister  you saw mary did you  oh yes i lunched there im to go down and meet the duke some day  meet the duke  why not  no reason on earthonly i cant imagine the governor going to richmond for his dinner well i am very glad to hear it i hope youll get on well with him  i was so much struck with your sister  yes i dare say said silverbridge turning away into the path where he saw miss boncassen standing with some other ladies it certainly did not occur to him that popplecourt was to be brought forward as a suitor for his sisters hand  i believe this is the most lovely place in the world miss boncassen said to him  we are so much the more obliged to you for bringing us here  we dont bring you you allow us to come with you and see all that is pretty and lovely  is it not your party  father will pay the bill i supposeas far as that goes and mothers name was put on the cards but of course we know what that means it is because you and a few others like you have been so kind to us that we are able to be here at all  everybody i should think must be kind to you  i do have a good time pretty much but nowhere so good as here i fear that when i get back i shall not like new york  i have heard you say miss boncassen that americans were more likeable than the english  have you well yes i think i have said so and i think it is so id sooner have to dance with a bank clerk in new york than with a bank clerk here  do you ever dance with bank clerks  oh dear yes at least i suppose so i dance with whoever comes up we havent got lords in america you know  you have got gentlemen  plenty of thembut they are not so easily defined as lords i do like lords  do you  oh yesand ladiescountesses i mean and women of that sort your lady mabel grex is not here why wouldnt she come  perhaps you didnt ask her  oh yes i didespecially for your sake  she is not my lady mabel grex said lord silverbridge with unnecessary energy  but she will be  what makes you think that  you are devoted to her  much more to you miss boncassen  that is nonsense lord silverbridge  not at all  it is alsountrue  surely i must be the best judge of that myself  not a doubt a judge not only whether it be true but if true whether expedientor even possible what did i say to you when we first began to know each other  what did you say  that i liked knowing youthat was frank enoughthat i liked knowing you because i knew that there would be no tomfoolery of lovemaking then she paused but he did not quite know how to go on with the conversation at once and she continued her speech when you condescend to tell me that you are devoted to me as though that were the kind of thing that i expect to have said when i take a walk with a young man in a wood is not that the tomfoolery of lovemaking she stopped and looked at him so that he was obliged to answer  then why do you ask me if i am devoted to lady mabel would not that be tomfoolery too  no if i thought so i would not have asked the question i did specially invite her to come here because i thought you would like it you have got to marry somebody  some day perhaps  and why not her  if you come to that why not you he felt himself to be getting into deep waters as he said thisbut he had a meaning to express if only he could find the words to express it i dont say whether it is tomfoolery as you call it or not but whatever it is you began it  yesyes i see you punish me for my unpremeditated impertinence in suggesting that you are devoted to lady mabel by the premeditated impertinence of pretending to be devoted to me  stop a moment i cannot follow that then she laughed i will swear that i did not intend to be impertinent  i hope not  i am devoted to you  lord silverbridge  i think you are  stop stop do not say it  well i wontnot now but there has been no tomfoolery  may i ask a question lord silverbridge you will not be angry i would not have you angry with me  i will not be angry he said  are you not engaged to marry lady mabel grex  no  then i beg your pardon i was told that you were engaged to her and i thought your choice was so fortunate so happy i have seen no girl here that i admire half so much she almost comes up to my idea of what a young woman should be  almost  now i am sure that if not engaged to her you must be in love with her or my praise would have sufficed  though one knows a lady mabel grex one may become acquainted with a miss boncassen  there are moments in which stupid people say clever things obtuse people say sharp things and goodnatured people say illnatured things lord silverbridge she said i did not expect that from you  expect what i meant it simply  i have no doubt you meant it simply we americans think ourselves sharp but i have long since found out that we may meet more than our matches over here i think we will go back mother means to try to get up a quadrille  you will dance with me  i think not i have been walking with you and i had better dance with someone else  you can let me have one dance  i think not there will not be many  are you angry with me  yes i am there but as she said this she smiled the truth is i thought i was getting the better of you and you turned round and gave me a pat on the head to show me that you could be master when it pleased you you have defended your intelligence at the expense of your goodnature  ill be shot if i know what it all means he said just as he was parting with her     chapter xxxii  miss boncassens riverparty no 2   lord silverbridge made up his mind that as he could not dance with miss boncassen he would not dance at all he was not angry at being rejected and when he saw her stand up with dolly longstaff he felt no jealousy she had refused to dance with him not because she did not like him but because she did not wish to show that she liked him he could understand that though he had not quite followed all the ins and outs of her little accusations against him she had flattered himwithout any intention of flattery on her part she had spoken of his intelligence and had complained that he had been too sharp to her mabel grex when most sweet to him when most loving always made him feel that he was her inferior she took no trouble to hide her conviction of his youthfulness this was anything but flattering miss boncassen on the other hand professed herself to be almost afraid of him  there shall be no tomfoolery of lovemaking she had said but what if it were not tomfoolery at all what if it were good genuine earnest lovemaking he certainly was not pledged to lady mabel as regarded his father there would be a difficulty in the first place he had been fool enough to tell his father that he was going to make an offer to mabel grex and then his father would surely refuse his consent to a marriage with an american stranger in such case there would be no unlimited income no immediate pleasantness of magnificent life such as he knew would be poured out upon him if he were to marry mabel grex as he thought of this however he told himself that he would not sell himself for money and magnificence he could afford to be independent and gratify his own taste just at this moment he was of opinion that isabel boncassen would be the sweeter companion of the two  he had sauntered down to the place where they were dancing and stood by saying a few words to mrs boncassen why are you not dancing my lord she asked  there are enough without me  i guess you young aristocrats are never overfond of doing much with your own arms and legs  i dont know about that polo you know for the legs and lawntennis for the arms is hard work enough  but it must always be something newfangled and after all it isnt of much account our young men like to have quite a time at dancing  it all came through her nose and she looked so common what would the duke say to her or mary or even gerald the father was by no means so objectionable he was a tall straight ungainly man who always wore black clothes he had dark stiff short hair a long nose and a forehead that was both high and broad ezekiel boncassen was the very manfrom his appearancefor a president of the united states and there were men who talked of him for that high office that he had never attended to politics was supposed to be in his favour he had the reputation of being the most learned man in the states and reputation itself often suffices to give a man dignity of manner he too spoke through his nose but the peculiar twang coming from a man would be supposed to be virile and incisive from a woman lord silverbridge thought it to be unbearable but as to isabel had she been born within the confines of some lordly park in hertfordshire she could not have been more completely free from the abomination  i am sorry that you should not be enjoying yourself said mr boncassen coming to his wifes relief  nothing could have been nicer to tell the truth i am standing idle by way of showing my anger against your daughter who would not dance with me  i am sure she would have felt herself honoured said mr boncassen  who is the gentleman with her asked the mother  a particular friend of minedolly longstaff  dolly ejaculated mrs boncassen  everybody calls him so his real name i believe to be adolphus  is heis hejust anybody asked the anxious mother  he is a very great dealas people go here everybody knows him he is asked everywhere but he goes nowhere the greatest compliment paid to you here is his presence  nay my lord there are the countess montague and the marchioness of capulet and lord tybalt and  they go everywhere they are nobodies it is a charity to even invite them but to have had dolly longstaff once is a triumph for life  laws said mrs boncassen looking hard at the young man who was dancing what has he done  he never did anything in his life  i suppose hes very rich  i dont know i should think not i dont know anything about his riches but i can assure you that having had him down here will quite give a character to the day  in the meantime dolly longstaff was in a state of great excitement some part of the character assigned to him by lord silverbridge was true he very rarely did go anywhere and yet was asked to a great many places he was a young manthough not a very young manwith a fortune of his own and the expectation of a future fortune few men living could have done less for the world than dolly longstaffand yet he had a position of his own now he had taken it into his head to fall in love with miss boncassen this was an accident which had probably never happened to him before and which had disturbed him much he had known miss boncassen a week or two before lord silverbridge had seen her having by some chance dined out and sat next to her from that moment he had become changed and had gone hither and thither in pursuit of the american beauty his passion having become suspected by his companions had excited their ridicule nevertheless he had perseveredand now he was absolutely dancing with the lady out in the open air if this goes on your friends will have to look after you and put you somewhere mr lupton had said to him in one of the intervals of the dance dolly had turned round and scowled and suggested that if mr lupton would mind his own affairs it would be as well for the world at large  at the present crisis dolly was very much excited when the dance was over as a matter of course he offered the lady his arm and as a matter of course she accepted it youll take a turn wont you he said  it must be a very short turn she saidas i am expected to make myself busy  oh bother that  it bothers me but it has to be done  you have set everything going now theyll begin dancing again without your telling them  i hope so  and ive got something i want to say  dear me what is it  they were now on a path close to the riverside in which there were many loungers would you mind coming up to the temple he said  what temple  oh such a beautiful place the temple of the winds i think they call it or venusorormrs arthur de bever  was she a goddess  it is something built to her memory such a view of the river i was here once before and they took me up there everybody who comes here goes and sees mrs arthur de bever they ought to have told you  let us go then said miss boncassen only it must not be long  five minutes will do it all then he walked rather quickly up a flight of rural steps lovely spot isnt it  yes indeed  thats maidenhead bridgethatssomebodys placeand now ive got something to say to you  youre not going to murder me now youve got me up here alone said miss boncassen laughing  murder you said dolly throwing himself into an attitude that was intended to express devoted affection oh no  i am glad of that  miss boncassen  mr longstaff if you sigh like that youll burst yourself  illwhat  burst yourself and she nodded her head at him  then he clapped his hands together and turned his head away from her towards the little temple i wonder whether she knows what love is he said as though he were addressing himself to mrs arthur de bever  no she dont said miss boncassen  but i do he shouted turning back towards her i do if any man were ever absolutely actually really in love i am the man  are you indeed mr longstaff isnt it pleasant  pleasantpleasant oh it could be so pleasant  but who is the lady perhaps you dont mean to tell me that  you mean to say you dont know  havent the least idea in life  let me tell you then that it could only be one person it never was but one person it never could have been but one person it is you then he put his hand well on his heart  me said miss boncassen choosing to be ungrammatical in order that he might be more absurd  of course it is you do you think that i should have brought you all the way up here to tell you that i was in love with anybody else  i thought i was brought to see mrs de somebody and the view  not at all said dolly emphatically  then you have deceived me  i will never deceive you only say that you will love me and i will be as true to you as the north pole  is that true to me  you know what i mean  but if i dont love you  yes you do  do i  i beg your pardon said dolly i didnt mean to say that of course a man shouldnt make sure of a thing  not in this case mr longstaff because really i entertain no such feeling  but you can if you please just let me tell you who i am  that will do no good whatever mr longstaff  let me tell you at any rate i have a very good income of my own as it is  money can have nothing to do with it  but i want you to know that i can afford it you might perhaps have thought that i wanted your money  i will attribute nothing evil to you mr longstaff only it is quite out of the question that i shouldrespond as i suppose you wish me to and therefore pray do not say anything further  she went to the head of the little steps but he interrupted her you ought to hear me he said  i have heard you  i can give you as good a position as any man without a title in england  mr longstaff i rather fancy that wherever i may be i can make a position for myself at any rate i shall not marry with the view of getting one if my husband were an english duke i should think myself nothing unless i was something as isabel boncassen  when she said this she did not bethink herself that lord silverbridge would in the course of nature become an english duke but the allusion to an english duke told intensely on dolly who had suspected that he had a noble rival english dukes arent so easily got he said  very likely not i might have expressed my meaning better had i said an english prince  thats quite out of the question said dolly they cant do itby act of parliamentexcept in a huggermugger lefthanded way that wouldnt suit you at all  mr longstaffyou must forgive meif i saythat of all the gentlemeni have ever met in this country or in any otheryou are themost obtuse this she brought out in little disjointed sentences not with any hesitation but in a way to make every word she uttered more clear to an intelligence which she did not believe to be bright but in this belief she did some injustice to dolly he was quite alive to the disgrace of being called obtuse and quick enough to avenge himself at the moment  am i said he how humbleminded you must be when you think me a fool because i have fallen in love with such a one as yourself  i like you for that she replied laughing and withdraw the epithet as not being applicable now we are quits and can forget and forgiveonly let there be the forgetting  never said dolly with his hand again on his heart  then let it be a little dream of your youththat you once met a pretty american girl who was foolish enough to refuse all that you would have given her  so pretty so awfully pretty thereupon she curtsied i have seen all the handsome women in england going for the last ten years and there has not been one who has made me think that it would be worth my while to get off my perch for her  and now you would desert your perch for me  i have already  but you can get up again let it be all a dream i know men like to have had such dreams and in order that the dream may be pleasant the last word between us shall be kind such admiration from such a one as you is an honourand i will reckon it among my honours but it can be no more than a dream then she gave him her hand it shall be soshall it not then she paused it must be so mr longstaff  must it  that and no more now i wish to go down will you come with me it will be better dont you think it is going to rain  dolly looked up at the clouds i wish it would with all my heart  i know you are not so illnatured it would spoil all  you have spoiled all  no no i have spoiled nothing it will only be a little dream about that strange american girl who really did make me feel queer for half an hour look at that a great big dropand the cloud has come over us as black as erebus do hurry down he was leading the way what shall we do for carriages to get us to the inn  theres the summerhouse  it will hold about half of us and think what it will be to be in there waiting till the rain shall be over everybody has been so goodhumoured and now they will be so cross  the rain was falling in big heavy drops slow and far between but almost black with their size and the heaviness of the cloud which had gathered over them made everything black  will you have my arm said silverbridge who saw miss boncassen scudding along with dolly longstaff following as fast as he could  oh dear no i have got to mind my dress therei have gone right into a puddle oh dear so she ran on and silverbridge followed close behind her leaving dolly longstaff in the distance  it was not only miss boncassen who got her feet into a puddle and splashed her stockings many did so who were not obliged by their position to maintain goodhumour under their misfortunes the storm had come on with such unexpected quickness that there had been a general stampede to the summerhouse as isabel had said there was comfortable room for not more than half of them in a few minutes people were crushed who never ought to be crushed a countess for whom treblepiled sofas were hardly good enough was seated on the corner of a table till some younger and less gorgeous lady could be made to give way and the marchioness was declaring she was as wet through as though she had been dragged in a river mrs boncassen was so absolutely quelled as to have retired into the kitchen attached to the summerhouse mr boncassen with all his countrys pluck and pride was proving to a knot of gentlemen round him on the verandah that such treachery in the weather was a thing unknown in his happier country miss boncassen had to do her best to console the splashed ladies oh mrs jones is it not a pity what can i do for you  we must bear it my dear it often does rain but why on this special day should it come down out of buckets  i never was so wet in all my life said dolly longstaff poking in his head  theres somebody smoking said the countess angrily there was a crowd of men smoking out on the verandah i never knew anything so nasty the countess continued leaving it in doubt whether she spoke of the rain or the smoke or the party generally  damp gauzes splashed stockings trampled muslins and features which have perhaps known something of rouge and certainly encountered something of rain may be made but can only by supreme high breeding be made compatible with goodhumour to be moist muddy rumpled and smeared when by the very nature of your position it is your duty to be clearstarched up to the pellucidity of crystal to be spotless as the lily to be crisp as the ivyleaf and as clear in complexion as a roseis it not o gentle readers felt to be a disgrace it came to pass therefore that many were now very cross carriages were ordered under the idea that some improvement might be made at the inn which was nearly a mile distant very few however had their own carriages and there was jockeying for the vehicles in the midst of all this silverbridge remained as near to miss boncassen as circumstances would admit you are not waiting for me she said  yes i am we might as well go up to town together  leave me with father and mother like the captain of a ship i must be the last to leave the wreck  but ill be the gallant sailor of the day who always at the risk of his life sticks to the skipper to the last moment  not at alljust because there will be no gallantry but come and see us tomorrow and find out whether we have got through it alive     chapter xxxiii  the langham hotel   what an abominable climate mrs boncassen had said when they were quite alone at maidenhead  my dear you didnt think you were to bring new york along with you when you came here replied her husband  i wish i was going back tomorrow  thats a foolish thing to say people here are very kind and you are seeing a great deal more of the world than you would ever see at home i am having a very good time what do you say bell  i wish i could have kept my stockings clean  but what about the young men  young men are pretty much the same everywhere i guess they never have their wits about them they never mean what they say because they dont understand the use of words they are generally half impudent and half timid when in love they do not at all understand what has befallen them what they want they try to compass as a cow does when it stands stretching out its head towards a stack of hay which it cannot reach indeed there is no such thing as a young man for a man is not really a man till he is middleaged but take them at their worst they are a deal too good for us for they become men some day whereas we must only be women to the end  my word bella exclaimed the mother  you have managed to be tolerably heavy upon gods creatures taking them in a lump said the father boys girls and cows something has gone wrong with you besides the rain  nothing on earth sirexcept the boredom  some young man has been talking to you bella  one or two mother and i got to be thinking if any one of them should ask me to marry him and if moved by some evil destiny i were to take him whether i should murder him or myself or run away with one of the others  couldnt you bear with him till according to your own theory he would grow out of his folly said the father  being a womanno the present moment is always everything to me when that horrid old harridan halloaed out that somebody was smoking i thought i should have died it was very bad just then  awful said mrs boncassen shaking her head  i didnt seem to feel it much said the father one doesnt look to have everything just what one wants always if i did i should go nowherebut my total life would be less enjoyable if ever you do get married bell you should remember that  i mean to get married some day so that i shouldnt be made love to any longer  i hope it will have that effect said the father  mr boncassen ejaculated the mother  what i say is true i hope it will have that effect it had with you my dear  i dont know that people didnt think of me as much as of anybody else even though i was married  then my dear i never knew it  miss boncassen though she had behaved serenely and with good temper during the process of dollys proposal had not liked it she had a very high opinion of herself and was certainly entitled to have it by the undisguised admiration of all that came near her she was not more indifferent to the admiration of young men than are other young ladies but she was not proud of the admiration of dolly longstaff she was here among strangers whose ways were unknown to her whose rank and standing in the world were vague to her and wonderful in their dimness she knew that she was associating with men very different from those at home where young men were supposed to be under the necessity of earning their bread at new york she would dance as she had said with bank clerks she was not prepared to admit that a young london lord was better than a new york bank clerk judging the men on their own individual merits she might find the bank clerk to be the better of the two but a certain sweetness of the aroma of rank was beginning to permeate her republican senses the softness of a life in which no occupation was compulsory had its charms for her though she had complained of the insufficient intelligence of young men she was alive to the delight of having nothings said to her pleasantly all this had affected her so strongly that she had almost felt that a life among these english luxuries would be a pleasant life like most americans who do not as yet know the country she had come with an inward feeling that as an american and a republican she might probably be despised  there is not uncommonly a savageness of selfassertion about americans which arises from a too great anxiety to be admitted to fellowship with britons she had felt this and conscious of reputation already made by herself in the social life of new york she had half trusted that she would be well received in london and had half convinced herself that she would be rejected she had not been rejected she must have become quite aware of that she had dropped very quickly the idea that she would be scorned ignorant as she had been of english life she perceived that she had at once become popular and this had been so in spite of her mothers homeliness and her fathers awkwardness by herself and by her own gifts she had done it she had found out concerning herself that she had that which would commend her to other society than that of the fifth avenue those lords of whom she had heard were as plenty with her as blackberries young lord silverbridge of whom she was told that of all the young lords of the day he stood first in rank and wealth was peculiarly her friend her brain was firmer than that of most girls but even her brain was a little turned she never told herself that it would be well for her to become the wife of such a one in her more thoughtful moments she told herself that it would not be well but still the allurement was strong upon her park lane was sweeter than the fifth avenue lord silverbridge was nicer than the bank clerk  but dolly longstaff was not she would certainly prefer the bank clerk to dolly longstaff and yet dolly longstaff was the one among her english admirers who had come forward and spoken out she did not desire that any one should come forward and speak out but it was an annoyance to her that this special man should have done so  the waiter at the langham understood american ways perfectly and when a young man called between three and four oclock asking for mrs boncassen said that miss boncassen was at home the young man took off his hat brushed up his hair and followed the waiter up to the sittingroom the door was opened and the young man was announced mr longstaff  miss boncassen was rather disgusted she had had enough of this english lover why should he have come after what had occurred yesterday he ought to have felt that he was absolved from the necessity of making personal inquiries i am glad to see that you got home safe she said as she gave him her hand  and you too i hope  wellso so with my clothes a good deal damaged and my temper rather worse  i am so sorry  it should not rain on such days mother has gone to church  ohindeed i like going to church myself sometimes  do you now  i know what would make me like to go to church  and father is at the athenæum he goes there to do a little light reading in the library on sunday afternoon  i shall never forget yesterday miss boncassen  you wouldnt if your clothes had been spoilt as mine were  money will repair that  well yes but when ive had a petticoat flounced particularly to order i dont like to see it illtreated there are emotions of the heart which money cant touch  just soemotions of the heart thats the very phrase  she was determined if possible to prevent a repetition of the scene which had taken place up at mrs de bevers temple all my emotions are about my dress  all  well yes all i guess i dont care much for eating and drinking in saying this she actually contrived to produce something of a nasal twang  eating and drinking said dolly of course they are necessitiesand so are clothes  but new things are such ducks  trowsers may be said dolly  then she took a prolonged gaze at him wondering whether he was or was not such a fool as he looked how funny you are she said  a man does not generally feel funny after going through what i suffered yesterday miss boncassen  would you mind ringing the bell  must it be done quite at once  quitequite she said i can do it myself for the matter of that and she rang the bell somewhat violently dolly sank back again into his seat remarking in his usual apathetic way that he had intended to obey her behest but had not understood that she was in so great a hurry i am always in a hurry she said i like things to be donesharp and she hit the table a crack please bring me some iced water this of course was addressed to the waiter and a glass for mr longstaff  none for me thank you  perhaps youd like soda and brandy  oh dear nonothing of the kind but i am so much obliged to you all the same as the waterbottle was in fact standing in the room and as the waiter had only to hand the glass all this created but little obstacle still it had its effect and dolly when the man had retired felt that there was a difficulty in proceeding i have called today he began  that has been so kind of you but mother has gone to church  i am very glad that she has gone to church because i wish to  oh laws theres a horse has tumbled down in the street i heard it  he has got up again said dolly looking leisurely out of the window but as i was saying  i dont think that the water we americans drink can be good it makes the women become ugly so young  you will never become ugly  she got up and curtsied to him and then still standing made him a speech mr longstaff it would be absurd of me to pretend not to understand what you mean but i wont have any more of it whether you are making fun of me or whether you are in earnest it is just the same  making fun of you  it does not signify i dont care which it is but i wont have it there  a gentleman should be allowed to express his feelings and to explain his position  you have expressed and explained more than enough and i wont have any more if you will sit down and talk about something else or else go away there shall be an end of itbut if you go on i will ring the bell again what can a man gain by going on when a girl has spoken as i have done they were both at this time standing up and he was now as angry as she was  ive paid you the greatest compliment a man can pay a woman he began  very well if i remember rightly i thanked you for it yesterday if you wish it i will thank you again today but it is a compliment which becomes very much the reverse if it be repeated too often you are sharp enough to understand that i have done everything in my power to save us both from this trouble  what makes you so fierce miss boncassen  what makes you so foolish  i suppose it must be something peculiar to american ladies  just thatsomething peculiar to american ladies they dont likewell i dont want to say anything more that can be called fierce  at this moment the door was again opened and lord silverbridge was announced halloa dolly are you here  it seems that i am  and i am here too said miss boncassen smiling her prettiest  none the worse for yesterdays troubles i hope  a good deal the worse i have been explaining all that to mr longstaff who has been quite sympathetic with me about my things  a terrible pity that shower said dolly  for you said silverbridge because if i remember right miss boncassen was walking with youbut i was rather glad of it  lord silverbridge  i regarded it as a direct interposition of providence because you would not dance with me  any news today silverbridge asked dolly  nothing particular they say that coalheaver cant run for the leger  whats the matter asked dolly vigorously  broke down at ascot but i daresay its a lie  sure to be a lie said dolly what do you think of madame scholzdam miss boncassen  i am not a good judge  never heard anything equal to it yet in this world said dolly i wonder whether thats true about coalheaver  tifto says so  which at the present moment asked miss boncassen is the greater favourite with the public madame scholzdam or coalheaver  coalheaver is a horse miss boncassen  oha horse  perhaps i ought to say a colt  oha colt  do you suppose dolly that miss boncassen doesnt know all that asked silverbridge  he supposes that my american ferocity has never been sufficiently softened for the reception of polite erudition  you two have been quarrelling i fear  i never quarrel with a woman said dolly  nor with a man in my presence i hope said miss boncassen  somebody does seem to have got out of bed at the wrong side said silverbridge  i did said miss boncassen i got out of bed at the wrong side i am cross i cant get over the spoiling of my flounces i think you had better both go away and leave me if i could walk about the room for half an hour and stamp my feet i should get better silverbridge thought that as he had come last he certainly ought to be left last miss boncassen felt that at any rate mr longstaff should go dolly felt that his manhood required him to remain after what had taken place he was not going to leave the field vacant for another therefore he made no effort to move  that seems rather hard upon me said silverbridge you told me to come  i told you to come and ask after us all you have come and asked after us and have been informed that we are very bad what more can i say you accuse me of getting out of bed the wrong side and i own that i did  i meant to say that dolly longstaff had done so  and i say it was silverbridge said dolly  we arent very agreeable together are we upon my word i think youd better both go silverbridge immediately got up from his chair upon which dolly also moved  what the mischief is up asked silverbridge when they were under the porch together  the truth is you never can tell what you are to do with those american girls  i suppose you have been making up to her  nothing in earnest she seemed to me to like admiration so i told her i admired her  what did she say then  upon my word you seem to be very great at crossexamining perhaps you had better go back and ask her  i will next time i see her then he stepped into his cab and in a loud voice ordered the man to drive him to the zoo but when he had gone a little way up portland place he stopped the driver and desired he might be taken back again to the hotel as he left the vehicle he looked round for dolly but dolly had certainly gone then he told the waiter to take his card to miss boncassen and explain that he had something to say which he had forgotten  so you have come back again said miss boncassen laughing  of course i have you didnt suppose i was going to let that fellow get the better of me why should i be turned out because he had made an ass of himself  who said he made an ass of himself  but he had hadnt he  noby no means said she after a little pause  tell me what he had been saying  indeed i shall do nothing of the kind if i told you all he said then i should have to tell the next man all that you may say would that be fair  i should not mind said silverbridge  i dare say not because you have nothing particular to say but the principle is the same lawyers and doctors and parsons talk of privileged communications why should not a young lady have her privileged communications  but i have something particular to say  i hope not  why should you hope not  i hate having things said particularly nobody likes conversation so well as i do but it should never be particular  i was going to tell you that i came back to london yesterday in the same carriage with old lady clanfiddle and that she swore that no consideration on earth would ever induce her to go to maidenhead again  that isnt particular  she went on to sayyou wont tell of me will you  it shall all be privileged  she went on to say that americans couldnt be expected to understand english manners  perhaps they may be all the better for that  then i spoke up i swore i was awfully in love with you  you didnt  i didthat you were out and away the finest girl i ever saw in my life of course you understand that her two daughters were there and that as for mannersunless the rain could be attributed to american mannersi did not think anything had gone wrong  what about the smoking  i told her they were all englishmen and that if she had been giving the party herself they would have smoked just as much you must understand that she never does give any parties  how could you be so illnatured  there was ever so much more of it and it ended in her telling me that i was a schoolboy i found out the cause of it all a great spout of rain had come upon her daughters hat and that had produced a most melancholy catastrophe  i would have given her mine willingly  an american hatto be worn by lady violet clanfiddle  it came from paris last week sir  but must have been contaminated by american contact  now lord silverbridge said she getting up if i had a stick id whip you  it was such fun  and you come here and tell it all to me  of course i do it was a deal too good to keep it to myself american manners as he said this he almost succeeded in looking like lady clanfiddle  at that moment mr boncassen entered the room and was immediately appealed to by his daughter father you must turn lord silverbridge out of the room  dear me if i mustof course i must but why  he is saying everything horrid he can about americans  after this they settled down for a few minutes to general conversation and then lord silverbridge again took his leave when he was gone isabel boncassen almost regretted that the something particular which he had threatened to say had not been less comic in its nature     chapter xxxiv  lord popplecourt   when the reader was told that lord popplecourt had found lady cantrip very agreeable it is to be hoped that the reader was disgusted lord popplecourt would certainly not have given a second thought to lady cantrip unless he had been specially flattered and why should such a man have been flattered by a woman who was in all respects his superior the reader will understand it had been settled by the wisdom of the elders that it would be a good thing that lord popplecourt should marry lady mary palliser  the mutual assent which leads to marriage should no doubt be spontaneous who does not feel that young love should speak from its first doubtful unconscious sparka spark which any breath of air may quench or cherishtill it becomes a flame which nothing can satisfy but the union of the two lovers no one should be told to love or bidden to marry this man or that woman the theory of this is plain to us all and till we have sons or daughters whom we feel imperatively obliged to control the theory is unassailable but the duty is so imperative the duke had taught himself to believe that as his wife would have been thrown away on the world had she been allowed to marry burgo fitzgerald so would his daughter be thrown away were she allowed to marry mr tregear therefore the theory of spontaneous love must in this case be set aside therefore the sparkwould that it had been no moremust be quenched therefore there could be no union of two loversbut simply a prudent and perhaps splendid marriage  lord popplecourt was a man in possession of a large estate which was unencumbered his rank in the peerage was not high but his barony was of an old dateand if things went well with him something higher in rank might be open to him he had good looks of that sort which recommend themselves to pastors and masters to elders and betters he had regular features he looked as though he were steady he was not impatient nor rollicking silverbridge was also goodlookingbut his good looks were such as would give a pang to the hearts of anxious mothers of daughters tregear was the handsomest man of the threebut then he looked as though he had no betters and did not care for his elders lord popplecourt though a very young man had once stammered through halfadozen words in the house of lords and had been known to dine with the benevolent funds lord silverbridge had declared him to be a fool no one thought him to be bright but in the eyes of the dukeand of lady cantriphe had his good qualities  but the work was very disagreeable it was the more hard upon lady cantrip because she did not believe in it if it could be done it would be expedient but she felt very strongly that it could not be done no doubt that lady glencora had been turned from her evil destiny but lady glencora had been younger than her daughter was now and possessed of less character nor was lady cantrip blind to the difference between a poor man with a bad character such as that burgo had been and a poor man with a good character such as was tregear nevertheless she undertook to aid the work and condescended to pretend to be so interested in the portrait of some common ancestor as to persuade the young man to have it photographed in order that the bringing down of the photograph might lead to something  he took the photograph and lady cantrip said very much to him about his grandmother who was the old lady in question she could she said just remember the features of the dear old woman she was not habitually a hypocrite and she hated herself for what she was doing and yet her object was simply goodto bring together two young people who might advantageously marry each other the mere talking about the old woman would be of no service she longed to bring out the offer plainly and say there is lady mary palliser dont you think shed make a good wife for you but she could not as yet bring herself to be so indelicately plain you havent seen the duke since she asked  he spoke to me only yesterday in the house i like the duke  if i may be allowed to say so it would be for your advantage that he should like youthat is if you mean to take a part in politics  i suppose i shall said popplecourt there isnt much else to do  you dont go to races he shook his head i am glad of that said lady cantrip nothing is so bad as the turf i fear lord silverbridge is devoting himself to the turf  i dont think it can be good for any man to have much to do with major tifto i suppose silverbridge knows what hes about  here was an opportunity which might have been used it would have been so easy for her to glide from the imperfections of the brother to the perfections of the sister but she could not bring herself to do it quite at once she approached the matter however as nearly as she could without making her grand proposition she shook her head sadly in reference to silverbridge and then spoke of the duke his father is so anxious about him  i dare say  i dont know any man who is more painfully anxious about his children he feels the responsibility so much since his wifes death there is lady mary  shes all right i should say  all right oh yes but when a girl is possessed of so many thingsrank beauty intelligence large fortune  will lady mary have much  a large portion of her mothers money i should say when all these things are joined together a father of course feels most anxious as to their disposal  i suppose she is clever  very clever said lady cantrip  i think a girl may be too clever you know said lord popplecourt  perhaps she may but i know more who are too foolish i am so much obliged to you for the photograph  dont mention it  i really did mean that you should send a man down  on that occasion the two young people did not see each other lady mary did not come down and lady cantrip lacked the courage to send for her as it was might it not be possible that the young man should be induced to make himself agreeable to the young lady without any further explanation but lovemaking between young people cannot well take place unless they be brought together there was a difficulty in bringing them together at richmond the duke had indeed spoken of meeting lord popplecourt at dinner therebut this was to have followed the proposition which lady cantrip should make to him she could not yet make the proposition and therefore she hardly knew how to arrange the dinner she was obliged at last to let the wishedfor lover go away without arranging anything when the duke should have settled his autumn plans then an attempt must be made to induce lord popplecourt to travel in the same direction  that evening lady cantrip said a few words to mary respecting the proposed suitor there is nothing i have such a horror of as gambling she said  it is dreadful  i am very glad to think that nidderdale does not do anything of that sort it was perhaps on the cards that nidderdale should do things of which she knew nothing i hope silverbridge does not bet  i dont think he does  theres lord popplecourtquite a young manwith everything at his own disposal and a very large estate think of the evil he might do if he were given that way  does he gamble  not at all it must be such a comfort to his mother  he looks to me as though he never would do anything said lady mary then the subject was dropped  it was a week after this towards the end of july that the duke wrote a line to lady cantrip apologising for what he had done but explaining that he had asked lord popplecourt to dine at the horns on a certain sunday he had he said been assured by lord cantrip that such an arrangement would be quite convenient it was clear from his letter that he was much in earnest of course there was no reason why the dinner should not be eaten only the speciality of the invitation to lord popplecourt must not be so glaring that he himself should be struck by the strangeness of it there must be a little party made up lord nidderdale and his wife were therefore bidden to come down and silverbridge who at first consented rather unwillinglyand lady mabel grex as to whom the duke made a special request that she might be asked this last invitation was sent express from lady mary and included miss cass so the party was made up the careful reader will perceive that there were to be ten of them  isnt it odd papa wanting to have lady mabel mary said to lady cantrip  does he not know her my dear  he hardly ever spoke to her ill tell you what i expect silverbridge is going to marry her  why shouldnt he  i dont know why he shouldnt she is very beautiful and very clever but if so papa must know all about it it does seem so odd that papa of all people should turn matchmaker or even that he should think of it  so much is thrown upon him now said lady cantrip  poor papa then she remembered herself and spoke with a little start of course i am not thinking of myself arranging a marriage is very different from preventing any one from marrying  whatever he may think to be his duty he will be sure to do it said the elder lady very solemnly  lady mabel was surprised by the invitation but she was not slow to accept it papa will be here and will be so glad to meet you lady mary had said why should the duke of omnium wish to meet her silverbridge will be here too mary had gone on to say it is just a family party papa you know is not going anywhere nor am i by all this lady mabels thoughts were much stirred and her bosom somewhat moved and silverbridge also was moved by it of course he could not but remember that he had pledged himself to his father to ask lady mabel to be his wife he had faltered since she had been he thought unkind to him or at any rate indifferent he had surely said enough to her to make her know what he meant and yet she had taken no trouble to meet him half way and then isabel boncassen had intervened now he was asked to dinner in a most unusual manner  of all the guests invited lord popplecourt was perhaps the least disturbed he was quite alive to the honour of being noticed by the duke of omnium and alive also to the flattering courtesy shown to him by lady cantrip but justice would not be done him unless it were acknowledged that he had as yet flattered himself with no hopes in regard to lady mary palliser he when he prepared himself for his journey down to richmond thought much more of the duke than of the dukes daughter  oh yes i can drive you down if you like that kind of thing silverbridge said to him on the saturday evening  and bring me back  if you will come when i am coming i hate waiting for a fellow  suppose we leave at halfpast ten  i wont fix any time but if we cant make it suit therell be the governors carriage  will the duke go down in his carriage  i suppose so its quicker and less trouble than the railway then lord popplecourt reflected that he would certainly come back with the duke if he could so manage it and there floated before his eyes visions of undersecretaryships all of which might owe their origin to this proposed drive up from richmond  at six oclock on the sunday evening silverbridge called for lord popplecourt upon my word said he i didnt ever expect to see you in my cab  why not me especially  because youre not one of our lot  youd sooner have tifto i dare say  no i wouldnt tifto is not at all a pleasant companion though he understands horses youre going in for heavy politics i suppose  not particularly heavy  if not why on earth does my governor take you up you wont mind my smoking i dare say after this there was no conversation between them     chapter xxxv  dont you think   it was pretty to see the dukes reception of lady mabel i knew your mother many years ago he said when i was young myself her mother and my mother were first cousins and dear friends he held her hand as he spoke and looked at her as though he meant to love her lady mabel saw that it was so could it be possible that the duke had heard anythingthat he should wish to receive her she had told herself and had told miss cassewary that though she had spared silverbridge yet she knew that she would make him a good wife if the duke thought so also then surely she need not doubt  i knew we were cousins she said and have been so proud of the connection lord silverbridge does come and see us sometimes  soon after that silverbridge and popplecourt came in if the story of the old woman in the portrait may be taken as evidence of a family connexion between lady cantrip and lord popplecourt everybody there was more or less connected with everybody else nidderdale had been a first cousin of lady glencora and he had married a daughter of lady cantrip they were manifestly a family partythanks to the old woman in the picture  it is a point of conscience among theperhaps not ten thousand but say one thousand of bluest bloodthat everybody should know who everybody is our duke though he had not given his mind much to the pursuit had nevertheless learned his lesson it is a knowledge which the possession of the blue blood itself produces there are countries with bluer blood than our own in which to be without such knowledge is a crime  when the old lady in the portrait had been discussed popplecourt was close to lady mary they two had no idea why such vicinity had been planned the duke knew of course and lady cantrip lady cantrip had whispered to her daughter that such a marriage would be suitable and the daughter had hinted it to her husband lord cantrip of course was not in the dark lady mabel had expressed a hint on the matter to miss cass who had not repudiated it even silverbridge had suggested to himself that something of the kind might be in the wind thinking that if so none of them knew much about his sister mary but popplecourt himself was divinely innocent his ideas of marriage had as yet gone no farther than a conviction that girls generally were things which would be pressed on him and against which he must arm himself with some shield marriage would have to come no doubt but not the less was it his duty to live as though it were a pit towards which he would be tempted by female allurements but that a net should be spread over him here he was much too humbleminded to imagine  very hot he said to lady mary  we found it warm in church today  i dare say i came down here with your brother in his hansom cab what a very odd thing to have a hansom cab  i should like one  should you indeed  particularly if i could drive it myself silverbridge does at night when he thinks people wont see him  drive the cab in the streets what does he do with his man  puts him inside he was out once without the man and took up a farean old woman he said and when she was going to pay him he touched his hat and said he never took money from ladies  do you believe that  oh yes i call that good fun because it did no harm he had his lark the lady was taken where she wanted to go and she saved her money  suppose he had upset her said lord popplecourt looking as an old philosopher might have looked when he had found some clenching answer to another philosophers argument  the real cabman might have upset her worse said lady mary  dont you feel it odd that we should meet here said lord silverbridge to his neighbour lady mabel  anything unexpected is odd said lady mabel it seemed to her to be very oddunless certain people had made up their minds as to the expediency of a certain event  that is what you call logicisnt it anything unexpected is odd  lord silverbridge i wont be laughed at you have been at oxford and ought to know what logic is  that at any rate is illnatured he replied turning very red in the face  you dont think i meant it oh lord silverbridge say that you dont think i meant it you cannot think i would willingly wound you indeed indeed i was not thinking it had in truth been an accident she could not speak aloud because they were closely surrounded by others but she looked up in his face to see whether he were angry with her say that you do not think i meant it  i do not think you meant it  i would not say a word to hurt youoh for more than i can tell you  it is all bosh of course he said laughing but i do not like to hear the old place named i have always made a fool of myself some men do it and dont care about it but i do it and yet it makes me miserable  if that be so you will soon give over makingwhat you call a fool of yourself for myself i like the idea of wild oats i look upon them like measles only you should have a doctor ready when the disease shows itself  what sort of a doctor ought i to have  ahyou must find out that yourself that sort of feeling which makes you feel miserablethat is a doctor itself  or a wife  or a wifeif you can find a good one there are wives you know who aggravate the disease if i had a fast husband i should make him faster by being fast myself there is nothing i envy so much as the power of doing halfmad things  women can do that too  but they go to the dogs we are dreadfully restricted if you like champagne you can have a bucketful i am obliged to pretend that i only want a very little you can bet thousands i must confine myself to gloves you can flirt with any woman you please i must wait till somebody comesand put up with it if nobody does come  plenty come no doubt  but i want to pick and choose a man turns the girls over one after another as one does the papers when one is fitting up a room or rolls them out as one rolls out the carpets a very careful young man like lord popplecourt might reject a young woman because her hair didnt suit the colour of his furniture  i dont think that i shall choose my wife as i would papers and carpets  the duke who sat between lady cantrip and her daughter did his best to make himself agreeable the conversation had been semipoliticalpolitical to the usual feminine extent and had consisted chiefly of sarcasms from lady cantrip against sir timothy beeswax that england should put up with such a man lady cantrip had said is to me shocking there used to be a feeling in favour of gentlemen to this the duke had responded by asserting that sir timothy had displayed great aptitude for parliamentary life and knew the house of commons better than most men he said nothing against his foe and very much in his foes praise but lady cantrip perceived that she had succeeded in pleasing him  when the ladies were gone the politics became more serious that unfortunate quarrel is to go on the same as ever i suppose said the duke addressing himself to the two young men who had seats in the house of commons they were both on the conservative side in politics the three peers present were all liberals  till next session i think sir said silverbridge  sir timothy though he did lose his temper has managed it well said lord cantrip  phineas finn lost his temper worse than sir timothy said lord nidderdale  but yet i think he had the feeling of the house with him said the duke i happened to be present in the gallery at the time  yes said nidderdale because he owned up the fact is if you own up in a genial sort of way the house will forgive anything if i were to murder my grandmother and when questioned about it were to acknowledge that i had done it then lord nidderdale stood up and made his speech as he might have made it in the house of commons i regret to say sir that the old woman did get in my way when i was in a passion unfortunately i had a heavy stick in my hand and i did strike her over the head nobody can regret it so much as i do nobody can feel so acutely the position in which i am placed i have sat in this house for many years and many gentlemen know me well i think sir that they will acknowledge that i am a man not deficient in filial piety or general humanity sir i am sorry for what i did in a moment of heat i have now spoken the truth and i shall leave myself in the hands of the house my belief is i should get such a round of applause as i certainly shall never achieve in any other way it is not only that a popular man may do itlike phineas finnbut the most unpopular man in the house may make himself liked by owning freely that he has done something that he ought to be ashamed of nidderdales unwonted eloquence was received in good part by the assembled legislators  taking it altogether said the duke i know of no assembly in any country in which goodhumour prevails so generally in which the members behave to each other so well in which rules are so universally followed or in which the president is so thoroughly sustained by the feeling of the members  i hear men say that it isnt quite what it used to be said silverbridge  nothing will ever be quite what it used to be  changes for the worse i mean men are doing all kinds of things just because the rules of the house allow them  if they be within rule said the duke i dont know who is to blame them in my time if any man stretched a rule too far the house would not put up with it  thats just it said nidderdale the house puts up with anything now there is a great deal of good feeling no doubt but theres no earnestness about anything i think you are more earnest than we but then you are such horrid bores and each earnest man is in earnest about something that nobody else cares for  when they were again in the drawingroom lord popplecourt was seated next to lady mary where are you going this autumn he asked  i dont know in the least papa said something about going abroad  you wont be at custins custins was lord cantrips country seat in dorsetshire  i know nothing about myself as yet but i dont think i shall go anywhere unless papa goes too  lady cantrip has asked me to be at custins in the middle of october they say it is about the best pheasantshooting in england  do you shoot much  a great deal i shall be in scotland on the twelfth i and reginald dobbes have a place together i shall get to my own partridges on the 1st of september i always manage that popplecourt is in suffolk and i dont think any man in england can beat me for partridges  what do you do with all you slay  leadenhall market i make it payor very nearly then i shall run back to scotland for the end of the stalking and i can easily manage to be at custins by the middle of october i never touch my own pheasants till november  why are you so abstemious  the birds are heavier and it answers better but if i thought you would be at custins it would be much nicer lady mary again told him that as yet she knew nothing of her fathers autumn movements  but at the same time the duke was arranging his autumn movements or at any rate those of his daughter lady cantrip had told him that the desirable soninlaw had promised to go to custins and suggested that he and mary should also be there in his daughters name he promised but he would not bind himself would it not be better that he should be absent now that the doing of this thing was brought nearer to him so that he could see and feel its details he was disgusted by it and yet it had answered so well with his wife  is lord popplecourt intimate here lady mabel asked her friend lord silverbridge  i dont know i am not  lady cantrip seems to think a great deal about him  i dare say i dont  your father seems to like him  thats possible too theyre going back to london together in the governors carriage my father will talk high politics all the way and popplecourt will agree with everything  he isnt intended toto you know what i mean  i cant say that i do  to cut out poor frank  its quite possible  poor frank  you had a great deal better say poor popplecourtor poor governor or poor lady cantrip  but a hundred countesses cant make your sister marry a man she doesnt like  just that they dont go the right way about it  what would you do  leave her alone let her find out gradually that what she wants cant be done  and so linger on for years said lady mabel reproachfully  i say nothing about that the man is my friend  and you ought to be proud of him  i never knew anybody yet that was proud of his friends i like him well enough but i can quite understand that the governor should object  yes we all know that said she sadly  what would your father say if you wanted to marry someone who hadnt a shilling  i should object myselfwithout waiting for my father but thenneither have i a shilling if i had money do you think i wouldnt like to give it to the man i loved  but this is a case of giving somebody elses money they wont make her give it up by bringing such a young ass as that down here if my father has persistency enough to let her cry her eyes out hell succeed  and break her heart could you do that  certainly not but then im soft i cant refuse  cant you  not if the person who asks me is in my good books you try me  what shall i ask for  anything  give me that ring off your finger she said he at once took it off his hand of course you know i am in joke you dont imagine that i would take it from you he still held it towards her lord silverbridge i expect that with you i may say a foolish word without being brought to sorrow by it i know that that ring belonged to your greatuncleand to fifty pallisers before  what would it matter  and it would be wholly useless to me as i could not wear it  of course it would be too big said he replacing the ring on his own finger but when i talk of any one being in my good books i dont mean a thing like that dont you know there is nobody on earth i there he paused and blushed and she sat motionless looking at him expecting with her colour too somewhat raisedwhom i like so well as i do you it was a lame conclusion she felt it to be lame but as regarded him the lameness at the moment had come from a timidity which forbade him to say the word love even though he had meant to say it  she recovered herself instantly i do believe it she said i do think that we are real friends  would you not take a ring from areal friend  not that ringnor a ring at all after i had asked for it in joke you understand it all but to go back to what we were talking aboutif you can do anything for frank pray do you know it will break her heart a man of course bears it better but he does not perhaps suffer the less it is all his life to him he can do nothing while this is going on are you not true enough to your friendship to exert yourself for him silverbridge put his hand up and rubbed his head as though he were vexed your aid would turn everything in his favour  you do not know my father  is he so inexorable  it is not that mabel but he is so unhappy i cannot add to his unhappiness by taking part against him  in another part of the room lady cantrip was busy with lord popplecourt she had talked about pheasants and had talked about grouse had talked about moving the address in the house of lords in some coming session and the great value of political alliances early in life till the young peer began to think that lady cantrip was the nicest of women then after a short pause she changed the subject  dont you think lady mary very beautiful  uncommon said his lordship  and her manners so perfect she has all her mothers ease without any of that you know what i mean  quite so said his lordship  and then she has got so much in her  has she though  i dont know any girl of her age so thoroughly well educated the duke seems to take to you  well yesthe duke is very kind  dont you think  eh  you have heard of her mothers fortune  tremendous  she will have i take it quite a third of it whatever i say im sure you will take in confidence but she is a dear dear girl and i am anxious for her happiness almost as though she belonged to me  lord popplecourt went back to town in the dukes carriage but was unable to say a word about politics his mind was altogether filled with the wonderful words that had been spoken to him could it be that lady mary had fallen violently in love with him he would not at once give himself up to the pleasing idea having so thoroughly grounded himself in the belief that female nets were to be avoided but when he got home he did think favourably of it the daughter of a dukeand such a duke so lovely a girl and with such gifts and then a fortune which would make a material addition to his own large property     chapter xxxvi  tallyho lodge   we all know that very clever distich concerning the great fleas and the little fleas which tells us that no animal is too humble to have its parasite even major tifto had his inferior friend this was a certain captain greenfor the friend also affected military honours he was a man somewhat older than tifto of whose antecedents no one was supposed to know anything it was presumed of him that he lived by betting and it was boasted by those who wished to defend his character that when he lost he paid his money like a gentleman tifto during the last year or two had been anxious to support captain green and had always made use of this argument where the d he gets his money i dont knowbut when he loses there it is  major tifto had a little box of his own in the neighbourhood of egham at which he had a set of stables a little bigger than his house and a set of kennels a little bigger than his stables it was here he kept his horses and hounds and himself too when business connected with his sporting life did not take him to town it was now the middle of august and he had come to tallyho lodge there to look after his establishments to make arrangements for cubhunting and to prepare for the autumn racing campaign on this occasion captain green was enjoying his hospitality and assisting him by sage counsels behind the little box was a little gardena garden that was very little but still thus close to the parlour window there was room for a small table to be put on the grassplat and for a couple of armchairs here the major and the captain were seated about eight oclock one evening with convivial good things within their reach the good things were ginandwater and pipes the two gentlemen had not dressed strictly for dinner they had spent a great part of the day handling the hounds and the horses dressing wounds curing sores and ministering to canine ailments and had been detained over their work too long to think of their toilet as it was they had an eye to business the stables at one corner and the kennels at the other were close to the little garden and the doings of a man and a boy who were still at work among the animals could be directed from the armchairs on which the two sportsmen were sitting  it must be explained that ever since the silverbridge election there had been a growing feeling in tiftos mind that he had been illtreated by his partner the feeling was strengthened by the admirable condition of prime minister surely more consideration had been due to a man who had produced such a state of things  i wouldnt quarrel with him but id make him pay his way said the prudent captain  as for that of course he does payhis share  who does all the work  thats true  the fact is tifto you dont make enough out of it when a small man like you has to deal with a big man like that he may take it out of him in one of two ways but he must be deuced clever if he can get it both ways  what are you driving at asked tifto who did not like being called a small man feeling himself to be every inch a master of foxhounds  why thislook at that d fellow fretting that orse with a switch if you cant strap a orse without a stick in your hand dont you strap him at all you then there came a volley of abuse out of the captains mouth in the middle of which the man threw down the rubber he was using and walked away  you come back halloed tifto jumping up from his seat with his pipe in his mouth then there was a general quarrel between the man and his two masters in which the man at last was victorious and the horse was taken into the stable in an unfinished condition its all very well to say get rid of him but where am i to get anybody better it has come to such a pass that now if you speak to a fellow he walks out of the yard  they then returned to the state of affairs as it was between tifto and lord silverbridge what i was saying is this continued the captain if you choose to put yourself up to live with a fellow like that on equal terms  one gentleman with another you mean  put it so it dont quite hit it off but put it so why then you get your wages when you take his arm and call him silverbridge  i dont want wages from any man said the indignant major  that comes from not knowing what wages is i do want wages if i do a thing i like to be paid for it you are paid for it after one fashion i prefer the other  do you mean he should give mea salary  id have it out of him some way whats the good of young chaps of that sort if they arent made to pay youve got this young swell in tow hes going to be about the richest man in englandand what the deuce better are you for it tifto sat meditating thinking of the wisdom which was being spoken the same ideas had occurred to him the happy chance which had made him intimate with lord silverbridge had not yet enriched him what is the good of chaps of that sort if they are not made to pay the words were wise words but yet how glorious he had been when he was elected at the beargarden and had entered the club as the special friend of the heir of the duke of omnium  after a short pause captain green pursued his discourse you said salary  i did mention the word  salary and wages is one a salary is a nice thing if its paid regular i had a salary once myself for looking after a stud of orses at newmarket only the gentleman broke up and it never went very far  was that marley bullock  yes that was marley bullock hes abroad somewhere now with nothing a year paid quarterly to live on i think he does a little at cards hed had a good bit of money once but most of it was gone when he came my way  you didnt make by him  i didnt lose nothing i didnt have a lot of orses under me without getting something out of it  what am i to do asked tifto i can sell him a horse now and again but if i give him anything good there isnt much to come out of that  very little i should say dont he put his money on his orses  not very free i think hes coming out freer now  what did he stand to win on the derby  a thousand or two perhaps  there may be something got handsome out of that said the captain not venturing to allow his voice to rise above a whisper major tifto looked hard at him but said nothing of course you must see your way  i dont quite understand  race orses are expensive animalsand races generally is expensive  thats true  when so much is dropped somebody has to pick it up thats what ive always said to myself im as honest as another man  thats of course said the major civilly  but if i dont keep my mouth shut somebody ll have my teeth out of my head every one for himself and god for us all i suppose theres a deal of money flying about hell put a lot of money on this orse of yours for the leger if hes managed right theres more to be got out of that than calling him silverbridge and walking arminarm business is business i dont know whether i make myself understood  the gentleman did not quite make himself understood but tifto endeavoured to read the riddle he must in some way make money out of his friend lord silverbridge hitherto he had contented himself with the brilliancy of the connection but now his brilliant friend had taken to snubbing him and had on more than one occasion made himself disagreeable it seemed to him that captain green counselled him to put up with that but counselled him at the same time topick up some of his friends money he didnt think that he could ask lord silverbridge for a salaryhe who was a master of foxhounds and a member of the beargarden then his friend had suggested something about the young lords bets he was endeavouring to unriddle all this with a brain that was already somewhat muddled with alcohol when captain green got up from his chair and standing over the major spoke his last words for that night as from an oracle square is all very well as long as others are square to youbut when they arent then i say square be d square what comes of it work your heart out and then its no good  the major thought about it much that night and was thinking about it still when he awoke on the next morning he would like to make lord silverbridge pay for his late insolence it would answer his purpose to make a little moneyas he told himselfin any honest way at the present moment he was in want of money and on looking into his affairs declared to himself that he had certainly impoverished himself by his devotion to lord silverbridges interests at breakfast on the following morning he endeavoured to bring his friend back to the subject but the captain was cross rather than oracular everybody he said ought to know his own business he wasnt going to meddle or make what he had said had been taken amiss this was hard upon tifto who had taken nothing amiss  square be d there was a great deal in the lesson there enunciated which demanded consideration hitherto the major had fought his battles with a certain adherence to squareness if his angles had not all been perfect angles still there had always been an attempt at geometrical accuracy he might now and again have told a lie about a horsebut who that deals in horses has not done that he had been alive to the value of underhand information from racingstables but who wont use a tip if he can get it he had lied about the expense of his hounds in order to enhance the subscription of his members those were things which everybody did in his line but green had meant something beyond this  as far as he could see out in the world at large nobody was square you had to keep your mouth shut or your teeth would be stolen out of it he didnt look into a paper without seeing that on all sides of him men had abandoned the idea of squareness chairmen directors members of parliament ambassadorsall the world as he told himselfwere trying to get on by their wits he didnt see why he should be more square than anybody else why hadnt silverbridge taken him down to scotland for the grouse     chapter xxxvii  grex   far away from all known places in the northern limit of the craven district on the borders of westmorland but in yorkshire there stands a large rambling most picturesque old house called grex the people around call it the castle but it is not a castle it is an old brick building supposed to have been erected in the days of james the first having oriel windows twisted chimneys long galleries gable ends a quadrangle of which the house surrounds three sides terraces sundials and fishponds but it is so sadly out of repair as to be altogether unfit for the residence of a gentleman and his family it stands not in a park for the land about it is divided into paddocks by low stone walls but in the midst of lovely scenery the ground rising all round it in low irregular hills or fells and close to it a quarter of a mile from the back of the house there is a small dark lake not serenely lovely as are some of the lakes in westmorland but attractive by the darkness of its waters and the gloom of the woods around it  this is the country seat of earl grexwhich however he had not visited for some years gradually the place had got into such a condition that his absence is not surprising an owner of grex with large means at his disposal and with a taste for the picturesque to gratifyone who could afford to pay for memories and who was willing to pay dearly for such luxuries might no doubt restore grex but the earl had neither the money nor the taste  lord grex had latterly never gone near the place nor was his son lord percival fond of looking upon the ruin of his property but lady mabel loved it with a fond love with all her lightness of spirit she was prone to memories prone to melancholy prone at times almost to seek the gratification of sorrow year after year when the london season was over she would come down to grex and spend a week or two amidst its desolation she was now going on to a seat in scotland belonging to mrs montacute jones called killancodlem but she was in the meanwhile passing a desolate fortnight at grex in company with miss cassewary the gardens were letand being let of course were not kept in further order than as profit might require the man who rented them lived in the big house with his wife and they on such occasions as this would cook and wait upon lady mabel  lady mabel was at the home of her ancestors and the faithful miss cass was with her but at the moment and at the spot at which the reader shall see her miss cass was not with her she was sitting on a rock about twelve feet above the lake looking upon the black water and on another rock a few feet from her was seated frank tregear no she said you should not have come nothing can justify it of course as you are here i could not refuse to come out with you to make a fuss about it would be the worst of all but you should not have come  why not whom does it hurt it is a pleasure to me if it be the reverse to you i will go  men are so unmanly they take such mean advantages you know it is a pleasure to me to see you  i had hoped so  but it is a pleasure i ought not to haveat least not here  that is what i do not understand said he in london where the earl could bark at me if he happened to find me i could see the inconvenience of it but here where there is nobody but miss cass  there are a great many others there are the rooks and stones and old womenall of which have ears  but of what is there to be ashamed there is nothing in the world to me so pleasant as the companionship of my friends  then go after silverbridge  i mean to do sobut i am taking you by the way  it is all unmanly she said rising from her stone you know that it is so friends do you mean to say that it would make no difference whether you were here with me or with miss cass  the greatest difference in the world  because she is an old woman and i am a young one and because in intercourse between young men and young women there is something dangerous to the women and therefore pleasant to the men  i never heard anything more unjust you cannot think i desire anything injurious to you  i do think so she was still standing and spoke now with great vehemence i do think so you force me to throw aside the reticence i ought to keep would it help me in my prospects if your friend lord silverbridge knew that i was here  how should he know  but if he did do you suppose that i want to have visits paid to me of which i am afraid to speak would you dare to tell lady mary that you had been sitting alone with me on the rocks at grex  certainly i would  then it would be because you have not dared to tell her certain other things which have gone before you have sworn to her no doubt that you love her better than all the world  i have  and you have taken the trouble to come here to tell me thatto wound me to the core by saying so to show me that though i may still be sick you have recoveredthat is if you ever suffered go your way and let me go mine i do not want you  mabel  i do not want you i know you will not help me but you need not destroy me  you know that you are wronging me  no you understand it all though you look so calm i hate your lady mary palliser there but if by anything i could do i could secure her to you i would do itbecause you want it  she will be your sisterinlawprobably  never it will never be so  why do you hate her  there again you are so little of a man that you can ask me why then she turned away as though she intended to go down to the marge of the lake  but he rose up and stopped her let us have this out mabel before we go he said unmanly is a heavy word to hear from you and you have used it a dozen times  it is because i have thought it a thousand times go and get her if you canbut why tell me about it  you said you would help me  so i would as i would help you do anything you might want but you can hardly think that after what has passed i can wish to hear about her  it was you spoke of her  i told you you should not be herebecause of her and because of me and i tell you again i hate her do you think i can hear you speak of her as though she were the only woman you had ever seen without feeling it did you ever swear that you loved any one else  certainly i have so sworn  have you ever said that nothing could alter that love  indeed i have  but it is altered it has all gone it has been transferred to one who has more advantages of beauty youth wealth and position  oh mabel mabel  but it is so  when you say this do you not think of yourself  yes but i have never been false to any one you are false to me  have i not offered to face all the world with you  you would not offer it now  no he said after a pausenot now were i to do so i should be false you bade me take my love elsewhere and i did so  with the greatest ease  we agreed it should be so and you have done the same  that is false look me in the face and tell me whether you do not know it to be false  and yet i am told that i am injuring you with silverbridge  ohso unmanly again of course i have to marry who does not know it do you want to see me begging my bread about the streets you have bread or if not you might earn it if you marry for money  the accusation is altogether unjustifiable  allow me to finish what i have to say if you marry for money you will do that which is in itself bad and which is also unnecessary what other course would you recommend me to take no one goes into the gutter while there is a clean path open if there be no escape but through the gutter one has to take it  you mean that my duty to you should have kept me from marrying all my life  not thatbut a little while frank just a little while your bloom is not fading your charms are not running from you have you not a strength which i cannot have do you not feel that you are a tree standing firm in the ground while i am a bit of ivy that will be trodden in the dirt unless it can be made to cling to something you should not liken yourself to me frank  if i could do you any good  good what is the meaning of good if you love it is good to be loved again it is good not to have your heart torn in pieces you know that i love you he was standing close to her and put out his hand as though he would twine his arm round her waist not for worlds she said it belongs to that palliser girl and as i have taught myself to think that what there is left of me may perhaps belong to some other one worthless as it is i will keep it for him i love youbut there can be none of that softness of love between us then there was a pause but as he did not speak she went on but remember frankour position is not equal you have got over your little complaint it probably did not go deep with you and you have found a cure perhaps there is a satisfaction in finding that two young women love you  you are trying to be cruel to me  why else should you be here you know i love youwith all my heart with all my strength and that i would give the world to cure myself knowing this you come and talk to me of your passion for this other girl  i had hoped we might both talk rationally as friends  friends frank tregear i have been bold enough to tell you i love you but you are not my friend and cannot be my friend if i have before asked you to help me in this mean catastrophe of mine in my attack upon that poor boy i withdraw my request i think i will go back to the house now  i will walk back to ledburgh if you wish it without going to the house again  no i will have nothing that looks like being ashamed you ought not to have come but you need not run away then they walked back to the house together and found miss cassewary on the terrace we have been to the lake said mabel and have been talking of old days i have but one ambition now in the world of course miss cassewary asked what the remaining ambition was to get money enough to purchase this place from the ruins of the grex property if i could own the house and the lake and the paddocks about and had enough income to keep one servant and bread for us to eatof course including you miss cass  thankee my dear but i am not sure i should like it  yes you would frank would come and see us perhaps once a year i dont suppose anybody else cares about the place but to me it is the dearest spot in the world so she went on in almost high spirits though alluding to the general decadence of the grex family till tregear took his leave  i wish he had not come said miss cassewary when he was gone  why should you wish that there is not so much here to amuse me that you should begrudge me a stray visitor  i dont think that i grudge you anything in the way of pleasure my dear but still he should not have come my lord if he knew it would be angry  then let him be angry papa does not do so much for me that i am bound to think of him at every turn  but i amor rather i am bound to think of myself if i take his bread  bread  welli do take his bread and i take it on the understanding that i will be to you what a mother might beor an aunt  welland if so had i a mother living would not frank tregear have come to visit her and in visiting her would he not have seen meand should we not have walked out together  not after all that has come and gone  but you are not a mother nor yet an aunt and you have to do just what i tell you and dont i know that you trust me in all things and am i not trustworthy  i think you are trustworthy  i know what my duty is and i mean to do it no one shall ever have to say of me that i have given way to selfindulgence i couldnt help his coming you know  that same night after miss cassewary had gone to bed when the moon was high in the heavens and the world around her was all asleep lady mabel again wandered out to the lake and again seated herself on the same rock and there she sat thinking of her past life and trying to think of that before her it is so much easier to think of the past than of the futureto remember what has been than to resolve what shall be she had reminded him of the offer which he had made and repeated to her more than onceto share with her all his chances in life there would have been almost no income for them all the world would have been against her she would have caused his ruin her light on the matter had been so clear that it had not taken her very long to decide that such a thing must not be thought of she had at last been quite stern in her decision  now she was brokenhearted because she found that he had left her in very truth oh yesshe would marry the boy if she could so arrange since that meeting at richmond he had sent her the ring reset she was to meet him down in scotland within a week or two from the present time mrs montacute jones had managed that he had all but offered to her a second time at richmond but all that would not serve to make her happy she declared to herself that she did not wish to see frank tregear again but still it was a misery to her that his heart should in truth be given to another woman     chapter xxxviii  crummietoddie   almost at the last moment silverbridge and his brother gerald were induced to join lord popplecourts shootingparty in scotland the party perhaps might more properly be called the party of reginald dobbes who was a man knowing in such matters it was he who made the party up popplecourt and silverbridge were to share the expense between them each bringing three guns silverbridge brought his brother and frank tregearhaving refused a most piteous petition on the subject from major tifto with popplecourt of course came reginald dobbes who was in truth to manage everything and lord nidderdale whose wife had generously permitted him this recreation the shooting was in the west of perthshire known as crummietoddie and comprised an enormous acreage of socalled forest and moor mr dobbes declared that nothing like it had as yet been produced in scotland everything had been made to give way to deer and grouse the thing had been managed so well that the tourist nuisance had been considerably abated there was hardly a potato patch left in the district nor a head of cattle to be seen there were no inhabitants remaining or so few that they could be absorbed in gamepreserving or cognate duties reginald dobbes who was very great at grouse and supposed to be capable of outwitting a deer by venatical wiles more perfectly than any other sportsman in great britain regarded crummietoddie as the nearest thing there was to a paradise on earth could he have been allowed to pass one or two special laws for his own protection there might still have been improvement he would like the right to have all intruders thrashed by the gillies within an inch of their lives and he would have had a clause in his lease against the making of any new roads opening of footpaths or building of bridges he had seen somewhere in print a plan for running a railway from callender to fort augustus right through crummietoddie if this were done in his time the beauty of the world would be over reginald dobbes was a man of about forty strong active wellmade about five feet ten in height with broad shoulders and greatlydeveloped legs he was not a handsome man having a protrusive nose high cheekbones and long upper lip but there was a manliness about his face which redeemed it sport was the business of his life and he thoroughly despised all who were not sportsmen he fished and shot and hunted during nine or ten months of the year filling up his time as best he might with coaching polo and pigeonshooting he regarded it as a great duty to keep his body in the firmest possible condition all his eating and all his drinking was done upon a system and he would consider himself to be guilty of weak selfindulgence were he to allow himself to break through sanitary rules but it never occurred to him that his whole life was one of selfindulgence he could walk his thirty miles with his gun on his shoulder as well now as he could ten years ago and being sure of this was thoroughly contented with himself he had a patrimony amounting to perhaps £1000 a year which he husbanded so as to enjoy all his amusements to perfection no one had ever heard of his sponging on his friends of money he rarely spoke sport being in his estimation the only subject worthy of a mans words such was reginald dobbes who was now to be the master of the shooting at crummietoddie  crummietoddie was but twelve miles from killancodlem mrs montacute joness highland seat and it was this vicinity which first induced lord silverbridge to join the party mabel grex was to be at killancodlem and determined as he still was to ask her to be his wife he would make this his opportunity of real opportunity there had been none at richmond since he had had his ring altered and had sent it to her there had come but a word or two of answer what am i to say you unkindest of men to keep it or to send it back would make me equally miserable i shall keep it till you are married and then give it to your wife this affair of the ring had made him more intent than ever after that he heard that isabel boncassen would also be at killancodlem having been induced to join mrs montacute joness swarm of visitors though he was dangerously devoid of experience still he felt that this was unfortunate he intended to marry mabel grex and he could assure himself that he thoroughly loved her nevertheless he liked making love to isabel boncassen he was quite willing to marry and settle down and looked forward with satisfaction to having mabel grex for his wife but it would be pleasant to have a sixmonths run of flirting and lovemaking before this settlement and he had certainly never seen any one with whom this would be so delightful as with miss boncassen but that the two ladies should be at the same house was unfortunate  he and gerald reached crummietoddie late on the evening of august 11th and found reginald dobbes alone that was on wednesday popplecourt and nidderdale ought to have made their appearance on that morning but had telegraphed to say that they would be detained two days on their route tregear whom hitherto dobbes had never seen had left his arrival uncertain this carelessness on such matters was very offensive to mr dobbes who loved discipline and exactitude he ought to have received the two young men with open arms because they were punctual but he had been somewhat angered by what he considered the extreme youth of lord gerald boys who could not shoot were he thought putting themselves forward before their time and silverbridge himself was by no means a firstrate shot such a one as silverbridge had to be endured because from his position and wealth he could facilitate such arrangements as these it was much to have to do with a man who would not complain if an extra fifty pounds were wanted but he ought to have understood that he was bound in honour to bring down competent friends of tregears shooting dobbes had been able to learn nothing lord gerald was a lad from the universities and dobbes hated university lads popplecourt and nidderdale were known to be efficient they were men who could work hard and do their part of the required slaughter dobbes proudly knew that he could make up for some deficiency by his own prowess but he could not struggle against three bad guns what was the use of so perfecting crummietoddie as to make it the best bit of ground for grouse and deer in scotland if the men who came there failed by their own incapacity to bring up the grand total of killed to a figure which would render dobbes and crummietoddie famous throughout the whole shooting world he had been hard at work on other matters dogs had gone amissor guns and he had been made angry by the champagne which popplecourt caused to be sent down he knew what champagne meant whiskyandwater and not much of it was the liquor which reginald dobbes loved in the mountains  dont you call this a very ugly country silverbridge asked as soon as he arrived now it is the case that the traveller who travels into argyllshire perthshire and inverness expects to find lovely scenery and it was also true that the country through which they had passed for the last twenty miles had been not only bleak and barren but uninteresting and ugly it was all rough open moorland never rising into mountains and graced by no running streams by no forest scenery almost by no foliage the lodge itself did indeed stand close upon a little river and was reached by a bridge that crossed it but there was nothing pretty either in the river or the bridge it was a placid black little streamlet which in that portion of its course was hurried by no steepness had no broken rocks in its bed no trees on its low banks and played none of those gambols which make running water beautiful the bridge was a simple low construction with a low parapet carrying an ordinary roadway up to the hall door the lodge itself was as ugly as a house could be white of two stories with the door in the middle and windows on each side with a slate roof and without a tree near it it was in the middle of the shooting and did not create a town around itself as do sumptuous mansions to the great detriment of that seclusion which is favourable to game look at killancodlem dobbes had been heard to saya very fine house for ladies to flirt in but if you find a deer within six miles of it i will eat him first and shoot him afterwards there was a spartan simplicity about crummietoddie which pleased the spartan mind of reginald dobbes  ugly do you call it  infernally ugly said lord gerald  what did you expect to find a big hotel and a lot of cockneys if you come after grouse you must come to what the grouse thinks pretty  nevertheless it is ugly said silverbridge who did not choose to be sat upon i have been at shootings in scotland before and sometimes they are not ugly this i call beastly whereupon reginald dobbes turned upon his heel and walked away  can you shoot he said afterwards to lord gerald  i can fire off a gun if you mean that said gerald  you have never shot much  not what you call very much im not so old as you are you know everything must have a beginning mr dobbes wished the beginning might have taken place elsewhere but there had been some truth in the remark  what on earth made you tell him crammers like that asked silverbridge as the brothers sat together afterwards smoking on the wall of the bridge  because he made an ass of himself asking me whether i could shoot  on the next morning they started at seven dobbes had determined to be cross because as he thought the young men would certainly keep him waiting and was cross because by their punctuality they robbed him of any just cause for offence during the morning on the moor they were hardly ever near enough each other for much conversation and very little was said according to arrangement made they returned to the house for lunch it being their purpose not to go far from home till their numbers were complete as they came over the bridge and put down their guns near the door mr dobbes spoke the first goodhumoured word they had heard from his lips why did you tell me such an infernal i would say lie only perhaps you mightnt like it  i told you no lie said gerald  youve only missed two birds all the morning and you have shot fortytwo thats uncommonly good sport  what have you done  only forty and mr dobbes seemed for the moment to be gratified by his own inferiority you are a deuced sight better than your brother  geralds about the best shot i know said silverbridge  why didnt he tell  because you were angry when we said the place was ugly  i see all about it said dobbes nevertheless when a fellow comes to shoot he shouldnt complain because a place isnt pretty what you want is a decent house as near as you can have it to your ground if there is anything in scotland to beat crummietoddie i dont know where to find it shooting is shooting you know and touring is touring  upon that he took very kindly to lord gerald who even after the arrival of the other men was second only in skill to dobbes himself with nidderdale who was an old companion he got on very well nidderdale ate and drank too much and refused to be driven beyond a certain amount of labour but was in other respects obedient and knew what he was about popplecourt was disagreeable but he was a fairly good shot and understood what was expected of him silverbridge was so goodhumoured that even his manifest faultsshooting carelessly lying in bed and wanting his dinnerwere if not forgiven at least endured but tregear was an abomination he could shoot well enough and was active and when he was at the work seemed to like itbut he would stay away whole days by himself and when spoken to would answer in a manner which seemed to dobbes to be flat mutiny we are not doing it for our bread said tregear  i dont know what you mean  theres no duty in killing a certain number of these animals they had been driving deer on the day before and were to continue the work on the day in question im not paid fifteen shillings a week for doing it  i suppose if you undertake to do a thing you mean to do it of course youre not wanted we can make the double party without you  then why the mischief should you growl at me  because i think a man should do what he undertakes to do a man who gets tired after three days work of this kind would become tired if he were earning his bread  who says i am tired i came here to amuse myself  amuse yourself  and as long as it amuses me i shall shoot and when it does not i shall give it up  this vexed the governor of crummietoddie much he had learned to regard himself as the arbiter of the fate of men while they were sojourning under the same autumnal roof as himself but a defalcation which occurred immediately afterwards was worse silverbridge declared his intention of going over one morning to killancodlem reginald dobbes muttered a curse between his teeth which was visible by the anger on his brow to all the party i shall be back tonight you know said silverbridge  a lot of men and women who pretend to come there for shooting said dobbes angrily but do all the mischief they can  one must go and see ones friends you know  some girl said dobbes  but worse happened than the evil so lightly mentioned silverbridge did go over to killancodlem and presently there came back a man with a cart who was to return with a certain not small proportion of his luggage  its hardly honest you know said reginald dobbes     chapter xxxix  killancodlem   mr dobbes was probably right in his opinion that hotels tourists and congregations of men are detrimental to shooting crummietoddie was in all respects suited for sport killancodlem though it had the name of a shootingplace certainly was not so men going there took their guns gamekeepers were provided and gilliesand in a moderate quantity game on certain grand days a deer or two might be shotand would be very much talked about afterwards but a glance at the place would suffice to show that killancodlem was not intended for sport it was a fine castellated mansion with beautiful though narrow grounds standing in the valley of the archay river with a mountain behind and the river in front between the gates and the river there was a public road on which a stagecoach ran with loudblown horns and the noise of many tourists a mile beyond the castle was the famous killancodlem hotel which made up a hundred and twenty beds and at which half as many more guests would sleep on occasions under the tables and there was the killancodlem postoffice halfway between the two at crummietoddie they had to send nine miles for their letters and newspapers at killancodlem there was lawntennis and a billiardroom and dancing every night the costumes of the ladies were lovely and those of the gentlemen who were wonderful in knickerbockers picturesque hats and variegated stockings hardly less so and then there were carriages and saddlehorses and paths had been made hither and thither through the rocks and hills for the sake of the scenery scenery to hear mr dobbes utter the single word was as good as a play was it for such cockney purposes as those that scotland had been created fit mother for grouse and deer  silverbridge arrived just before lunch and was soon made to understand that it was impossible that he should go back that day mrs jones was very great on that occasion you are afraid of reginald dobbes she said severely  i think i am rather  of course you are how came it to pass that you of all men should submit yourself to such a tyrant  good shooting you know said silverbridge  but you dare not call an hour your ownor your soul mr dobbes and i are sworn enemies we both like scotland and unfortunately we have fallen into the same neighbourhood he looks upon me as the genius of sloth i regard him as the incarnation of tyranny he once said there should be no women in scotlandjust an old one here and there who would know how to cook grouse i offered to go and cook his grouse  any friend of mine continued mrs jones who comes down to crummietoddie without staying a day or two with mewill never be my friend any more i do not hesitate to tell you lord silverbridge that i call for your surrender in order that i may show my power over reginald dobbes are you a dobbite  not thoroughgoing said silverbridge  then be a montacute jonesite or a boncassenite if as is possible you prefer a young woman to an old one at this moment isabel boncassen was standing close to them  killancodlem against crummietoddie for ever said miss boncassen waving her handkerchief as a matter of course a messenger was sent back to crummietoddie for the young lords wearing apparel  the whole of that afternoon he spent playing lawntennis with miss boncassen lady mabel was asked to join the party but she refused having promised to take a walk to a distant waterfall where the codlem falls into the archay a gentleman in knickerbockers was to have gone with her and two other young ladies but when the time came she was weary she saidand she sat almost the entire afternoon looking at the game from a distance silverbridge played well but not so well as the pretty american with them were joined two others somewhat inferior so that silverbridge and miss boncassen were on different sides they played game after game and miss boncassens side always won  very little was said between silverbridge and miss boncassen which did not refer to the game but lady mabel looking on told herself that they were making love to each other before her eyes and why shouldnt they she asked herself that question in perfect good faith why should they not be lovers was ever anything prettier than the girl in her country dress active as a fawn and as graceful or could anything be more handsome more attractive to a girl more goodhumoured or better bred in his playful emulation than silverbridge  when youth and pleasure meet to chase the glowing hours with flying feet she said to herself over and over again  but why had he sent her the ring she would certainly give him back the ring and bid him bestow it at once upon miss boncassen inconstant boy then she would get up and wander away for a time and rebuke herself what right had she even to think of inconstancy could she be so irrational so unjust as to be sick for his love as to be angry with him because he seemed to prefer another was she not well aware that she herself did not love himbut that she did love another man she had made up her mind to marry him in order that she might be a duchess and because she could give herself to him without any of that horror which would be her fate in submitting to matrimony with one or another of the young men around her there might be disappointment if he escaped her there would be bitter disappointment but seeing how it was had she any further ground for hope she certainly had no ground for anger  it was thus within her own bosom she put questions to herself and yet all this before her was simply a game of play in which the girl and the young man were as eager for victory as though they were children they were thinking neither of love nor lovemaking that the girl should be so lovely was no doubt a pleasure to himand perhaps to her also that he should be joyous to look at and sweet of voice but he could he have been made to tell all the truth within him would have still owned that it was his purpose to make mabel his wife  when the game was over and the propositions made for further matches and the likemiss boncassen said that she would betake herself to her own room i never worked so hard in my life before she said and i feel like a navvie i could drink beer out of a jug and eat bread and cheese i wont play with you any more lord silverbridge because i am beginning to think it is unladylike to exert myself  are you not glad you came over said lady mabel to him as he was going off the ground almost without seeing her  pretty well he said  is not that better than stalking  lawntennis  yeslawntenniswith miss boncassen  she plays uncommonly well  and so do you  ah she has such an eye for distances  and youwhat have you an eye for will you answer me a question  wellyes i think so  truly  certainly if i do answer it  do you not think her the most beautiful creature you ever saw in your life he pushed back his cap and looked at her without making any immediate answer i do now tell me what you think  i think that perhaps she is  i knew you would say so you are so honest that you could not bring yourself to tell a fibeven to me about that come here and sit down for a moment of course he sat down by her you know that frank came to see me at grex  he never mentioned it  dear mehow odd  it was odd said he in a voice which showed that he was angry she could hardly explain to herself why she told him this at the present moment it came partly from jealousy as though she had said to herself though he may neglect me he shall know that there is someone who does notand partly from an eager halfangry feeling that she would have nothing concealed there were moments with her in which she thought that she could arrange her future life in accordance with certain wise rules over which her heart should have no influence there were others many others in which her feelings completely got the better of her and now she told herself that she would be afraid of nothing there should be no deceit no lies  he went to see you at grex said silverbridge  why should he not have come to me at grex  only it is so odd that he did not mention it it seems to me that he is always having secrets with you of some kind  poor frank there is no one else who would come to see me at that tumbledown old place but i have another thing to say to you you have behaved badly to me  have i  yes sir after my folly about that ring you should have known better than to send it to me you must take it back again  you shall do exactly what you said you would you shall give it to my wifewhen i have one  that did very well for me to say in a note i did not want to send my anger to you over a distance of two or three hundred miles by the postman but now that we are together you must take it back  i will do no such thing said he sturdily  you speak as though this were a matter in which you can have your own way  i mean to have mine about that  any lady then must be forced to take any present that a gentleman may send her allow me to assure you that the usages of society do not run in that direction here is the ring i knew that you would come over to seewell to see someone here and i have kept it ready in my pocket  i came over to see you  lord silverbridge but we know that in certain employments all things are fair he looked at her not knowing what were the employments to which she alluded at any rate you will oblige me bybyby not being troublesome and putting this little trinket into your pocket  never nothing on earth shall make me do it  at killancodlem they did not dine till halfpast eight twilight was now stealing on these two who were still out in the garden all the others having gone in to dress she looked round to see that no other eyes were watching them as she still held the ring it is there she said putting it on the bench between them then she prepared to rise from the seat so that she might leave it with him  but he was too quick for her and was away at a distance before she had collected her dress and from a distance he spoke again if you choose that it shall be lost so be it  you had better take it said she following him slowly but he would not turn backnor would she they met again in the hall for a moment i should be sorry it should be lost said he because it belonged to my greatuncle and i had hoped that i might live to see it very often  you can fetch it she said as she went to her room he however would not fetch it she had accepted it and he would not take it back again let the fate of the gem be what it might  but to the feminine and more cautious mind the very value of the trinket made its position out there on the bench within the grasp of any dishonest gardener a burden to her she could not reconcile it to her conscience that it should be so left the diamond was a large one and she had heard it spoken of as a stone of great valueso much so that silverbridge had been blamed for wearing it ordinarily she had asked for it in joke regarding it as a thing which could not be given away she could not go down herself and take it up again but neither could she allow it to remain as she went to her room she met mrs jones already coming from hers you will keep us all waiting said the hostess  oh nonobody ever dressed so quickly but mrs jones will you do me a favour  certainly  and will you let me explain something  anything you likefrom a hopeless engagement down to a broken garter  i am suffering neither from one or the other but there is a most valuable ring lying out in the garden will you send for it then of course the story had to be told you will i hope understand how i came to ask for it foolishly it was because it was the one thing which i was sure he would not give away  why not take it  cant you understand i wouldnt for the world but you will be good enoughwont you to see that there is nothing else in it  nothing of love  nothing in the least he and i are excellent friends we are cousins and intimate and all that i thought i might have had my joke and now i am punished for it as for love dont you see he is over head and ears in love with miss boncassen  this was very imprudent on the part of lady mabel who had she been capable of clinging fast to her policy would not now in a moment of strong feeling have done so much to raise obstacles in her own way but you will send for it wont you and have it put on his dressingtable tonight when he went to bed lord silverbridge found it on his table  but before that time came he had twice danced with miss boncassen lady mabel having refused to dance with him no she said i am angry with you you ought to have felt that it did not become you as a gentleman to subject me to inconvenience by throwing upon me the charge of that diamond you may be foolish enough to be indifferent about its value but as you have mixed me up with it i cannot afford to have it lost  it is yours  no sir it is not mine nor will it ever be mine but i wish you to understand that you have offended me  this made him so unhappy for the time that he almost told the story to miss boncassen if i were to give you a ring he said would not you accept it  what a question  what i mean is dont you think all those conventional rules about men and women are absurd  as a progressive american of course i am bound to think all conventional rules are an abomination  if you had a brother and i gave him a stick hed take it  not across his back i hope  or if i gave your father a book  hed take books to any extent i should say  and why not you a ring  who said i wouldnt but after all this you mustnt try me  i was not thinking of it  im so glad of that wellif youll promise that youll never offer me one ill promise that ill take it when it comes but what does all this mean  it is not worth talking about  you have offered somebody a ring and somebody hasnt taken it may i guess  i had rather you did not  i could you know  never mind about that now come and have a turn i am bound not to give you a ring but you are bound to accept anything else i may offer  no lord silverbridgenot at all nevertheless well have a turn  that night before he went up to his room he had told isabel boncassen that he loved her and when he spoke he was telling her the truth it had seemed to him that mabel had become hard to him and had over and over again rejected the approaches to tenderness which he had attempted to make in his intercourse with her even though she were to accept him what would that be worth to him if she did not love him so many things had been added together why had tregear gone to grex and having gone there why had he kept his journey a secret tregear he knew was engaged to his sisterbut for all that there was a closer intimacy between mabel and tregear than between mabel and himself and surely she might have taken his ring  and then isabel boncassen was so perfect since he had first met her he had heard her loveliness talked of on all sides it seemed to be admitted everywhere that so beautiful a creature had never before been seen in london there is even a certain dignity attached to that which is praised by all lips miss boncassen as an american girl had she been judged to be beautiful only by his own eyes might perhaps have seemed to him to be beneath his serious notice in such a case he might have felt himself unable to justify so extraordinary a choice but there was an acclamation of assent as to this girl then came the dancingthe one dance after another the pressure of the hand the entreaty that she would not just on this occasion dance with any other man the attendance on her when she took her glass of wine the whispered encouragement of mrs montacute jones the halfresisting and yet halfyielding conduct of the girl i shall not dance at all again she said when he asked her to stand up for another think of all that lawntennis this morning  but you will play tomorrow  i thought you were going  of course i shall stay now he said and as he said it he put his hand on her hand which was on his arm she drew it away at once i love you so dearly he whispered to her so dearly  lord silverbridge  i do i do can you say that you will love me in return  i cannot she said slowly i have never dreamed of such a thing i hardly know now whether you are in earnest  indeed indeed i am  then i will say goodnight and think about it everybody is going we will have our game tomorrow at any rate  when he went to his room he found the ring on his dressingtable     chapter xl  and then   on the next morning miss boncassen did not appear at breakfast word came that she had been so fatigued by the lawntennis as not to be able to leave her bed i have been to her said mrs montacute jones whispering to lord silverbridge as though he were particularly interested theres nothing really the matter she will be down to lunch  i was afraid she might be ill said silverbridge who was now hardly anxious to hide his admiration  oh nonothing of that sort but she will not be able to play again today it was your fault you should not have made her dance last night after that mrs jones said a word about it all to lady mabel i hope the duke will not be angry with me  why should he be angry with you  i dont suppose he will approve of it and perhaps hell say i brought them together on purpose  soon afterwards mabel asked silverbridge to walk with her to the waterfall she had worked herself into such a state of mind that she hardly knew what to do what to wish or how to act at one moment she would tell herself that it was better in every respect that she should cease to think of being duchess of omnium it was not fit that she should think of it she herself cared but little for the young man and heshe would tell herselfnow appeared to care as little for her and yet to be duchess of omnium but was it not clear that he was absolutely in love with this other girl she had played her cards so badly that the game was now beyond her powers then other thoughts would come was it beyond her powers had he not told her in london that he loved her had he not given her the ring which she well knew he valued ahif she could but have been aware of all that had passed between silverbridge and the duke how different would have been her feelings and then would it not be so much better for him that he should marry her one of his own class than this american girl of whom nobody knew anything and thento be the daughter of the duke of omnium to be the future duchess to escape from all the cares which her fathers vices and follies had brought upon her to have come to an end of all her troubles would it not be sweet  she had made her mind up to nothing when she asked him to walk up to the waterfall there was present to her only the glimmer of an idea that she ought to caution him not to play with the american girls feelings she knew herself to be aware that when the time for her own action came her feminine feelings would get the better of her purpose she could not craftily bring him to the necessity of bestowing himself upon her had that been within the compass of her powers opportunities had not been lacking to her on such occasions she had always spared him and should the opportunity come again again she would spare him but she might perhaps do some goodnot to herself that was now out of the questionbut to him by showing him how wrong he was in trifling with this girls feelings  and so they started for their walk he of course would have avoided it had it been possible when men in such matters have two strings to their bow much inconvenience is felt when the two become entangled silverbridge no doubt had come over to killancodlem for the sake of making love to mabel grex and instead of doing so he had made love to isabel boncassen and during the watches of the night and as he had dressed himself in the morning and while mrs jones had been whispering to him her little bulletin as to the state of the young ladys health he had not repented himself of the change mabel had been he thought so little gracious to him that he would have given up that notion earlier but for his indiscreet declaration to his father on the other hand making love to isabel boncassen seemed to him to possess some divine afflatus of joy which made it of all imaginable occupations the sweetest and most charming she had admitted of no embrace indeed he had attempted none unless that touch of the hand might be so called from which she had immediately withdrawn her conduct had been such that he had felt it to be incumbent on him at the very moment to justify the touch by a declaration of love then she had told him that she would not promise to love him in return and yet it had been so sweet so heavenly sweet  during the morning he had almost forgotten mabel when mrs jones told him that isabel would keep her room he longed to ask for leave to go and make some inquiry at the door she would not play lawntennis with him wellhe did not now care much for that after what he had said to her she must at any rate give him some answer she had been so gracious to him that his hopes ran very high it never occurred to him to fancy that she might be gracious to him because he was heir to the dukedom of omnium she herself was so infinitely superior to all wealth to all rank to all sublunary arrangements conventions and considerations that there was no room for confidence of that nature but he was confident because her smile had been sweet and her eyes brightand because he was conscious though unconsciously conscious of something of the sympathy of love  but he had to go to the waterfall with mabel lady mabel was always dressed perfectlyhaving great gifts of her own in that direction there was a freshness about her which made her morning costume more charming than that of the evening and never did she look so well as when arrayed for a walk on this occasion she had certainly done her best but he poor blind idiot saw nothing of this the white gauzy fabric which had covered isabels satin petticoat on the previous evening still filled his eyes those perfect boots the little glimpses of partycoloured stockings above them the loopedup skirt the jacket fitting but never binding that lovely body and waist the jaunty hat with its small fresh feathers all were nothing to him nor was the bright honest face beneath the hat anything to him nowfor it was an honest face though misfortunes which had come had somewhat marred the honesty of the heart  at first the conversation was about indifferent thingskillancodlem and mrs jones crummietoddie and reginald dobbes they had gone along the highroad as far as the postoffice and had turned up through the wood and reached a seat whence there was a beautiful view down upon the archay before a word was said affecting either miss boncassen or the ring you got the ring safe she said  oh yes  how could you be so foolish as to risk it  i did not regard it as mine you had accepted iti thought  but if i had and then repented of my fault in doing so should you not have been willing to help me in setting myself right with myself of course after what had passed it was a trouble to me when it came what was i to do for a day or two i thought i would take it not as liking to take it but as getting rid of the trouble in that way then i remembered its value its history the fact that all who knew you would want to know what had become of itand i felt that it should be given back there is only one person to whom you must give it  who is that he said quickly  your wifeor to her who is to become your wife no other woman can be justified in accepting such a present  there has been a great deal more said about it than its worth said he not anxious at the present moment to discuss any matrimonial projects with her shall we go on to the fall then she got up and led the way till they came to the little bridge from which they could see the falls of the codlem below them i call that very pretty he said  i thought you would like it  i never saw anything of that kind more jolly do you care for scenery mabel  very much i know no pleasure equal to it you have never seen grex  is it like this  not in the least it is wilder than this and there are not so many trees but to my eyes it is very beautiful i wish you had seen it  perhaps i may some day  that is not likely now she said the house is in ruins if i had just money enough to keep it for myself i think i could live alone there and be happy  youalone of course you mean to marry  mean to marry do persons marry because they mean it with nineteen men out of twenty the idea of marrying them would convey the idea of hating them you can mean to marry no doubt you do mean it  i suppose i shallsome day how very well the house looks from here it was incumbent upon him at the present moment to turn the conversation  but when she had a project in her head it was not so easy to turn her away yes indeed she said very well but as i was sayingyou can mean to marry  anybody can mean it  but you can carry out a purpose what are you thinking of doing now  upon my honour mabel that is unfair  are we not friends  i think so  dear friends  i hope so  then may i not tell you what i think if you do not mean to marry that american young lady you should not raise false hopes  falsehopes he had hopes but he had never thought that isabel could have any  false hopescertainly do you not know that everyone was looking at you last night  certainly not  and that that old woman is going about talking of it as her doing pretending to be afraid of your father whereas nothing would please her better than to humble a family so high as yours  humble exclaimed lord silverbridge  do you think your father would like it would you think that another man would be doing well for himself by marrying miss boncassen  i do said he energetically  then you must be very much in love with her  i say nothing about that  if you are so much in love with her that you mean to face the displeasure of all your friends  i do not say what i mean i could talk more freely to you than to any one else but i wont talk about that even to you as regards miss boncassen i think that any man might marry her without discredit i wont have it said that she can be inferior to meor to anybody  there was a steady manliness in this which took lady mabel by surprise she was convinced that he intended to offer his hand to the girl and now was actuated chiefly by a feeling that his doing so would be an outrage to all english propriety if a word might have an effect it would be her duty to speak that word i think you are wrong there lord silverbridge  i am sure i am right  what have you yourself felt about your sister and mr tregear  it is altogether differentaltogether franks wife will be simply his wife mine should i outlive my father will be duchess of omnium  but your father i have heard you speak with bitter regret of this affair of lady marys because it vexes him would your marriage with an american lady vex him less  why should it vex him at all is she vulgar or ill to look at or stupid  think of her mother  i am not going to marry her mother nor for the matter of that am i going to marry her you are taking all that for granted in a most unfair way  how can i help it after what i saw yesterday  i will not talk any more about it we had better go down or we shall get no lunch lady mabel as she followed him tried to make herself believe that all her sorrow came from regret that so fine a scion of the british nobility should throw himself away upon an american adventuress  the guests were still at lunch when they entered the diningroom and isabel was seated close to mrs jones silverbridge at once went up to herand place was made for him as though he had almost a right to be next to her miss boncassen herself bore her honours well seeming to regard the little change at table as though it was of no moment i became so eager about that game she said that i went on too long  i hope you are now none the worse  at six oclock this morning i thought i should never use my legs again  were you awake at six said silverbridge with pitying voice  that was it i could not sleep now i begin to hope that sooner or later i shall unstiffen  during every moment at every word that he uttered he was thinking of the declaration of love which he had made to her but it seemed to him as though the matter had not dwelt on her mind when they drew their chairs away from the table he thought that not a moment was to be lost before some further explanation of their feelings for each other should be made was not the matter which had been so far discussed of vital importance for both of them and glorious as she was above all other women the offer which he had made must have some weight with her he did not think that he proposed to give more than she deserved but still that which he was so willing to give was not a little or was it possible that she had not understood his meaning if so he would not willingly lose a moment before he made it plain to her but she seemed content to hang about with the other women and when she sauntered about the grounds seated herself on a gardenchair with lady mabel and discussed with great eloquence the general beauty of scottish scenery an hour went on in this way could it be that she knew that he had offered to make her his wife during this time he went and returned more than once but still she was there on the same gardenseat talking to those who came in her way  then on a sudden she got up and put her hand on his arm come and take a turn with me she said lord silverbridge do you remember anything of last night  remember  i thought for a while this morning that i would let it pass as though it had been mere trifling  it would have wanted two to let it pass in that way he said almost indignantly  on hearing this she looked up at him and there came over her face that brilliant smile which to him was perhaps the most potent of her spells what do you mean bywanting two  i must have a voice in that as well as you  and what is your voice  my voice is this i told you last night that i loved you this morning i ask you to be my wife  it is a very clear voice she saidalmost in a whisper but in a tone so serious that it startled him  it ought to be clear he said doggedly  do you think i dont know that do you think that if i liked you well last night i dont like you better now  but do youlike me  that is just the thing i am going to say nothing about  isabel  just the one thing i will not allude to now you must listen to me  certainly  i know a great deal about you we americans are an inquiring people and i have found out pretty much everything his mind misgave him as he felt she had ascertained his former purpose respecting mabel you she said among young men in england are about the foremost and thereforeas i thinkabout the foremost in the world and you have all personal giftsyouth and spirits well i will not go on and name the others you are no doubt supposed to be entitled to the best and sweetest of gods feminine creatures  you are she  whether you be entitled to me or not i cannot yet say now i will tell you something of myself my fathers father came to new york as a labourer from holland and worked upon the quays in that city then he built houses and became rich and was almost a miserwith the good sense however to educate his only son what my father is you see to me he is sterling gold but he is not like your people my dear mother is not at all like your ladies she is not a lady in your sensethough with her unselfish devotion to others she is something infinitely better for myself i amwell meaning to speak honestly i will call myself pretty and smart i think i know how to be true  i am sure you do  but what right have you to suppose i shall know how to be a duchess  i am sure you will  now listen to me go to your friends and ask them ask that lady mabelask your fatherask that lady cantrip and above all ask yourself and allow me to require you to take three months to do this do not come to see me for three months  and then  what may happen then i cannot tell for i want three months also to think of it myself till then goodbye she gave him her hand and left it in his for a few seconds he tried to draw her to him but she resisted him still smiling then she left him     chapter xli  ischl   it was a custom with mrs finn almost every autumn to go off to vienna where she possessed considerable property and there to inspect the circumstances of her estate sometimes her husband would accompany her and he did so in this year of which we are now speaking one morning in september they were together at an hotel at ischl whither they had come from vienna when as they went through the hall into the courtyard they came in the very doorway upon the duke of omnium and his daughter the duke and lady mary had just arrived having passed through the mountains from the saltmine district and were about to take up their residence in the hotel for a few days they had travelled very slowly for lady mary had been ill and the duke had expressed his determination to see a doctor at ischl  there is no greater mistake than in supposing that only the young blush but the blushes of middle life are luckily not seen through the tan which has come from the sun and the gas and the work and the wiles of the world both the duke and phineas blushed and though their blushes were hidden that peculiar glance of the eye which always accompanies a blush was visible enough from one to the other the elder lady kept her countenance admirably and the younger one had no occasion for blushing she at once ran forward and kissed her friend the duke stood with his hat off waiting to give his hand to the lady and then took that of his late colleague how odd that we should meet here he said turning to mrs finn  odd enough to us that your grace should be here she said because we had heard nothing of your intended coming  it is so nice to find you said lady mary we are this moment come dont say that you are this moment going  at this moment we are only going as far as halstadt  and are coming back to dinner of course they will dine with us will they not papa the duke said that he hoped they would to declare that you are engaged at an hotel unless there be some real engagement is almost an impossibility there was no escape and before they were allowed to get into their carriage they had promised they would dine with the duke and his daughter  i dont know that it is especially a bore mrs finn said to her husband in the carriage you may be quite sure that of whatever trouble there may be in it he has much more than his share  his share should be the whole said her husband no one else has done anything wrong  when the dukes apology had reached her so that there was no longer any ground for absolute hostility then she had told the whole story to her husband he at first was very indignant what right had the duke to expect that any ordinary friend should act duenna over his daughter in accordance with his caprices this was said and much more of the kind but any humour towards quarrelling which phineas finn might have felt for a day or two was quieted by his wifes prudence a man she said can do no more than apologise after that there is no room for reproach  at dinner the conversation turned at first on british politics in which mrs finn was quite able to take her part phineas was decidedly of opinion that sir timothy beeswax and lord drummond could not live another session and on this subject a good deal was said later in the evening the duke found himself sitting with mrs finn in the broad verandah over the hotel garden while lady mary was playing to phineas within how do you think she is looking asked the father  of course i see that she has been ill she tells me that she was far from well at salzburg  yesindeed for three or four days she frightened me much she suffered terribly from headaches  nervous headaches  so they said there i feel quite angry with myself because i did not bring a doctor with us the trouble and ceremony of such an accompaniment is no doubt disagreeable  and i suppose seemed when you started to be unnecessary  quite unnecessary  does she complain again now  she did todaya little  the next day lady mary could not leave her bed and the duke in his sorrow was obliged to apply to mrs finn after what had passed on the previous day mrs finn of course called and was shown at once up to her young friends room there she found the girl in great pain lying with her two thin hands up to her head and hardly able to utter more than a word shortly after that mrs finn was alone with the duke and then there took place a conversation between them which the lady thought to be very remarkable  had i better send for a doctor from england he asked in answer to this mrs finn expressed her opinion that such a measure was hardly necessary that the gentleman from the town who had been called in seemed to know what he was about and that the illness lamentable as it was did not seem to be in any way dangerous one cannot tell what it comes from said the duke dubiously  young people i fancy are often subject to such maladies  it must come from something wrong  that may be said of all sickness  and therefore one tries to find out the cause she says that she is unhappy these last words he spoke slowly and in a low voice to this mrs finn could make no reply she did not doubt but that the girl was unhappy and she knew well why but the source of lady marys misery was one to which she could not very well allude you know all the misery about that young man  that is a trouble that requires time to cure it she saidnot meaning to imply that time would cure it by enabling the girl to forget her lover but because in truth she had not known what else to say  if time will cure it  time they say cures all sorrows  but what should i do to help time there is no sacrifice i would not makeno sacrifice of myself i mean i would devote myself to herleave everything else on one side we purpose being back in england in october but i would remain here if i thought it better for her comfort  i cannot tell duke  neither can i but you are a woman and might know better than i do it is so hard that a man should be left with a charge of which from its very nature he cannot understand the duties then he paused but she could find no words which would suit at the moment it was almost incredible to her that after what had passed he should speak to her at all as to the condition of his daughter i cannot you know he said very seriously encourage a hope that she should be allowed to marry that man  i do not know  you yourself mrs finn felt that when she told you about it at matching  i felt that you would disapprove of it  disapprove of it how could it be otherwise of course you felt that there are ranks in life in which the first comer that suits a maidens eye may be accepted as a fitting lover i will not say but that they who are born to such a life may be the happier they are i am sure free from troubles to which they are incident whom fate has called to a different sphere but duty isdutyand whatever pang it may cost duty should be performed  certainly  certainlycertainly certainly he said reechoing her word  but then duke one has to be so sure what duty requires in many matters this is easy enough and the only difficulty comes from temptation there are cases in which it is so hard to know  is this one of them  i think so  then the maiden shouldin any class of lifebe allowed to take the manthat just suits her eye as he said this his mind was intent on his glencora and on burgo fitzgerald  i have not said so a man may be bad vicious a spendthrifteaten up by bad habits then he frowned thinking that she also had her mind intent on his glencora and on that burgo fitzgerald and being most unwilling to have the difference between burgo and frank tregear pointed out to him nor have i said she continued that even were none of these faults apparent in the character of a suitor the lady should in all cases be advised to accept a young man because he has made himself agreeable to her there may be discrepancies  there are said he still with a low voice but with infinite energyinsurmountable discrepancies  i only said that this was a case in which it might be difficult for you to see your duty plainly  why should it be  you would not have herbreak her heart then he was silent for awhile turning over in his mind the proposition which now seemed to have been made to him if the question came to thatshould she be allowed to break her heart and die or should he save her from that fate by sanctioning her marriage with tregear if the choice could be put to him plainly by some supernal power what then would he choose if duty required him to prevent this marriage his duty could not be altered by the fact that his girl would avenge herself upon him by dying if such a marriage were in itself wrong that wrong could not be made right by the fear of such a catastrophe was it not often the case that duty required that someone should die and yet as he thought of itthought that the someone whom his mind had suggested was the one female creature now left belonging to himhe put his hand up to his brow and trembled with agony if he knew if in truth he believed that such would be the result of firmness on his partthen he would be infirm then he must yield sooner than that he must welcome this tregear to his house but why should he think that she would die this woman had now asked him whether he would be willing to break his girls heart it was a frightful question but he could see that it had come naturally in the sequence of the conversation which he had forced upon her did girls break their hearts in such emergencies was it not all romance men have died and worms have eaten thembut not for love he remembered it all and carried on the argument in his mind though the pause was but for a minute there might be suffering no doubt the higher the duties the keener the pangs but would it become him to be deterred from doing right because she for a time might find that she had made the world bitter to herself and were there not feminine wilestricks by which women learn to have their way in opposition to the judgment of their lords and masters he did not think that his mary was wilfully guilty of any scheme the suffering he knew was true suffering but not the less did it become him to be on his guard against attacks of this nature  no he said at last i would not have her break her heartif i understand what such words mean they are generally i think used fantastically  you would not wish to see her overwhelmed by sorrow  wish it what a question to ask a father  i must be more plain in my language duke though such a marriage be distasteful to you it might perhaps be preferable to seeing her sorrowing always  why should it i have to sorrow always we are told that man is born to sorrow as surely as the sparks fly upwards  then i can say nothing further  you think i am cruel  if i am to say what i really think i shall offend you  nonot unless you mean offence  i shall never do that to you duke when you talk as you do now you hardly know yourself you think you could see her suffering and not be moved by it but were it to be continued long you would give way though we know that there is an infinity of grief in this life still we struggle to save those we love from grieving if she be steadfast enough to cling to her affection for this man then at last you will have to yield he looked at her frowning but did not say a word then it will perhaps be a comfort for you to know that the man himself is trustworthy and honest  there was a terrible rebuke in this but still as he had called it down upon himself he would not resent it even in his heart thank you he said rising from his chair perhaps you will see her again this afternoon of course she assented and as the interview had taken place in his rooms she took her leave  this which mrs finn had said to him was all to the same effect as that which had come from lady cantrip only it was said with a higher spirit both the women saw the matter in the same light there must be a fight between him and his girl but she if she could hold out for a certain time would be the conqueror he might take her away and try what absence would do or he might have recourse to that specific which had answered so well in reference to his own wife but if she continued to sorrow during absence and if she would have nothing to do with the other loverthen he must at last give way he had declared that he was willing to sacrifice himselfmeaning thereby that if a lengthened visit to the cities of china or a prolonged sojourn in the western states of america would wean her from her love he would go to china or to the western states at present his selfbanishment had been carried no farther than vienna during their travels hitherto tregears name had not once been mentioned the duke had come away from home resolved not to mention itand she was minded to keep it in reserve till some seeming catastrophe should justify a declaration of her purpose but from first to last she had been sad and latterly she had been ill when asked as to her complaint she would simply say that she was not happy to go on with this through the chinese cities could hardly be good for either of them she would not wake herself to any enthusiasm in regard to scenery costume pictures or even discomforts wherever she was taken it was all barren to her  as their plans stood at present they were to return to england so as to enable her to be at custins by the middle of october had he taught himself to hope that any good could be done by prolonged travelling he would readily have thrown over custins and lord popplecourt he could not bring himself to trust much to the popplecourt scheme but the same contrivance had answered on that former occasion when he spoke to her about their plans she expressed herself quite ready to go back to england when he suggested those chinese cities her face became very long and she was immediately attacked by paroxysms of headaches  i think i should take her to some place on the seashore in england said mrs finn  custins is close to the sea he replied it is lord cantrips place in dorsetshire it was partly settled that she was to go there  i suppose she likes lady cantrip  why should she not  she has not said a word to me to the contrary i only fear she would feel that she was being sent thereas to a convent  what ought i to do then  how can i venture to answer that what she would like best i think would be to return to matching with you and to settle down in a quiet way for the winter the duke shook his head that would be worse than travelling she would still have headaches and still tell him that she was unhappy of course i do not know what your plans are and pray believe me that i should not obtrude my advice if you did not ask me  i know it he said i know how good you are and how reasonable i know how much you have to forgive  oh no  and if i have not said so as i should have done it has not been from want of feeling i do believe you did what you thought best when mary told you that story at matching  why should your grace go back to that  only that i may acknowledge my indebtedness to you and say to you somewhat fuller than i could do in my letter that i am sorry for the pain which i gave you  all that is over nowand shall be forgotten  then he spoke of his immediate plans he would at once go back to england by slow stagesby very slow stagesstaying a day or two at salzburg at ratisbon at nuremberg at frankfort and so on in this way he would reach england about the 10th of october and mary would then be ready to go to custins by the time appointed  in a day or two lady mary was better it is terrible while it lasts she said speaking to mrs finn of her headache but when it has gone then i am quite well onlyshe added after a pauseonly i can never be happy again while papa thinks as he does now then there was a party made up before they separated for an excursion to the hintersee and the obersee on this occasion lady mary seemed to enjoy herself as she liked the companionship of mrs finn against lady cantrip she never said a word but lady cantrip was always a duenna to her whereas mrs finn was a friend while the duke and phineas were discussing politics togetherthoroughly enjoying the weakness of lord drummond and the iniquity of sir timothywhich they did with augmented vehemence from their ponies backs the two women in lower voices talked over their own affairs i dare say you will be happy at custins said mrs finn  no i shall not there will be people there whom i dont know and i dont want to know have you heard anything about him mrs finn  mrs finn turned round and looked at herfor a moment almost angrily then her heart relented do you meanmr tregear  yes mr tregear  i think i heard that he was shooting with lord silverbridge  i am glad of that said mary  it will be pleasant for both of them  i am very glad they should be together while i know that i feel that we are not altogether separated i will never give it up mrs finnnever never it is no use taking me to china in that mrs finn quite agreed with her     chapter xlii  again at killancodlem   silverbridge remained at crummietoddie under the dominion of reginald dobbes till the second week in september popplecourt nidderdale and gerald palliser were there also very obedient and upon the whole efficient tregear was intractable occasional and untrustworthy he was the cause of much trouble to mr dobbes he would entertain a most heterodox and injurious idea that as he had come to crummietoddie for amusement he was not bound to do anything that did not amuse him he would not understand that in sport as in other matters there was an ambition driving a man on to excel always and be ahead of others in spite of this mr dobbes had cause for much triumph it was going to be the greatest thing ever done by six guns in scotland as for gerald whom he had regarded as a boy and who had offended him by saying that crummietoddie was uglyhe was ready to go round the world for him he had indoctrinated gerald with all his ideas of a sportsmaneven to a contempt for champagne and a conviction that tobacco should be moderated the three lords too had proved themselves efficient and the thing was going to be a success but just when a day was of vital importance when it was essential that there should be a strong party for a drive silverbridge found it absolutely necessary that he should go over to killancodlem  she has gone said nidderdale  who the  is she asked silverbridge almost angrily  everybody knows who she is said popplecourt  it will be a good thing when some she has got hold of you my boy so as to keep you in your proper place  if you cannot withstand that sort of attraction you ought not to go in for shooting at all said dobbes  i shouldnt wonder at his going continued nidderdale if we didnt all know that the american is no longer there she has gone tobath i think they say  i suppose its mrs jones herself said popplecourt  my dear boys said silverbridge you may be quite sure that when i say that i am going to killancodlem i mean to go to killancodlem and that no chaff about young ladieswhich i think very disgustingwill stop me i shall be sorry if dobbess roll of the killed should be lessened by a single hand seeing that his ambition sets that way considering the amount of slaughter we have perpetrated i really think that we need not be over anxious after this nothing further was said tregear who knew that mabel grex was still at killancodlem had not spoken  in truth mabel had sent for lord silverbridge and this had been her letter      dear lord silverbridge     mrs montacute jones is cut to the heart because you have    not been over to see her again and she says that it is    lamentable to think that such a man as reginald dobbes    should have so much power over you only twelve miles    she says and he knows that we are here i told her that    you knew miss boncassen was gone     but though miss boncassen has left us we are a very    pleasant party and surely you must be tired of such a    place as crummietoddie if only for the sake of getting a    good dinner once in a way do come over again i shall be    here yet for ten days as they will not let me go back to    grex i dont know where i could be more happy i have been    asked to go to custins and suppose i shall turn up there    some time in the autumn     and now shall i tell you what i expect i do expect    that you will come over tosee me i did see her the    other day you will say and she did not make herself    pleasant i know that how was i to make myself pleasant    when i found myself so completely snuffed out by your    american beauty now she is away and richard will be    himself do come because in truth i want to see you     yours always sincerely     mabel grex   on receiving this he at once made up his mind to go to killancodlem but he could not make up his mind why it was that she had asked him he was sure of two things sure in the first place that she had intended to let him know that she did not care about him and then sure that she was aware of his intention in regard to miss boncassen everybody at killancodlem had seen itto his disgust but still that it was so had been manifest and he had consoled himself feeling that it would matter nothing should he be accepted she had made an attempt to talk him out of his purpose could it be that she thought it possible a second attempt might be successful if so she did not know him  she had in truth thought not only that this but that something further than this might be possible of course the prize loomed larger before her eyes as the prospects of obtaining it became less she could not doubt that he had intended to offer her his hand when he had spoken to her of his love in london then she had stopped himhad spared him as she had told her friend certainly she had then been swayed by some feeling that it would be ungenerous in her to seize greedily the first opportunity he had given her but he had again made an effort he surely would not have sent her the ring had he not intended her to regard him as her lover when she received the ring her heart had beat very high then she had sent that little note saying that she would keep it till she could give it to his wife when she wrote that she had intended the ring should be her own and other things pressed upon her mind why had she been asked to the dinner at richmond why was she invited to custins little hints had reached her of the dukes goodwill towards her if on that side the marriage were approved why should she destroy her own hopes  then she had seen him with miss boncassen and in her pique had forced the ring back upon him during that long game on the lawn her feelings had been very bitter of course the girl was the lovelier of the two all the world was raving of her beauty and there was no doubt as to the charm of her wit and manner and then she had no touch of that blasé usedup way of life of which lady mabel was conscious herself it was natural that it should be so and was she mabel grex the girl to stand in his way and to force herself upon him if he loved another certainly notthough there might be a triple ducal coronet to be had  but were there not other considerations could it be well that the heir of the house of omnium should marry an american girl as to whose humble birth whispers were already afloat as his friend would it not be right that she should tell him what the world would say as his friend therefore she had given him her counsel  when he was gone the whole thing weighed heavily upon her mind why should she lose the prize if it might still be her own to be duchess of omnium she had read of many of the other sex and of one or two of her own who by settled resolution had achieved greatness in opposition to all obstacles was this thing beyond her reach to hunt him and catch him and marry him to his own injurythat would be impossible to her she was sure of herself there but how infinitely better would this be for him would she not have all his family with herand all the world of england in how short a time would he not repent his marriage with miss boncassen whereas were she his wife she would so stir herself for his joys for his good for his honour that there should be no possibility of repentance and he certainly had loved her why else had he followed her and spoken such words to her of course he had loved her but then there had come this blaze of beauty and had carried offnot his heart but his imagination because he had yielded to such fascination was she to desert him and also to desert herself from day to day she thought of it and then she wrote that letter she hardly knew what she would do what she might say but she would trust to the opportunity to do and say something  if you have no room for me he said to mrs jones you must scold lady mab she has told me that you told her to invite me  of course i did do you think i would not sleep in the stables and give you up my own bed if there were no other it is so good of you to come  so good of you mrs jones to ask me  so very kind to come when all the attraction has gone then he blushed and stammered and was just able to say that his only object in life was to pour out his adoration at the feet of mrs montacute jones herself  there was a certain lady fawna pretty mincing married woman of about twentyfive with a husband much older who liked mild flirtations with mild young men i am afraid weve lost your great attraction she whispered to him  certainly not as long as lady fawn is here he said seating himself close to her on a garden bench and seizing suddenly hold of her hand she gave a little scream and a jerk and so relieved herself from him you see said he people do make such mistakes about a mans feelings  lord silverbridge  its quite true but ill tell you all about it another time and so he left her all these little troubles his experience in the house the necessity of snubbing tifto the choice of a wife and his battle with reginald dobbes were giving him by degrees age and flavour  lady mabel had fluttered about him on his first coming and had been very gracious doing the part of an old friend there is to be a big shooting tomorrow she said in the presence of mrs jones  if it is to come to that he said i might as well go back to dobbydom  you may shoot if you like said lady mabel  i havent even brought a gun with me  then well have a walka whole lot of us she said  in the evening about an hour before dinner silverbridge and lady mabel were seated together on the bank of a little stream which ran on the other side of the road but on a spot not more than a furlong from the halldoor she had brought him there but she had done so without any definite scheme she had made no plan of campaign for the evening having felt relieved when she found herself able to postpone the project of her attack till the morrow of course there must be an attack but how it should be made she had never had the courage to tell herself the great women of the world the semiramises the pocahontas the ida pfeiffers and the charlotte cordays had never been wanting to themselves when the moment for action came now she was pleased to have this opportunity added to her this pleasant minute in which some soft preparatory word might be spoken but the great effort should be made on the morrow  is not this nicer than shooting with mr dobbes she asked  a great deal nicer of course i am bound to say so  but in truth i want to find out what you really like men are so different you need not pay me any compliment you know that well enough  i like you better than dobbesif you mean that  even so much is something  but i am fond of shooting  only a man may have enough of it  too much if he is subject to dobbes as dobbes likes them to be gerald likes it  did you think it odd she said after a pause that i should ask you to come over again  was it odd he replied  that is as you may take it there is certainly no other man in the world to whom i would have done it  not to tregear  yes she said yesto tregear could i have been as sure of a welcome for him as i am for you frank is in all respects the same as a brother to me that would not have seemed oddi mean to myself  and has this beenoddto yourself  yes not that anybody else has felt it so only iand perhaps you you felt it so  not especially i thought you were a very good fellow i have always thought thatexcept when you made me take back the ring  does that still fret you  no man likes to take back a thing it makes him seem to have been awkward and stupid in giving it  it was the value  you should have left me to judge of that  if i have offended you i will beg your pardon give me anything else anything but that and i will take it  but why not that said he  now that you have fitted it for a ladys finger it should go to your wife no one else should have it  upon this he brought the ring once more out of his pocket and again offered it to her no anything but that that your wife must have then he put the ring back again it would have been nicer for you had miss boncassen been here in saying this she followed no plan it came rather from pique it was almost as though she had asked him whether miss boncassen was to have the ring  what makes you say that  but it would  yes it would he replied stoutly turning round as he lay on the ground and facing her  has it come to that  come to what you ask me a question and i answer you truly  you cannot be happy without her  i did not say so you ask me whether i should like to have her hereand i say yes what would you think of me if i said no  my being here is not enough this should not have been said of course but the little speech came from the exquisite pain of the moment she had meant to have said hardly anything she had intended to be happy with him just touching lightly on things which might lead to that attack which must be made on the morrow but words will often lead whither the speaker has not intended so it was now and in the soreness of her heart she spoke my being here is not enough  it would be enough he said jumping on his feet if you understood all and would be kind to me  i will at any rate be kind to you she replied as she sat upon the bank looking at the running water  i have asked miss boncassen to be my wife  and she has accepted  no not as yet she is to take three months to think of it of course i love her best of all if you will sympathise with me in that then i will be as happy with you as the day is long  no said she i cannot i will not  very well  there should be no such marriage if you have told me in confidence  of course i have told you in confidence  it will go no farther but there can be no sympathy between us ititit is notis not then she burst into tears  mabel  no sir no no what did you mean but never mind i have no questions to ask not a word to say why should i only thisthat such a marriage will disgrace your family to me it is no more than to anybody else but it will disgrace your family  how she got back to the house she hardly knew nor did he that evening they did not again speak to each other and on the following morning there was no walk to the mountains before dinner he drove himself back to crummietoddie and when he was taking his leave she shook hands with him with her usual pleasant smile     chapter xliii  what happened at doncaster   the leger this year was to be run on the 14th september and while lord silverbridge was amusing himself with the deer at crummietoddie and at killancodlem with the more easily pursued young ladies the indefatigable major was hard at work in the stables this came a little hard on him there was the cubhunting to be looked after which made his presence at runnymede necessary and then that pigheaded fellow silverbridge would not have the horses trained anywhere but at newmarket how was he to be in two places at once yet he was in two places almost at once cubhunting in the morning at egham and bagshot and sitting on the same evening at the stabledoor at newmarket with his eyes fixed upon prime minister  gradually had he and captain green come to understand each other and though they did at last understand each other tifto would talk as though there were no such correct intelligencewhen for instance he would abuse lord silverbridge for being pigheaded on such occasions the captains remark would generally be short that be blowed he would say implying that that state of things between the two partners in which such complaints might be natural had now been brought to an end but on one occasion about a week before the race he spoke out a little plainer whats the use of your going on with all that before me its settled what youve got to do  i dont know that anything is settled said the major  aint it i thought it was if it aint youll find yourself in the wrong box youve as straight a tip as a man need wish for but if you back out youll come to grief your moneys all on the other way already  on the friday before the race silverbridge dined with tifto at the beargarden on the next morning they went down to newmarket to see the horse get a gallop and came back the same evening during all this time tifto was more than ordinarily pleasant to his patron the horse and the certainty of the horses success were the only subjects mooted it isnt what i say repeated tifto but look at the betting you cant get five to four against him they tell me that if you want to do anything on the sunday the pull will be the other way  i stand to lose over £20000 already said silverbridge almost frightened by the amount  but how much are you on to win said tifto i suppose you could sell your bets for £5000 down  i wish i knew how to do it said silverbridge but this was an arrangement which if made just now would not suit the majors views  they went to newmarket and there they met captain green tifto said the young lord i wont have that fellow with us when the horse is galloping  there isnt an honester man or a man who understands a horses paces better in all england said tifto  i wont have him standing alongside of me on the heath said his lordship  i dont know how im to help it  if hes there ill send the horse inthats all then tifto found it best to say a few words to captain green but the captain also said a few words to himself d young fool he dont know what hes dropping into which assertion if you lay aside the unnecessary expletive was true to the letter lord silverbridge was a young fool and did not at all know into what a mess he was being dropped by the united experience perspicuity and energy of the man whose company on the heath he had declined  the horse was quite a picture to look at mr pook the trainer assured his lordship that for health and condition he had never seen anything better stout all over said mr pook and not an ounce of what you may call flesh and bright just feel his coat my lord thats ealththat is not dressing nor yet macassar  and then there were various evidences produced of his pacehow he had beaten that horse giving him two pounds how he had been beaten by that but only on a mile course the leger distance was just the thing for prime minister how by a lucky chance that marvellous quick rat of a thing that had won the derby had not been entered for the autumn race how coalheaver was known to have had bad feet hes a stout orse no doubtis the eaver said mr pook and thats why the bettingmen have stuck to him but hell be nowhere on wednesday theyre beginning to see it now my lord i wish they wasnt so sharpsighted  in the course of the day however they met a gentleman who was of a different opinion he said loudly that he looked on the heaver as the best threeyearold in england of course as matters stood he wasnt going to back the heaver at even moneybut hed take twentyfive to thirty in hundreds between the two all this ended in the bet being accepted and duly booked by lord silverbridge and in this way silverbridge added two thousand four hundred pounds to his responsibilities  but there was worse than this coming on the sunday afternoon he went down to doncaster of course in company with the major he was alive to the necessity of ridding himself of the major but it had been acknowledged that that duty could not be performed till after this race had been run as he sat opposite to his friend on their journey to doncaster he thought of this in the train it should be done immediately on their return to london after the race but the horse his prime minister was by this time so dear to him that he intended if possible to keep possession of the animal  when they reached doncaster the racingmen were all occupied with prime minister the horse and mr pook had arrived that day from newmarket via cambridge and peterborough tifto silverbridge and mr pook visited him together three times that afternoon and eveningand the captain also visited the horse though not in company with lord silverbridge to do mr pook justice no one could be more careful when the captain came round with the major mr pook was there but captain green did not enter the boxhad no wish to do so was of opinion that on such occasions no one whose business did not carry him there should go near a horse his only object seemed to be to compliment mr pook as to his care skill and good fortune  it was on the tuesday evening that the chief mischief was done there was a club at which many of the racingmen dined and there lord silverbridge spent his evening he was the hero of the hour and everybody flattered him it must be acknowledged that his head was turned they dined at eight and much wine was drunk no one was tipsy but many were elated and much confidence in their favourite animals was imparted to men who had been sufficiently cautious before dinner then cigars and sodaandbrandy became common and our young friend was not more abstemious than others large sums were named and at last in three successive bets lord silverbridge backed his horse for more than forty thousand pounds as he was making the second bet mr lupton came across to him and begged him to hold his hand it will be a nasty sum for you to lose and winning it will be nothing to you he said silverbridge took it goodhumouredly but said that he knew what he was about these men will pay whispered lupton but you cant be quite sure what theyre at the young mans brow was covered with perspiration he was smoking quick and had already smoked more than was good for him all right he said ill mind what im about mr lupton could do no more and retired before the night was over bets had been booked to the amount stated and the dukes son who had promised that he would never plunge stood to lose about seventy thousand pounds upon the race  while this was going on tifto sat not far from his patron but completely silent during the day and early in the evening a few sparks of the glory which scintillated from the favourite horse flew in his direction but he was on this occasion unlike himself and though the horse was to be run in his name had very little to say in the matter not a boast came out of his mouth during dinner or after dinner he was so moody that his partner who was generally anxious to keep him quiet more than once endeavoured to encourage him but he was unable to rouse himself it was still within his power to run straight to be on the square if not with captain green at any rate with lord silverbridge but to do so he must make a clean breast with his lordship and confess the intended sin as he heard all that was being done his conscience troubled him sorely with pitch of this sort he had never soiled himself before he was to have three thousand pounds from green and then there would be the bets he himself had laid against the horseby greens assistance it would be the making of him of what use had been all his square work to him and then silverbridge had behaved so badly to him but still as he sat there during the evening he would have given a hand to have been free from the attempt he had had no conception before that he could become subject to such misery from such a cause he would make it straight with silverbridge this very nightbut that silverbridge was ever lighting fresh cigars and ever having his glass refilled it was clear to him that on this night silverbridge could not be made to understand anything about it and the deed in which he himself was to be the chief actor was to be done very early in the following morning at last he slunk away to bed  on the following morning the morning of the day on which the race was to be run the major tapped at his patrons door about seven oclock of course there was no answer though the knock was repeated when young men overnight drink as much brandyandwater as silverbridge had done and smoke as many cigars they are apt not to hear knocks at their door made at seven oclock nor was his lordships servant upso that tifto had no means of getting at him except by personal invasion of the sanctity of his bedroom but there was no time not a minute to be lost now within this minute that was pressing on him tifto must choose his course he opened the door and was standing at the young mans head  what the d does this mean said his lordship angrily as soon as his visitor had succeeded in waking him tifto muttered something about the horse which silverbridge failed to understand the young mans condition was by no means pleasant his mouth was furred by the fumes of tobacco his head was aching he was heavy with sleep and this intrusion seemed to him to be a final indignity offered to him by the man whom he now hated what business have you to come in here he said leaning on his elbow i dont care a straw for the horse if you have anything to say send my servant get out  ohvery well said tiftoand tifto got out  it was about an hour afterwards that tifto returned and on this occasion a groom from the stables and the young lords own servant and two or three other men were with him tifto had been made to understand that the news now to be communicated must be communicated by himself whether his lordship were angry or not indeed after what had been done his lordships anger was not of much moment in his present visit he was only carrying out the pleasant little plan which had been arranged for him by captain green what the mischief is up said silverbridge rising in his bed  then tifto told his story sullenly doggedly but still in a perspicuous manner and with words which admitted of no doubt but before he told the story he had excluded all but himself and the groom he and the groom had taken the horse out of the stable it being the animals nature to eat his corn better after slight exercise and while doing so a nail had been picked up  is it much asked silverbridge jumping still higher in his bed then he was told that it was very muchthat the iron had driven itself into the horses frog and that there was actually no possibility that the horse should run on that day  he cant walk my lord said the groom in that authoritative voice which grooms use when they desire to have their own way and to make their masters understand that they at any rate are not to have theirs  where is pook asked silverbridge but mr pook was also still in bed  it was soon known to lord silverbridge as a fact that in very truth the horse could not run then sick with headache with a stomach suffering unutterable things he had as he dressed himself to think of his seventy thousand pounds of course the money would be forthcoming but how would his father look at him how would it be between him and his father now after such a misfortune how would he be able to break that other matter to the duke and say that he had changed his mind about his marriagethat he was going to abandon lady mabel grex and give his hand and a future duchesss coronet to an american girl whose grandfather had been a porter  a nail in his foot well he had heard of such things before he knew that such accidents had happened what an ass must he have been to risk such a sum on the wellbeing and safety of an animal who might any day pick up a nail in his foot then he thought of the caution which lupton had given him what good would the money have done him had he won it what more could he have than he now enjoyed but to lose such a sum of money with all his advantages of wealth he felt himself to be as forlorn and wretched as though he had nothing left in the world before him     chapter xliv  how it was done   the story was soon about the town and was the one matter for discussion in all racing quarters about the town it was about england about all europe it had travelled to america and the indies to australia and the chinese cities before two hours were over before the race was run the accident was discussed and something like the truth surmised in cairo calcutta melbourne and san francisco but at doncaster it was so allpervading a matter that down to the tradesmens daughters and the boys at the freeschool the town was divided into two parties one party believing it to have been a plant and the other holding that the cause had been natural it is hardly necessary to say that the ring as a rule belonged to the former party the ring always suspects it did not behove even those who would win by the transaction to stand up for its honesty  the intention had been to take the horse round a portion of the outside of the course near to which his stable stood a boy rode him and the groom and tifto went with him at a certain spot on their return tifto had exclaimed that the horse was going lame in his off forefoot as to this exclamation the boy and the two men were agreed the boy was then made to dismount and run for mr pook and as he started tifto commenced to examine the horses foot the boy saw him raise the off foreleg he himself had not found the horse lame under him but had been so hustled and hurried out of the saddle by tifto and the groom that he had not thought on that matter till he was questioned so far the story told by tifto and the groom was corroborated by the boyexcept as to the horses actual lameness so far the story was believed by all menexcept in regard to the actual lameness and so far it was true then according to tifto and the groom the other foot was looked at but nothing was seen this other foot the near forefoot was examined by the groom who declared himself to be so flurried by the lameness of such a horse at such a time that he hardly knew what he saw or what he did not see at any rate then in his confusion he found no cause of lameness but the horse was led into the stable as lame as a tree here tifto found the nail inserted into the very cleft of the frog of the near forefoot and so inserted that he could not extract it till the farrier came that the farrier had extracted the nail from the part of the foot indicated was certainly a fact  then there was the nail only those who were most peculiarly privileged were allowed to see the nail but it was buzzed about the racing quarters that the head of the nailan old rusty straight and wellpointed nailbore on it the mark of a recent hammer in answer to this it was alleged that the blacksmith in extracting the nail with his pincers had of course operated on its head had removed certain particles of rust and might easily have given it the appearance of having been struck but in answer to this the farrier who was a sharp fellow and quite beyond suspicion in the matter declared that he had very particularly looked at the nail before he extracted ithad looked at it with the feeling on his mind that something base might too probably have been doneand that he was ready to swear that the clear mark on the head of the nail was there before he touched it and then not in the stable but lying under the little dungheap away from the stabledoor there was found a small piece of broken iron bar about a foot long which might have answered for a hammera rusty bit of iron and amidst the rust of this was found such traces as might have been left had it been used in striking such a nail there were some who declared that neither on the nail nor on the iron could they see anything and among these was the major but mr lupton brought a strong magnifyingglass to bear and the world of examiners was satisfied that the marks were there  it seemed however to be agreed that nothing could be done silverbridge would not lend himself at all to those who suspected mischief he was miserable enough but in this great trouble he would not separate himself from tifto i dont believe a word of all that he said to mr lupton  it ought to be investigated at any rate said lupton  mr pook may do as he likes but i will have nothing to do with it  then tifto came to him swaggering tifto had to go through a considerable amount of acting for which he was not very well adapted the captain would have done it better he would have endeavoured to put himself altogether into the same boat with his partner and would have imagined neither suspicion or enmity on his partners part till suspicion or enmity had been shown but tifto who had not expected that the matter would be allowed to pass over without some inquiry began by assuming that silverbridge would think evil of him tifto who at this moment would have given all that he had in the world not to have done the deed who now hated the instigator of the deed and felt something almost akin to love for silverbridge found himself to be forced by circumstances to defend himself by swaggering i dont understand all this thats going on my lord he said  neither do i replied silverbridge  any horse is subject to an accident i am i suppose as great a sufferer as you are and a deuced sight less able to bear it  who has said anything to the contrary as for bearing it we must take it as it comesboth of us you may as well know now as later that i have done with racingfor ever  what do you tell me that for you can do as you like and i can do as i like about that if i had had my way about the horse this never would have happened taking a horse out at that time in the morningbefore a race  why you went with him yourself  yesby pooks orders you allowed pook to do just as he pleased i should like to know what money pook has got on it and which way he laid it this disgusted silverbridge so much that he turned away and would have no more to say to tifto  before one oclock at which hour it was stated nominally that the races would commence general opinion had formed itselfand general opinion had nearly hit the truth general opinion declared that the nail had been driven in wilfullythat it had been done by tifto himself and that tifto had been instigated by captain green captain green perhaps overacted his part a little his intimacy with the major was well known and yet in all this turmoil he kept himself apart as though he had no interest in the matter i have got my little money on and what little i have i lose he said in answer to inquiries but everyone knew that he could not but have a great interest in a race as to which the half owner of the favourite was a peculiarly intimate friend of his own had he come down to the stables and been seen about the place with tifto it might have been better as it was though he was very quiet his name was soon mixed up in the matter there was one man who asserted it as a fact known to himself that green and villiersone gilbert villierswere in partnership together it was very well known that gilbert villiers would win two thousand five hundred pounds from lord silverbridge  then minute investigation was made into the betting of certain individuals of course there would be great plunder and where would the plunder go who would get the money which poor silverbridge would lose it was said that one at least of the large bets made on that tuesday evening could be traced to the same villiers though not actually made by him more would be learned when the settlingday should come but there was quite enough already to show that there were many men determined to get to the bottom of it all if possible  there came upon silverbridge in his trouble a keen sense of his position and a feeling of the dignity which he ought to support he clung during great part of the morning to mr lupton mr lupton was much his senior and they had never been intimate but now there was comfort in his society i am afraid you are hit heavily said mr lupton  something over seventy thousand pounds  looking at what will be your property it is of course nothing but if  if what  if you go to the jews for it then it will become a great deal  i shall certainly not do that  then you may regard it as a trifle said lupton  no i cant it is not a trifle i must tell my father hell find the money  there is no doubt about that  he will but i feel at present that i would rather change places with the poorest gentleman i know than have to tell him i have done with races lupton  if so this will have been a happy day for you a man in your position can hardly make money by it but he may lose so much if a man really likes the amusementas i doand risks no more than what he has in his pocket that may be very well  at any rate i have done with it  nevertheless he went to see the race run and everybody seemed to be touched with pity for him he carried himself well saying as little as he could of his own horse and taking or affecting to take great interest in the race after the race he managed to see all those to whom he had lost heavy stakeshaving to own to himself as he did so that not one of them was a gentleman to whom he should like to give his hand to them he explained that his father was abroadthat probably his liabilities could not be settled till after his fathers return he however would consult his fathers agent and would then appear on settlingday they were all full of the blandest courtesies there was not one of them who had any doubt as to getting his moneyunless the whole thing might be disputed on the score of tiftos villany even then payment could not be disputed unless it was proved that he who demanded the money had been one of the actual conspirators after having seen his creditors he went away up alone to london  when in london he went to carlton terrace and spent the night in absolute solitude it had been his plan to join gerald for some partridgeshooting at matching and then to go yachting till such time as he should be enabled to renew his suit to miss boncassen early in november he would again ask her to be his wife these had been his plans but now it seemed that everything was changed partridgeshooting and yachting must be out of the question till this terrible load was taken off his shoulders soon after his arrival at the house two telegrams followed him from doncaster one was from gerald what is all this about prime minister is it a sell i am so unhappy the other was from lady mabelfor among other luxuries mrs montacute jones had her own telegraphwire at killancodlem can this be true we are all so miserable i do hope it is not much from which he learned that his misfortune was already known to all his friends  and now what was he to do he ate his supper and then without hesitating for a momentfeeling that if he did hesitate the task would not be done on that nighthe sat down and wrote the following letter      carlton terrace sept 14 18     my dear mr moreton     i have just come up from doncaster you have probably    heard what has been prime ministers fate i dont know    whether any horse has ever been such a favourite for the    leger early in the morning he was taken out and picked up    a nail the consequence was he could not run     now i must come to the bad part of my story i have lost    seventy thousand pounds it is no use beating about the    bush the sum is something over that what am i to do if    i tell you that i shall give up racing altogether i dare    say you will not believe me it is a sort of thing a man    always says when he wants money but i feel now i cannot    help saying it     but what shall i do perhaps if it be not too much    trouble you will come up to town and see me you can send    me a word by the wires     you may be sure of this i shall make no attempt to raise    the money elsewhere unless i find that my father will not    help me you will understand that of course it must be    paid you will understand also what i must feel about    telling my father but i shall do so at once i only wait    till i can hear from you     yours faithfully     silverbridge   during the next day two despatches reached lord silverbridge both of them coming as he sat down to his solitary dinner the first consisted of a short but very civil note      messrs comfort and criball present their compliments to    the earl of silverbridge     messrs c and c beg to offer their apologies for    interfering but desire to inform his lordship that should    cash be wanting to any amount in consequence of the late    races they will be happy to accommodate his lordship    on most reasonable terms at a moments notice upon his    lordships single bond     lord silverbridge may be sure of absolute secrecy     crasham court crutched friars sept 15 18   the other despatch was a telegram from mr moreton saying that he would be in carlton terrace by noon on the following day     chapter xlv  there shall not be another word about it   early in october the duke was at matching with his daughter and phineas finn and his wife were both with them on the day after they parted at ischl the first news respecting prime minister had reached himnamely that his sons horse had lost the race this would not have annoyed him at all but that the papers which he read contained some vague charge of swindling against somebody and hinted that lord silverbridge had been a victim even this would not have troubled himmight in some sort have comforted himwere it not made evident to him that his son had been closely associated with swindlers in these transactions if it were a mere question of money that might be settled without difficulty even though the sum lost might have grown out of what he might have expected into some few thousands still he would bear it without a word if only he could separate his boy from bad companions then came mr moretons letter telling the whole  at the meeting which took place between silverbridge and his fathers agent at carlton terrace it was settled that mr moreton should write the letter silverbridge tried and found that he could not do it he did not know how to humiliate himself sufficiently and yet could not keep himself from making attempts to prove that according to all recognised chances his bets had been good bets  mr moreton was better able to accomplish the task he knew the dukes mind a very large discretion had been left in mr moretons hands in regard to moneys which might be needed on behalf of that dangerous heirso large that he had been able to tell lord silverbridge that if the money was in truth lost according to jockey club rules it should all be forthcoming on the settlingdaycertainly without assistance from messrs comfort and criball the duke had been nervously afraid of such men of business as comfort and criball and from the earliest days of his sons semimanhood had been on his guard against them let any sacrifice be made so that his son might be kept clear from comforts and criballs to mr moreton he had been very explicit his own pecuniary resources were so great that they could bear some ravaging without serious detriment it was for his sons character and standing in the world for his future respectability and dignity that his fears were so keen and not for his own money by one so excitable so fond of pleasure as lord silverbridge some ravaging would probably be made let it be met by ready money such had been the dukes instructions to his own trusted man of business and acting on these instructions mr moreton was able to tell the heir that the money should be forthcoming  mr moreton after detailing the extent and the nature of the loss and the steps which he had decided upon taking went on to explain the circumstances as best he could he had made some inquiry and felt no doubt that a gigantic swindle had been perpetrated by major tifto and others the swindle had been successful mr moreton had consulted certain gentlemen of high character versed in affairs of the turf he mentioned mr lupton among othersand had been assured that though the swindle was undoubted the money had better be paid it was thought to be impossible to connect the men who had made the bets with the perpetrators of the fraudand if lord silverbridge were to abstain from paying his bets because his own partner had ruined the animal which belonged to them jointly the feeling would be against him rather than in his favour in fact the jockey club could not sustain him in such refusal therefore the money would be paid mr moreton with some expressions of doubt trusted that he might be thought to have exercised a wise discretion then he went on to express his own opinion in regard to the lasting effect which the matter would have upon the young man i think said he that his lordship is heartily sickened of racing and that he will never return to it  the duke was of course very wretched when these tidings first reached him though he was a rich man and of all men the least careful of his riches still he felt that seventy thousand pounds was a large sum of money to throw away among a nest of swindlers and then it was excessively grievous to him that his son should have been mixed up with such men wishing to screen his son even from his own anger he was careful to remember that the promise made that tifto should be dismissed was not to take effect till after this race had been run there had been no deceit in that but then silverbridge had promised that he would not plunge there are however promises which from their very nature may be broken without falsehood plunging is a doubtful word and the path down to it like all doubtful pathsis slippery and easy if that assurance with which mr moreton ended his letter could only be made true he could bring himself to forgive even this offence the boy must be made to settle himself in life the duke resolved that his only revenge should be to press on that marriage with mabel grex  at coblenz on their way home the duke and his daughter were caught up by mr and mrs finn and the matter of the young mans losses was discussed phineas had heard all about it and was loud in denunciations against tifto captain green gilbert villiers and others whose names had reached him the money he thought should never have been paid the duke however declared that the money would not cause a moments regret if only the whole thing could be got rid of at that cost it had reached finns ears that tifto was already at loggerheads with his associates there was some hope that the whole thing might be brought to light by this means for all that the duke cared nothing if only silverbridge and tifto could for the future be kept apart as far as he and his were concerned good would have been done rather than harm while they were in this way together on the rhine it was decided that very soon after their return to england phineas and mrs finn should go down to matching  when the duke arrived in london his sons were not there gerald had gone back to oxford and silverbridge had merely left an address then his sister wrote him a very short letter papa will be so glad if you will come to matching do come of course he came and presented himself some few days after the dukes arrival  but he dreaded this meeting with his father which however let it be postponed for ever so long must come at last in reference to this he made a great resolutionthat he would go instantly as soon as he might be sent for when the summons came he started but though he was by courtesy an earl and by fact was not only a man but a member of parliament though he was half engaged to marry one young lady and ought to have been engaged to marry another though he had come to an age at which pitt was a great minister and pope a great poet still his heart was in his boots as a schoolboys might be when he was driven up to the house at matching  in two minutes before he had washed the dust from his face and hands he was with his father i am glad to see you silverbridge said the duke putting out his hand  i hope i see you well sir  fairly well thank you travelling i think agrees with me i miss not my comforts but a certain knowledge of how things are going on which comes to us i think through our skins when we are at home a feeling of absence pervades me otherwise i like it and youwhat have you been doing  shooting a little said silverbridge in a mooncalf tone  shooting a great deal if what i see in the newspapers be true about mr reginald dobbes and his party i presume it is a religion to offer up hecatombs to the autumnal godswho must surely take a keener delight in blood and slaughter than those bloodthirsty gods of old  you should talk to gerald about that sir  has gerald been so great at his sacrifices how will that suit with plato what does mr simcox say  of course they were all to have a holiday just at that time but gerald is reading i fancy that gerald is clever  and he is a great nimrod  as to hunting  nimrod i fancy got his game in any way that he could compass it i do not doubt but that he trapped foxes  with a rifle at deer say for four hundred yards i would back gerald against any man of his age in england or scotland  as for backing silverbridge do not you think that we had better have done with that this was said hardly in a tone of reproach with something even of banter in it and as the question was asked the duke was smiling but in a moment all that sense of joyousness which the young man had felt in singing his brothers praises was expelled his face fell and he stood before his father almost like a culprit we might as well have it out about this racing continued the duke something has to be said about it you have lost an enormous sum of money the dukes tone in saying this became terribly severe such at least was its sound in his sons ears he did not mean to be severe  but when he did speak of that which displeased him his voice naturally assumed that tone of indignation with which in days of yore he had been wont to denounce the public extravagance of his opponents in the house of commons the father paused but the son could not speak at the moment  and worse than that continued the duke you have lost it in as bad company as you could have found had you picked all england through  mr lupton and sir henry playfair and lord stirling were in the room when the bets were made  were the gentlemen you name concerned with major tifto  no sir  who can tell with whom he may be in a room though rooms of that kind are i think best avoided then the duke paused again but silverbridge was now sobbing so that he could hardly speak i am sorry that you should be so grieved continued the father but such delights cannot i think lead to much real joy  it is for you sir said the son rubbing his eyes with the hand which supported his head  my grief in the matter might soon be cured  how shall i cure it i will do anything to cure it  let major tifto and the horses go  they are gone said silverbridge energetically jumping from his chair as he spoke i will never own a horse again or a part of a horse i will have nothing more to do with races you will believe me  i will believe anything that you tell me  i wont say i will not go to another race because  no no i would not have you hamper yourself nor shall you bind yourself by any further promises you have done with racing  indeed indeed i have sir  then the father came up to the son and put his arms round the young mans shoulders and embraced him of course it made me unhappy  i knew it would  but if you are cured of this evil the money is nothing what is it all for but for you and your brother and sister it was a large sum but that shall not grieve me the thing itself is so dangerous that if with that much of loss we can escape i will think that we have made not a bad market who owns the horse now  the horses shall be sold  for anything they may fetch so that we may get clear of this dirt and the major  i know nothing of him i have not seen him since that day  has he claims on you  not a shilling it is all the other way  let it go then be quit of him however it may be send a messenger so that he may understand that you have abandoned racing altogether mr moreton might perhaps see him  that his father should forgive so readily and yet himself suffer so deeply affected the sons feelings so strongly that for a time he could hardly repress his sobs and now there shall not be a word more said about it said the duke suddenly  silverbridge in his confusion could make no answer  there shall not be another word said about it said the duke again and now what do you mean to do with yourself immediately  ill stay here sir as long as you do finn and warburton and i have still a few coverts to shoot  thats a good reason for staying anywhere  i meant that i would remain while you remained sir  that at any rate is a good reason as far as i am concerned but we go to custins next week  theres a deal of shooting to be done at gatherum said the heir  you speak of it as if it were the business of your lifeon which your bread depended  one cant expect game to be kept up if nobody goes to shoot it  cant one i didnt know i should have thought that the less was shot the more there would be to shoot but i am ignorant in such matters silverbridge then broke forth into a long explanation as to coverts gamekeepers poachers breeding and the expectations of the neighbourhood at large in the middle of which he was interrupted by the duke i am afraid my dear boy that i am too old to learn but as it is so manifestly a duty go and perform it like a man who will go with you  i will ask mr finn to be one  he will be very hard upon you in the way of politics  i can answer him better than i can you sir mr lupton said he would come for a day or two hell stand to me  after that his father stopped him as he was about to leave the room one more word silverbridge do you remember what you were saying when you walked down to the house with me from your club that night silverbridge remembered very well what he had said he had undertaken to ask mabel grex to be his wife and had received his fathers ready approval to the proposition but at this moment he was unwilling to refer to that matter i have thought about it very much since that said the duke i may say that i have been thinking of it every day if there were anything to tell me you would let me knowwould you not  yes sir  then there is nothing to be told i hope you have not changed your mind  silverbridge paused a moment trusting that he might be able to escape the making of any answerbut the duke evidently intended to have an answer it appeared to me sir that it did not seem to suit her said the hardlydriven young man he could not now say that mabel had shown a disposition to reject his offer because as they had been sitting by the brookside at killancodlem even he with all his selfdiffidence had been forced to see what were her wishes her confusion and too evident despair when she heard of the offer to the american girl had plainly told her tale he could not now plead to his father that mabel grex would refuse his offer but his selfdefence when first he found that he had lost himself in love for the american had been based on that idea he had done his best to make mabel understand him if he had not actually offered to her he had done the next thing to it and he had run after her till he was ashamed of such running she had given him no encouragementand therefore he had been justified no doubt he must have been mistaken that he now perceived but still he felt himself to be justified it was impossible that he should explain all this to his father one thing he certainly could not sayjust at present after his folly in regard to those heavy debts he could not at once risk his fathers renewed anger by proposing to him an american daughterinlaw that must stand over at any rate till the girl had accepted him positively i am afraid it wont come off sir he said at last  then i am to presume that you have changed your mind  i told you when we were speaking of it that i was not confident  she has not  i cant explain it all sirbut i fear it wont come off  then the duke who had been sitting got up from his chair and with his back to the fire made a final little speech we decided just now silverbridge that nothing more should be said about that unpleasant racing business and nothing more shall be said by me but you must not be surprised if i am anxious to see you settled in life no young man could be more bound by duty to marry early than you are in the first place you have to repair the injury done by my inaptitude for society you have explained to me that it is your duty to have the barsetshire coverts properly shot and i have acceded to your views surely it must be equally your duty to see your barsetshire neighbours and you are a young man every feature of whose character would be improved by matrimony as far as means are concerned you are almost as free to make arrangements as though you were already the head of the family  no sir  i could never bring myself to dictate to a son in regard to his choice of a wife but i will own that when you told me that you had chosen i was much gratified try and think again when you are pausing amidst your sacrifices at gatherum whether that be possible if it be not still i would wish you to bear in mind what is my idea as to your duty silverbridge said that he would bear this in mind and then escaped from the room     chapter xlvi  lady marys dream   when the duke and his daughter reached custins they found a large party assembled and were somewhat surprised at the crowd lord and lady nidderdale were there which might have been expected as they were part of the family with lord popplecourt had come his recent friend adolphus longstaff that too might have been natural mr and miss boncassen were there also who at this moment were quite strangers to the duke and mr lupton the duke also found lady chiltern whose fatherinlaw had more than once sat in the same cabinet with himself and mr monk who was generally spoken of as the head of the coming liberal government and the ladies adelaide and flora fitzhoward the still unmarried but not very juvenile daughters of the duke of st bungay these with a few others made a large party and rather confused the duke who had hardly reflected that discreet and profitable lovemaking was more likely to go on among numbers than if the two young people were thrown together with no other companions  lord popplecourt had been made to understand what was expected of him and after some hesitation had submitted himself to the conspiracy there would not be less at any rate than two hundred thousand poundsand the connexion would be made with one of the highest families in great britain though lady cantrip had said very few words those words had been expressive and the young bachelor peer had given in his adhesion some vague halfdefined tale had been told himnot about tregear as tregears name had not been mentionedbut respecting some dream of a young man who had flitted across the girls path during her mothers lifetime all girls have such dreams lady cantrip had suggested whereupon lord popplecourt said that he supposed it was so but a softer purer more unsullied flower never waited on its stalk till the proper fingers should come to pluck it said lady cantrip rising to unaccustomed poetry on behalf of her friend the duke lord popplecourt accepted the poetry and was ready to do his best to pluck the flower  soon after the dukes arrival lord popplecourt found himself in one of the drawingrooms with lady cantrip and his proposed fatherinlaw a hint had been given him that he might as well be home early from shooting so as to be in the way as the hour in which he was to make himself specially agreeable both to the father and to the daughter had drawn nigh he became somewhat nervous and now at this moment was not altogether comfortable though he had been concerned in no such matter before he had an idea that love was a soft kind of thing which ought to steal on one unawares and come and go without trouble in his case it came upon him with a rough demand for immediate hard work he had not previously thought that he was to be subjected to such labours and at this moment almost resented the interference with his ease he was already a little angry with lady cantrip but at the same time felt himself to be so much in subjection to her that he could not rebel  the duke himself when he saw the young man was hardly more comfortable he had brought his daughter to custins feeling that it was his duty to be with her but he would have preferred to leave the whole operation to the care of lady cantrip he hardly liked to look at the fish whom he wished to catch for his daughter whenever this aspect of affairs presented itself to him he would endeavour to console himself by remembering the past success of a similar transaction he thought of his own first interview with his wife you have heard he had said what our friends wish she had pouted her lips and when gently pressed had at last muttered with her shoulder turned to him that she supposed it was to be so very much more coercion had been used to her then than either himself or lady cantrip had dared to apply to his daughter he did not think that his girl in her present condition of mind would signify to lord popplecourt that she supposed it was to be so now that the time for the transaction was present he felt almost sure it would never be transacted but still he must go on with it were he now to abandon his scheme would it not be tantamount to abandoning everything so he wreathed his face in smilesor made some attempt at itas he greeted the young man  i hope you and lady mary had a pleasant journey abroad said lord popplecourt lord popplecourt being aware that he had been chosen as a soninlaw felt himself called upon to be familiar as well as pleasant i often thought of you and lady mary and wondered what you were about  we were visiting lakes and mountains churches and picture galleries cities and saltmines said the duke  does lady mary like that sort of thing  i think she was pleased with what she saw  she has been abroad a great deal before i believe it depends so much on whom you meet when abroad  this was unfortunate because it recalled tregear to the dukes mind we saw very few people whom we knew he said  ive been shooting in scotland with silverbridge and gerald and reginald dobbes and nidderdaleand that fellow tregear who is so thick with silverbridge  indeed  im told that lord gerald is going to be the great shot of his day said lady cantrip  it is a distinction said the duke bitterly  he did not beat me by so much continued popplecourt i think tregear did the best with his rifle one morning he potted three dobbes was disgusted he hated tregear  isnt it stupidhalfadozen men getting together in that way asked lady cantrip  nidderdale is always jolly  i am glad to hear that said the motherinlaw  and gerald is a regular brick the duke bowed silverbridge used always to be going off to killancodlem where there were a lot of ladies he is very sweet you know on this american girl whom you have here again the duke winced dobbes is awfully good as to making out the shooting but then he is a tyrant nevertheless i agree with him if you mean to do a thing you should do it  certainly said the duke but you should make up your mind first whether the thing is worth doing  just so said popplecourt and as grouse and deer together are about the best things out most of us made up our minds that it was worth doing but that fellow tregear would argue it out he said a gentleman oughtnt to play billiards as well as a marker  i think he was right said the duke  do you know mr tregear duke  i have met himwith my son  do you like him  i have seen very little of him  i cannot say i do he thinks so much of himself of course he is very intimate with silverbridge and that is all that any one knows of him the duke bowed almost haughtily though why he bowed he could hardly have explained to himself lady cantrip bit her lips in disgust hes just the fellow continued popplecourt to think that some princess has fallen in love with him then the duke left the room  you had better not talk to him about mr tregear said lady cantrip  why not  i dont know whether he approves of the intimacy between him and lord silverbridge  i should think nota man without any position or a shilling in the world  the duke is peculiar if a subject is distasteful to him he does not like it to be mentioned you had better not mention mr tregear lady cantrip as she said this blushed inwardly at her own hypocrisy  it was of course contrived at dinner that lord popplecourt should take out lady mary it is impossible to discover how such things get wind but there was already an idea prevalent at custins that lord popplecourt had matrimonial views and that these views were looked upon favourably you may be quite sure of it mr lupton lady adelaide fitzhoward had said ill make a bet theyre married before this time next year  it will be a terrible case of beauty and the beast said lupton  lady chiltern had whispered a suspicion of the same kind and had expressed a hope that the lover would be worthy of the girl and dolly longstaff had chaffed his friend popplecourt on the subject popplecourt having laid himself open by indiscreet allusions to dollys love for miss boncassen everybody cant have it as easily arranged for him as youa dukes daughter and a pot of money without so much as the trouble of asking for it  what do you know about the dukes children  thats what it is to be a lord and not to have a father popplecourt tried to show that he was disgusted but he felt himself all the more strongly bound to go on with his project  it was therefore a matter of course that these shouldbe lovers would be sent out of the room together youll give your arm to mary lady cantrip said dropping the ceremonial prefix lady mary of course went out as she was bidden though everybody else knew it no idea of what was intended had yet come across her mind  the shouldbe lover immediately reverted to the austrian tour expressing a hope that his neighbour had enjoyed herself theres nothing i like so much myself said he remembering some of the dukes words as mountains cities saltmines and all that kind of thing theres such a lot of interest about it  did you ever see a saltmine  wellnot exactly a saltmine but i have coalmines on my property in staffordshire im very fond of coal i hope you like coal  i like salt a great deal betterto look at  but which do you think pays best i dont mind telling youthough its a kind of thing i never talk about to strangersthe royalties from the blogownie and toodlem mines go up regularly two thousand pounds every year  i thought we were talking about what was pretty to look at  so we were im as fond of pretty things as anybody do you know reginald dobbes  no i dont is he pretty  he used to be so angry with silverbridge because silverbridge would say crummietoddie was ugly  was crummietoddie ugly  just a plain house on a moor  that sounds ugly  i suppose your family like pretty things  i hope so  i do i know lord popplecourt endeavoured to look as though he intended her to understand that she was the pretty thing which he most particularly liked she partly conceived his meaning and was disgusted accordingly on the other side of her sat mr boncassen to whom she had been introduced in the drawingroomand who had said a few words to her about some norwegian poet she turned round to him and asked him some questions about the skald and so getting into conversation with him managed to turn her shoulder to her suitor on the other side of him sat lady rosina de courcy to whom as being an old woman and an old maid he felt very little inclined to be courteous she said a word asking him whether he did not think the weather was treacherous he answered her very curtly and sat bolt upright looking forward on the table and taking his dinner as it came to him he had been put there in order that lady mary palliser might talk to him and he regarded interference on the part of that old american as being ungentlemanlike but the old american disregarded him and went on with his quotations from the scandinavian bard  but mr boncassen sat next to lady cantrip and when at last he was called upon to give his ear to the countess lady mary was again vacant for popplecourts attentions  are you very fond of poetry he asked  very fond  so am i which do you like best tennyson or shakespeare  they are very unlike  yesthey are unlike or moores melodies i am very fond of when in death i shall calm recline i think this equal to anything reginald dobbes would have it that poetry is all bosh  then i think that mr reginald dobbes must be all bosh himself  there was a man there named tregear who had brought some books then there was a pause lady mary had not a word to say dobbes used to declare that he was always pretending to read poetry  mr tregear never pretends anything  do you know him asked the rival  he is my brothers most particular friend  ah yes i dare say silverbridge has talked to you about him i think hes a stuckup sort of fellow to this there was not a word of reply where did your brother pick him up  they were at oxford together  i must say i think he gives himself airsbecause you know hes nobody  i dont know anything of the kind said lady mary becoming very red and as he is my brothers most particular friendhis very friend of friendsi think you had better not abuse him to me  i dont think the duke is very fond of him  i dont care who is fond of him i am very fond of silverbridge and i wont hear his friend illspoken of i dare say he had some books with him he is not at all the sort of a man to go to a place and satisfy himself with doing nothing but killing animals  do you know him lady mary  i have seen him and of course i have heard a great deal of him from silverbridge i would rather not talk any more about him  you seem to be very fond of mr tregear he said angrily  it is no business of yours lord popplecourt whether i am fond of anybody or not i have told you that mr tregear is my brothers friend and that ought to be enough  lord popplecourt was a young man possessed of a certain amount of ingenuity it was said of him that he knew on which side his bread was buttered and that if you wished to take him in you must get up early after dinner and during the night he pondered a good deal on what he had heard lady cantrip had told him there had been adream what was he to believe about that dream had he not better avoid the error of putting too fine a point upon it and tell himself at once that a dream in this instance meant alover lady mary had already been troubled by a lover he was disposed to believe that young ladies often do have objectionable lovers and that things get themselves right afterwards young ladies can be made to understand the beauty of coalmines almost as readily as young gentlemen there would be the two hundred thousand pounds and there was the girl beautiful wellborn and thoroughly wellmannered but what if this tregear and the dream were one and the same if so had he not received plenty of evidence that the dream had not yet passed away a remnant of affection for the dream would not have been a fatal barrier had not the girl been so fierce with him in defence of her dream he remembered too what the duke had said about tregear and lady cantrips advice to him to be silent in respect to this man and then do girls generally defend their brothers friends as she had defended tregear he thought not putting all these things together on the following morning he came to an uncomfortable belief that tregear was the dream  soon after that he found himself near to dolly longstaff as they were shooting you know that fellow tregear dont you  oh lord yes he is silverbridges pal  did you ever hear anything about him  what sort of thing  was he everever in love with any one  i fancy he used to be awfully spooney on mab grex i remember hearing that they were to have been married only that neither of them had sixpence  ohlady mabel grex thats a horse of another colour  and which is the horse of your colour  i havent got a horse said lord popplecourt going away to his own corner     chapter xlvii  miss boncassens idea of heaven   it was generally known that dolly longstaff had been heavily smitten by the charms of miss boncassen but the world hardly gave him credit for the earnestness of his affection dolly had never been known to be in earnest in anythingbut now he was in very truth in love he had agreed to be popplecourts companion at custins because he had heard that miss boncassen would be there he had thought over the matter with more consideration than he had ever before given to any subject he had gone so far as to see his own man of business with a view of ascertaining what settlements he could make and what income he might be able to spend he had told himself over and over again that he was not the sort of fellow that ought to marry but it was all of no avail he confessed to himself that he was completely bowled overknocked off his pins  is a fellow to have no chance he said to miss boncassen at custins  if i understand what a fellow means i am afraid not  no man alive was ever more in earnest than i am  well mr longstaff i do not suppose that you have been trying to take me in all this time  i hope you do not think ill of me  i may think well of a great many gentlemen without wishing to marry them  but does love go for nothing said dolly putting his hand upon his heart perhaps there are so many that love you  not above halfadozen or so  you can make a joke of it when i but i dont think miss boncassen you at all realise what i feel as to settlements and all that your father could do what he likes with me  my father has nothing to do with it and i dont know what settlements mean we never think anything of settlements in our country if two young people love each other they go and get married  let us do the same here  but the two young people dont love each other look here mr longstaff its my opinion that a young woman ought not to be pestered  pestered  you force me to speak in that way ive given you an answer ever so many times i will not be made to do it over and over again  its that d fellow silverbridge he exclaimed almost angrily on hearing this miss boncassen left the room without speaking another word and dolly longstaff found himself alone he saw what he had done as soon as she was gone after that he could hardly venture to persevere againhere at custins he weighed it over in his mind for a long time almost coming to a resolution in favour of hard drink he had never felt anything like this before he was so uncomfortable that he couldnt eat his luncheon though in accordance with his usual habit he had breakfasted off sodaandbrandy and a morsel of devilled toast he did not know himself in his changed character i wonder whether she understands that i have four thousand pounds a year of my own and shall have twelve thousand pounds more when my governor goes she was so headstrong that it was impossible to explain anything to her  im off to london he said to popplecourt that afternoon  nonsense you said youd stay for ten days  all the same im going at once ive sent to bridport for a trap and i shall sleep tonight at dorchester  whats the meaning of it all  ive had some words with somebody dont mind asking any more  not with the duke  the duke no i havent spoken to him  or lord cantrip  i wish you wouldnt ask questions  if youve quarrelled with anybody you ought to consult a friend  its nothing of that kind  then its a lady its the american girl  dont i tell you i dont want to talk about it im going ive told lady cantrip that my mother wasnt well and wants to see me youll stop your time out i suppose  i dont know  youve got it all square no doubt i wish id a handle to my name i never cared for it before  im sorry youre so down in the mouth why dont you try again the thing is to stick to em like wax if ten times of asking wont do go in twenty times  dolly shook his head despondently what can you do when a girl walks out of the room and slams the door in your face shell get it hot and heavy before she has done i know what shes after she might as well cry for the moon and so dolly got into the trap and went to bridport and slept that night at the hotel at dorchester  lord popplecourt though he could give such excellent advice to his friend had been able as yet to do very little in his own case he had been a week at custins and had said not a word to denote his passion day after day he had prepared himself for the encounter but the lady had never given him the opportunity when he sat next to her at dinner she would be very silent if he stayed at home on a morning she was not visible during the short evenings he could never get her attention and he made no progress with the duke the duke had been very courteous to him at richmond but here he was monosyllabic and almost sullen  once or twice lord popplecourt had a little conversation with lady cantrip dear girl said her ladyship she is so little given to seeking admiration  i dare say  girls are so different lord popplecourt with some of them it seems that a gentleman need have no trouble in explaining what it is that he wishes  i dont think lady mary is like that at all  not in the least any one who addresses her must be prepared to explain himself fully nor ought he to hope to get much encouragement at first i do not think that lady mary will bestow her heart till she is sure she can give it with safety there was an amount of falsehood in this which was proof at any rate of very strong friendship on the part of lady cantrip  after a few days lady mary became more intimate with the american and his daughter than with any others of the party perhaps she liked to talk about the scandinavian poets of whom mr boncassen was so fond perhaps she felt sure that her transatlantic friend would not make love to her perhaps it was that she yielded to the various allurements of miss boncassen miss boncassen saw the duke of omnium for the first time at custins and there had the first opportunity of asking herself how such a man as that would receive from his son and heir such an announcement as lord silverbridge would have to make him should she at the end of three months accept his offer she was quite aware that lord silverbridge need not repeat the offer unless he were so pleased but she thought that he would come again he had so spoken that she was sure of his love and had so spoken as to obtain hers yesshe was sure that she loved him she had never seen anything like him beforeso glorious in his beauty so gentle in his manhood so powerful and yet so little imperious so great in condition and yet so little confident in his own greatness so bolstered up with external advantages and so little apt to trust anything but his own heart and his own voice in asking for her love he had put forward no claim but his own love she was glad he was what he was she counted at their full value all his natural advantages to be an english duchess ohyes her ambition understood it all but she loved him because in the expression of his love no hint had fallen from him of the greatness of the benefits which he could confer upon her yes she would like to be a duchess but not to be a duchess would she become the wife of a man who should begin his courtship by assuming a superiority  now the chances of society had brought her into the company of his nearest friends she was in the house with his father and with his sister now and again the duke spoke a few words to her and always did so with a peculiar courtesy but she was sure that the duke had heard nothing of his sons courtship and she was equally sure that the matter had not reached lady marys ears she perceived that the duke and her father would often converse together mr boncassen would discuss republicanism generally and the duke would explain that theory of monarchy as it prevails in england which but very few americans have ever been made to understand all this miss boncassen watched with pleasure she was still of opinion that it would not become her to force her way into a family which would endeavour to repudiate her she would not become this young mans wife if all connected with the young man were resolved to reject the contact but if she could conquer themthenthen she thought that she could put her little hand into that young mans grasp with a happy heart  it was in this frame of mind that she laid herself out not unsuccessfully to win the esteem of lady mary palliser i do not know whether you approve it lady cantrip said to the duke but mary has become very intimate with our new american friend at this time lady cantrip had become very nervousso as almost to wish that lady marys difficulties might be unravelled elsewhere than at custins  they seem to be sensible people said the duke i dont know when i have met a man with higher ideas on politics than mr boncassen  his daughter is popular with everybody  a nice ladylike girl said the duke and appears to have been well educated  it was now near the end of october and the weather was peculiarly fine perhaps in our climate october would of all months be the most delightful if something of its charms were not detracted from by the feeling that with it will depart the last relics of the delights of summer the leaves are still there with their gorgeous colouring but they are going the last rose still lingers on the bush but it is the last the woodland walks are still pleasant to the feet but caution is heard on every side as to the coming winter  the park at custins which was spacious had many woodland walks attached to it from which through vistas of the timber distant glimpses of the sea were caught within half a mile of the house the woods were reached and within a mile the open sea was in sightand yet the wanderers might walk for miles without going over the same ground here without other companions lady mary and miss boncassen found themselves one afternoon and here the latter told her story to her lovers sister i so long to tell you something she said  is it a secret asked lady mary  well yes it isif you will keep it so i would rather you should keep it a secret but i will tell you then she stood still looking into the others face i wonder how you will take it  what can it be  your brother has asked me to be his wife  silverbridge  yeslord silverbridge you are astonished  lady mary was very much astonishedso much astonished that words escaped from her which she regretted afterwards i thought there was someone else  who else  lady mabel grex but i know nothing  i think not said miss boncassen slowly i have seen them together and i think not there might be somebody though i think not her but why do i say that why do i malign him and make so little of myself there is no one else lady mary is he not true  i think he is true  i am sure he is true and he has asked me to be his wife  what did you say  wellwhat do you think what is it probable that such a girl as i would say when such a man as your brother asks her to be his wife is he not such a man as a girl would love  oh yes  is he not handsome as a god mary stared at her with all her eyes and sweeter than any god those pagan races knew and is he not goodtempered and loving and has he not that perfection of manly dash without which i do not think i could give my heart to any man  then you have accepted him  and his rank and his wealth the highest position in all the world in my eyes  i do not think you should take him for that  does it not all help can you put yourself in my place why should i refuse him no not for that i would not take him for that but if i love himbecause he is all that my imagination tells me that a man ought to beif to be his wife seems to me to be the greatest bliss that could happen to a woman if i feel that i could die to serve him that i could live to worship him that his touch would be sweet to me his voice music his strength the only support in the world on which i would care to leanwhat then  is it so  yes it is so it is after that fashion that i love him he is my heroand not the less so because there is none higher than he among the nobles of the greatest land under the sun would you have me for a sister lady mary could not answer all at once she had to think of her fatherand then she thought of her own lover why should not silverbridge be as well entitled to his choice as she considered herself to be and yet how would it be with her father silverbridge would in process of time be the head of the family would it be proper that he should marry an american  you would not like me for a sister  i was thinking of my father for myself i like you  shall i tell you what i said to him  if you will  i told him that he must ask his friendsthat i would not be his wife to be rejected by them all nor will i though it be heaven i will not creep there through a hole if i cannot go in with my head upright i will not go even there then she turned round as though she were prepared in her emotion to walk back to the house alone but lady mary ran after her and having caught her put her arm round her waist and kissed her  i at any rate will love you said lady mary  i will do as i have said continued miss boncassen i will do as i have said though i love your brother down to the ground he shall not marry me without his fathers consent then they returned arminarm close together but very little more was said between them  when lady mary entered the house she was told that lady cantrip wished to see her in her own room     chapter xlviii  the party at custins is broken up   the message was given to lady mary after so solemn a fashion that she was sure some important communication was to be made to her her mind at that moment had been filled with her new friends story she felt that she required some time to meditate before she could determine what she herself would wish but when she was going to her own room in order that she might think it over she was summoned to lady cantrip my dear said the countess i wish you to do something to oblige me  of course i will  lord popplecourt wants to speak to you  who  lord popplecourt  what can lord popplecourt have to say to me  can you not guess lord popplecourt is a young nobleman standing very high in the world possessed of ample means just in that position in which it behoves such a man to look about for a wife lady mary pressed her lips together and clenched her two hands can you not imagine what such a gentleman may have to say then there was a pause but she made no immediate answer i am to tell you my dear that your father would approve of it  approve of what  he approves of lord popplecourt as a suitor for your hand  how can he  why not mary of course he has made it his business to ascertain all particulars as to lord popplecourts character and property  papa knows that i love somebody else  my dear mary that is all vanity  i dont think that papa can want to see me married to a man when he knows that with all my heart and soul  oh mary  when he knows continued mary who would not be put down that i love another man with all my heart what will lord popplecourt say if i tell him that if he says anything to me i shall tell him lord popplecourt he cares for nothing but his coalmines of course if you bid me see him i will but it can do no good i despise him and if he troubles me i shall hate him as for marrying himi would sooner die this minute  after this lady cantrip did not insist on the interview she expressed her regret that things should be as they wereexplained in sweetly innocent phrases that in a certain rank of life young ladies could not always marry the gentlemen to whom their fancies might attach them but must not unfrequently postpone their youthful inclinations to the will of their eldersor in less delicate language that though they might love in one direction they must marry in another and then expressed a hope that her dear mary would think over these things and try to please her father why does he not try to please me said mary then lady cantrip was obliged to see lord popplecourt a necessity which was a great nuisance to her yesshe understands what you mean but she is not prepared for it yet you must wait awhile  i dont see why i am to wait  she is very youngand so are you indeed there is plenty of time  there is somebody else i suppose  i told you said lady cantrip in her softest voice that there has been a dream across her path  its that tregear  i am not prepared to mention names said lady cantrip astonished that he should know so much but indeed you must wait  i dont see it lady cantrip  what can i say more if you think that such a girl as lady mary palliser the daughter of the duke of omnium possessed of fortune beauty and every good gift is to come like a bird to your call you will find yourself mistaken all that her friends can do for you will be done the rest must remain with yourself during that evening lord popplecourt endeavoured to make himself pleasant to one of the fitzhoward young ladies and on the next morning he took his leave of custins  i will never interfere again in reference to anybody elses child as long as i live lady cantrip said to her husband that night  lady mary was very much tempted to open her heart to miss boncassen it would be delightful to her to have a friend but were she to engage miss boncassens sympathies on her behalf she must of course sympathise with miss boncassen in return and what if after all silverbridge were not devoted to the american beauty what if it should turn out that he was going to marry lady mabel grex i wish you would call me isabel her friend said to her it is so oddsince i have left new york i have never heard my name from any lips except fathers and mothers  has not silverbridge ever called you by your christian name  i think not i am sure he never has but he had though it had passed by her at the moment without attention it all came from him so suddenly and yet i expected it but it was too sudden for christian names and pretty talk i do not even know what his name is  plantagenetbut we always call him silverbridge  plantagenet is very much prettier i shall always call him plantagenet but i recall that you will not remember that against me  i will remember nothing that you do not wish  i mean that ifif all the grandeurs of all the pallisers could consent to put up with poor me if heaven were opened to me with a straight gate so that i could walk out of our republic into your aristocracy with my head erect with the stars and stripes waving proudly round me till i had been accepted into the shelter of the omnium griffinsthen i would call him  theres one palliser would welcome you  would you dear then i will love you so dearly may i call you mary  of course you may  mary is the prettiest name under the sun but plantagenet is so grand which of the kings did you branch off from  i know nothing about it from none of them i should think there is some story about a sir guy who was a kings friend i never trouble myself about it i hate aristocracy  do you dear  yes said mary full of her own grievances it is an abominable bondage and i do not see that it does any good at all  i think it is so glorious said the american there is no such mischievous nonsense in all the world as equality that is what father says what men ought to want is liberty  it is terrible to be tied up in a small circle said the dukes daughter  what do you mean lady mary  i thought you were to call me mary what i mean is this suppose that silverbridge loves you better than all the world  i hope he does i think he does  and suppose he cannot marry you because of hisaristocracy  but he can  i thought you were saying yourself  saying what that he could not marry me no indeed but that under certain circumstances i would not marry him you dont suppose that i think he would be disgraced if so i would go away at once and he should never again see my face or hear my voice i think myself good enough for the best man god ever made but if others think differently and those others are so closely concerned with him and would be so closely concerned with me as to trouble our joint livesthen will i neither subject him to such sorrow nor will i encounter it myself  it all comes from what you call aristocracy  no dearbut from the prejudices of an aristocracy to tell the truth mary the more difficult a place is to get into the more the right of going in is valued if everybody could be a duchess and a palliser i should not perhaps think so much about it  i thought it was because you loved him  so i do i love him entirely i have said not a word of that to himbut i do if i know at all what love is but if you love a star the pride you have in your star will enhance your love though you know that you must die of your love still you must love your star  and yet mary could not tell her tale in return she could not show the reverse picturethat she being a star was anxious to dispose of herself after the fashion of poor human rushlights it was not that she was ashamed of her love but that she could not bring herself to yield altogether in reference to the great descent which silverbridge would have to make  on the day after thisthe last day of the dukes sojourn at custins the last also of the boncassens visitit came to pass that the duke and mr boncassen with lady mary and isabel were all walking in the woods together and it so happened when they were at a little distance from the house each of the girls was walking with the other girls father isabel had calculated what she would say to the duke should a time for speaking come to her she could not tell him of his sons love she could not ask his permission she could not explain to him all her feelings or tell him what she thought of her proper way of getting into heaven that must come afterwards if it should ever come at all but there was something that she could tell we are so different from you she said speaking of her own country  and yet so like said the duke smilingyour language your laws your habits  but still there is such a difference i do not think there is a man in the whole union more respected than father  i dare say not  many people think that if he would only allow himself to be put in nomination he might be the next president  the choice i am sure would do your country honour  and yet his father was a poor labourer who earned his bread among the shipping at new york that kind of thing would be impossible here  my dear young lady there you wrong us  do i  certainly a prime minister with us might as easily come from the same class  here you think so much of rank you area duke  but a prime minister can make a duke and if a man can raise himself by his own intellect to that position no one will think of his father or his grandfather the sons of merchants have with us been prime ministers more than once and no englishmen ever were more honoured among their countrymen our peerage is being continually recruited from the ranks of the people and hence it gets its strength  is it so  there is no greater mistake than to suppose that inferiority of birth is a barrier to success in this country  she listened to this and to much more on the same subject with attentive earsnot shaken in her ideas as to the english aristocracy in general but thinking that she was perhaps learning something of his own individual opinions if he were more liberal than others on that liberality might perhaps be based her own happiness and fortune  he in all this was quite unconscious of the working of her mind nor in discussing such matters generally did he ever mingle his own private feelings his own pride of race and name his own ideas of what was due to his ancient rank with the political creed by which his conduct in public life was governed the peer who sat next to him in the house of lords whose grandmother had been a washerwoman and whose father an innkeeper was to him every whit as good a peer as himself and he would as soon sit in counsel with mr monk whose father had risen from a mechanic to be a merchant as with any nobleman who could count ancestors against himself but there was an inner feeling in his bosom as to his own family his own name his own children and his own personal self which was kept altogether apart from his grand political theories it was a subject on which he never spoke but the feeling had come to him as a part of his birthright and he conceived that it would pass through him to his children after the same fashion it was this which made the idea of a marriage between his daughter and tregear intolerable to him and which would operate as strongly in regard to any marriage which his son might contemplate lord grex was not a man with whom he would wish to form any intimacy he was we may say a wretched unprincipled old man bad all round and such the duke knew him to be but the blue blood and the rank were there and as the girl was good herself he would have been quite contented that his son should marry the daughter of lord grex that one and the same man should have been in one part of himself so unlike the other partthat he should have one set of opinions so contrary to another setpoor isabel boncassen did not understand     chapter xlix  the majors fate   the affair of prime minister and the nail was not allowed to fade away into obscurity through september and october it was made matter for pungent inquiry the jockey club was alive mr pook was very instantwith many pookites anxious to free themselves from suspicion sporting men declared that the honour of the turf required that every detail of the case should be laid open but by the end of october though every detail had been surmised nothing had in truth been discovered nobody doubted but that tifto had driven the nail into the horses foot and that green and gilbert villiers had shared the bulk of the plunder they had gone off on their travels together and the fact that each of them had been in possession of about twenty thousand pounds was proved but then there is no law against two gentlemen having such a sum of money it was notorious that captain green and mr gilbert villiers had enriched themselves to this extent by the failure of prime minister but yet nothing was proved  that the major had either himself driven in the nail or seen it done all racing men were agreed he had been out with the horse in the morning and had been the first to declare that the animal was lame and he had been with the horse till the farrier had come but he had concocted a story for himself he did not dispute that the horse had been lamed by the machinations of green and villierswith the assistance of the groom no doubt he said these men who had been afraid to face an inquiry had contrived and had carried out the iniquity how the lameness had been caused he could not pretend to say the groom who was at the horses head and who evidently knew how these things were done might have struck a nerve in the horses foot with his boot but when the horse was got into the stable he tiftoso he declaredat once ran out to send for the farrier during the minutes so occupied the operation must have been made with the nail that was tiftos storyand as he kept his ground there were some few who believed it  but though the story was so far good he had at moments been imprudent and had talked when he should have been silent the whole matter had been a torment to him in the first place his conscience made him miserable as long as it had been possible to prevent the evil he had hoped to make a clean breast of it to lord silverbridge up to this period of his life everything had been square with him he had betted square and had ridden square and had run horses square he had taken a pride in this as though it had been a great virtue it was not without great inward grief that he had deprived himself of the consolations of these reflections but when he had approached his noble partner his noble partner snubbed him at every turnand he did the deed  his reward was to be three thousand poundsand he got his money the money was very much to himwould perhaps have been almost enough to comfort him in his misery had not those other rascals got so much more when he heard that the grooms fee was higher than his own it almost broke his heart green and villiers men of infinitely lower standingmen at whom the beargarden would not have lookedhad absolutely netted fortunes on which they could live in comfort no doubt they had run away while tifto still stood his groundbut he soon began to doubt whether to have run away with twenty thousand pounds was not better than to remain with such small plunder as had fallen to his lot among such faces as those which now looked upon him then when he had drunk a few glasses of whiskyandwater he said something very foolish as to his power of punishing that swindler green  an attempt had been made to induce silverbridge to delay the payment of his betsbut he had been very eager that they should be paid under the joint auspices of mr lupton and mr moreton the horses were sold and the establishment was annihilatedwith considerable loss but with great despatch the duke had been urgent the jockey club and the racing world and the horsey fraternity generally might do what seemed to them goodso that silverbridge was extricated from the matter silverbridge was extricatedand the duke cared nothing for the rest  but silverbridge could not get out of the mess quite so easily as his father wished two questions arose about major tifto outside the racing world but within the domain of the world of sport and pleasure generally as to one of which it was impossible that silverbridge should not express an opinion the first question had reference to the mastership of the runnymede hounds in this our young friend was not bound to concern himself the other affected the beargarden club and as lord silverbridge had introduced the major he could hardly forbear from the expression of an opinion  there was a meeting of the subscribers to the hunt in the last week of october at that meeting major tifto told his story there he was to answer any charge which might be brought against him if he had made money by losing the racewhere was it and whence had it come was it not clear that a conspiracy might have been made without his knowledgeand clear also that the real conspirators had levanted he had not levanted the hounds were his own he had undertaken to hunt the country for this season and they had undertaken to pay him a certain sum of money he should expect and demand that sum of money if they chose to make any other arrangement for the year following they could do so then he sat down and the meeting was adjournedthe secretary having declared that he would not act in that capacity any longer nor collect the funds a farmer had also asserted that he and his friends had resolved that major tifto should not ride over their fields on the next day the major had his hounds out and some of the london men with a few of the neighbours joined him gates were locked but the hounds ran and those who chose to ride managed to follow them there are men who will stick to their sport though apollyon himself should carry the horn who cares whether the lady who fills a theatre be or be not a moral young woman or whether the bandmaster who keeps such excellent time in a ball has or has not paid his debts there were men of this sort who supported major tiftobut then there was a general opinion that the runnymede hunt would come to an end unless a new master could be found  then in the first week in november a special meeting was called at the beargarden at which lord silverbridge was asked to attend it is impossible that he should be allowed to remain in the club this was said to lord silverbridge by mr lupton either he must go or the club must be broken up  silverbridge was very unhappy on the occasion he had at last been reasoned into believing that the horse had been made the victim of foul play but he persisted in saying that there was no conclusive evidence against tifto the matter was argued with him tifto had laid bets against the horse tifto had been handandglove with green tifto could not have been absent from the horse above two minutes the thing could not have been arranged without tifto as he had brought tifto into the club and had been his partner on the turf it was his business to look into the matter but for all that said he im not going to jump on a man when hes down unless i feel sure that hes guilty  then the meeting was held and tifto himself appeared when the accusation was made by mr lupton who proposed that he should be expelled he burst into tears the whole story was repeatedthe nail and the hammer and the lameness and the moments were counted up and poor tiftos bets and friendship with green were made apparentand the case was submitted to the club an old gentleman who had been connected with the turf all his life and who would not have scrupled by square betting to rob his dearest friend of his last shilling seconded the propositiontelling all the story over again then major tifto was asked whether he wished to say anything  ive got to say that im here said tifto still crying and if id done anything of that kind of course id have gone with the rest of em i put it to lord silverbridge to say whether im that sort of fellow then he sat down  upon this there was a pause and the club was manifestly of opinion that lord silverbridge ought to say something i think that major tifto should not have betted against the horse said silverbridge  i can explain that said the major let me explain that everybody knows that im a man of small means i wanted to edge i only wanted to edge  mr lupton shook his head why have you not shown me your book  i told you before that it was stolen green got hold of it i did win a little i never said i didnt but what has that to do with hammering a nail into a horses foot i have always been true to you lord silverbridge and you ought to stick up for me now  i will have nothing further to do with the matter said silverbridge one way or the other and he walked out of the roomand out of the club the affair was ended by a magnanimous declaration on the part of major tifto that he would not remain in a club in which he was suspected and by a consent on the part of the meeting to receive the majors instant resignation     chapter l  the dukes arguments   the duke before he left custins had an interview with lady cantrip at which that lady found herself called upon to speak her mind freely i dont think she cares about lord popplecourt lady cantrip said  i am sure i dont know why she should said the duke who was often very aggravating even to his friend  but as we had thought  she ought to do as she is told said the duke remembering how obedient his glencora had been has he spoken to her  i think not  then how can we tell  i asked her to see him but she expressed so much dislike that i could not press it i am afraid duke that you will find it difficult to deal with her  i have found it very difficult  as you have trusted me so much  yesi have trusted you and do trust you i hope you understand that i appreciate your kindness  perhaps then you will let me say what i think  certainly lady cantrip  mary is a very peculiar girlwith great giftsbut  but what  she is obstinate perhaps it would be fairer to say that she has great firmness of character it is within your power to separate her from mr tregear it would be foreign to her character totoleave you except with your approbation  you mean she will not run away  she will do nothing without your permission but she will remain unmarried unless she be allowed to marry mr tregear  what do you advise then  that you should yield as regards money you could give them what they want let him go into public life you could manage that for him  he is conservative  what does that matter when the question is one of your daughters happiness everybody tells me that he is clever and well conducted  he betrayed nothing by his face as this was said to him but as he got into the carriage he was a miserable man it is very well to tell a man that he should yield but there is nothing so wretched to a man as yielding young people and women have to yieldbut for such a man as this to yield is in itself a misery in this matter the duke was quite certain of the propriety of his judgment to yield would be not only to mortify himself but to do wrong at the same time he had convinced himself that the popplecourt arrangement would come to nothing nor had he and lady cantrip combined been able to exercise over her the sort of power to which lady glencora had been subjected if he perseveredand he still was sure almost sure that he would perseverehis object must be achieved after a different fashion there must be infinite sufferingsuffering both to him and to her could she have been made to consent to marry someone else terrible as the rupture might have been she would have reconciled herself at last to her new life so it had been with his glencora after a time now the misery must go on from day to day beneath his eyes with the knowledge on his part that he was crushing all joy out of her young life and the conviction on her part that she was being treated with continued cruelty by her father it was a terrible prospect but if it was manifestly his duty to act after this fashion must he not do his duty  if he were to find that by persevering in this course he would doom her to death or perchance to madnesswhat then if it were right he must still do it he must still do it if the weakness incident to his human nature did not rob him of the necessary firmness if every foolish girl were indulged all restraint would be lost and there would be an end to those rules as to birth and position by which he thought his world was kept straight and then mixed with all this was his feeling of the young mans arrogance in looking for such a match here was a man without a shilling whose manifest duty it was to go to work so that he might earn his bread who instead of doing so had hoped to raise himself to wealth and position by entrapping the heart of an unwary girl there was something to the dukes thinking base in this and much more base because the unwary girl was his own daughter that such a man as tregear should make an attack upon him and select his rank his wealth and his child as the steppingstones by which he intended to rise what could be so mean as that a man should seek to live by looking out for a wife with money but what so impudent so arrogant so unblushingly disregardful of propriety as that he should endeavour to select his victim from such a family as that of the pallisers and that he should lay his impious hand on the very daughter of the duke of omnium  but together with all this there came upon him moments of ineffable tenderness he felt as though he longed to take her in his arms and tell her that if she were unhappy so would he be unhappy tooto make her understand that a hard necessity had made this sorrow common to them both he thought that if she would only allow it he could speak of her love as a calamity which had befallen them as from the hand of fate and not as a fault if he could make a partnership in misery with her so that each might believe that each was acting for the best then he could endure all that might come but as he was well aware she regarded him as being simply cruel to her she did not understand that he was performing an imperative duty she had set her heart upon a certain object and having taught herself that in that way happiness might be reached had no conception that there should be something in the world some idea of personal dignity more valuable to her than the fruition of her own desires and yet every word he spoke to her was affectionate he knew that she was bruised and if it might be possible he would pour oil into her woundseven though she would not recognise the hand which relieved her  they slept one night in townwhere they encountered silverbridge soon after his retreat from the beargarden i cannot quite make up my mind sir about that fellow tifto he said to his father  i hope you have made up your mind that he is no fit companion for yourself  thats over everybody understands that sir  is anything more necessary  i dont like feeling that he has been illused they have made him resign the club and i fancy they wont have him at the hunt  he has lost no money by you  oh no  then i think you may be indifferent from all that i hear i think he must have won moneywhich will probably be a consolation to him  i think they have been hard upon him continued silverbridge of course he is not a good man nor a gentleman nor possessed of very high feelings but a man is not to be sacrificed altogether for that there are so many men who are not gentlemen and so many gentlemen who are bad fellows  i have no doubt mr lupton knew what he was about replied the duke  on the next morning the duke and lady mary went down to matching and as they sat together in the carriage after leaving the railway the father endeavoured to make himself pleasant to his daughter i suppose we shall stay at matching now till christmas he said  i hope so  whom would you like to have here  i dont want any one papa  you will be very sad without somebody would you like the finns  if you please papa i like her he never talks anything but politics  he is none the worse for that mary i wonder whether lady mabel grex would come  lady mabel grex  do you not like her  oh yes i like herbut what made you think of her papa  perhaps silverbridge would come to us then  lady mary thought that she knew a great deal more about that than her father did is he fond of lady mabel papa  welli dont know there are secrets which should not be told i think they are very good friends i would not have her asked unless it would please you  i like her very much papa  and perhaps we might get the boncassens to come to us i did say a word to him about it now as mary felt difficulty was heaping itself upon difficulty i have seldom met a man in whose company i could take more pleasure than in that of mr boncassen and the young lady seems to be worthy of her father mary was silent feeling the complication of the difficulties do you not like her asked the duke  very much indeed said mary  then let us fix a day and ask them if you will come to me after dinner with an almanac we will arrange it of course you will invite that miss cassewary too  the complication seemed to be very bad indeed in the first place was it not clear that she lady mary ought not to be a party to asking miss boncassen to meet her brother at matching would it not be imperative on her part to tell her father the whole story and yet how could she do that it had been told her in confidence and she remembered what her own feelings had been when mrs finn had suggested the propriety of telling the story which had been told to her and how would it be possible to ask lady mabel to come to matching to meet miss boncassen in the presence of silverbridge if the party could be made up without silverbridge things might run smoothly  as she was thinking of this in her own room thinking also how happy she could be if one other name might be added to the list of guests the duke had gone alone into his library there a pile of letters reached him among which he found one marked private and addressed in a hand which he did not recognise this he opened suddenlywith a conviction that it would contain a thornand turning over the page found the signature to it was francis tregear the mans name was wormwood to him he at once felt that he would wish to have his dinner his fragment of a dinner brought to him in that solitary room and that he might remain secluded for the rest of the evening but still he must read the letterand he read it      my dear lord duke     if my mode of addressing your grace be too familiar i hope    you will excuse it it seems to me that if i were to use    one more distant i should myself be detracting something    from my right to make the claim which i intend to put    forward you know what my feelings are in reference to    your daughter i do not pretend to suppose that they    should have the least weight with you but you know also    what her feelings are for me a man seems to be vain when    he expresses his conviction of a womans love for himself    but this matter is so important to her as well as to me    that i am compelled to lay aside all pretence if she do    not love me as i love her then the whole thing drops to    the ground then it will be for me to take myself off from    out of your noticeand from hers and to keep to myself    whatever heartbreaking i may have to undergo but if she    be as steadfast in this matter as i amif her happiness    be fixed on marrying me as mine is on marrying herthen    i think i am entitled to ask you whether you are    justified in keeping us apart     i know well what are the discrepancies speaking from my    own feeling i regard very little those of rank i believe    myself to be as good a gentleman as though my fathers    forefathers had sat for centuries past in the house of    lords i believe that you would have thought so also had    you and i been brought in contact on any other subject    the discrepancy in regard to money is i own a great    trouble to me having no wealth of my own i wish that your    daughter were so circumstanced that i could go out into    the world and earn bread for her i know myself so well    that i dare say positively that her moneyif it be that    she will have moneyhad no attractions for me when i    first became acquainted with her and adds nothing now to    the persistency with which i claim her hand     but i venture to ask whether you can dare to keep us apart    if her happiness depends on her love for me it is now    more than six months since i called upon you in london and    explained my wishes you will understand me when i say    that i cannot be contented to sit idle trusting simply to    the assurance which i have of her affection did i doubt    it my way would be more clear i should feel in that case    that she would yield to your wishes and i should then as    i have said before just take myself out of the way but    if it be not so then i am bound to do somethingon her    behalf as well as my own what am i to do any endeavour    to meet her clandestinely is against my instincts    and would certainly be rejected by her a secret    correspondence would be equally distasteful to both of us    whatever i do in this matter i wish you to know that i do    it     yours always    most faithfully and with the greatest respect     francis tregear   he read the letter very carefully and at first was simply astonished by what he considered to be the unparalleled arrogance of the young man in regard to rank this young gentleman thought himself to be as good as anybody else in regard to money he did acknowledge some inferiority but that was a misfortune and could not be helped not only was the letter arrogantbut the fact that he should dare to write any letter on such a subject was proof of most unpardonable arrogance the duke walked about the room thinking of it till he was almost in a passion then he read the letter again and was gradually pervaded by a feeling of its manliness its arrogance remained but with its arrogance there was a certain boldness which induced respect whether i am such a soninlaw as you would like or not it is your duty to accept me if by refusing to do so you will render your daughter miserable that was mr tregears argument he himself might be prepared to argue in answer that it was his duty to reject such a soninlaw even though by rejecting him he might make his daughter miserable he was not shaken but with his condemnation of the young man there was mingled something of respect  he continued to digest the letter before the hour of dinner and when the almanac was brought to him he fixed on certain days the boncassens he knew would be free from engagements in ten days time as to lady mabel he seemed to think it almost certain that she would come i believe she is always going about from one house to another at this time of the year said mary  i think she will come to us if it be possible said the duke and you must write to silverbridge  and what about mr and mrs finn  she promised she would come again you know they are at their own place in surrey they will come unless they have friends with them they have no shooting and nothing brings people together now except shooting i suppose there are things here to be shot and be sure you write to silverbridge     chapter li  the dukes guests   the duke of omnium presents his compliments to mr francis tregear and begs to acknowledge the receipt of mr tregears letter of  the duke has no other communication to make to mr tregear and must beg to decline any further correspondence this was the reply which the duke wrote to the applicant for his daughters hand and he wrote it at once he had acknowledged to himself that tregear had shown a certain manliness in his appeal but not on that account was such a man to have all that he demanded it seemed to the duke that there was no alternative between such a note as that given above and a total surrender  but the post did not go out during the night and the note lay hidden in the dukes private drawer till the morning there was still that locus poenitentiæ which should be accorded to all letters written in anger during the day he thought over it all constantly not in any spirit of yielding not descending a single step from that altitude of conviction which made him feel that it might be his duty absolutely to sacrifice his daughterbut asking himself whether it might not be well that he should explain the whole matter at length to the young man he thought he could put the matter strongly it was not by his own doing that he belonged to an aristocracy which if all exclusiveness were banished from it must cease to exist but being what he was having been born to such privileges and such limitations was he not bound in duty to maintain a certain exclusiveness he would appeal to the young man himself to say whether marriage ought to be free between all classes of the community and if not between all who was to maintain the limits but they to whom authority in such matters is given so much in regard to rank and then he would ask this young man whether he thought it fitting that a young man whose duty according to all known principles it must be to earn his bread should avoid that manifest duty by taking a wife who could maintain him as he roamed about his park alone he felt that he could write such a letter as would make an impression even upon a lover but when he had come back to his study other reflections came to his aid though he might write the most appropriate letter in the world would there not certainly be a reply as to conviction had he ever known an instance of a man who had been convinced by an adversary of course there would be a replyand replies and to such a correspondence there would be no visible end words when once written remain or may remain in testimony for ever so at last when the moment came he sent off those three lines with his uncourteous compliments and his demand that there should be no further correspondence  at dinner he endeavoured to make up for this harshness by increased tenderness to his daughter who was altogether ignorant of the correspondence have you written your letters dear she said she had written them  i hope the people will come  if it will make you comfortable papa  it is for your sake i wish them to be here i think that lady mabel and miss boncassen are just such girls as you would like  i do like them only  only what  miss boncassen is an american  is that an objection according to my ideas it is desirable to become acquainted with persons of various nations i have heard no doubt many stories of the awkward manners displayed by american ladies if you look for them you may probably find american women who are not polished i do not think i shall calumniate my own country if i say the same of english women it should be our object to select for our own acquaintances the best we can find of all countries it seems to me that miss boncassen is a young lady with whom any other young lady might be glad to form an acquaintance  this was a little sermon which mary was quite contented to endure in silence she was in truth fond of the young american beauty and had felt a pleasure in the intimacy which the girl had proposed to her but she thought it inexpedient that miss boncassen lady mabel and silverbridge should be at matching together therefore she made a reply to her fathers sermon which hardly seemed to go to the point at issue she is so beautiful she said  very beautiful said the duke but what has that to do with it my girl need not be jealous of any girls beauty mary laughed and shook her head what is it then  perhaps silverbridge might admire her  i have no doubt he wouldor does for i am aware that they have met but why should he not admire her  i dont know said lady mary sheepishly  i fancy that there is no danger in that direction i think silverbridge understands what is expected from him had not silverbridge plainly shown that he understood what was expected from him when he selected lady mabel nothing could have been more proper and the duke had been altogether satisfied that in such a matter there should have been a change in so short a time did not occur to him poor mary was now completely silenced she had been told that silverbridge understood what was expected from him and of course could not fail to carry home to herself an accusation that she failed to understand what was expected from her  she had written her letters but had not as yet sent them those to mrs finn and to the two young ladies had been easy enough could mr and mrs finn come to matching on the 20th of november papa says that you promised to return and thinks this time will perhaps suit you and then to lady mabel do come if you can and papa particularly says that he hopes miss cassewary will come also to miss boncassen she had written a long letter but that too had been written very easily i write to you instead of your mamma because i know you you must tell her that and then she will not be angry i am only papas messenger and i am to say how much he hopes that you will come on the 20th mr boncassen is to bring the whole british museum if he wishes then there was a little postscript which showed that there was already considerable intimacy between the two young ladies we wont have either mr l or lord p not a word was said about lord silverbridge there was not even an initial to indicate his name  but the letter to her brother was more difficult in her epistles to those others she had so framed her words as if possible to bring them to matching but in writing to her brother she was anxious so to write as to deter him from coming she was bound to obey her fathers commands he had desired that silverbridge should be asked to comeand he was asked to come but she craftily endeavoured so to word the invitation that he should be induced to remain away it is all papas doing she said and i am glad that he should like to have people here i have asked the finns with whom papa seems to have made up everything mr warburton will be here of course and i think mr moreton is coming he seems to think that a certain amount of shooting ought to be done then i have invited lady mabel grex and miss cassewaryall of papas choosing and the boncassens now you will know whether the set will suit you papa has particularly begged that you will comeapparently because of lady mabel i dont at all know what that means perhaps you do as i like lady mabel i hope she will come surely silverbridge would not run himself into the jaws of the lion when he heard that he was specially expected by his father to come to matching in order that he might make himself agreeable to one young lady he would hardly venture to come seeing that he would be bound to make love to another young lady  to marys great horror all the invitations were accepted mr and mrs finn were quite at the dukes disposal that she had expected the boncassens would all come this was signified in a note from isabel which covered four sides of the paper and was full of fun but under her signature had been written a few wordsnot in funwords which lady mary perfectly understood i wonder i wonder i wonder did the duke when inviting her know anything of his sons inclinations would he be made to know them now during this visit and what would he say when he did know them  that the boncassens would come was a matter of course but mary had thought that lady mabel would refuse she had told lady mabel that the boncassens had been asked and to her thinking it had not been improbable that the young lady would be unwilling to meet her rival at matching but the invitation was accepted  but it was her brothers ready acquiescence which troubled mary chiefly he wrote as though there were no doubt about the matter of course there is a deal of shooting to be done he said and i consider myself bound to look after it there ought not to be less than four gunsparticularly if warburton is to be one of them i like warburton very much and i think he shoots badly to ingratiate himself with the governor i wonder whether the governor would get leave for gerald for a week he has been sticking to his work like a brick if not would he mind my bringing someone you ask the governor and let me know ill be there on the 20th i wonder whether theyll let me hear what goes on among them about politics im sure there is not one of them hates sir timothy worse than i do lady mab is a brick and im glad you have asked her i dont think shell come as she likes shutting herself up at grex miss boncassen is another brick and if you can manage about gerald i will say that you are a third  this would have been all very well had she not known that secret could it be that miss boncassen had been mistaken she was forced to write again to say that her father did not think it right that gerald should be brought away from his studies for the sake of shooting and that the necessary fourth gun would be there in the person of one barrington erle then she added lady mabel grex is coming and so is miss boncassen but to this she received no reply  though silverbridge had written to his sister in his usual careless style he had considered the matter much the three months were over he had no idea of any hesitation on his part he had asked her to be his wife and he was determined to go on with his suit had he ever been enabled to make the same request to mabel grex or had she answered him when he did half make it in a serious manner he would have been true to her he had not told his father or his sister or his friends as isabel had suggested he would not do so till he should have received some more certain answer from her but in respect to his love he was prepared to be quite as obstinate as his sister it was a matter for his own consideration and he would choose for himself the three months were over and it was now his business to present himself to the lady again  that lady mabel should also be at matching would certainly be a misfortune he thought it probable that she knowing that isabel boncassen and he would be there together would refuse the invitation surely she ought to do so that was his opinion when he wrote to his sister when he heard afterwards that she intended to be there he could only suppose that she was prepared to accept the circumstances as they stood     chapter lii  miss boncassen tells the truth   on the 20th of the month all the guests came rattling in at matching one after another the boncassens were the first but lady mabel with miss cassewary followed them quickly then came the finns and with them barrington erle lord silverbridge was the last he arrived by a train which reached the station at 7 pm and only entered the house as his father was taking mrs boncassen into the diningroom he dressed himself in ten minutes and joined the party as they had finished their fish i am awfully sorry he said rushing up to his father but i thought that i should just hit it  there is no occasion for awe said the duke as a sufficiency of dinner is left but how you should have hit it as you sayseeing that the train is not due at bridstock till 705 i do not know  ive done it often sir said silverbridge taking the seat left vacant for him next to lady mabel weve had a political caucus of the partyall the members who could be got together in londonat sir timothys and i was bound to attend  weve all heard of that said phineas finn  and we pretty well know all the points of sir timothys eloquence said barrington erle  i am not going to tell any of the secrets i have no doubt that there were reporters present and you will see the whole of it in the papers tomorrow then silverbridge turned to his neighbour well lady mab and how are you this long time  but how are you think what you have gone through since we were at killancodlem  dont talk of it  i suppose it is not to be talked of  though upon the whole it has happened very luckily i have got rid of the accursed horses and my governor has shown what a brick he can be i dont think there is another man in england who would have done as he did  there are not many who could  there are fewer who would when they came into my bedroom that morning and told me that the horse could not run i thought i should have broken my heart seventy thousand pounds gone  seventy thousand pounds  and the honour and glory of winning the race and then the feeling that one had been so awfully swindled of course i had to look as though i did not care a straw about it and to go and see the race with a jaunty air and a cigar in my mouth that is what i call hard work  but you did it  i tried i wish i could explain to you my state of mind that day in the first place the money had to be got though it was to go into the hands of swindlers still it had to be paid i dont know how your father and percival get on togetherbut i felt very like the prodigal son  it is very different with papa  i suppose so i felt very like hanging myself when i was alone that evening and now everything is right again  i am glad that everything is right she said with a strong emphasis on the everything  i have done with racing at any rate the feeling of being in the power of a lot of low blackguards is so terrible i did love the poor brute so dearly and now what have you been doing  just nothingand have seen nobody i went back to grex after leaving killancodlem and shut myself up in my misery  why misery  why misery what a question for you to ask though i love grex i am not altogether fond of living alone and though grex has its charms they are of a melancholy kind and when i think of the state of our family affairs that is not reassuring your father has just paid seventy thousand pounds for you my father has been good enough to take something less than a quarter of that sum from mebut still it was all that i was ever to have  girls dont want money  dont they when i look forward it seems to me that a time will come when i shall want it very much  you will marry he said she turned round for a moment and looked at him full in the face after such a fashion that he did not dare to promise her further comfort in that direction things always do come right somehow  let us hope so only nothing has ever come right with me yet what is frank doing  i havent seen him since he left crummietoddie  and your sister she whispered  i know nothing about it at all  and you i have told you everything about myself  as for me i think of nothing but politics now i have told you about my racing experiences just at present shooting is up before christmas i shall go into chilterns country for a little hunting  you can hunt here  i shant stay long enough to make it worth while to have my horses down if tregear will go with me to the brake i can mount him for a day or two but i dare say you know more of his plans than i do he went to see you at grex  and you did not  i was not asked  nor was he  then all i can say is replied silverbridge speaking in a low voice but with considerable energy that he can use a freedom with lady mabel grex upon which i cannot venture  i believe you begrudge me his friendship if you had no one else belonging to you with whom you could have any sympathy would not you find comfort in a relation who could be almost as near to you as a brother  i do not grudge him to you  yes you do and what business have you to interfere  none at allcertainly i will never do it again  dont say that lord silverbridge you ought to have more mercy on me you ought to put up with anything from meknowing how much i suffer  i will put up with anything said he  do do and now i will try to talk to mr erle  miss boncassen was sitting on the other side of the table between mr monk and phineas finn and throughout the dinner talked mock politics with the greatest liveliness silverbridge when he entered the room had gone round the table and had shaken hands with everyone but there had been no other greeting between him and isabel nor had any sign passed from one to the other no such greeting or sign had been possible nothing had been left undone which she had expected or hoped but though she was lively nevertheless she kept her eye upon her lover and lady mabel lady mary had said that she thought her brother was in love with lady mabel could it be possible in her own land she had heard absurd storiesstories which seemed to her to be absurdof the treachery of lords and countesses of the baseness of aristocrats of the iniquities of high life in london but her father had told her that go where she might she would find people in the main to be very like each other it had seemed to her that nothing could be more ingenuous than this young man had been in the declaration of his love no simplest republican could have spoken more plainly but now at this moment she could not doubt but that her lover was very intimate with this other girl of course he was free when she had refused to say a word to him of her own love or want of love she had necessarily left him his liberty when she had put him off for three months of course he was to be his own master but what must she think of him if it were so and how could he have the courage to face her in his fathers house if he intended to treat her in such a fashion but of all this she showed nothing nor was there a tone in her voice which betrayed her she said her last word to mr monk with so sweet a smile that that old bachelor wished he were younger for her sake  in the evening after dinner there was music it was discovered that miss boncassen sang divinely and both lady mabel and lady mary accompanied her mr erle and mr warburton and mr monk all of whom were unmarried stood by enraptured but lord silverbridge kept himself apart and interested himself in a description which mrs boncassen gave him of their young men and their young ladies in the states he had hardly spoken to miss boncassentill he offered her sherry or sodawater before she retired for the night she refused his courtesy with her usual smile but showed no more emotion than though they two had now met for the first time in their lives  he had quite made up his mind as to what he would do when the opportunity should come in his way he would simply remind her that the three months were passed but he was shy of talking to her in the presence of lady mabel and his father he was quite determined that the thing should be done at once but he certainly wished that lady mabel had not been there in what she had said to him at the dinnertable she had made him understand that she would be a trouble to him he remembered her look when he told her she would marry it was as though she had declared to him that it was he who ought to be her husband it referred back to that proffer of love which he had once made to her of course all this was disagreeable of course it made things difficult for him but not the less was it a thing quite assured that he would press his suit to miss boncassen when he was talking to mrs boncassen he was thinking of nothing else when he was offering isabel the glass of sherry he was telling himself that he would find his opportunity on the morrowthough now at that moment it was impossible that he should make a sign she as she went to bed asked herself whether it were possible that there should be such treacherywhether it were possible that he should pass it all by as though he had never said a word to her  during the whole of the next day which was sunday he was equally silent immediately after breakfast on the monday shooting commenced and he could not find a moment in which to speak it seemed to him that she purposely kept out of his way with mabel he did find himself for a few minutes alone and was then interrupted by his sister and isabel i hope you have killed a lot of things said miss boncassen  pretty well among us all  what an odd amusement it seems going out to commit wholesale slaughter however it is the proper thing no doubt  quite the proper thing said lord silverbridge and that was all  on the next morning he dressed himself for shootingand then sent out the party without him he had heard he said of a young horse for sale in the neighbourhood and had sent to desire that it might be brought to him and now he found his occasion  come and play a game of billiards he said to isabel as the three girls with the other ladies were together in the drawingroom she got up very slowly from her seat and very slowly crept away to the door then she looked round as though expecting the others to follow her none of them did follow her mary felt that she ought to do so but knowing all that she knew did not dare and what good could she have done by one such interruption lady mabel would fain have gone toobut neither did she quite dare had there been no special reason why she should or should not have gone with them the thing would have been easy enough when two people go to play billiards a third may surely accompany them but now lady mabel found that she could not stir mrs finn mrs boncassen and miss cassewary were all in the room but none of them moved silverbridge led the way quickly across the hall and isabel boncassen followed him very slowly when she entered the room she found him standing with a cue in his hand he at once shut the door and walking up to her dropped the butt of the cue on the floor and spoke one word well he said  what does well mean  the three months are over  certainly they are over  and i have been a model of patience  perhaps your patience is more remarkable than your constancy is not lady mabel grex in the ascendant just now  what do you mean by that why do you ask that you told me to wait for three months i have waited and here i am  how veryverydownright you are  is not that the proper thing  i thought i was downrightbut you beat me hollow yes the three months are over and now what have you got to say he put down his cue and stretched out his arms as though he were going to take her and hold her to his heart nono not that she said laughing but if you will speak i will hear you  you know what i said before will you love me isabel  and you know what i said before do they know that you love me does your father know it and your sister why did they ask me to come here  nobody knows it but say that you love me and everyone shall know it at once yes one person knows it why did you mention lady mabels name she knows it  did you tell her  yes i went again to killancodlem after you were gone and then i told her  but why her come lord silverbridge you are straightforward with me and i will be the same with you you have told lady mabel i have told lady mary  my sister  yesyour sister and i am sure she disapproves it she did not say so but i am sure it is so and then she told me something  what did she tell you  has there never been reason to think that you intended to offer your hand to lady mabel grex  did she tell you so  you should answer my question lord silverbridge it is surely one which i have a right to ask then she stood waiting for his reply keeping herself at some little distance from him as though she were afraid that he would fly upon her and indeed there seemed to be cause for such fear from the frequent gestures of his hands why do you not answer me has there been reason for such expectations  yesthere has  there has  i thought of itnot knowing myself before i had seen you you shall know it all if you will only say that you love me  i should like to know it all first  you do know it allalmost i have told you that she knows what i said to you at killancodlem is not that enough  and she approves  what has that to do with it lady mabel is my friend but not my guardian  has she a right to expect that she should be your wife  nocertainly not why should you ask all this do you love me come isabel say that you love me will you call me vain if i say that i almost think you do you cannot doubt about my lovenot now  nonot now  you neednt why wont you be as honest to me if you hate me say sobut if you love me  i do not hate you lord silverbridge  and is that all  you asked me the question  but you do love me by george i thought you would be more honest and straightforward  then she dropped her badinage and answered him seriously i thought i had been honest and straightforward when i found that you were in earnest at killancodlem  why did you ever doubt me  when i felt that you were in earnest then i had to be in earnest too and i thought so much about it that i lay awake nearly all that night shall i tell you what i thought  tell me something that i should like to hear  i will tell you the truth is it possible i said to myself that such a man as that can want me to be his wife he an englishman of the highest rank and the greatest wealth and one that any girl in the world would love  psha he exclaimed  that is what i said to myself then she paused and looking into her face he saw that there was a glimmer of a tear in each eye one that any girl must love when asked for her lovebecause he is so sweet so good and so pleasant  i know that you are chaffing  then i went on asking myself questions and is it possible that i who by all his friends will be regarded as a nobody who am an americanwith merely human workaday blood in my veinsthat such a one as i should become his wife then i told myself that it was not possible it was not in accordance with the fitness of things all the dukes in england would rise up against it and especially that duke whose goodwill would be imperative  why should he rise up against it  you know he will but i will go on with my story of myself when i had settled that in my mind i just cried myself to sleep it had been a dream i had come across one who in his own self seemed to combine all that i had ever thought of as being lovable in a man  isabel  and in his outward circumstances soared as much above my thoughts as the heaven is above the earth and he had whispered to me soft loving heavenly words nono you shall not touch me but you shall listen to me in my sleep i could be happy again and not see the barriers but when i woke i made up my mind if he comes to me again i saidif it should be that he should come to me again i will tell him that he shall be my heaven on earthififif the illwill of his friends would not make that heaven a hell to both of us i did not tell you quite all that  you told me nothing but that i was to come again in three months  i said more than that i bade you ask your father now you have come again you cannot understand a girls fears and doubts how should you i thought perhaps you would not come when i saw you whispering to that highlyborn wellbred beauty and remembered what i was myself i thought thatyou would not come  then you must love me  love you oh my darlingno no no she said as she retreated from him round the corner of the billiardtable and stood guarding herself from him with her little hands you ask if i love you you are entitled to know the truth from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head i love you as i think a man would wish to be loved by the girl he loves you have come across my life and have swallowed me up and made me all your own but i will not marry you to be rejected by your people no nor shall there be a kiss between us till i know that it will not be so  may i speak to your father  for what good i have not spoken to father or mother because i have known that it must depend upon your father lord silverbridge if he will tell me that i shall be his daughter i will become your wifeoh with such perfect joy with such perfect truth if it can never be so then let us be torn apartwith whatever struggle still at once in that case i will get myself back to my own country as best i may and will pray to god that all this may be forgotten then she made her way round to the door leaving him fixed to the spot in which she had been standing but as she went she made a little prayer to him do not delay my fate it is all in all to me and so he was left alone in the billiardroom     chapter liii  then i am as proud as a queen   during the next day or two the shooting went on without much interruption from lovemaking the lovemaking was not prosperous all round poor lady mary had nothing to comfort her could she have been allowed to see the letter which her lover had written to her father the comfort would have been if not ample still very great mary told herself again and again that she was quite sure of tregearbut it was hard upon her that she could not be made certain that her certainty was well grounded had she known that tregear had written though she had not seen a word of his letter it would have comforted her but she had heard nothing of the letter in june last she had seen him by chance for a few minutes in lady mabels drawingroom since that she had not heard from him or of him that was now more than five months since how could her love serve herhow could her very life serve her if things were to go on like that how was she to bear it thinking of this she resolvedshe almost resolvedthat she would go boldly to her father and desire that she might be given up to her lover  her brother though more triumphantfor how could he fail to triumph after such words as isabel had spoken to himstill felt his difficulties very seriously she had imbued him with a strong sense of her own firmness and she had declared that she would go away and leave him altogether if the duke should be unwilling to receive her he knew that the duke would be unwilling the duke who certainly was not handy in those duties of matchmaking which seemed to have fallen upon him at the death of his wife showed by a hundred little signs his anxiety that his son and heir should arrange his affairs with lady mabel these signs were manifest to marywere disagreeably manifest to silverbridgewere unfortunately manifest to lady mabel herself they were manifest to mrs finn who was clever enough to perceive that the inclinations of the young heir were turned in another direction and gradually they became manifest to isabel boncassen the host himself as host was courteous to all his guests they had been of his own selection and he did his best to make himself pleasant to them all but he selected two for his peculiar noticeand those two were miss boncassen and lady mabel while he would himself walk and talk and argue after his own peculiar fashion with the american beautyexplaining to her matters political and social till he persuaded her to promise to read his pamphlet upon decimal coinagehe was always making awkward efforts to throw silverbridge and lady mabel together the two girls saw it all and knew well how the matter wasknew that they were rivals and knew each the ground on which she herself and on which the other stood but neither was satisfied with her advantage or nearly satisfied isabel would not take the prize without the dukes consentand mabel could not have it without that other consent if you want to marry an english duke she once said to isabel in that anger which she was unable to restrain there is the duke himself i never saw a man more absolutely in love but i do not want to marry an english duke said isabel and i pity any girl who has any idea of marriage except that which comes from a wish to give back love for love  through it all the father never suspected the real state of his sons mind he was too simple to think it possible that the purpose which silverbridge had declared to him as they walked together from the beargarden had already been thrown to the winds he did not like to ask why the thing was not settled young men he thought were sometimes shy and young ladies not always ready to give immediate encouragement but when he saw them together he concluded that matters were going in the right direction it was however an opinion which he had all to himself  during the three or four days which followed the scene in the billiardroom isabel kept herself out of her lovers way she had explained to him that which she wished him to do and she left him to do it day by day she watched the circumstances of the life around her and knew that it had not been done she was sure that it could not have been done while the duke was explaining to her the beauty of quints and expatiating on the horrors of twelve pennies and twelve inches and twelve ouncesvariegated in some matters by sixteen and fourteen he could not know that she was ambitious of becoming his daughterinlaw while he was opening out to her the mysteries of the house of lords and explaining how it came to pass that while he was a member of one house of parliament his son should be sitting as a member of anotherhow it was that a nobleman could be a commoner and how a peer of one part of the empire could sit as the representative of a borough in another part she was an apt scholar had there been a question of any other young man marrying her he would probably have thought that no other young man could have done better  silverbridge was discontented with himself the greatest misfortune was that lady mabel should be there while she was present to his fathers eyes he did not know how to declare his altered wishes every now and then she would say to him some little word indicating her feelings of the absurdity of his passion i declare i dont know whether it is you or your father that miss boncassen most affects she said but to this and to other similar speeches he would make no answer she had extracted his secret from him at killancodlem and might use it against him if she pleased in his present frame of mind he was not disposed to joke with her upon the subject  on that second sundaythe boncassens were to return to london on the following tuesdayhe found himself alone with isabels father the american had been brought out at his own request to see the stables and had been accompanied round the premises by silverbridge and by mr warburton by isabel and by lady mary as they got out into the park the party were divided and silverbridge found himself with mr boncassen then it occurred to him that the proper thing for a young man in love was to go not to his own father but to the ladys father why should not he do as others always did isabel no doubt had suggested a different course but that which isabel had suggested was at the present moment impossible to him now at this instant without a moments forethought he determined to tell his story to isabels fatheras any other lover might tell it to any other father  i am very glad to find ourselves alone mr boncassen he said mr boncassen bowed and showed himself prepared to listen though so many at matching had seen the whole play mr boncassen had seen nothing of it  i dont know whether you are aware of what i have got to say  i cannot quite say that i am my lord but whatever it is i am sure i shall be delighted to hear it  i want to marry your daughter said silverbridge isabel had told him that he was downright and in such a matter he had hardly as yet learned how to express himself with those paraphrases in which the world delights mr boncassen stood stock still and in the excitement of the moment pulled off his hat the proper thing is to ask your permission to go on with it  you want to marry my daughter  yes that is what i have got to say  is she aware of yourintention  quite aware i believe i may say that if other things go straight she will consent  and your fatherthe duke  he knows nothing about itas yet  really this takes me quite by surprise i am afraid you have not given enough thought to the matter  i have been thinking about it for the last three months said lord silverbridge  marriage is a very serious thing  of course it is  and men generally like to marry their equals  i dont know about that i dont think that counts for much people dont always know who are their equals  that is quite true if i were speaking to you or to your father theoretically i should perhaps be unwilling to admit superiority on your side because of your rank and wealth i could make an argument in favour of any equality with the best briton that ever livedas would become a trueborn republican  that is just what i mean  but when the question becomes one of practisinga question for our lives for our happiness for our own conduct then knowing what must be the feelings of an aristocracy in such a country as this i am prepared to admit that your father would be as well justified in objecting to a marriage between a child of his and a child of mine as i should be in objecting to one between my child and the son of some mechanic in our native city  he wouldnt be a gentleman said silverbridge  that is a word of which i dont quite know the meaning  i do said silverbridge confidently  but you could not define it if a man be well educated and can keep a good house over his head perhaps you may call him a gentleman but there are many such with whom your father would not wish to be so closely connected as you propose  but i may have your sanction mr boncassen again took off his hat and walked along thoughtfully i hope you dont object to me personally  my dear young lord your father has gone out of his way to be civil to me am i to return his courtesy by bringing a great trouble upon him  he seems to be very fond of miss boncassen  will he continue to be fond of her when he has heard this what does isabel say  she says the same as you of course  why of courseexcept that it is evident to you as it is to me that she could not with propriety say anything else  i think she wouldwould like it you know  she would like to be your wife  wellyes if it were all serene i think she would consent  i dare say she would consentif it were all serene why should she not do not try her too hard lord silverbridge you say you love her  i do indeed  then think of the position in which you are placing her you are struggling to win her heart silverbridge as he heard this assured himself that there was no need for any further struggling in that direction perhaps you have won it yet she may feel that she cannot become your wife she may well say to herself that this which is offered to her is so great that she does not know how to refuse it and may yet have to say at the same time that she cannot accept it without disgrace you would not put one that you love into such a position  as for disgracethat is nonsense i beg your pardon mr boncassen  would it be no disgrace that she should be known here in england to be your wife and that none of those of your rankof what would then be her own rankshould welcome her into her new world  that would be out of the question  if your own father refused to welcome her would not others follow suit  you dont know my father  you seem to know him well enough to fear that he would object  yesthat is true  what more do i want to know  if she were once my wife he would not reject her of all human beings he is in truth the kindest and most affectionate  and therefore you would try him after this fashion no my lord i cannot see my way through these difficulties you can say what you please to him as to your own wishes but you must not tell him that you have any sanction from me  that evening the story was told to mrs boncassen and the matter was discussed among the family isabel in talking to them made no scruple of declaring her own feelings and though in speaking to lord silverbridge she had spoken very much as her father had done afterwards yet in this family conclave she took her lovers part that is all very well father she said i told him the same thing myself but if he is man enough to be firm i shall not throw him overnot for all the dukes in europe i shall not stay here to be pointed at i will go back home if he follows me then i shall choose to forget all about his rank if he loves me well enough to show that he is in earnest i shall not disappoint him for the sake of pleasing his father to this neither mr nor mrs boncassen was able to make any efficient answer mrs boncassen dear good woman could see no reason why two young people who loved each other should not be married at once dukes and duchesses were nothing to her if they couldnt be happy in england then let them come and live in new york she didnt understand that anybody could be too good for her daughter was there not an idea that mr boncassen would be the next president and was not the president of the united states as good as the queen of england  lord silverbridge when he left mr boncassen wandered about the park by himself king cophetua married the beggars daughter he was sure of that king cophetua probably had not a father and the beggar probably was not highminded but the discrepancy in that case was much greater he intended to persevere trusting much to a belief that when once he was married his father would come round his father always did come round but the more he thought of it the more impossible it seemed to him that he should ask his fathers consent at the present moment lady mabels presence in the house was an insuperable obstacle he thought that he could do it if he and his father were alone together or comparatively alone he must be prepared for an opposition at any rate of some days which opposition would make his father quite unable to entertain his guests while it lasted  but as he could not declare his wishes to his father and was thus disobeying isabels behests he must explain the difficulty to her he felt already that she would despise him for his cowardicethat she would not perceive the difficulties in his way or understand that he might injure his cause by precipitation then he considered whether he might not possibly make some bargain with his father how would it be if he should consent to go back to the liberal party on being allowed to marry the girl he loved as far as his political feelings were concerned he did not think that he would much object to make the change there was only one thing certainthat he must explain his condition to miss boncassen before she went  he found no difficulty now in getting the opportunity she was equally anxious and as well disposed to acknowledge her anxiety after what had passed between them she was not desirous of pretending that the matter was one of small moment to herself she had told him that it was all the world to her and had begged him to let her know her fate as quickly as possible on that last monday morning they were in the grounds together and lady mabel who was walking with mrs finn saw them pass through a little gate which led from the gardens into the priory ruins it all means nothing mabel said with a little laugh to her companion  if so i am sorry for the young lady said mrs finn  dont you think that one always has to be sorry for the young ladies young ladies generally have a bad time of it did you ever hear of a gentleman who had always to roll a stone to the top of a hill but it would always come back upon him  that gentleman i believe never succeeded said mrs finn the young ladies i suppose do sometimes  in the meantime isabel and silverbridge were among the ruins together this is where the old pallisers used to be buried he said  oh indeed and married i suppose  i dare say they had a priest of their own no doubt which must have been convenient this block of a fellow without any legs left is supposed to represent sir guy he ran away with halfadozen heiresses they say i wish things were as easily done now  nobody should have run away with me i have no idea of going on such a journey except on terms of equalityjust step and step alike then she took hold of his arm and put out one foot are you ready  i am very willing  but are you readyfor a straightforward walk off to church before all the world none of your private chaplains such as sir guy had at his command just the registrar if there is nothing betterso that it be public before all the world  i wish we could start this instant  but we cantcan we  no dear so many things have to be settled  and what have you settled on since you last spoke to me  i have told your father everything  yesi know that what good does that do father is not a duke of omnium no one supposed that he would object  but he did said silverbridge  yesas i dofor the same reason because he would not have his daughter creep in at a hole but to your own father you have not ventured to speak then he told his story as best he knew how it was not that he feared his father but that he felt that the present moment was not fit he wishes you to marry that lady mabel grex she said he nodded his head and you will marry her  never i might have done so had i not seen you i should have done so if she had been willing but now i never cannever never her hand had dropped from his arm but now she put it up again for a moment so that he might feel the pressure of her fingers say that you believe me  i think i do  you know i love you  i think you do i am sure i hope you do if you dont then i ama miserable wretch  with all my heart i do  then i am as proud as a queen you will tell him soon  as soon as you are gone as soon as we are alone together i willand then i will follow you to london now shall we not say goodbye  goodbye my own she whispered  you will let me have one kiss  her hand was in his and she looked about as though to see that no eyes were watching them but then as the thoughts came rushing to her mind she changed her purpose no she said what is it but a trifle it is nothing in itself but i have bound myself to myself by certain promises and you must not ask me to break them you are as sweet to me as i can be to you but there shall be no kissing till i know that i shall be your wife now take me back     chapter liv  i dont think she is a snake   on the following day tuesday the boncassens went and then there were none of the guests left but mrs finn and lady mabel grexwith of course miss cassewary the duke had especially asked both mrs finn and lady mabel to remain the former through his anxiety to show his repentance for the injustice he had formerly done her and the latter in the hope that something might be settled as soon as the crowd of visitors should have gone he had never spoken quite distinctly to mabel he had felt that the manner in which he had learned his sons purposethat which once had been his sons purposeforbade him to do so but he had so spoken as to make lady mabel quite aware of his wish he would not have told her how sure he was that silverbridge would keep no more racehorses how he trusted that silverbridge had done with betting how he believed that the young member would take a real interest in the house of commons had he not intended that she should take a special interest in the young man and then he had spoken about the house in london it was to be made over to silverbridge as soon as silverbridge should marry and there was gatherum castle gatherum was rather a trouble than otherwise he had ever felt it to be so but had nevertheless always kept it open perhaps for a month in the year his uncle had always resided there for a fortnight at christmas when silverbridge was married it would become the young mans duty to do something of the same kind gatherum was the white elephant of the family and silverbridge must enter in upon his share of the trouble he did not know that in saying all this he was offering his son as a husband to lady mabel but she understood it as thoroughly as though he had spoken the words  but she knew the sons mind also he had indeed himself told her all his mind of course i love her best of all he had said when he told her of it she had been so overcome that she had wept in her despairhad wept in his presence she had declared to him her secretthat it had been her intention to become his wife and then he had rejected her it had all been shame and sorrow and disappointment to her and she could not but remember that there had been a moment when she might have secured him by a word a look would have done it a touch of her finger on that morning she had known then that he had intended to be in earnestthat he only waited for encouragement she had not given it because she had not wished to grasp too eagerly at the prizeand now the prize was gone she had said that she had spared himbut then she could afford to joke thinking that he would surely come back to her  she had begun her world with so fatal a mistake when she was quite young when she was little more than a child but still not a child she had given all her love to a man whom she soon found that it would be impossible she should ever marry he had offered to face the world with her promising to do the best to smooth the rough places and to soften the stones for her feet but she young as she was had felt that both he and she belonged to a class which could hardly endure poverty with contentment the grinding need for money the absolute necessity of luxurious living had been pressed upon her from her childhood she had seen it and acknowledged it and had told him with precocious wisdom that that which he offered to do for her sake would be a folly for them both she had not stinted the assurance of her love but had told him that they must both turn aside and learn to love elsewhere he had done so with too complete readiness she had dreamed of a second love which should obliterate the firstwhich might still leave to her the memory of the romance of her early passion then this boy had come in her way with him all her ambition might have been satisfied she desired high rank and great wealth with him she might have had it all and then too though there would always be the memory of that early passion yet she could in another fashion love this youth he was pleasant to her and graciousand she had told herself that if it should be so that this great fortune might be hers she would atone to him fully for that past romance by the wifelike devotion of her life the cup had come within the reach of her fingers but she had not grasped it her happiness her triumphs her great success had been there present to her and she had dallied with her fortune there had been a day on which he had been all but at her feet and on the next he had been prostrate at the feet of another he had even dared to tell her sosaying of that american that of course he loved her the best  over and over again since that she had asked herself whether there was no chance though he had loved that other one best she would take him if it were possible when the invitation came from the duke she would not lose a chance she had told him that it was impossible that he the heir to the duke of omnium should marry an american all his family all his friends all his world would be against him and then he was so youngand as she thought so easily led he was lovable and prone to lovebut surely his love could not be very strong or he would not have changed so easily  she did not hesitate to own to herself that this american was very lovely she too herself was beautiful she too had a reputation for grace loveliness and feminine highbred charm she knew all that but she knew also that her attractions were not so bright as those of her rival she could not smile or laugh and throw sparks of brilliance around her as did the american girl miss boncassen could be graceful as a nymph in doing the awkwardest thing when she had pretended to walk stiffly along to some imaginary marriage ceremony with her foot stuck out before her with her chin in the air and one arm akimbo silverbridge had been all afire with admiration lady mabel understood it all the american girl must be taken awayfrom out of the reach of the young mans sensesand then the struggle must be made  lady mabel had not been long at matching before she learned that she had much in her favour she perceived that the duke himself had no suspicion of what was going on and that he was strongly disposed in her favour she unravelled it all in her own mind there must have been some agreement between the father and the son when the son had all but made his offer to her more than once she was halfminded to speak openly to the duke to tell him all that silverbridge had said to her and all that he had not said and to ask the fathers help in scheming against that rival but she could not find the words with which to begin and then might he not despise her and despising her reject her were she to declare her desire to marry a man who had given his heart to another woman and so when the duke asked her to remain after the departure of the other guests she decided that it would be best to bide her time the duke as she assented kissed her hand and she knew that this sign of grace was given to his intended daughterinlaw  in all this she halfconfided her thoughts and her prospects to her old friend miss cassewary that girl has gone at last she said to miss cass  i fear she has left her spells behind her my dear  of course she has the venom out of the snakes tooth will poison all the blood but still the poor bitten wretch does not always die  i dont think she is a snake  dont be moral cass she is a snake in my sense she has got her weapons and of course it is natural enough that she should use them if i want to be duchess of omnium why shouldnt she  i hate to hear you talk of yourself in that way  because you have enough of the old school about you to like conventional falsehood this young man did in fact ask me to be his wife of course i meant to accept himbut i didnt then comes this convicts granddaughter  not a convicts  you know what i mean had he been a convict it would have been all the same i take upon myself to say that had the world been informed that an alliance had been arranged between the eldest son of the duke of omnium and the daughter of earl grexthe world would have been satisfied every unmarried daughter of every peer in england would have envied mebut it would have been comme il faut  certainly my dear  but what would be the feeling as to the convicts granddaughter  you dont suppose that i would approve itbut it seems to me that in these days young men do just what they please  he shall do what he pleases but he must be made to be pleased with me so much she said to miss cassewary but she did not divulge any plan the boncassens had just gone off to the station and silverbridge was out shooting if anything could be done here at matching it must be done quickly as silverbridge would soon take his departure she did not know it but in truth he was remaining in order that he might as he said have all this out with the governor  she tried to realise for herself some plan but when the evening came nothing was fixed for a quarter of an hour just as the sun was setting the duke joined her in the gardensand spoke to her more plainly than he had ever spoken before has silverbridge come home he asked  i have not seen him  i hope you and mary get on well together  i think so duke i am sure we should if we saw more of each other  i sincerely hope you may there is nothing i wish for mary so much as that she should have a sister and there is no one whom i would be so glad to hear her call by that name as yourself how could he have spoken plainer  the ladies were all together in the drawingroom when silverbridge came bursting in rather late wheres the governor he asked turning to his sister  dressing i should think but what is the matter  i want to see him i must be off to cornwall tomorrow morning  to cornwall said miss cassewary why to cornwall asked lady mabel but mary connecting cornwall with frank tregear held her peace  i cant explain it all now but i must start very early tomorrow then he went off to his fathers study and finding the duke still there explained the cause of his intended journey the member for polpenno had died and frank tregear had been invited to stand for the borough he had written to his friend to ask him to come and assist in the struggle years ago there used to be always a tregear in for polpenno said silverbridge  but he is a younger son  i dont know anything about it said silverbridge but as he has asked me to go i think i ought to do it the duke who was by no means the man to make light of the political obligations of friendship raised no objection  i wish said he that something could have been arranged between you and mabel before you went the young man stood in the gloom of the dark room aghast this was certainly not the moment for explaining everything to his father i have set my heart very much upon it and you ought to be gratified by knowing that i quite approve your choice  all that had been years agoin last junebefore mrs montacute joness gardenparty before that day in the rain at maidenhead before the brightness of killancodlem before the glories of miss boncassen had been revealed to him there is no time for that kind of thing now he said weakly  i thought that when you were here together  i must dress now sir but i will tell you all about it when i get back from cornwall i will come back direct to matching and will explain everything so he escaped  it was clear to lady mabel that there was no opportunity now for any scheme whatever might be possible must be postponed till after this cornish business had been completed perhaps it might be better so she had thought that she would appeal to himself that she would tell him of his fathers wishes of her love for himof the authority which he had once given her for loving himand of the absolute impossibility of his marriage with the american she thought that she could do it if not efficiently at any rate effectively but it could not be done on the very day on which the american had gone  it came out in the course of the evening that he was going to assist frank tregear in his canvass the matter was not spoken of openly as tregears name could hardly be mentioned but everybody knew it and it gave occasion to mabel for a few words apart with silverbridge i am so glad you are going to him she said in a little whisper  of course i go when he wishes me i dont know that i can do him any good  the greatest good in the world your name will go so far it will be everything to him to be in parliament and when are we to meet again she said  i shall turn up somewhere he replied as he gave her his hand to wish her goodbye  on the following morning the duke proposed to lady mabel that she should stay at matching for yet another fortnightor even for a month if it might be possible lady mabel whose father was still abroad was not sorry to accept the invitation     chapter lv  polpenno   polwenning the seat of mr tregear franks father was close to the borough of polpennoso close that the gates of the grounds opened into the town as silverbridge had told his father many of the tregear family had sat for the borough then there had come changes and strangers had made themselves welcome by their money when the vacancy now occurred a deputation waited upon squire tregear and asked him to stand the deputation would guarantee that the expense should not exceeda certain limited sum mr tregear for himself had no such ambition his eldest son was abroad and was not at all such a man as one would choose to make into a member of parliament after much consideration in the family frank was invited to present himself to the constituency franks aspirations in regard to lady mary palliser were known at polwenning and it was thought that they would have a better chance of success if he could write the letters mp after his name frank acceded and as he was starting wrote to ask the assistance of his friend lord silverbridge at that time there were only nine days more before the election and mr carbottle the liberal candidate was already living in great style at the camborne arms  mr and mrs tregear and an elder sister of franks who quite acknowledged herself to be an old maid were very glad to welcome franks friend on the first morning of course they discussed the candidates prospects my best chance of success said frank arises from the fact that mr carbottle is fatter than the people here seem to approve  if his purse be fat said old mr tregear that will carry off any personal defect lord silverbridge asked whether the candidate was not too fat to make speeches miss tregear declared that he had made three speeches daily for the last week and that mr williams the rector who had heard him declared him to be a godless dissenter mrs tregear thought that it would be much better that the place should be disfranchised altogether than that such a horrid man should be brought into the neighbourhood a godless dissenter she said holding up her hands in dismay frank thought that they had better abstain from allusion to their opponents religion then mr tregear made a little speech we used he said to endeavour to get someone to represent us in parliament who would agree with us on vital subjects such as the church of england and the necessity of religion now it seems to be considered illmannered to make any allusion to such subjects from which it may be seen that this old tregear was very conservative indeed  when the old people were gone to bed the two young men discussed the matter i hope youll get in said silverbridge and if i can do anything for you of course i will  it is always good to have a real member along with one said tregear  but i begin to think i am a very shaky conservative myself  i am sorry for that  sir timothy is such a beast said silverbridge  is that your notion of a political opinion are you to be this or that in accordance with your own liking or disliking for some particular man one is supposed to have opinions of ones own  your father would be down on a man because he is a dissenter  of course my father is oldfashioned  it does seem so hard to me said silverbridge to find any difference between the two sets you who are a true conservative are much more like to my father who is a liberal than to your own who is on the same side as yourself  it may be so and still i may be a good conservative  it seems to me in the house to mean nothing more than choosing one set of companions or choosing another there are some awful cads who sit along with mr monkfellows that make you sick to hear them and whom i couldnt be civil to but i dont think there is anybody i hate so much as old beeswax he has a contemptuous way with his nose which makes me long to pull it  and you mean to go over in order that you may be justified in doing so i think i soar a little higher said tregear  oh of course youre a clever fellow said silverbridge not without a touch of sarcasm  a man may soar higher than that without being very clever if the party that calls itself liberal were to have all its own way who is there that doesnt believe that the church would go at once then all distinction between boroughs the house of lords immediately afterwards and after that the crown  those are not my governors ideas  your governor couldnt help himself a liberal party with plenipotentiary power must go on right away to the logical conclusion of its arguments it is only the conservative feeling of the country which saves such men as your father from being carried headlong to ruin by their own machinery you have read carlyles french revolution  yes i have read that  wasnt it so there there were a lot of honest men who thought they could do a deal of good by making everybody equal a good many were made equal by having their heads cut off thats why i mean to be member for polpenno and to send mr carbottle back to london carbottle probably doesnt want to cut anybodys head off  i dare say hes as conservative as anybody  but he wants to be a member of parliament and as he hasnt thought much about anything he is quite willing to lend a hand to communism radicalism socialism chopping peoples heads off or anything else  thats all very well said silverbridge but where should we have been if there had been no liberals robespierre and his pals cut off a lot of heads but louis xiv and louis xv locked up more in prison and so he had the last word in the argument  the whole of the next morning was spent in canvassing and the whole of the afternoon in the evening there was a great meeting at the polwenning assembly room which at the present moment was in the hands of the conservative party here frank tregear made an oration in which he declared his political convictions the whole speech was said at the time to be very good but the portion of it which was apparently esteemed the most had direct reference to mr carbottle who was mr carbottle why had he come to polpenno who had sent for him why mr carbottle rather than anybody else did not the people of polpenno think that it might be as well to send mr carbottle back to the place from whence he had come these questions which seemed to silverbridge to be as easy as they were attractive almost made him desirous of making a speech himself  then mr williams the rector followed a gentleman who had many staunch friends and many bitter enemies in the town he addressed himself chiefly to that bane of the whole countryas he conceived themthe godless dissenters and was felt by tregear to be injuring the cause by every word he spoke it was necessary that mr williams should liberate his own mind and therefore he persevered with the godless dissenters at great lengthnot explaining however how a man who thought enough about his religion to be a dissenter could be godless or how a godless man should care enough about religion to be a dissenter  mr williams was heard with impatience and then there was a clamour for the young lord he was the son of an exprime minister and therefore of course he could speak he was himself a member of parliament and therefore could speak he had boldly severed himself from the faulty political tenets of his family and therefore on such an occasion as this was peculiarly entitled to speak when a man goes electioneering he must speak at a dinnertable to refuse is possibleor in any assembly convened for a semiprivate purpose a gentleman may declare that he is not prepared for the occasion but in such an emergency as this a manand a member of parliamentcannot plead that he is not prepared a son of a former prime minister who had already taken so strong a part in politics as to have severed himself from his father not prepared to address the voters of a borough whom he had come to canvass the plea was so absurd that he was thrust on to his feet before he knew what he was about  it was in truth his first public speech at silverbridge he had attempted to repeat a few words and in his failure had been covered by the sprugeons and the sprouts but now he was on his legs in a great room in an unknown town with all the aristocracy of the place before him his eyes at first swam a little and there was a moment in which he thought he would run away but on that morning as he was dressing there had come to his mind the idea of the possibility of such a moment as this and a few words had occurred to him my friend frank tregear he began rushing at once at his subject is a very good fellow and i hope youll elect him then he paused not remembering what was to come next but the sentiment which he had uttered appeared to his auditors to be so good in itself and so welldelivered that they filled up a long pause with continued clappings and exclamations yes continued the young member of parliament encouraged by the kindness of the crowd i have known frank tregear ever so long and i dont think you could find a better member of parliament anywhere there were many ladies present and they thought that the dukes son was just the person who ought to come electioneering among them his voice was much pleasanter to their ears than that of old mr williams the women waved their handkerchiefs and the men stamped their feet here was an orator come among them you all know all about it just as well as i do continued the orator and i am sure you feel that he ought to be member for polpenno there could be no doubt about that as far as the opinion of the audience went there cant be a better fellow than frank tregear and i ask you all to give three cheers for the new member ten times three cheers were given and the carbottleites outside the door who had come to report what was going on at the tregear meeting were quite of opinion that this eldest son of the former prime minister was a tower of strength i dont know anything about mr carbottle continued silverbridge who was almost growing to like the sound of his own voice perhaps hes a good fellow too no no no a very bad fellow indeed was heard from different parts of the room i dont know anything about him i wasnt at school with carbottle this was taken as a stroke of the keenest wit and was received with infinite cheering silverbridge was in the pride of his youth and carbottle was sixty at the least nothing could have been funnier he seems to be a stout old party but i dont think hes the man for polpenno i think youll return frank tregear i was at school with himand i tell you that you cant find a better fellow anywhere than frank tregear then he sat down and i am afraid he felt that he had made the speech of the evening we are so much obliged to you lord silverbridge miss tregear said as they were walking home together thats just the sort of thing that the people like so reassuring you know what mr williams says about the dissenters is of course true but it isnt reassuring  i hope i didnt make a fool of myself tonight silverbridge said when he was alone with tregearprobably with some little pride in his heart  i ought to say that you did seeing that you praised me so violently but whatever it was it was well taken i dont know whether they will elect me but had you come down as a candidate i am quite sure they would have elected you silverbridge was hardly satisfied with this he wished to have been told that he had spoken well he did not however resent his friends coldness perhaps after all i did make a fool of myself he said to himself as he went to bed  on the next day after breakfast it was found to be raining heavily canvassing was of course the business of the hour and canvassing is a business which cannot be done indoors it was soon decided that the rain should go for nothing could an agreement have been come to with the carbottleites it might have been decided that both parties should abstain but as that was impossible the tregear party could not afford to lose the day as mr carbottle by reason of his fatness and natural slowness would perhaps be specially averse to walking about in the slush and mud it might be that they would gain something so after breakfast they started with umbrellastregear silverbridge mr newcomb the curate mr pinebott the conservative attorney with four or five followers who were armed with books and pencils and who ticked off on the list of the voters the names of the friendly the doubtful and the inimical  parliamentary canvassing is not a pleasant occupation perhaps nothing more disagreeable more squalid more revolting to the senses more opposed to personal dignity can be conceived the same words have to be repeated over and over again in the cottages hovels and lodgings of poor men and women who only understand that the time has come round in which they are to be flattered instead of being the flatterers i think i am right in supposing that your husbands principles are conservative mrs bubbs i dont know nothing about it youd better call again and see bubbs hissel certainly i will do so i shouldnt at all like to leave the borough without seeing mr bubbs i hope we shall have your influence mrs bubbs i dont know nothing about it my folk at home allays vote buff and i think bubbs ought to go buff too only mind this bubbs dont never come home to his dinner you must come arter six and i hope hes to have someat for his trouble he wont have my word to vote unless he have someat such is the conversation in which the candidate takes a part while his cortège at the door is criticising his very imperfect mode of securing mrs bubbs good wishes then he goes on to the next house and the same thing with some variation is endured again some guide philosopher and friend who accompanies him and who is the chief of the cortège has calculated on his behalf that he ought to make twenty such visitations an hour and to call on two hundred constituents in the course of the day as he is always falling behind in his number he is always being driven on by his philosopher till he comes to hate the poor creatures to whom he is forced to address himself with a most cordial hatred  it is a nuisance to which no man should subject himself in any weather but when it rains there is superadded a squalor and an ill humour to all the party which makes it almost impossible for them not to quarrel before the day is over to talk politics to mrs bubbs under any circumstances is bad but to do so with the conviction that the moisture is penetrating from your greatcoat through your shirt to your bones and that while so employed you are breathing the steam from those seven other wet men at the door is abominable to have to go through this is enough to take away all the pride which a man might otherwise take from becoming a member of parliament but to go through it and then not to become a member is base indeed to go through it and to feel that you are probably paying at the rate of a hundred pounds a day for the privilege is most disheartening silverbridge as he backed up tregear in the uncomfortable work congratulated himself on the comfort of having a mr sprugeon and a mr sprout who could manage his borough for him without a contest  they worked on that day all the morning till one when they took luncheon all reeking with wet at the kings headso that a little money might be legitimately spent in the cause then at two they sallied out again vainly endeavouring to make their twenty calls within the hour about four when it was beginning to be dusk they were very tired and silverbridge had ventured to suggest that as they were all wet through and as there was to be another meeting in the assembly room that night and as nobody in that part of the town seemed to be at home they might perhaps be allowed to adjourn for the present he was thinking how nice it would be to have a glass of hot brandyandwater and then lounge till dinnertime but the philosophers received the proposition with stern disdain was his lordship aware that mr carbottle had been out all day from eight in the morning and was still at work that the carbottleites had already sent for lanterns and were determined to go on till eight oclock among the artisans who would then have returned from their work when a man had put his hand to the plough the philosophers thought that that man should complete the furrow  the philosophers view had just carried the day the discussion having been held under seven or eight wet umbrellas at the corner of a dirty little lane leading into the high street when suddenly on the other side of the way mr carbottles cortège made its appearance the philosophers at once informed them that on such occasions it was customary that the rival candidates should be introduced it will take ten minutes said the philosophers but then it will take them ten minutes too upon this tregear as being the younger of the two crossed over the road and the introduction was made  there was something comfortable in it to the tregear party as no imagination could conceive anything more wretched than the appearance of mr carbottle he was a very stout man of sixty and seemed to be almost carried along by his companions he had pulled his coatcollar up and his hat down till very little of his face was visible and in attempting to look at tregear and silverbridge he had to lift up his chin till the rain ran off his hat on to his nose he had an umbrella in one hand and a stick in the other and was wet through to his very skin what were his own feelings cannot be told but his philosophers guides and friends would allow him no rest very hard work mr tregear he said shaking his head  very hard indeed mr carbottle then the two parties went on each their own way without another word     chapter lvi  the news is sent to matching   there were nine days of this work during which lord silverbridge became very popular and made many speeches tregear did not win half so many hearts or recommend himself so thoroughly to the political predilections of the boroughbut nevertheless he was returned it would probably be unjust to attribute this success chiefly to the young lords eloquence it certainly was not due to the strong religious feelings of the rector it is to be feared that even the thoughtful political convictions of the candidate did not altogether produce the result it was that chief man among the candidates guides and friends that leading philosopher who would not allow anybody to go home from the rain and who kept his eyes so sharply open to the pecuniary doings of the carbottleites that mr carbottles guides and friends had hardly dared to spend a shillingit was he who had in truth been efficacious in every attempt they had made to spend their money they had been looked into and circumvented as mr carbottle had been brought down to polpenno on purpose that he might spend moneyas he had nothing but his money to recommend him and as he had not spent itthe free and independent electors of the borough had not seen their way to vote for him therefore the conservatives were very elate with their triumph there was a great conservative reaction but the electioneering guide philosopher and friend in the humble retirement of his own homehe was a tailor in the town whose assistance at such periods had long been in requisitionhe knew very well how the seat had been secured ten shillings a head would have sent three hundred true liberals to the ballotboxes the mode of distributing the money had been arranged but the conservative tailor had been too acute and not halfasovereign could be passed the tailor got twentyfive pounds for his work and that was smuggled in among the bills for printing  mr williams however was sure that he had so opened out the iniquities of the dissenters as to have convinced the borough yes every salem and zion and ebenezer in his large parish would be closed it is a great thing for the country said mr williams  hell make a capital member said silverbridge clapping his friend on the back  i hope hell never forget said mr williams that he owes his seat to the protestant and churchofengland principles which have sunk so deeply into the minds of the thoughtful portion of the inhabitants of this borough  whom should they elect but a tregear said the mother feeling that her rector took too much of the praise to himself  i think you have done more for us than any one else whispered miss tregear to the young lord what you said was so reassuring the father before he went to bed expressed to his son with some trepidation a hope that all this would lead to no great permanent increase of expenditure  that evening before he went to bed lord silverbridge wrote to his father an account of what had taken place at polpenno      polwenning 15th december     my dear father     among us all we have managed to return tregear i am    afraid you will not be quite pleased because it will be a    vote lost to your party but i really think that he is    just the fellow to be in parliament if he were on your    side im sure hes the kind of man youd like to bring    into office he is always thinking about those sort of    things he says that if there were no conservatives such    liberals as you and mr monk would be destroyed by the    jacobins there is something in that whether a man is a    conservative or not himself i suppose there ought to be    conservatives   the duke as he read this made a memorandum in his own mind that he would explain to his son that every carriage should have a drag to its wheels but that an ambitious soul would choose to be the coachman rather than the drag      it was beastly work   the duke made another memorandum to instruct his son that no gentleman above the age of a schoolboy should allow himself to use such a word in such a sense      we had to go about in the rain up to our knees in mud for    eight or nine days always saying the same thing and of    course all that we said was bosh   another memorandumor rather two one as to the slang and another as to the expediency of teaching something to the poor voters on such occasions      our only comfort was that the carbottle people were quite    as badly off as us   another memorandum as to the grammar the absence of christian charity did not at the moment affect the duke      i made ever so many speeches till at last it seemed to be    quite easy   here there was a very grave memorandum speeches easy to young speakers are generally very difficult to old listeners      but of course it was all bosh   this required no separate memorandum      i have promised to go up to town with tregear for a day    or two after that i will stick to my purpose of going to    matching again i will be there about the 22nd and will    then stay over christmas after that i am going into the    brake country for some hunting it is such a shame to have    a lot of horses and never to ride them     your most affectionate son     silverbridge   the last sentence gave rise in the dukes mind to the necessity of a very elaborate memorandum on the subject of amusements generally  by the same post another letter went from polpenno to matching which also gave rise to some mental memoranda it was as follows      my dear mabel     i am a member of the british house of commons i have    sometimes regarded myself as being one of the most    peculiarly unfortunate men in the world and yet now i    have achieved that which all commoners in england think to    be the greatest honour within their reach and have done    so at an age at which very few achieve it but the sons of    the wealthy and the powerful     i now come to my misfortunes i know that as a poor man    i ought not to be a member of parliament i ought to    be earning my bread as a lawyer or a doctor i have no    business to be what i am and when i am forty i shall find    that i have eaten up all my good things instead of having    them to eat     i have one chance before me you know very well what that    is tell her that my pride in being a member of parliament    is much more on her behalf than on my own the man who    dares to love her ought at any rate to be something in the    world if it might beif ever it may bei should wish    to be something for her sake i am sure you will be glad    of my success yourself for my own sake     your affectionate friend and cousin     francis tregear   the first mental memorandum in regard to this came from the writers assertion that he at forty would have eaten up all his good things no he being a man might make his way to good things though he was not born to them he surely would win his good things for himself but what good things were in store for her what chance of success was there for her but the reflection which was the most bitter to her of all came from her assurance that his love for that other girl was so genuine even when he was writing to her there was no spark left of the old romance some hint of a recollection of past feelings some halfconcealed reference to the former passion might have been allowed to him she as a womanas a woman all whose fortune must depend on marriagecould indulge in no such allusions but surely he need not have been so hard  but still there was another memorandum at the present moment she would do all that he desired as far as it was in her power she was anxious that he should marry lady mary palliser though so anxious also that something of his love should remain with herself she was quite willing to convey that messageif it might be done without offence to the duke she was there with the object of ingratiating herself with the duke she must not impede her favour with the duke by making herself the medium of any secret communications between mary and her lover  but how should she serve tregear without risk of offending the duke she read the letter again and again and thinking it to be a good letter she determined to show it to the duke  mr tregear has got in at polpenno she said on the day on which she and the duke had received their letters  so i hear from silverbridge  it will be a good thing for him i suppose  i do not know said the duke coldly  he is my cousin and i have always been interested in his welfare  that is natural  and a seat in parliament will give him something to do  certainly it ought said the duke  i do not think that he is an idle man to this the duke made no answer he did not wish to be made to talk about tregear may i tell you why i say all this she asked softly pressing her hand on the dukes arm ever so gently to this the duke assented but still coldly because i want to know what i ought to do would you mind reading that letter of course you will remember that frank and i have been brought up almost as brother and sister  the duke took the letter in his hand and did read it very slowly what he says about young men without means going into parliament is true enough this was not encouraging but as the duke went on reading mabel did not think it necessary to argue the matter he had to read the last paragraph twice before he understood it he did read it twice and then folding the letter very slowly gave it back to his companion  what ought i to do asked lady mabel  as you and i my dear are friends i think that any carrying of a message to mary would be breaking confidence i think that you should not speak to mary about mr tregear then he changed the subject lady mabel of course understood that after that she could not say a word to mary about the election at polpenno     chapter lvii  the meeting at the bobtailed fox   it was now the middle of december and matters were not comfortable in the runnymede country the major with much pluck had carried on his operations in opposition to the wishes of the resident members of the hunt the owners of coverts had protested and farmers had sworn that he should not ride over their lands there had even been some talk among the younger men of thrashing him if he persevered but he did persevere and had managed to have one or two good runs now it was the fortune of the runnymede hunt that many of those who rode with the hounds were strangers to the countrymen who came down by train from london gentlemen of perhaps no great distinction who could ride hard but as to whom it was thought that as they did not provide the land to ride over or the fences to be destroyed or the coverts for the foxes or the greater part of the subscription they ought not to oppose those by whom all these things were supplied but the major knowing where his strength lay had managed to get a party to support him the contract to hunt the country had been made with him in last march and was good for one year having the kennels and the hounds under his command he did hunt the country but he did so amidst a storm of contumely and ill will  at last it was decided that a general meeting of the members of the hunt should be called together with the express object of getting rid of the major the gentlemen of the neighbourhood felt that the major was not to be borne and the farmers were very much stronger against him than the gentlemen it had now become a settled belief among sporting men in england that the major had with his own hands driven the nail into the horses foot was it to be endured that the runnymede farmers should ride to hounds under a master who had been guilty of such an iniquity as that the staines and egham gazette which had always supported the runnymede hunt declared in very plain terms that all who rode with the major were enjoying their sport out of the plunder which had been extracted from lord silverbridge then a meeting was called for saturday the 18th december to be held at that wellknown sporting little inn the bobtailed fox the members of the hunt were earnestly called upon to attend it wasso said the printed document which was issuedthe only means by which the hunt could be preserved if gentlemen who were interested did not put their shoulders to the wheel the runnymede hunt must be regarded as a thing of the past one of the documents was sent to the major with an intimation that if he wished to attend no objection would be made to his presence the chair would be taken at halfpast twelve punctually by that popular and wellknown old sportsman mr mahogany topps  was ever the master of a hunt treated in such a way his presence not objected to as a rule the master of a hunt does not attend hunt meetings because the matter to be discussed is generally that of the money to be subscribed for him as to which it is as well he should not hear the pros and cons but it is presumed that he is to be the hero of the hour and that he is to be treated to his face and spoken of behind his back with love admiration and respect but now this master was told his presence would be allowed and then this foxhunting meeting was summoned for halfpast twelve on a huntingdaywhen as all the world knew the hounds were to meet at eleven twelve miles off was ever anything so base said the major to himself but he resolved that he would be equal to the occasion he immediately issued cards to all the members stating that on that day the meet had been changed from croppingham bushes which was ever so much on the other side of bagshot to the bobtailed foxfor the benefit of the hunt at large said the cardand that the hounds would be there at halfpast one  whatever might happen he must show a spirit in all this there were one or two of the london brigade who stood fast to him cock your tail tifto said one hardriding supporter and show em you arent afraid of nothing so tifto cocked his tail and went to the meeting in his best new scarlet coat with his whitest breeches his pinkest boots and his neatest little bows at his knees he entered the room with his horn in his hand as a symbol of authority and took off his huntingcap to salute the assembly with a jaunty air he had taken two glasses of cherry brandy and as long as the stimulant lasted would no doubt be able to support himself with audacity  old mr topps in rising from his chair did not say very much he had been hunting in the runnymede country for nearly fifty years and had never seen anything so sad as this before it made him he knew very unhappy as for foxes there were always plenty of foxes in his coverts his friend mr jawstock on the right would explain what all this was about all he wanted was to see the runnymede hunt properly kept up then he sat down and mr jawstock rose to his legs  mr jawstock was a gentleman well known in the runnymede country who had himself been instrumental in bringing major tifto into these parts there is often someone in a hunting country who never becomes a master of hounds himself but who has almost as much to say about the business as the master himself sometimes at hunt meetings he is rather unpopular as he is always inclined to talk but there are occasions on which his services are felt to be valuableas were mr jawstocks at present he was about fortyfive years of age was not much given to riding owned no coverts himself and was not a man of wealth but he understood the nature of hunting knew all its laws and was a judge of horses of houndsand of men and could say a thing when he had to say it  mr jawstock sat on the right hand of mr topps and a place was left for the master opposite the task to be performed was neither easy nor pleasant it was necessary that the orator should accuse the gentleman opposite to hima man with whom he himself had been very intimateof iniquity so gross and so mean that nothing worse can be conceived you are a swindler a cheat a rascal of the very deepest dyea rogue so mean that it is revolting to be in the same room with you that was what mr jawstock had to say and he said it looking round the room occasionally appealing to mr topps who on these occasions would lift up his hands in horror but never letting his eye fall for a moment on the major mr jawstock told his story i did not see it done said he i know nothing about it i never was at doncaster in my life but you have evidence of what the jockey club thinks the master of our hunt has been banished from racecourses here there was considerable opposition and a few short but excited little dialogues were maintainedthroughout all which tifto restrained himself like a spartan at any rate he has been thoroughly disgraced continued mr jawstock as a sporting man he has been driven out of the beargarden club he resigned in disgust at their treatment said a friend of the majors then let him resign in disgust at ours said mr jawstock for we wont have him here cæsar wouldnt keep a wife who was suspected of infidelity nor will the runnymede country endure a master of hounds who is supposed to have driven a nail into a horses foot  two or three other gentlemen had something to say before the major was allowed to speakthe upshot of the discourse of all of them being the same the major must go  then the major got up and certainly as far as attention went he had full justice done him however clamorous they might intend to be afterwards that amount of fair play they were all determined to afford him the major was not excellent at speaking but he did perhaps better than might have been expected this is a very disagreeable position he said very disagreeable indeed as for the nail in the horses foot i know no more about it than the babe unborn but ive got two things to say and ill say what arent the most consequence first these hounds belong to me here he paused and a loud contradiction came from many parts of the room mr jawstock however proposed that the major should be heard to the end i say they belong to me repeated the major if anybody tries his hand at anything else the law will soon set that to rights but that arent of much consequence what ive got to say is this let the matter be referred if that orse had a nail run into his footand i dont say he hadntwho was the man most injured why lord silverbridge everybody knows that i suppose he dropped well on to eighty thousand pounds i propose to leave it to him let him say he ought to know more about it than any one he and i were partners in the horse his lordship arent very sweet upon me just at present nobody need fear that hell do me a good turn i say leave it to him  in this matter the major had certainly been well advised a rumour had become prevalent among sporting circles that silverbridge had refused to condemn the major it was known that he had paid his bets without delay and that he had to some extent declined to take advice from the leaders of the jockey club the majors friends were informed that the young lord had refused to vote against him at the club was it not more than probable that if this matter were referred to him he would refuse to give a verdict against his late partner  the major sat down put on his cap and folded his arms akimbo with his horn sticking out from his left hand for a time there was general silence broken however by murmurs in different parts of the room then mr jawstock whispered something into the ear of the chairman and mr topps rising from his seat suggested to tifto that he should retire i think so said mr jawstock the proposition you have made can be discussed only in your absence then the major held a consultation with one of his friends and after that did retire  when he was gone the real hubbub of the meeting commenced there were some there who understood the nature of lord silverbridges feelings in the matter he would be the last man in england to declare him guilty said mr jawstock whatever my lord says he shant ride across my land said a farmer in the background i dont think any gentleman ever made a fairer propositionsince anything was anything said a friend of the majors a gentleman who kept livery stables in long acre we wont have him here said another farmerwhereupon mr topps shook his head sadly i dont think any gentleman ought to be condemned without a earing said one of tiftos admirers and where youre to get any one to hunt the country like him i dont know as any body is prepared to say well manage that said a young gentleman from the neighbourhood of bagshot who thought that he could hunt the country himself quite as well as major tifto he must go from here thats the long and the short of it said mr jawstock put it to the vote mr jawstock said the liverystable keeper mr topps who had had great experience in public meetings hereupon expressed an opinion that they might as well go to a vote no doubt he was right if the matter was one which must sooner or later be decided in that manner  mr jawstock looked round the room trying to calculate what might be the effect of a show of hands the majority was with him but he was well aware that of this majority some few would be drawn away by the apparent justice of tiftos proposition and what was the use of voting let them vote as they might it was out of the question that tifto should remain master of the hunt but the chairman had acceded and on such occasions it is difficult to go against the chairman  then there came a show of handsfirst for those who desired to refer the matter to lord silverbridge and afterwards for tiftos direct enemiesfor those who were anxious to banish tifto out of hand without reference to any one at last the matter was settled to the great annoyance of mr jawstock and the farmers the meeting voted that lord silverbridge should be invited to give his opinion as to the innocence or guilt of his late partner  the majors friends carried the discussion out to him as he sat on horseback as though he had altogether gained the battle and was secure in his position as master of the runnymede hunt for the next dozen years but at the same time there came a message from mr mahogany topps it was now halfpast two and mr topps expressed a hope that major tifto would not draw the country on the present occasion the major thinking that it might be as well to conciliate his enemies rode solemnly and slowly home to tallyho lodge in the middle of his hounds     chapter lviii  the major is deposed   when silverbridge undertook to return with tregear to london instead of going off direct to matching it is to be feared that he was simply actuated by a desire to postpone his further visit to his fathers house he had thought that lady mabel would surely be gone before his task at polpenno was completed as soon as he should again find himself in his fathers presence he would at once declare his intention of marrying isabel boncassen but he could not see his way to doing it while lady mabel should be in the house  i think you will find mabel still at matching said tregear on their way up she will wait for you i fancy  i dont know why she should wait for me said silverbridge almost angrily  i thought that you and she were fast friends  i suppose we areafter a fashion she might wait for you perhaps  i think she wouldif i could go there  you are much thicker with her than i ever was you went to see her at grexwhen nobody else was there  is miss cassewary nobody  next door to it said silverbridge half jealous of the favours shown to tregear  i thought said tregear that there would be a closer intimacy between you and her  i dont know why you should think so  had you never any such idea yourself  i havent any nowso there may be an end of it i dont think a fellow ought to be crossquestioned on such a subject  then i am very sorry for mabel said tregear this was uttered solemnly so that silverbridge found himself debarred from making any flippant answer he could not altogether defend himself he had been quite justified he thought in changing his mind but he did not like to own that he had changed it so quickly  i think we had better not talk any more about it he said after pausing for a few moments after that nothing more was said between them on the subject  up in town silverbridge spent two or three days pleasantly enough while a thunderbolt was being prepared for him or rather in truth two thunderbolts during these days he was much with tregear and though he could not speak freely of his own matrimonial projects still he was brought round to give some sort of assent to the engagement between tregear and his sister this new position which his friend had won for himself did in some degree operate on his judgment it was not perhaps that he himself imagined that tregear as a member of parliament would be worthier but that he fancied that such would be the dukes feelings the duke had declared that tregear was nobody that could hardly be said of a man who had a seat in the house of commonscertainly could not be said by so staunch a politician as the duke  but had he known of those two thunderbolts he would not have enjoyed his time at the beargarden the thunderbolts fell upon him in the shape of two letters which reached his hands at the same time and were as follows      the bobtailed fox egham 18th december     my lord     at a meeting held in this house today in reference to the    hunting of the runnymede country it was proposed that the    management of the hounds should be taken out of the hands    of major tifto in consequence of certain conduct of which    it is alleged that he was guilty at the last doncaster    races     major tifto was present and requested that your    lordships opinion should be asked as to his guilt i do    not know myself that we are warranted in troubling your    lordship on the subject i am however commissioned by    the majority of the gentlemen who were present to ask    you whether you think that major tiftos conduct on that    occasion was of such a nature as to make him unfit to be    the depositary of that influence authority and intimacy    which ought to be at the command of a master of hounds     i feel myself bound to inform your lordship that the hunt    generally will be inclined to place great weight upon your    opinion but that it does not undertake to reinstate major    tifto even should your opinion be in his favour     i have the honour to be    my lord    your lordships most obedient servant     jeremiah jawstock     juniper lodge staines   mr jawstock when he had written this letter was proud of his own language but still felt that the application was a very lame one why ask any man for an opinion and tell him at the same time that his opinion might probably not be taken and yet no other alternative had been left to him the meeting had decided that the application should be made but mr jawstock was well aware that let the young lords answer be what it might the major would not be endured as master in the runnymede country mr jawstock felt that the passage in which he explained that a master of hounds should be a depositary of influence and intimacy was goodbut yet the application was lame very lame  lord silverbridge as he read it thought that it was very unfair it was a most disagreeable thunderbolt then he opened the second letter of which he well knew the handwriting it was from the major tiftos letters were very legible but the writing was cramped showing that the operation had been performed with difficulty silverbridge had hoped that he might never receive another epistle from his late partner the letter as follows had been drawn out for tifto in rough by the liverystable keeper in long acre      my dear lord silverbridge     i venture respectfully to appeal to your lordship for    an act of justice nobody has more of a trueborn    englishmans feeling of fair play between man and man than    your lordship and as you and me have been a good deal    together and your lordship ought to know me pretty well    i venture to appeal to your lordship for a good word     all that story from doncaster has got down into the    country where i am mfh nobody could have been more    sorry than me that your lordship dropped your money would    not i have been prouder than anything to have a horse in    my name win the race was it likely i should lame him    anyways i didnt and i dont think your lordship thinks    it was me of course your lordship and me is two nowbut    that dont alter the facts     what i want is your lordship to send me a line just    stating your lordships opinion that i didnt do it and    didnt have nothing to do with itwhich i didnt there    was a meeting at the bobtailed fox yesterday and the    gentlemen was all of one mind to go by what your lordship    would say i couldnt desire nothing fairer so i hope    your lordship will stand to me now and write something    that will pull me through     with all respects i beg to remain    your lordships most dutiful servant     t tifto   there was something in this letter which the major himself did not quite approve there was an absence of familiarity about it which annoyed him he would have liked to call upon his late partner to declare that a more honourable man than major tifto had never been known on the turf but he felt himself to be so far down in the world that it was not safe for him to hold an opinion of his own even against the liverystable keeper  silverbridge was for a time in doubt whether he should answer the letters at all and if so how he should answer them in regard to mr jawstock and the meeting at large he regarded the application as an impertinence but as to tifto himself he vacillated much between pity contempt and absolute condemnation everybody had assured him that the man had certainly been guilty the fact that he had made bets against their joint horsebets as to which he had said nothing till after the race was overhad been admitted by himself and yet it was possible that the man might not be such a rascal as to be unfit to manage the runnymede hounds having himself got rid of tifto he would have been glad that the poor wretch should have been left with his hunting honours but he did not think that he could write to his late partner any letter that would preserve those honours to him  at tregears advice he referred the matter to mr lupton mr lupton was of opinion that both the letters should be answered but that the answer to each should be very short there is a prejudice about the world just at present said mr lupton in favour of answering letters i dont see why i am to be subjected to an annoyance because another man has taken a liberty but it is better to submit to public opinion public opinion thinks that letters should be answered then mr lupton dictated the answers  lord silverbridge presents his compliments to mr jawstock and begs to say that he does not feel himself called upon to express any opinion as to major tiftos conduct at doncaster that was the first the second was rather less simple but not much longer      sir     i do not feel myself called upon to express any opinion    either to you or to others as to your conduct at    doncaster having received a letter on the subject from    mr jawstock i have written to him to this effect     your obedient servant     silverbridge     to t tifto esq    tallyho lodge   poor tifto when he got this very curt epistle was brokenhearted he did not dare to show it day after day he told the liverystable keeper that he had received no reply and at last asserted that his appeal had remained altogether unanswered even this he thought was better than acknowledging the rebuff which had reached him as regarded the meeting which had been heldand any further meetings which might be heldat the bobtailed fox he did not see the necessity as he explained to the liverystable keeper of acknowledging that he had written any letter to lord silverbridge  the letter to mr jawstock was of course brought forward another meeting at the bobtailed fox was convened but in the meantime hunting had been discontinued in the runnymede country the major with all his pluck with infinite cherry brandy could not do it men who had a few weeks since been on very friendly terms and who had called each other dick and harry when the squabble first began were now talking of punching each others heads special whips had been procured by men who intended to ride and special bludgeons by the young farmers who intended that nobody should ride as long as major tifto kept the hounds it was said that the police would interfere it was whispered that the hounds would be shotthough mr topps mr jawstock and others declared that no crime so heinous as that had ever been contemplated in the runnymede country  the difficulties were too many for poor tifto and the hounds were not brought out again under his influence  a second meeting was summoned and an invitation was sent to the major similar to that which he had before receivedbut on this occasion he did not appear nor were there many of the gentlemen down from london this second meeting might almost have been called select mr mahogany topps was there of course in the chair and mr jawstock took the place of honour and of difficulty on his right hand there was the young gentleman from bagshot who considered himself quite fit to take tiftos place if somebody else would pay the bills and settle the money and there was the sporting old parson from croppingham three or four other members of the hunt were present and perhaps halfadozen farmers ready to declare that major tifto should never be allowed to cross their fields again  but there was no opposition mr jawstock read the young lords note and declared that it was quite as much as he expected he considered that the note short as it was must be decisive major tifto in appealing to lord silverbridge had agreed to abide by his lordships answer and that answer was now before them mr jawstock ventured to propose that major tifto should be declared to be no longer master of the runnymede hounds the parson from croppingham seconded the proposition and major tifto was formally deposed     chapter lix  no one can tell what may come to pass   then lord silverbridge necessarily went down to matching knowing that he must meet mabel grex why should she have prolonged her visit no doubt it might be very pleasant for her to be his fathers guest at matching but she had been there above a month he could understand that his father should ask her to remain his father was still brooding over that foolish communication which had been made to him on the night of the dinner at the beargarden his father was still intending to take mabel to his arms as a daughterinlaw but lady mabel herself knew that it could not be so the whole truth had been told to her why should she remain at matching for the sake of being mixed up in a scene the acting of which could not fail to be disagreeable to her  he found the house very quiet and nearly empty mrs finn was there with the two girls and mr warburton had come back miss cassewary had gone to a brothers house other guests to make christmas merry there were none as he looked round at the large rooms he reflected that he himself was there only for a special purpose it was his duty to break the news of his intended marriage to his father as he stood before the fire thinking how best he might do this it occurred to him that a letter from a distance would have been the ready and simple way but then it had occurred to him also when at a distance that a declaration of his purpose face to face was the simplest and readiest way if you have to go headlong into the water you should take your plunge without hesitating so he told himself making up his mind that he would have it all out that evening  at dinner lady mabel sat next to his father and he could watch the special courtesy with which the duke treated the girl whom he was so desirous of introducing to his house silverbridge could not talk about the election at polpenno because all conversation about tregear was interdicted in the presence of his sister he could say nothing as to the runnymede hunt and the two thunderbolts which had fallen on him as major tifto was not a subject on which he could expatiate in the presence of his father he asked a few questions about the shooting and referred with great regret to his absence from the brake country  i am sure mr cassewary could spare you for another fortnight the duke said to his neighbour alluding to a visit which she now intended to make  if so he would have to spare me altogether said mabel for i must meet my father in london in the middle of january  could you not put it off to another year  you would think i had taken root and was growing at matching  of all our products you would be the most delightful and the most charmingand we would hope the most permanent said the courteous duke  after being here so long i need hardly say that i like matching better than any place in the world i suppose it is the contrast to grex  grex was a palace said the duke before a wall of this house had been built  grex is very old and very wildand very uncomfortable but i love it dearly matching is the very reverse of grex  not i hope in your affections  i did not mean that i think one likes a contrast but i must go say on the first of january to pick up miss cassewary  it was certain therefore that she was going on the first of january how would it be if he put off the telling of his story for yet another week till she should be gone then he looked around and bethought himself that the time would hang very heavy with him and his father would daily expect from him a declaration exactly opposed to that which he had to make he had no horses to ride as he went on listening he almost convinced himself that the proper thing to do would be to go back to london and thence write to his father he made no confession to his father on that night  on the next morning there was a heavy fall of snow but nevertheless everybody managed to go to church the duke as he looked at lady mabel tripping along over the swept paths in her furs and short petticoats and wellmade boots thought that his son was a lucky fellow to have the chance of winning the love of such a girl no remembrance of miss boncassen came across his mind as he saw them close together it was so important that silverbridge should marry and thus be kept from further follies and it was so momentous to the fortunes of the palliser family generally that he should marry well in thinking so it did not occur to him that the granddaughter of an american labourer might be offered to him a young lady fit to be duchess of omnium was not to be found everywhere but this girl he thought as he saw her walking briskly and strongly through the snow with every mark of health about her with every sign of high breeding very beautiful exquisite in manner gracious as a goddess was fit to be a duchess silverbridge at this moment was walking close to her sidein good looks in gracious manner in high breeding her equalin worldly gifts infinitely her superior surely she would not despise him silverbridge at the moment was expressing a hope that the sermon would not be very long  after lunch mabel came suddenly behind the chair on which silverbridge was sitting and asked him to take a walk with her was she not afraid of the snow perhaps you are she said laughing i do not mind it in the least when they were but a few yards from the front door she put her hand upon his arm and spoke to him as though she had arranged the walk with reference to that special question and now tell me all about frank  she had arranged everything she had a plan before her now and had determined in accordance with that plan that she would say nothing to disturb him on this occasion if she could succeed in bringing him into good humour with herself that should be sufficient for today now tell me everything about frank  frank is member of parliament for polpenno that is all  that is so like a man and so unlike a woman what did he say what did he do how did he look what did you say what did you do how did you look  we looked very miserable when we got wet through walking about all day in the rain  was that necessary  quite necessary we looked so mean and draggled that nobody would have voted for us only that poor mr carbottle looked meaner and more draggled  the duke says you made ever so many speeches  i should think i did it is very easy to make speeches down at a place like that tregear spoke like a book  he spoke well  awfully well he told them that all the good things that had ever been done in parliament had been carried by the tories he went back to pitts time and had it all at his fingers ends  and quite true  thats just what it was not it was all a crammer but it did as well  i am glad he is a member dont you think the duke will come round a little now  when tregear and the election had been sufficiently discussed they came by degrees to major tifto and the two thunderbolts silverbridge when he perceived that nothing was to be said about isabel boncassen or his own freedom in the matter of lovemaking was not sorry to have a friend from whom he could find sympathy for himself in his own troubles with some encouragement from mabel the whole story was told was it not a great impertinence she asked  it was an awful bore what could i say i was not going to pronounce judgment against the poor devil i daresay he was good enough for mr jawstock  but i suppose he did cheat horribly  i daresay he did a great many of them do cheat but what of that i was not bound to give him a character bad or good  certainly not  he had not been my servant it was such a letter ill show it you when we get inasking whether tifto was fit to be the depositary of the intimacy of the runnymede hunt and then tifs letteri almost wept over that  how could he have had the audacity to write at all  he said that him and me had been a good deal together unfortunately that was true even now i am not quite sure that he lamed the horse himself  everybody thinks he did percival says there is no doubt about it  percival knows nothing about it three of the gang ran away and he stood his ground thats about all we do know  what did you say to him  i had to address him as sir and beg him not to write to me any more of course they mean to get rid of him and i couldnt do him any good poor tifto upon the whole i think i hate jawstock worse than tifto  lady mabel was content with her afternoons work when they had been at matching before the polpenno election there had apparently been no friendship between themat any rate no confidential friendship miss boncassen had been there and he had had neither ears nor eyes for any one else but now something like the feeling of old days had been restored she had not done much towards her great objectbut then she had known that nothing could be done till he should again be in a good humour with her  on the sunday the monday and the tuesday they were again together in some of these interviews silverbridge described the polpenno people and told her how miss tregear had been reassured by his eloquence he also read to her the jawstock and tifto correspondence and was complimented by her as to his prudence and foresight to tell the truth i consulted mr lupton he said not liking to take credit for wisdom which had not been his own then they talked about grex and killancodlem about gerald and the shooting about marys love for tregear and about the work of the coming session on all these subjects they were comfortable and confidentialmiss boncassens name never having been as yet so much as mentioned  but still the real work was before her she had not hoped to bring him round to kneel once more at her feet by such gentle measures as these she had not dared to dream that he could in this way be taught to forget the past autumn and all its charms she knew well that there was something very difficult before her but if that difficult thing might be done at all these were the preparations which must be made for the doing of it  it was arranged that she should leave matching on saturday the first day of the new year things had gone on in the manner described till the thursday had come the duke had been impatient but had restrained himself he had seen that they were much together and that they were apparently friends he too told himself that there were two more days and that before the end of those days everything might be pleasantly settled  it had become a matter of course that silverbridge and mabel should walk together in the afternoon he himself had felt that there was danger in thisnot danger that he should be untrue to isabel but that he should make others think that he was true to mabel but he excused himself on the plea that he and mabel had been intimate friendswere still intimate friends and that she was going away in a day or two mary who watched it all was sure that misery was being prepared for someone she was aware that by this time her father was anxious to welcome mabel as his daughterinlaw she strongly suspected that something had been said between her father and her brother on the subject but then she had isabel boncassens direct assurance that silverbridge was engaged to her now when isabels back was turned silverbridge and mabel were always together  on the thursday after lunch they were again out together it had become so much a habit that the walk repeated itself without an effort it had been part of mabels scheme that it should be so during all this morning she had been thinking of her scheme it was all but hopeless so much she had declared to herself but forlorn hopes do sometimes end in splendid triumphs that which she might gain was so much and what could she lose the sweet bloom of her maiden shame that she told herself with bitterest inward tears was already gone from her frank tregear at any rate knew where her heart had been given frank tregear knew that having lost her heart to one man she was anxious to marry another he knew that she was willing to accept the coronet of a duchess as her consolation that bloom of her maiden shame of which she quite understood the sweetness the charm the valuewas gone when she had brought herself to such a state that any human being should know that loving one man she should be willing to marry another the sweet treasure was gone from her its aroma was fled it behoved her now to be ambitious cautiousand if possible successful  when first she had so resolved success seemed to be easily within her reach of all the golden youths that crossed her path no one was so pleasant to her eye to her ear to her feelings generally as this dukes young heir there was a coming manliness about him which she likedand she liked even the slight want of present manliness putting aside frank tregear she could go nearer to loving him than any other man she had ever seen with him she would not be turned from her duties by disgust by dislike or dismay she could even think that the time would come when she might really love him then she had all but succeeded and she might have succeeded altogether had she been but a little more prudent but she had allowed her great prize to escape from her fingers  but the prize was not yet utterly beyond her grasp to recover itto recover even the smallest chance of recovering it there would be need of great exertion she must be bold sudden unwomanlikeand yet with such display of womans charm that he at least should discover no want she must be false but false with such perfect deceit that he must regard her as a pearl of truth if anything could lure him back it must be his conviction of her passionate love and she must be strongso strong as to overcome not only his weakness but all that was strong in him she knew that he did love that other girland she must overcome even that and to do this she must prostrate herself at his feetas since the world began it has been mans province to prostrate himself at the feet of the woman he loves  to do this she must indeed bid adieu to the sweet bloom of her maiden shame but had she not done so already when by the side of the brook at killancodlem she had declared to him plainly enough her despair at hearing that he loved that other girl though she were to grovel at his feet she could not speak more plainly than she had spoken then she could not tell her story now more plainly than she had done then butthough the chances were smallperchance she might tell it more effectually  perhaps this will be our last walk she said come down to the seat over the river  why should it be the last youll be here tomorrow  there are so many slips in such things she said laughing you may get a letter from your constituents that will want all the day to answer or your father may have a political communication to make to me but at any rate come so they went to the seat  it was a spot in the park from whence there was a distant view over many lands and low beneath the bench which stood on the edge of a steep bank ran a stream which made a sweeping bend in this place so that a reach of the little river might be seen both to the right and to the left though the sun was shining the snow under their feet was hard with frost it was an air such as one sometimes finds in england and often in america though the cold was very perceptible though water in the shade was freezing at this moment there was no feeling of damp no sense of bitter wind it was a sweet and jocund air such as would make young people prone to run and skip you are not going to sit down with all the snow on the bench said silverbridge  on their way thither she had not said a word that would disturb him she had spoken to him of the coming session and had managed to display to him the interest which she took in his parliamentary career in doing this she had flattered him to the top of his bent if he would return to his fathers politics then would she too become a renegade would he speak in the next session she hoped he would speak and if he did might she be there to hear him she was cautious not to say a word of frank tregear understanding something of that strange jealousy which could exist even when he who was jealous did not love the woman who caused it  no she said i do not think we can sit but still i like to be here with you all that some day will be your own then she stretched her hands out to the far view  some of it i suppose i dont think it is all ours as for that if we cared for extent of acres one ought to go to barsetshire  is that larger  twice as large i believe and yet none of the family like being there the rental is very well  and the borough she said leaning on his arm and looking up into his face what a happy fellow you ought to be  bar tiftoand mr jawstock  you have got rid of tifto and all those troubles very easily  thanks to the governor  yes indeed i do love your father so dearly  so do irather  may i tell you something about him as she asked the question she was standing very close to him leaning upon his arm with her left hand crossed upon her right had others been there of course she would not have stood in such a guise she knew thatand he knew it too of course there was something in it of declared affectionof that kind of love which most of us have been happy enough to give and receive without intending to show more than true friendship will allow at special moments  dont tell me anything about him i shant like to hear  ahthat is so hard to know i wish you would like to hear it  what can it be  i cannot tell you now  why not and why did you offer  because oh silverbridge  he certainly as yet did not understand it it had never occurred to him that she would know what were his fathers wishes perhaps he was slow of comprehension as he urged her to tell him what this was about his father what can you tell me about him that i should not like to hear  you do not know oh silverbridge i think you know then there came upon him a glimmering of the truth you do know and she stood apart looking him full in the face  i do not know what you can have to tell me  nono it is not i that should tell you but yet it is so silverbridge what did you say to me when you came to me that morning in the square  what did i say  was i not entitled to think that youloved me to this he had nothing to reply but stood before her silent and frowning think of it silverbridge was it not so and because i did not at once tell you all the truth because i did not there say that my heart was all yours were you right to leave me  you only laughed at me  nono no i never laughed at you how could i laugh when you were all the world to me ask frankhe knew ask miss cassshe knew and can you say you did not know you you you yourself can any girl suppose that such words as these are to mean nothing when they have been spoken you knew i loved you  nono  you must have known it i will never believe but that you knew it why should your father be so sure of it  he never was sure of it  yes silverbridge yes there is not one in the house who does not see that he treats me as though he expected me to be his sons wife do you not know that he wishes it he fain would not have answered this but she paused for his answer and then repeated her question do you not know that he wishes it  i think he does said silverbridge but it can never be so  oh silverbridgeoh my loved one do not say that to me do not kill me at once now she placed her hands one on each arm as she stood opposite to him and looked up into his face you said you loved me once why do you desert me now have you a right to treat me like thatwhen i tell you that you have all my heart the tears were now streaming down her face and they were not counterfeit tears  you know he said submitting to her hands but not lifting his arm to embrace her  what do i know  that i have given all i have to give to another as he said this he looked away sternly over her shoulder to the distance  that american girl she exclaimed starting back with some show of sternness also on her brow  yesthat american girl said silverbridge  then she recovered herself immediately indignation natural indignation would not serve her turn in the present emergency you know that cannot be you ought to know it what will your father say you have not dared to tell him that is so natural she added trying to appease his frown how possibly can it be told to him i will not say a word against her  no do not do that  but there are fitnesses of things which such a one as you cannot disregard without preparing for yourself a whole life of repentance  look here mabel  well  i will tell you the truth  well  i would sooner lose allthe rank i have the rank that i am to have all these lands that you have been looking on my fathers wealth my seat in parliamenteverything that fortune has done for mei would give them all up sooner than lose her now at any rate he was a man she was sure of that now this was more very much more not only than she had expected from him but more than she had thought it possible that his character should have produced  his strength reduced her to weakness and i am nothing she said  yes indeed you are lady mabel grexwhom all women envy and whom all men honour  the poorest wretch this day under the sun  do not say that you should take shame to say that  i do take shameand i do say it sir do you not feel what you owe me do you not know that you have made me the wretch i am how did you dare to talk to me as you did talk when you were in london you tell me that i am lady mabel grexand yet you come to me with a lie on your lipswith such a lie as that you must have taken me for some nursemaid on whom you had condescended to cast your eye it cannot be that even you should have dared to treat lady mabel grex after such a fashion as that and now you have cast your eye on this other girl you can never marry her  i shall endeavour to do so  you can never marry her she said stamping her foot she had now lost all the caution which she had taught herself for the prosecution of her schemeall the care with which she had burdened herself now she was natural enough noyou can never marry her you could not show yourself after it in your clubs or in parliament or in the world come home do you say no i will not go to your home it is not my home coldof course i am coldcold through to the heart  i cannot leave you alone here he said for she had now turned from him and was walking with hurried steps and short turns on the edge of the bank which at this place was almost a precipice  you have left meutterly in the coldmore desolate than i am here even though i should spend the night among the trees but i will go back and will tell your father everything if my father were other than he isif my brother were better to me you would not have done this  if you had a legion of brothers it would have been the same he said turning sharp upon her  they walked on together but without a word till the house was in sight then she looked round at him and stopped him on the path as she caught his eye silverbridge she said  lady mabel  call me mabel at any rate call me mabel if i have said anything to offend youi beg your pardon  i am not offendedbut unhappy  if you are unhappy what must i be what have i to look forward to give me your hand and say that we are friends  certainly we are friends he said as he gave her his hand  who can tell what may come to pass to this he would make no answer as it seemed to imply that some division between himself and isabel boncassen might possibly come to pass you will not tell any one that i love you  i tell such a thing as that  but never forget it yourself no one can tell what may come to pass  lady mabel at once went up to her room she had played her scene but was well aware that she had played it altogether unsuccessfully     chapter lx  lord gerald in further trouble   when silverbridge got back to the house he was by no means well pleased with himself in the first place he was unhappy to think that mabel was unhappy and that he had made her so and then she had told him that he would not have dared to have acted as he had done but that her father and her brother were careless to defend her he had replied fiercely that a legion of brothers ready to act on her behalf would not have altered his conduct but not the less did he feel that he had behaved badly to her it could not now be altered he could not now be untrue to isabel but certainly he had said a word or two to mabel which he could not remember without regret he had not thought that a word from him could have been so powerful now when that word was recalled to his memory by the girl to whom it had been spoken he could not quite acquit himself  and mabel had declared to him that she would at once appeal to his father there was an absurdity in this at which he could not but smilethat the girl should complain to his father because he would not marry her but even in doing this she might cause him great vexation he could not bring himself to ask her not to tell her story to the duke he must take all that as it might come  while he was thinking of all this in his own room a servant brought him two letters from the first which he opened he soon perceived that it contained an account of more troubles it was from his brother gerald and was written from auld reikie the name of a house in scotland belonging to lord nidderdales people      dear silver     i have got into a most awful scrape that fellow percival    is here and dolly longstaff and nidderdale and    popplecourt and jack hindes and perry who is in the    coldstreams and one or two more and there has been a lot    of cards and i have lost ever so much money i wouldnt    mind it so much but percival has won it alla fellow    i hate and now i owe himthree thousand four hundred    pounds he has just told me he is hard up and that he    wants the money before the week is over he cant be hard    up because he has won from everybodybut of course i had    to tell him that i would pay him     can you help me of course i know that i have been a fool    percival knows what he is about and plays regularly for    money when i began i didnt think that i could lose above    twenty or thirty pounds but it got on from one thing to    another and when i woke this morning i felt i didnt know    what to do with myself you cant think how the luck went    against me everybody says that they never saw such cards     and now do tell me how i am to get out of it could you    manage it with mr moreton of course i will make it all    right with you some day moreton always lets you have    whatever you want but perhaps you couldnt do this    without letting the governor know i would rather anything    than that there is some money owing at oxford also which    of course he must know     i was thinking that perhaps i might get it from some of    those fellows in london there are people called comfort    and criball who let men have money constantly i know two    or three up at oxford who have had it from them of course    i couldnt go to them as you could do for in spite of    what the governor said to us up in london one day there    is nothing that must come to me but you could do anything    in that way and of course i would stand to it     i know you wont throw me over because you always have    been such a brick but above all things dont tell the    governor percival is such a nasty fellow otherwise i    shouldnt mind it he spoke this morning as though i was    treating him badlythough the money was only lost last    night and he looked at me in a way that made me long to    kick him i told him not to flurry himself and that he    should have his money if he speaks to me like that again    i will kick him     i will be at matching as soon as possible but i cannot go    till this is settled nidmeaning lord nidderdaleis a    brick     your affectionate brother     gerald   the other was from nidderdale and referred to the same subject      dear silverbridge     here has been a terrible nuisance last night some of    the men got to playing cards and gerald lost a terribly    large sum to percival i did all that i could to stop it    because i saw that percival was going in for a big thing    i fancy that he got as much from dolly longstaff as he did    from geraldbut it wont matter much to dolly or if it    does nobody cares gerald told me he was writing to you    about it so i am not betraying him     what is to be done of course percival is behaving badly    he always does i cant turn him out of the house and he    seems to intend to stick to gerald till he has got the    money he has taken a cheque from dolly dated two months    hence i am in an awful funk for fear gerald should pitch    into him he will in a minute if anything rough is said    to him i suppose the straightest thing would be to go to    the duke at once but gerald wont hear of it i hope you    wont think me wrong to tell you if i could help him i    would you know what a bad doctor i am for that sort of    complaint     yours always     nidderdale   the dinnerbell had rung before silverbridge had come to an end of thinking of this new vexation and he had not as yet made up his mind what he had better do for his brother there was one thing as to which he was determinedthat it should not be done by him nor if he could prevent it by gerald there should be no dealings with comfort and criball the duke had succeeded at any rate in filling his sons mind with a horror of aid of that sort nidderdale had suggested that the straightest thing would be to go direct to the duke that no doubt would be straightand efficacious the duke would not have allowed a boy of his to be a debtor to lord percival for a day let the debt have been contracted how it might but gerald had declared against this courseand silverbridge himself would have been most unwilling to adopt it how could he have told that story to the duke while there was that other infinitely more important story of his own which must be told at once  in the midst of all these troubles he went down to dinner lady mabel said the duke tells me that you two have been to see sir guys lookout  she was standing close to the duke and whispered a word into his ear you said you would call me mabel  yes sir said silverbridge and i have made up my mind that sir guy never stayed there very long in winter it was awfully cold  i had furs on said mabel what a lovely spot it is even in this weather then dinner was announced she had not been cold she could still feel the tingling heat of her blood as she had implored him to love her  silverbridge felt that he must write to his brother by the first post the communication was of a nature that would bear no delay if his hands had been free he would himself have gone off to auld reikie at last he made up his mind the first letter he wrote was neither to nidderdale nor to gerald but to lord percival himself      dear percival     gerald writes me word that he has lost to you at cards    £3400 and he wants me to get him the money it is a    terrible nuisance and he has been an ass but of course    i shall stand to him for anything he wants i havent    got £3400 in my pocket and i dont know any one who    hasthat is among our set but i send you my iou for    the amount and will promise to get you the money in two    months i suppose that will be sufficient and that you    will not bother gerald any more about it     yours truly     silverbridge   then he copied this letter and enclosed the copy in another which he wrote to his brother      dear gerald     what an ass you have been but i dont suppose you are    worse than i was at doncaster i will have nothing to do    with such people as comfort and criball that is the sure    way to the d as for telling moreton that is only    a polite and roundabout way of telling the governor he    would immediately ask the governor what was to be done    you will see what i have done of course i must tell the    governor before the end of february as i cannot get the    money in any other way but that i will do it does seem    hard upon him not that the money will hurt him much but    that he would so like to have a steadygoing son     i suppose percival wont make any bother about the iou    hell be a fool if he does i wouldnt kick him if i were    youunless he says anything very bad you would be sure    to come to grief somehow he is a beast     your affectionate brother     silverbridge   with these letters that special grief was removed from his mind for awhile looking over the dark river of possible trouble which seemed to run between the present moment and the time at which the money must be procured he thought that he had driven off this calamity of geralds to infinite distance but into that dark river he must now plunge almost at once on the next day he managed so that there should be no walk with mabel in the evening he could see that the duke was uneasybut not a word was said to him on the following morning lady mabel took her departure when she went from the door both the duke and silverbridge were there to bid her farewell she smiled and was as gracious as though everything had gone according to her hearts delight dear duke i am so obliged to you for your kindness she said as she put up her cheek for him to kiss then she gave her hand to silverbridge of course you will come and see me in town and she smiled upon them allhaving courage enough to keep down all her sufferings  come in here a moment silverbridge said the father as they returned into the house together how is it now between you and her     chapter lxi  bone of my bone   how is it now between you and her that was the question which the duke put to his son as soon as he had closed the door of the study lady mabel had just been dismissed from the front door on her journey and there could be no doubt as to the her intended no such question would have been asked had not silverbridge himself declared to his father his purpose of making lady mabel his wife on that subject the duke without such authority would not have interfered but he had been consulted had acceded and had encouraged the idea by excessive liberality on his part he had never dropped it out of his mind for a moment but when he found that the girl was leaving his house without any explanation then he became restless and inquisitive  they say that perfect love casteth out fear if it be so the love of children to their parents is seldom altogether perfectand perhaps had better not be quite perfect with this young man it was not that he feared anything which his father could do to him that he believed that in consequence of the declaration which he had to make his comforts and pleasures would be curtailed or his independence diminished he knew his father too well to dread such punishment but he feared that he would make his father unhappy and he was conscious that he had so often sinned in that way he had stumbled so frequently though in action he would so often be thoughtlessyet he understood perfectly the effect which had been produced on his fathers mind by his conduct he had it at heart to be good to the governor to gratify that most loving of all possible friends who as he knew well was always thinking of his welfare and yet he never had been good to the governornor had geraldand to all this was added his sisters determined perversity it was thus he feared his father  he paused for a moment while the duke stood with his back to the fire looking at him im afraid that it is all over sir he said  all over  i am afraid so  why is it all over has she refused you  well sirit isnt quite that then he paused again it was so difficult to begin about isabel boncassen  i am sorry for that said the duke almost hesitating very sorry you will understand i hope that i should make no inquiry in such a matter unless i had felt myself warranted in doing so by what you had yourself told me in london  i understand all that  i have been very anxious about it and have even gone so far as to make some preparations for what i had hoped would be your early marriage  preparations exclaimed silverbridge thinking of church bells bride cake and wedding presents  as to the property i am so anxious that you should enjoy all the settled independence which can belong to an english gentleman i never plough or sow i know no more of sheep and bulls than of the extinct animals of earlier ages i would not have it so with you i would fain see you surrounded by those things which ought to interest a nobleman in this country why is it all over with lady mabel grex  the young man looked imploringly at his father as though earnestly begging that nothing more might be said about mabel i had changed my mind before i found out that she was really in love with me he could not say that he could not hint that he might still have mabel if he would the only thing for him was to tell everything about isabel boncassen he felt that in doing this he must begin with himself i have rather changed my mind sir he said since we were walking together in london that night  have you quarrelled with lady mabel  oh dear no i am very fond of mabelonly not just like that  not just like what  i had better tell the whole truth at once  certainly tell the truth silverbridge i cannot say that you are bound in duty to tell the whole truth even to your father in such a matter  but i mean to tell you everything mabel did not seem to care for me muchin london and then i saw someonesomeone i liked better then he stopped but as the duke did not ask any questions he plunged on it was miss boncassen  miss boncassen  yes sir said silverbridge with a little access of decision  the american young lady  yes sir  do you know anything of her family  i think i know all about her family it is not much in the way offamily  you have not spoken to her about it  yes siri have settled it all with her on condition  settled it with her that she is to be your wife  yes siron condition that you will approve  did you go to her silverbridge with such a stipulation as that  it was not like that  how was it then  she stipulated she will marry me if you will consent  it was she then who thought of my wishes and my feelingnot you  i knew that i loved her what is a man to do when he feels like that of course i meant to tell you the duke was now looking very black i thought you liked her sir  liked her i did like her i do like her what has that to do with it do you think i like none but those with whom i should think it fitting to ally myself in marriage is there to be no duty in such matters no restraint no feeling of what is due to your own name and to others who bear it the lad out there who is sweeping the walks can marry the first girl that pleases his eye if she will take him perhaps his lot is the happier because he owns such liberty have you the same freedom  i suppose i haveby law  do you recognise no duty but what the laws impose upon you should you be disposed to eat and drink in bestial excess because the laws would not hinder you should you lie and sleep all the day the law would say nothing should you neglect every duty which your position imposes on you the law could not interfere to such a one as you the law can be no guide you should so live as not to come near the lawor to have the law to come near to you from all evil against which the law bars you you should be barred at an infinite distance by honour by conscience and nobility does the law require patriotism philanthropy selfabnegation public service purity of purpose devotion to the needs of others who have been placed in the world below you the law is a great thingbecause men are poor and weak and bad and it is great because where it exists in its strength no tyrant can be above it but between you and me there should be no mention of law as the guide of conduct speak to me of honour of duty and of nobility and tell me what they require of you  silverbridge listened in silence and with something of true admiration in his heart but he felt the strong necessity of declaring his own convictions on one special point here at once in this new crisis of the conversation that accident in regard to the colour of the deans lodge had stood in the way of his logical studiesso that he was unable to put his argument into proper shape but there belonged to him a certain natural astuteness which told him that he must put in his rejoinder at this particular point i think i am bound in honour and in duty to marry miss boncassen he said and if i understand what you mean by nobility just as much  because you have promised  not only for that i have promised and therefore i am bound she haswell she has said that she loves me and therefore of course i am bound but it is not only that  what do you mean  i suppose a man ought to marry the woman he lovesif he can get her  no no not so not always so do you think that love is a passion that cannot be withstood  but here we are both of one mind sir when i saw how you seemed to take to her  take to her can i not interest myself in human beings without wishing to make them flesh of my flesh bone of my bone what am i to think of you it was but the other day that all that you are now telling me of miss boncassen you were telling me of lady mabel grex here poor silverbridge bit his lips and shook his head and looked down upon the ground this was the weak part of his case he could not tell his father the whole story about mabelthat she had coyed his love so that he had been justified in thinking himself free from any claim in that direction when he had encountered the infinitely sweeter charms of isabel boncassen you are weak as water said the unhappy father  i am not weak in this  did you not say exactly the same about lady mabel  there was a pause so that he was driven to reply i found her as i thought indifferent and theni changed my mind  indifferent what does she think about it now does she know of this how does it stand between you two at the present moment  she knows that i am engaged tomiss boncassen  does she approve of it  why should i ask her sir i have not asked her  then why did you tell her she could not but have spoken her mind when you told her there must have been much between you when this was talked of  the unfortunate young man was obliged to take some time before he could answer this appeal he had to own that his father had some justice on his side but at the same time he could reveal nothing of mabels secret i told her because we were friends i did not ask her approval but she did disapprove she thought that your son should not marry an american girl without family  of course she would feel that  now i have told you what she said and i hope you will ask me no further questions about her i cannot make lady mabel my wifethough for the matter of that i ought not to presume that she would take me if i wished it i had intended to ask you today to consent to my marriage with miss boncassen  i cannot give you my consent  then i am very unhappy  how can i believe as to your unhappiness when you would have said the same about lady mabel grex a few weeks ago  nearly eight months said silverbridge  what is the difference it is not the time but the disposition of the man i cannot give you my consent the young lady sees it in the right light and that will make your escape easy  i do not want to escape  she has indicated the cause which will separate you  i will not be separated from her said silverbridge who was beginning to feel that he was subjugated to tyranny if he chose to marry isabel no one could have a right to hinder him  i can only hope that you will think better of it and that when next you speak to me on that or any other subject you will answer me with less arrogance  this rebuke was terrible to the son whose mind at the present moment was filled with two ideas that of constancy to isabel boncassen and then of respect and affection for his father indeed sir he said i am not arrogant and if i have answered improperly i beg your pardon but my mind is made up about this and i thought you had better know how it is  i do not see that i can say anything else to you now  i think of going to harrington this afternoon then the duke with further very visible annoyance asked where harrington was it was explained that harrington was lord chilterns seat lord chiltern being the master of the brake houndsthat it was his sons purpose to remain six weeks among the brake hounds but that he should stay only a day or two with lord chiltern then it appeared that silverbridge intended to put himself up at a hunting inn in the neighbourhood and the duke did not at all like the plan that his son should choose to live at an inn when the comforts of an english country house were open to him was distasteful and almost offensive to the duke and the matter was not improved when he was made to understand that all this was to be done for the sake of hunting there had been the shooting in scotland then the racingah alas yesthe racing and the betting at doncaster then the shooting at matching had been made to appear to be the chief reason why he himself had been living in his own house and now his son was going away to live at an inn in order that more time might be devoted to hunting why cant you hunt here at home if you must hunt  it is all woodland said silverbridge  i thought you wanted woods lord chiltern is always troubling me about trumpington wood  this breeze about the hunting enabled the son to escape without any further allusion to miss boncassen he did escape and proceeded to turn over in his mind all that had been said his tale had been told a great burden was thus taken off his shoulders he could tell isabel so much and thus free himself from the suspicion of having been afraid to declare his purpose she should know what he had done and should be made to understand that he had been firm he had he thought been very firm and gave himself some credit on that head his father no doubt had been firm too but that he had expected his father had said much all that about honour and duty had been very good but this was certainthat when a young man had promised a young woman he ought to keep his word and he thought that there were certain changes going on in the management of the world which his father did not quite understand fathers never do quite understand the changes which are manifest to their sons some years ago it might have been improper that an american girl should be elevated to the rank of an english duchess but now all that was altered  the duke spent the rest of the day alone and was not happy in his solitude all that silverbridge had told him was sad to him he had taught himself to think that he could love lady mabel as an affectionate father wishes to love his sons wife he had set himself to wish to like her and had been successful being most anxious that his son should marry he had prepared himself to be more than ordinarily liberalto be in every way gracious his children were now everything to him and among his children his son and heir was the chief from the moment in which he had heard from silverbridge that lady mabel was chosen he had given himself up to considering how he might best promote their interestshow he might best enable them to live with that dignity and splendour which he himself had unwisely despised that the son who was to come after him should be worthy of the place assigned to his name had been of personal objects the nearest to his heart there had been failures but still there had been left room for hope the boy had been unfortunate at etonbut how many unfortunate boys had become great men he had disgraced himself by his folly at collegebut though some lads will be men at twenty others are then little more than children the fruit that ripens the soonest is seldom the best then had come tifto and the racing mania nothing could be worse than tifto and racehorses but from that evil silverbridge had seemed to be made free by the very disgust which the vileness of the circumstance had produced perhaps tifto driving a nail into his horses foot had on the whole been serviceable that apostasy from the political creed of the pallisers had been a blowmuch more felt than the loss of the seventy thousand poundsbut even under that blow he had consoled himself by thinking that a conservative patriotic nobleman may serve his countryeven as a conservative in the midst of this he had felt that the surest resource for his son against evil would be in an early marriage if he would marry becomingly then might everything still be made pleasant if his son would marry becomingly nothing which a father could do should be wanting to add splendour and dignity to his sons life  in thinking of all this he had by no means regarded his own mode of life with favour he knew how jejune his life had beenhow devoid of other interests than that of the public service to which he had devoted himself he was thinking of this when he told his son that he had neither ploughed and sowed or been the owner of sheep or oxen he often thought of this when he heard those around him talking of the sports which though he condemned them as the employments of a life he now regarded wistfully hopelessly as far as he himself was concerned as proper recreations for a man of wealth silverbridge should have it all if he could arrange it the one thing necessary was a fitting wifeand the fitting wife had been absolutely chosen by silverbridge himself  it may be conceived therefore that he was again unhappy he had already been driven to acknowledge that these children of histhoughtless restless though they seemed to bestill had a will of their own in all which how like they were to their mother with her however his word though it might be resisted had never lost its authority when he had declared that a thing should not be done she had never persisted in saying that she would do it but with his children it was otherwise what power had he over silverbridgeor for the matter of that even over his daughter they had only to be firm and he knew that he must be conquered  i thought that you liked her silverbridge had said to him how utterly unconscious thought the duke must the young man have been of all that his position required of him when he used such an argument liked her he did like her she was clever accomplished beautiful wellmanneredas far as he knew endowed with all good qualities would not many an old roman have said as much for some favourite greek slavefor some freedman whom he would admit to his very heart but what old roman ever dreamed of giving his daughter to the son of a greek bondsman had he done so what would have become of the name of a roman citizen and was it not his duty to fortify and maintain that higher smaller more precious pinnacle of rank on which fortune had placed him and his children  like her yes he liked her certainly he had by no means always found that he best liked the companionship of his own order he had liked to feel around him the free battle of the house of commons he liked the power of attack and defence in carrying on which an english politician cares nothing for rank he liked to remember that the son of any tradesman might by his own merits become a peer of parliament he would have liked to think that his son should share all these tastes with him yeshe liked isabel boncassen but how different was that liking from a desire that she should be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh     chapter lxii  the brake country   what does your father mean to do about trumpington wood that was the first word from lord chiltern after he had shaken hands with his guest  isnt it all right yet  all right no how can a wood like that be all right without a man about the place who knows anything of the nature of a fox in your grandfathers time  my greatuncle you mean  wellyour greatunclethey used to trap the foxes there there was a fellow named fothergill who used to come there for shooting now it is worse than ever nobody shoots there because there is nothing to shoot there isnt a keeper every scamp is allowed to go where he pleases and of course there isnt a fox in the whole place my huntsman laughs at me when i ask him to draw it as the indignant master of the brake hounds said this the very fire flashed from his eyes  my dear said lady chiltern expostulating lord silverbridge hasnt been in the house above half an hour  what does that matter when a thing has to be said it had better be said at once  phineas finn was staying at harrington with his intimate friends the chilterns as were also a certain mr and mrs maule both of whom were addicted to huntingthe lady whose maiden name had been palliser being a cousin to lord silverbridge on that day also a certain mr and mrs spooner dined at harrington mr and mrs spooner were both very much given to hunting as seemed to be necessarily the case with everybody admitted to that house mr spooner was a gentleman who might be on the wrong side of fifty with a red nose very vigorous and submissive in regard to all things but portwine his wife was perhaps something more than half his age a stout hardriding handsome woman she had been the penniless daughter of a retired officerbut yet had managed to ride on whatever animal any one would lend her then mr spooner who had for many years been part and parcel of the brake hunt and who was much in want of a wife had luckily for her cast his eyes upon miss leatherside it was thought that upon the whole she made him a good wife she hunted four days a week and he could afford to keep horses for her she never flirted and wanted no one to open gates tom spooner himself was not always so forward as he used to be but his wife was always there and would tell him all that he did not see himself and she was a good housewife taking care that nothing should be spent lavishly except upon the stable of him too and of his health she was careful never scrupling to say a word in season when he was likely to hurt himself either among the fences or among the decanters you aint so young as you were tom dont think of doing it this she would say to him with a loud voice when she would find him pausing at a fence then she would hop over herself and he would go round she was quite a providence to him as her mother old mrs leatherside would say  she was hardly the woman that one would have expected to meet as a friend in the drawingroom of lady chiltern lord chiltern was perhaps a little rough but lady chiltern was all that a mother a wife and a lady ought to be she probably felt that some little apology ought to be made for mrs spooner i hope you like hunting she said to silverbridge  best of all things said he enthusiastically  because you know this is castle nimrod in which nothing is allowed to interfere with the one great business of life  its like that is it  quite like that lord chiltern has taken up hunting as his duty in life and he does it with his might and main not to have a good day is a misery to himnot for himself but because he feels that he is responsible we had one blank day last year and i thought that he never would recover it it was that unfortunate trumpington wood  how he will hate me  not if you will praise the hounds judiciously and then there is a mr spooner coming here tonight he is the firstlieutenant he understands all about the foxes and all about the farmers he has got a wife  does she understand anything  she understands him she is coming too they have not been married long and he never goes anywhere without her  does she ride  well yes i never go out myself now because i have so much of it all at home but i fancy she does ride a good deal she will talk hunting too if chiltern were to leave the country i think they ought to make her master perhaps youll think her rather odd but really she is a very good woman  i am sure i shall like her  i hope you will you know mr finn he is here he and my husband are very old friends and adelaide maule is your cousin she hunts too and so does mr mauleonly not quite so energetically i think that is all we shall have  immediately after that all the guests came in at once and a discussion was heard as they were passing through the hall nothat wasnt it said mrs spooner loudly i dont care what dick said dick rabbit was the first whip and seemed to have been much exercised with the matter now under dispute the fox never went into grobby gorse at all i was there and saw sappho give him a line down the bank  i think he must have gone into the gorse my dear said her husband the earth was open you know  i tell you she didnt you werent there and you cant know im sure it was a vixen by her running we ought to have killed that fox my lord then mrs spooner made her obeisance to her hostess perhaps she was rather slow in doing this but the greatness of the subject had been the cause these are matters so important that the ordinary civilities of the world should not stand in their way  what do you say chiltern asked the husband  i say that mrs spooner isnt very often wrong and that dick rabbit isnt very often right about a fox  it was a pretty run said phineas  just thirtyfour minutes said mr spooner  thirtytwo up to grobby gorse asserted mrs spooner the hounds never hunted a yard after that dick hurried them into the gorse and the old hound wouldnt stick to his line when she found that no one believed her  this was on a monday evening and the brake hounds went out generally five days a week youll hunt tomorrow i suppose lady chiltern said to silverbridge  i hope so  you must hunt tomorrow indeed there is nothing else to do chiltern has taken such a dislike to shootingmen that he wont shoot pheasants himself we dont hunt on wednesdays or sundays and then everybody lies in bed here is mr maule he lies in bed on other mornings as well and spends the rest of his day riding about the country looking for the hounds  does he ever find them  what did become of you all today said mr maule as he took his place at the dinnertable you cant have drawn any of the coverts regularly  then we found our foxes without drawing them said the master  we chopped one at bromleys said mr spooner  i went there  then you ought to have known better said mrs spooner when a man loses the hounds in that country he ought to go direct to bracketts wood if you had come on to bracketts youd have seen as good a thirtytwo minutes as ever you wished to ride when the ladies went out of the room mrs spooner gave a parting word of advice to her husband and to the host now tom dont you drink portwine lord chiltern look after him and dont let him have portwine  then there began an altogether different phase of hunting conversation as long as the ladies were there it was all very well to talk of hunting as an amusement good sport a thirty minutes or so the delight of having a friend in a ditch or the glory of a stiffbuilt rail were fitting subjects for a lighter hour but now the business of the night was to begin the difficulties the enmities the precautions the resolutions the resources of the brake hunt were to be discussed and from thence the conversation of these devotees strayed away to the perils at large to which hunting in these modern days is subjectednot the perils of broken necks and crushed ribs which can be reduced to an average and so an end made of that small matter but the perils from outsiders the perils from newfangled prejudices the perils from more modern sports the perils from overcultivation the perils from extended population the perils from increasing railroads the perils from literary ignorances the perils from intruding cads the perils from indifferent magnatesthe duke of omnium for instanceand that peril of perils the peril of decrease of funds and increase of expenditure the jaunty gentleman who puts on his dainty breeches and his pair of boots and on his single horse rides out on a pleasant morning to some neighbouring meet thinking himself a sportsman has but a faint idea of the troubles which a few staunch workmen endure in order that he may not be made to think that his boots and his breeches and his horse have been in vain  a word or two further was at first said about that unfortunate wood for which silverbridge at the present felt himself responsible finn said that he was sure the duke would look to it if silverbridge would mention it chiltern simply groaned silverbridge said nothing remembering how many troubles he had on hand at this moment then by degrees their solicitude worked itself round to the cares of a neighbouring hunt the a r u had lost their master one captain glomax was going and the county had been driven to the necessity of advertising for a successor when hunting comes to that said lord chiltern one begins to think that it is in a bad way it may always be observed that when huntingmen speak seriously of their sport they speak despondingly everything is going wrong perhaps the same thing may be remarked in other pursuits farmers are generally on the verge of ruin trade is always bad the church is in danger the house of lords isnt worth a dozen years purchase the throne totters  an itinerant master with a carpetbag never can carry on a country said mr spooner  you ought really to have a gentleman of property in the county said lord chiltern in a selfdeprecating tone his fathers acres lay elsewhere  it should be someone who has a real stake in the country replied mr spoonerwhom the farmers can respect glomax understood hunting no doubt but the farmers didnt care for him if you dont have the farmers with you you cant have hunting then he filled a glass of port  if you dont approve of glomax what do you think of a man like major tifto asked mr maule  that was in the runnymede said spooner contemptuously  who is major tifto asked lord chiltern  he is the man said silverbridge boldly who owned prime minister with me when he didnt win the leger last september  there was a deuce of a row said maule then mr spooner who read his bells life and field very religiously and who never missed an article in bayleys proceeded to give them an account of everything that had taken place in the runnymede hunt it mattered but little that he was wrong in all his details narrations always are the result to which he came was nearly right when he declared that the major had been turned off that a committee had been appointed and that messrs topps and jawstock had been threatened with a lawsuit  that comes said lord chiltern solemnly of employing men like major tifto in places for which they are radically unfit i dare say major tifto knew how to handle a pack of houndsperhaps almost as well as my huntsman fowler but i dont think a county would get on very well which appointed fowler master of hounds he is an honest man and therefore would be better than tifto butit would not do it is a position in which a man should at any rate be a gentleman if he be not all those who should be concerned in maintaining the hunt will turn their backs upon him when i take my hounds over this mans ground and that mans ground certainly without doing him any good i have to think of a great many things i have to understand that those whom i cannot compensate by money i have to compensate by courtesy when i shake hands with a farmer and express my obligation to him because he does not lock his gates he is gratified i dont think any decent farmer would care much for shaking hands with major tifto if we fall into that kind of thing there must soon be an end of hunting major tiftos are cheap no doubt but in hunting as in most other things cheap and nasty go together if men dont choose to put their hands in their pockets they had better say so and give the thing up altogether if you wont take any more wine well go to the ladies silverbridge the trap will start from the door tomorrow morning precisely at 930 am grantingham cross is fourteen miles then they all left their chairsbut as they did so mr spooner finished the bottle of portwine  i never heard chiltern speak so much like a book before said spooner to his wife as she drove him home that night  the next morning everybody was ready for a start at halfpast nine except mr mauleas to whom his wife declared that she had left him in bed when she came down to breakfast he can never get there if we dont take him said lord chiltern who was in truth the most goodnatured man in the world five minutes were allowed him and then he came down with a large sandwich in one hand and a buttonhook in the other with which he was prepared to complete his toilet what the deuce makes you always in such a hurry were the first words he spoke as lord chiltern got on the box the master knew him too well to argue the point wellhe always is in a hurry said the sinner when his wife accused him of ingratitude  wheres spooner asked the master when he saw mrs spooner without her husband at the meet  i knew how it would be when i saw the portwine she said in a whisper that could be heard all round he has got it this time sharpin his great toe we shant find at grantingham they were cutting wood there last week if i were you my lord id go away to the spinnies at once  i must draw the country regularly muttered the master  the country was drawn regularly but in vain till about two oclock not only was there no fox at grantingham wood but none even at the spinnies and at two fowler with an anxious face held a consultation with his more anxious master trumpington wood lay on their right and that no doubt would have been the proper draw i suppose we must try it said lord chiltern  old fowler looked very sour you might as well look for a fox under my wifes bed my lord  i dare say we should find one there said one of the wags of the hunt fowler shook his head feeling that this was no time for joking  it ought to be drawn said chiltern  of course you know best my lord i wouldnt touch itnever no more let em all know what the dukes wood is  this is lord silverbridge the dukes son said chiltern laughing  i beg your lordships pardon said fowler taking off his cap we shall have a good time coming some day let me trot em off to michaelmas daisies my lord ill be there in thirty minutes in the neighbouring parish of st michael de dezier there was a favourite little gorse which among huntingmen had acquired this unreasonable name after a little consideration the master yielded and away they trotted  youll cross the ford fowler asked mrs spooner  oh yes maam we couldnt draw the daisies this afternoon if we didnt  itll be up to the horses bellies  those who dont like it can go round  theyd never be there in time fowler  theres a many maam as dont mind that you wont be one to stay behind the water was up to the horses bellies but nevertheless mrs spooner was at the gorse side when the daisies were drawn  they found and were away in a minute it was all done so quickly that fowler who had alone gone into the gorse had hardly time to get out with his hounds the fox ran right back as though he were making for the dukes pernicious wood in the first field or two there was a succession of gates and there was not much to do in the way of jumping then the fox keeping straight ahead deviated from the line by which they had come making for the brook by a more direct course the ruck of the horsemen understanding the matter very well left the hounds and went to the right riding for the ford the ford was of such a nature that but one horse could pass it at a time and that one had to scramble through deep mud therell be the devil to pay there said lord chiltern going straight with his hounds phineas finn and dick rabbit were close after him old fowler had craftily gone to the ford but mrs spooner who did not intend to be shaken off followed the master and close with her was lord silverbridge lord chiltern hasnt got it right she said he cant do it among these bushes as she spoke the master put his horse at the bushes and thendisappeared the lady had been right there was no ground at that spot to take off from and the bushes had impeded him lord chiltern got over but his horse was in the water dick rabbit and poor phineas finn were stopped in their course by the necessity of helping the master in his trouble  but mrs spooner the judicious mrs spooner rode at the stream where it was indeed a little wider but at a place in which the horse could see what he was about and where he could jump from and to firm ground lord silverbridge followed her gallantly they both jumped the brook well and then were together youll beat me in pace said the lady as he rode alongside of her take the fence ahead straight and then turn sharp to your right with all her faults mrs spooner was a thorough sportsman  he did take the fence aheador rather tried to do so it was a bank and a double ditchnot very great in itself but requiring a horse to land on the top and go off with a second spring our young friends nag not quite understanding the nature of the impediment endeavoured to swallow it whole as hardriding men say and came down in the further ditch silverbridge came down on his head but the horse pursued his courseacross a heavilyploughed field  this was very disagreeable he was not in the least hurt but it became his duty to run after his horse a very few furrows of that work suffice to make a man think that hunting altogether is a beastly sort of thing mrs spooners horse who had shown himself to be a little less quick of foot than his own had known all about the bank and the double ditch and had apparently of his own accord turned down to the right either seeing or hearing the hounds and knowing that the ploughed ground was to be avoided but his rider soon changed his course she went straight after the riderless horse and when silverbridge had reduced himself to utter speechlessness by his exertions brought him back his steed  i ami am i amso sorry he struggled to sayand then as she held his horse for him he struggled up into the saddle  keep down this furrow said mrs spooner and we shall be with them in the second field theres nobody near them yet     chapter lxiii  ive seen em like that before   on this occasion silverbridge stayed only a few days at harrington having promised tregear to entertain him at the baldfaced stag it was here that his horses were standing and he now intended by limiting himself to one horse a day to mount his friend for a couple of weeks it was settled at last that tregear should ride his friends horse one day hire the next and so on i wonder what youll think of mrs spooner he said  why should i think anything of her  because i doubt whether you ever saw such a woman before she does nothing but hunt  then i certainly shant want to see her again  and she talks as i never heard a lady talk before  then i dont care if i never see her at all  but she is the most plucky and most goodnatured human being i ever saw in my life after all hunting is very good fun  very if you dont do it so often as to be sick of it  long as i have known you i dont think i ever saw you ride yet  we used to have hunting down in cornwall and thought we did it pretty well and i have ridden in south wales which i can assure you isnt an easy thing to do but you mustnt expect much from me  they were both out the monday and tuesday in that week and then again on the thursday without anything special in the way of sport lord chiltern who had found silverbridge to be a young man after his own heart was anxious that he should come back to harrington and bring tregear with him but to this tregear would not assent alleging that he should feel himself to be a burden both to lord and lady chiltern on the friday tregear did not go out saying that he would avoid the expense and on that day there was a good run it is always the way said silverbridge if you miss a day it is sure to be the best thing of the season an hour and a quarter with hardly anything you could call a check it is the only very good thing i have seen since i have been here mrs spooner was with them all through  and i suppose you were with mrs spooner  i wasnt far off i wish you had been there  on the next day the meet was at the kennels close to harrington and silverbridge drove his friend over in a gig the master and lady chiltern spooner and mrs spooner maule and mrs maule phineas finn and a host of others condoled with the unfortunate young man because he had not seen the good thing yesterday weve had it a little faster once or twice said mrs spooner with deliberation but never for so long then it was straight as a line and a real open kill no changing you know we did go through the daisies but ill swear to its being the same fox all of which set tregear wondering how could she swear to her fox and if they had changed what did it matter and if it had been a little crooked why would it have been less enjoyable and was she really so exact a judge of pace as she pretended to be im afraid we shant have anything like that today she continued the winds in the west and i never do like a westerly wind  a little to the north said her husband looking round the compass  my dear said the lady you never know where the wind comes from now dont you think of taking off your comforter i wont have it  tregear was riding his friends favourite hunter a thoroughbred bay horse very much more than up to his riders weight and supposed to be peculiarly good at timber water or any welldefined kind of fence however high or however broad they found at a covert near the kennels and killed their fox after a burst of a few minutes they found again and having lost their fox all declared that there was not a yard of scent i always know what a west wind means said mrs spooner  then they lunched and smoked and trotted about with an apparent acknowledgement that there wasnt much to be done it was not right that they should expect much after so good a thing as they had had yesterday at halfpast two mr spooner had been sent home by his providence and mrs spooner was calculating that she would be able to ride her horse again on the tuesday when on a sudden the hounds were on a fox it turned out afterwards that dick rabbit had absolutely ridden him up among the stubble and that the hounds had nearly killed him before he had gone a yard but the astute animal making the best use of his legs till he could get the advantage of the first ditch ran and crept and jumped absolutely through the pack then there was shouting and yelling and riding the men who were idly smoking threw away their cigars those who were loitering at a distance lost their chance but the real sportsmen always on the alert always thinking of the business in hand always mindful that there may be at any moment a fox just before the hounds had a glorious opportunity of getting well away among these no one was more intent or when the moment came better away than mrs spooner  silverbridge had been talking to her and had the full advantage of her care tregear was riding behind with lord chiltern who had been pressing him to come with his friend to harrington as soon as the shouting was heard chiltern was off like a rocket it was not only that he was anxious to get well away but that a sense of duty compelled him to see how the thing was being done old fowler certainly was a little slow and dick rabbit with the true bloodyminded instinct of a whip was a little apt to bustle a fox back into covert and then when a run commences with a fast rush riders are apt to override the hounds and then the hounds will overrun the fox all of which has to be seen to by a master who knows his business  tregear followed and being mounted on a fast horse was soon as forward as a judicious rider would desire now runks dont you press on and spoil it all said mrs spooner to the hardriding objectionable son of old runks the vet from rufford but young runks did press on till the master spoke a word the word shall not be repeated but it was efficacious  at that moment there had been a checkas there is generally after a short spurt when fox hounds and horsemen get off together and not always in the order in which they have been placed here there is too much bustle and the pack becomes disconcerted but it enabled fowler to get up and by dint of growling at the men and conciliating his hounds he soon picked up the scent if theyd all stand still for two minutes and be  to them he muttered aloud to himself theyd ave someat to ride arter they might go then and theres some of em d soon be nowhere  but in spite of fowlers denunciations there was of course another rush runks had slunk away but by making a little distance was now again ahead of the hounds and unfortunately there was halfadozen with him lord chiltern was very wrath when hes like that said mrs spooner to tregear its always well to give him a wide berth but as the hounds were now running fast it was necessary that even in taking this precaution due regard should be had to the foxs line hes back for harrington bushes said mrs spooner and as she said so she rode at a bank with a rail at the top of it perhaps a footandahalf high with a deep drop into the field beyond it was not a very nice place but it was apparently the only available spot in the fence she seemed to know it well for as she got close to it she brought her horse almost to a stand and so took it the horse cleared the rail seemed just to touch the bank on the other side while she threw herself back almost on to his crupper and so came down with perfect ease but she knowing that it would not be easy to all horses paused a moment to see what would happen  tregear was next to her and was intending to fly the fence but when he saw mrs spooner pull her horse and pause he also had to pull his horse this he did so as to enable her to take her leap without danger or encumbrance from him but hardly so as to bring his horse to the bank in the same way it may be doubted whether the animal he was riding would have known enough and been quiet enough to have performed the acrobatic manoeuvre which had carried mrs spooner so pleasantly over the peril he had some idea of this for the thought occurred to him that he would turn and ride fast at the jump but before he could turn he saw that silverbridge was pressing on him it was thus his only resource to do as mrs spooner had done he was too close to the rail but still he tried it the horse attempted to jump caught his foot against the bar and of course went over headforemost this probably would have been nothing had not silverbridge with his rushing beast been immediately after them when the young lord saw that his friend was down it was too late for him to stop his course his horse was determined to have the fenceand did have it he touched nothing and would have skimmed in glory over the next field had he not come right down on tregear and tregears steed there they were four of them two men and two horses in one confused heap  the first person with them was mrs spooner who was off her horse in a minute and silverbridge too was very soon on his legs he at any rate was unhurt and the two horses were up before mrs spooner was out of her saddle but tregear did not move what are we to do said lord silverbridge kneeling down over his friend oh mrs spooner what are we to do  the hunt had passed on and no one else was immediately with them but at this moment dick rabbit who had been left behind to bring up his hounds appeared above the bank leave your horse and come down said mrs spooner here is a gentleman who has hurt himself dick wouldnt leave his horse but was soon on the scene having found his way through another part of the fence  no he aint dead said dickive seen em like that before and they wurnt dead but hes had a hawful squeege then he passed his hand over the mans neck and chest theres a lot of em is broke said he we must get him into farmer toobys  after awhile he was got into farmer toobys when that surgeon came who is always in attendance on a huntingfield the surgeon declared that he had broken his collarbone two of his ribs and his left arm and then one of the animals had struck him on the chest as he raised himself a little brandy was poured down his throat but even under that operation he gave no sign of life no missis he arent dead said dick to mrs tooby no more he wont die this bout but hes got it very nasty  that night silverbridge was sitting by his friends bedside at ten oclock in lord chilterns house tregear had spoken a few words and the bones had been set but the doctor had not felt himself justified in speaking with that assurance which dick had expressed the mans whole body had been bruised by the horse which had fallen on him the agony of silverbridge was extreme for he knew that it had been his doing you were a little too close mrs spooner had said to him but nobody saw it and well hold our tongues silverbridge however would not hold his tongue he told everybody how it had happened how he had been unable to stop his horse how he had jumped upon his friend and perhaps killed him i dont know what i am to do i am so miserable he said to lady chiltern with the tears running down his face  the two remained at harrington and their luggage was brought over from the baldfaced stag the accident had happened on a saturday on the sunday there was no comfort on the monday the patients recollection and mind were reestablished and the doctor thought that perhaps with great care his constitution would pull him through on that day the consternation at harrington was so great that mrs spooner would not go to the meet she came over from spoon hall and spent a considerable part of the day in the sick mans room its sure to come right if its above the vitals she said expressing an opinion which had come from much experience that is she added unless the necks broke when poor old jack stubbs drove his head into his cap and dislocated his wertebury of course it was all up with him the patient heard this and was seen to smile  on the tuesday there arose the question of family communication as the accident would make its way into the papers a message had been sent to polwenning to say that various bones had been broken but that the patient was upon the whole doing well then there had been different messages backwards and forwards in all of which there had been an attempt to comfort old mrs tregear but on the tuesday letters were written silverbridge sitting in his friends room sent a long account of the accident to mrs tregear giving a list of the injuries done  your sister whispered the poor fellow from his pillow  yesyesyes i will  and mabel grex silverbridge nodded assent and again went to the writingtable he did write to his sister and in plain words told her everything the doctor says he is not now in danger then he added a postscript as long as i am here i will let you know how he is     chapter lxiv  i believe him to be a worthy young man   lady mary and mrs finn were alone when the tidings came from silverbridge the duke had been absent having gone to spend an unpleasant week in barsetshire mary had taken the opportunity of his absence to discuss her own prospects at full length my dear said mrs finn i will not express an opinion how can i after all that has passed i have told the duke the same i cannot be heart and hand with either without being false to the other but still lady mary continued to talk about tregear  i dont think papa has a right to treat me in this way she said he wouldnt be allowed to kill me and this is killing me  while there is life there is hope said mrs finn  yes while there is life there is hope but one doesnt want to grow old first  there is no danger of that yet mary  i feel very old what is the use of life without something to make it sweet i am not even allowed to hear anything that he is doing if he were to ask me i think i would go away with him tomorrow  he would not be foolish enough for that  because he does not suffer as i do he has his borough and his public life and a hundred things to think of i have got nothing but him i know he is truequite as true as i am but it is i that have the suffering in all this a man can never be like a girl papa ought not to make me suffer like this  that took place on the monday on the tuesday mrs finn received a letter from her husband giving his account of the accident as far as i can learn he said silverbridge will write about it tomorrow then he went on to give a by no means good account of the state of the patient the doctor had declared him to be out of immediate danger and had set the broken bones as tidings would be sent on the next day she had better say nothing about the accident to lady mary this letter reached matching on tuesday and made the position of mrs finn very disagreeable she was bound to carry herself as though nothing was amiss knowing as she did so the condition of marys lover  on the evening of that day lady mary was more lively than usual though her liveliness was hardly of a happy nature i dont know what papa can expect ive heard him say a hundred times that to be in parliament is the highest place a gentleman can fill and now frank is in parliament mrs finn looked at her with beseeching eyes as though begging her not to speak of tregear and then to think of their having that lord popplecourt there i shall always hate lady cantrip for it was her place that she should have thought it possible lord popplecourt such a creature hyperion to a satyr isnt it true oh that papa should have thought it possible then she got up and walked about the room beating her hands together all this time mrs finn knew that tregear was lying at harrington with half his bones broken and in danger of his life  on the next morning lady mary received her letters there were two lying before her plate when she came into breakfast one from her father and the other from silverbridge she read that from the duke first while mrs finn was watching her papa will be home on saturday she said he declares that the people in the borough are quite delighted with silverbridge for a member and he is quite jocose they used to be delighted with me once he says but i suppose everybody changes then she began to pour out the tea before she opened her brothers letter mrs finns eyes were still on her anxiously i wonder what silverbridge has got to say about the brake hunt then she opened her letter  ohoh she exclaimedfrank has killed himself  killed himself not that it is not so bad as that  you had heard it before  how is he mary  oh heavens i cannot read it do you read it tell me all tell me the truth what am i to do where shall i go then she threw up her hands and with a loud scream fell on her knees with her head upon the chair in the next moment mrs finn was down beside her on the floor read it why do you not read it if you will not read it give it to me  mrs finn did read the letter which was very short but still giving by no means an unfavourable account of the patient i am sorry to say he has broken ever so many bones and we were very much frightened about him then the writer went into details from which a reader who did not read the words carefully might well imagine that the mans life was still in danger  mrs finn did read it all and did her best to comfort her friend it has been a bad accident she said but it is clear that he is getting better men do so often break their bones and then seem to think nothing of it afterwards  silverbridge says it was his fault what does he mean  i suppose he was riding too close to mr tregear and that they came down together of course it is distressing but i do not think you need make yourself positively unhappy about it  would you not be unhappy if it were mr finn said mary jumping up from her knees i shall go to him i should go mad if i were to remain here and know nothing about it but what silverbridge will tell me  i will telegraph to mr finn  mr finn wont care men are so heartless they write about each other just as though it did not signify in the least whether anybody were dead or alive i shall go to him  you cannot do that  i dont care now what anybody may think i choose to be considered as belonging to him and if papa were here i would say the same it was of course not difficult to make her understand that she could not go to harrington but it was by no means easy to keep her tranquil she would send a telegram herself this was debated for a long time till at last lady mary insisted that she was not subject to mrs finns authority if papa were here even then i would send it and she did send it in her own name regardless of the fact pointed out to her by mrs finn that the people at the postoffice would thus know her secret it is no secret she said i dont want it to be a secret the telegram went in the following words i have heard it i am so wretched send me one word to say how you are she got an answer back with tregears own name to it on that afternoon do not be unhappy i am doing well silverbridge is with me  on the thursday gerald came home from scotland he had arranged his little affair with lord percival not however without some difficulty lord percival had declared he did not understand ious in an affair of that kind he had always thought that gentlemen did not play for stakes which they could not pay at once this was not said to gerald himselfor the result would have been calamitous nidderdale was the gobetween and at last arranged itnot however till he had pointed out that percival having won so large a sum of money from a lad under twentyone years of age was very lucky in receiving substantial security for its payment  gerald had chosen the period of his fathers absence for his return it was necessary that the story of the gambling debt should be told the duke in february silverbridge had explained that to him and he had quite understood it he indeed would be up at oxford in february and in that case the first horror of the thing would be left to poor silverbridge thinking of this gerald felt that he was bound to tell his father himself he resolved that he would do so but was anxious to postpone the evil day he lingered therefore in scotland till he knew that his father was in barsetshire  on his arrival he was told of tregears accident oh gerald have you heard said his sister he had not as yet heard and then the history was repeated to him mary did not attempt to conceal her own feelings she was as open with her brother as she had been with mrs finn  i suppose hell get over it said gerald  is that all you say she asked  what can i say better i suppose he will fellows always do get over that kind of thing herbert de burgh smashed both his thighs and now he can move about againof course with crutches  gerald how can you be so unfeeling  i dont know what you mean i always liked tregear and i am very sorry for him if you would take it a little quieter i think it would be better  i could not take it quietly how can i take it quietly when he is more than all the world to me  you should keep that to yourself  yesand so let people think that i didnt care till i broke my heart i shall say just the same to papa when he comes home after that the brother and sister were not on very good terms with each other for the remainder of the day  on the saturday there was a letter from silverbridge to mrs finn tregear was better but was unhappy because it had been decided that he could not be moved for the next month this entailed two misfortunes on himfirst that of being the enforced guest of persons who were notor hitherto had not been his own friendsand then his absence from the first meeting of parliament when a gentleman has been in parliament some years he may be able to reconcile himself to an obligatory vacation with a calm mind but when the honours and glory are new and the tedium of the benches has not yet been experienced then such an accident is felt to be a grievance but the young member was out of danger and was as silverbridge declared in the very best quarters which could be provided for a man in such a position  phineas finn told him all the politics mrs spooner related to him on sundays and wednesdays all the hunting details while lady chiltern read to him light literature because he was not allowed to hold a book in his hand i wish it were me said gerald i wish i were there to read to him said mary  then the duke came home mary said he i have been distressed to hear of this accident this seemed to her to be the kindest word she had heard from him for a long time i believe him to be a worthy young man i am sorry that he should be the cause of so much sorrow to youand to me  of course i was sorry for his accident she replied after pausing awhile but now that he is better i will not call him a cause of sorrowto me then the duke said nothing further about tregear nor did she  so you have come at last he said to gerald that was the first greetingto which the son responded by an awkward smile but in the course of the evening he walked straight up to his fatheri have something to tell you sir said he  something to tell me  something that will make you very angry     chapter lxv  do you ever think what money is   gerald told his story standing bolt upright and looking his father full in the face as he told it you lost three thousand four hundred pounds at one sitting to lord percivalat cards  yes sir  in lord nidderdales house  yes sir nidderdale wasnt playing it wasnt his fault  who were playing  percival and dolly longstaff and jack hindesand i popplecourt was playing at first  lord popplecourt  yes sir but he went away when he began to lose  three thousand four hundred pounds how old are you  i am just twentyone  you are beginning the world well gerald what is the engagement which silverbridge has made with lord percival  to pay him the money at the end of next month  what had silverbridge to do with it  nothing sir i wrote to silverbridge because i didnt know what to do i knew he would stand to me  who is to stand to either of you if you go on thus i do not know to this gerald of course made no reply but an idea came across his mind that he knew who would stand both to himself and his brother how did silverbridge mean to get the money  he said he would ask you but i thought that i ought to tell you  is that all  all what sir  are there other debts to this gerald made no reply other gambling debts  no sirnot a shilling of that kind i have never played before  does it ever occur to you that going on at that rate you may very soon lose all the fortune that will ever come to you you were not yet of age and you lost three thousand four hundred pounds at cards to a man whom you probably knew to be a professed gambler the duke seemed to wait for a reply but poor gerald had not a word to say can you explain to me what benefit you proposed to yourself when you played for such stakes as that  i hoped to win back what i had lost  facilis descensus averni said the duke shaking his head noctes atque dies patet atri janua ditis no doubt he thought that as his son was at oxford admonitions in latin would serve him better than in his native tongue but gerald when he heard the grand hexameter rolled out in his fathers grandest tone entertained a comfortable feeling that the worst of the interview was over win back what you had lost do you think that that is the common fortune of young gamblers when they fall among those who are more experienced than themselves  one goes on sir without reflecting  go on without reflecting yes and where to where to oh gerald where to whither will such progress without reflection take you he meansto the devil the lad said inwardly to himself without moving his lips there is but one goal for such going on as that i can pay three thousand four hundred pounds for you certainly i think it hard that i should have to do so but i can do itand i will do it  thank you sir murmured gerald  but how can i wash your young mind clean from the foul stain which has already defiled it why did you sit down to play was it to win the money which these men had in their pockets  not particularly  it cannot be that a rational being should consent to risk the money he has himselfto risk even the money which he has not himselfwithout a desire to win that which as yet belongs to his opponents you desired to win  i suppose i did hope to win  and why why did you want to extract their property from their pockets and to put it into your own that the footpad on the road should have such desire when with his pistol he stops the traveller on his journey we all understand and we know what we think of the footpadand what we do to him he is a poor creature who from his youth upwards has had no good thing done for him uneducated an outcast whom we should pity more than we despise him we take him as a pest which we cannot endure and lock him up where he can harm us no more on my word gerald i think that the socalled gentleman who sits down with the deliberate intention of extracting money from the pockets of his antagonists who lays out for himself that way of repairing the shortcomings of fortune who looks to that resource as an aid to his meansis worse much worse than the public robber he is meaner more cowardly and has i think in his bosom less of the feelings of an honest man and he probably has been educatedas you have been he calls himself a gentleman he should know black from white it is considered terrible to cheat at cards  there was nothing of that sir  the man who plays and cheats has fallen low indeed  i understand that sir  he who plays that he may make an income but does not cheat has fallen nearly as low do you ever think what money is  the duke paused so long collecting his own thoughts and thinking of his own words that gerald found himself obliged to answer cheques and sovereigns and banknotes he replied with much hesitation  money is the reward of labour said the duke or rather in the shape it reaches you it is your representation of that reward you may earn it yourself or as is i am afraid more likely to be the case with you you may possess it honestly as prepared for you by the labour of others who have stored it up for you but it is a commodity of which you are bound to see that the source is not only clean but noble you would not let lord percival give you money  he wouldnt do that sir i am sure  nor would you take it there is nothing so comfortable as moneybut nothing so defiling if it be come by unworthily nothing so comfortable but nothing so noxious if the mind be allowed to dwell upon it constantly if a man have enough let him spend it freely if he wants it let him earn it honestly let him do something for it so that the man who pays it to him may get its value but to think that it may be got by gambling to hope to live after that fashion to sit down with your fingers almost in your neighbours pockets with your eye on his purse trusting that you may know better than he some studied calculations as to the pips concealed in your hands praying to the only god you worship that some special card may be vouchsafed to youthat i say is to have left far far behind you all nobility all gentleness all manhood write me down lord percivals address and i will send him the money  then the duke wrote a cheque for the money claimed and sent it with a note as followsthe duke of omnium presents his compliments to lord percival the duke has been informed by lord gerald palliser that lord percival has won at cards from him the sum of three thousand four hundred pounds the duke now encloses a cheque for that amount and requests that the document which lord percival holds from lord silverbridge as security for the amount may be returned to lord gerald let the noble gambler have his prey he was little solicitous about that if he could only so operate on the mind of this sonso operate on the minds of both his sons as to make them see the foolishness of folly the ugliness of what is mean the squalor and dirt of ignoble pursuits then he could easily pardon past faults if it were half his wealth what would it signify if he could teach his children to accept those lessons without which no man can live as a gentleman let his rank be the highest known let his wealth be as the sands his fashion unrivalled  the word or two which his daughter had said to him declaring that she still took pride in her lovers love and then this new misfortune on geralds part upset him greatly he almost sickened of politics when he thought of his domestic bereavement and his domestic misfortunes how completely had he failed to indoctrinate his children with the ideas by which his own mind was fortified and controlled nothing was so base to him as a gambler and they had both commenced their career by gambling from their young boyhood nothing had seemed so desirable to him as that they should be accustomed by early training to devote themselves to the service of their country he saw other young noblemen around him who at eighteen were known as debaters at their colleges or at twentyfive were already deep in politics social science and educational projects what good would all his wealth or all his position do for his children if their minds could rise to nothing beyond the shooting of deer and the hunting of foxes there was young lord buttercup the son of the earl of woolantallow only a few months older than silverbridgewho was already a junior lord and as constant at his office or during the session on the treasury bench as though there were not a pack of hounds or a cardtable in great britain lord buttercup too had already written an article in the fortnightly on the subject of turkish finance how long would it be before silverbridge would write an article or gerald sign his name in the service of the public  and then those proposed marriagesas to which he was beginning to know that his children would be too strong for him anxious as he was that both his sons should be permeated by liberal politics studious as he had ever been to teach them that the highest duty of those high in rank was to use their authority to elevate those beneath them still he was hardly less anxious to make them understand that their second duty required them to maintain their own position it was by feeling this second dutyby feeling it and performing itthat they would be enabled to perform the rest and now both silverbridge and his girl were bent upon marriages by which they would depart out of their own order let silverbridge marry whom he might he could not be other than heir to the honours of his family but by his marriage he might either support or derogate from these honours and now having at first made a choice that was good he had altered his mind from simple freak captivated by a pair of bright eyes and an arch smile and without a feeling in regard to his family was anxious to take to his bosom the granddaughter of an american daylabourer  and then his girlof whose beauty he was so proud from whose manners and tastes and modes of life he had expected to reap those good things in a feminine degree which his sons as young men seemed so little fitted to give him by slow degrees he had been brought round to acknowledge that the young man was worthy tregears conduct had been felt by the duke to be manly the letter he had written was a good letter and then he had won for himself a seat in the house of commons when forced to speak of him to this girl he had been driven by justice to call him worthy but how could he serve to support and strengthen that nobility the endurance and perpetuation of which should be the peculiar care of every palliser  and yet as the duke walked about his room he felt that his opposition either to the one marriage or to the other was vain of course they would marry according to their wills  that same night gerald wrote to his brother before he went to bed as follows      dear silveri was awfully obliged to you for sending me    the iou for that brute percival he only sneered when    he took it and would have said something disagreeable    but that he saw that i was in earnest i know he did say    something to nid only i cant find out what nid is an    easygoing fellow and as i saw didnt want to have a    rumpus     but now what do you think ive done directly i got home    i told the governor all about it as i was in the train i    made up my mind that i would i went slap at it if there    is anything that never does any good its craning i did    it all at one rush just as though i was swallowing a dose    of physic i wish i could tell you all that the governor    said because it was really tiptop what is a fellow to    get by playing higha fellow like you and me i didnt    want any of that beasts money i dont suppose he had    any but ones dander gets up and one doesnt like to be    done and so it goes on i shall cut that kind of thing    altogether you should have heard the governor spouting    latin and then the way he sat upon percival without    mentioning the fellows name i do think it mean to set    yourself to work to win money at cardsand it is awfully    mean to lose more than you have got to pay     then at the end the governor said hed send the beast a    cheque for the amount you know his way of finishing up    just like two fellows fightingwhen one has awfully    punished the other he goes up and shakes hands with him    he did pitch into menot abusing me nor even saying    a word about the money which he at once promised    to pay but laying it on to gambling with a regular    catoninetails and then there was an end of it he    just asked the fellows address and said that he would    send him the money i will say thisi dont think    theres a greater brick than the governor out anywhere     i am awfully sorry about tregear i cant quite make out    how it happened i suppose you were too near him and    melrose always does rush at his fences one fellow    shouldnt be too near another fellowonly it so often    happens that it cant be helped its just like anything    else if nothing comes of it then its all right but if    anybody comes to grief then he has got to be pitched into    do you remember when i nearly cut over old sir simon    slobody didnt i hear about it     i am awfully glad you didnt smash up tregear altogether    because of mary i am quite sure it is no good anybody    setting up his back against that its one of the things    that have got to be you always have said that he is a    good fellow if so whats the harm at any rate it has    got to be     your affectionate brother     gerald     i go up in about a week     chapter lxvi  the three attacks   during the following week the communications between harrington and matching were very frequent there were no further direct messages between tregear and lady mary but she heard daily of his progress the duke was conscious of the special interest which existed in his house as to the condition of the young man but after his arrival not a word was spoken for some days between him and his daughter on the subject then gerald went back to his college and the duke made his preparations for going up to town and making some attempt at parliamentary activity  it was by no concert that an attack was made upon him from three quarters at once as he was preparing to leave matching on the sunday morning during church timefor on that day lady mary went to her devotions alonemrs finn was closeted for an hour with the duke in his study i think you ought to be aware she said to the duke that though i trust mary implicitly and know her to be thoroughly high principled i cannot be responsible for her if i remain with her here  i do not quite follow your meaning  of course there is but one matter on which there can probably be any difference between us if she should choose to write to mr tregear or to send him a message or even to go to him i could not prevent it  go to him exclaimed the horrified duke  i merely suggest such a thing in order to make you understand that i have absolutely no control over her  what control have i  nay i cannot define that you are her father and she acknowledges your authority she regards me as a friendand as such treats me with the sweetest affection nothing can be more gratifying than her manner to me personally  it ought to be so  she has thoroughly won my heart but still i know that if there were a difference between us she would not obey me why should she  because you hold my deputed authority  oh duke that goes for very little anywhere no one can depute authority it comes too much from personal accidents and too little from reason or law to be handed over to others besides i fear that on one matter concerning her you and i are not agreed  i shall be sorry if it be so  i feel that i am bound to tell you my opinion  oh yes  you think that in the end lady mary will allow herself to be separated from tregear i think that in the end they will become man and wife  this seemed to the duke to be not quite so bad as it might have been any speculation as to results were very different from an expressed opinion as to propriety were he to tell the truth as to his own mind he might perhaps have said the same thing but one is not to relax in ones endeavours to prevent that which is wrong because one fears that the wrong may be ultimately perpetrated let that be as it may he said it cannot alter my duty  nor mine duke if i may presume to think that i have a duty in this matter  that you should encounter the burden of the duty binds me to you for ever  if it be that they will certainly be married one day  who has said that who has admitted that  if it be so if it seems to me that it must be sothen how can i be anxious to prolong her sufferings she does suffer terribly upon this the duke frowned but there was more of tenderness in his frown than in the hard smile which he had hitherto worn i do not know whether you see it all he well remembered all that he had seen when he and mary were travelling together i see it and i do not pass half an hour with her without sorrowing for her on hearing this he sighed and turned his face away girls are so different there are many who though they be genuinely in love though their natures are sweet and affectionate are not strong enough to support their own feelings in resistance to the will of those who have authority over them had it been so with his wife at this moment all the former history passed through his mind they yield to that which seems to be inevitable and allow themselves to be fashioned by the purposes of others it is well for them often that they are so plastic whether it would be better for her that she should be so i will not say  it would be better said the duke doggedly  but such is not her nature she is as determined as ever  i may be determined too  but if at last it will be of no useif it be her fate either to be married to this man or die of a broken heart  what justifies you in saying that how can you torture me by such a threat  if i think so duke i am justified of late i have been with her dailyalmost hourly i do not say that this will kill her nowin her youth it is not often i fancy that women die after that fashion but a broken heart may bring the sufferer to the grave after a lapse of many years how will it be with you if she should live like a ghost beside you for the next twenty years and you should then see her die faded and withered before her timeall her life gone without a joybecause she had loved a man whose position in life was displeasing to you would the ground on which the sacrifice had been made then justify itself to you in thus performing your duty to your order would you feel satisfied that you had performed that to your child  she had come there determined to say it allto liberate her own soul as it werebut had much doubted the spirit in which the duke would listen to her that he would listen to her she was sureand then if he chose to cast her out she would endure his wrath it would not be to her now as it had been when he accused her of treachery but nevertheless bold as she was and independent he had imbued her as he did all those around him with so strong a sense of his personal dignity that when she had finished she almost trembled as she looked in his face since he had asked her how she could justify to herself the threats which she was using he had sat still with his eyes fixed upon her now when she had done he was in no hurry to speak he rose slowly and walking towards the fireplace stood with his back towards her looking down upon the fire she was the first to speak again shall i leave you now she said in a low voice  perhaps it will be better he answered his voice too was very low in truth he was so moved that he hardly knew how to speak at all then she rose and was already on her way to the door when he followed her one moment if you please he said almost sternly i am under a debt of gratitude to you of which i cannot express my sense in words how far i may agree with you and where i may disagree i will not attempt to point out to you now  oh no  but all that you have troubled yourself to think and to feel in this matter and all that true friendship has compelled you to say to me shall be written down in the tablets of my memory  duke  my child has at any rate been fortunate in securing the friendship of such a friend then he turned back to the fireplace and she was constrained to leave the room without another word  she had determined to make the best plea in her power for mary and while she was making the plea had been almost surprised by her own vehemence but the greater had been her vehemence the stronger she thought would have been the dukes anger and as she had watched the workings of his face she had felt for a moment that the vials of his wrath were about to be poured out upon her even when she left the room she almost believed that had he not taken those moments for consideration at the fireplace his parting words would have been different but as it was there could be no question now of her departure no power was left to her of separating herself from lady mary though the duke had not as yet acknowledged himself to be conquered there was no doubt to her now but that he would be conquered and she either here or in london must be the girls nearest friend up to the day when she should be given over to mr tregear  that was one of the three attacks which were made upon the duke before he went up to his parliamentary duties  the second was as follows among the letters on the following morning one was brought to him from tregear it is hoped that the reader will remember the lovers former letter and the very unsatisfactory answer which had been sent to it nothing could have been colder less propitious or more inveterately hostile than the reply as he lay in bed with his broken bones at harrington he had ample time for thinking over all this he knew every word of the dukes distressing note by heart and had often lashed himself to rage as he had repeated it but he could effect nothing by showing his anger he must go on and still do something since the writing of that letter he had done something he had got his seat in parliament and he had secured the interest of his friend silverbridge this had been partially done at polwenning but the accident in the brake country had completed the work the brother had at last declared himself in his friends favour of course i should be glad to see it he had said while sitting by tregears bedside the worst is that everything does seem to go against the poor governor  then tregear made up his mind that he would write another letter personally he was not in the best condition for doing this as he was lying in bed with his left arm tied up and with straps and bandages all round his body but he could sit up in bed and his right hand and arm were free so he declared to lady chiltern his purpose of writing a letter she tried to dissuade him gently and offered to be his secretary but when he assured her that no secretary could write this letter for him she understood pretty well what would be the subject of the letter with considerable difficulty tregear wrote his letter      my lord dukeon this occasion he left out the epithet    which he had before used     your graces reply to my last letter was not encouraging    but in spite of your prohibition i venture to write to you    again if i had the slightest reason for thinking that    your daughter was estranged from me i would not persecute    either you or her but if it be true that she is as    devoted to me as i am to her can i be wrong in pleading    my cause is it not evident to you that she is made    of such stuff that she will not be controlled in her    choiceeven by your will     i have had an accident in the huntingfield and am now    writing from lord chilterns house where i am confined to    bed but i think you will understand me when i say that    even in this helpless condition i feel myself constrained    to do something of course i ask for nothing from you on    my own behalfbut on her behalf may i not add my prayers    to hers     i have the honour to be    your graces very faithful servant     francis tregear   this coming alone would perhaps have had no effect the duke had desired the young man not to address him again and the young man had disobeyed him no mere courtesy would now have constrained him to send any reply to this further letter but coming as it did while his heart was still throbbing with the effects of mrs finns words it was allowed to have a certain force the argument used was a true argument his girl was devoted to the man who sought her hand mrs finn had told him that sooner or later he must yieldunless he was prepared to see his child wither and fade at his side he had once thought that he would be prepared even for that he had endeavoured to strengthen his own will by arguing with himself that when he saw a duty plainly before him he should cleave to that let the results be what they might but that picture of her face withered and wan after twenty years of sorrowing had had its effect upon his heart he even made excuses within his own breast in the young mans favour he was in parliament now and what may not be done for a young man in parliament altogether the young man appeared to him in a light different from that through which he had viewed the presumptuous arrogant utterly unjustifiable suitor who had come to him now nearly a year since in carlton terrace  he went to breakfast with tregears letter in his pocket and was then gracious to mrs finn and tender to his daughter when do you go papa mary asked  i shall take the 1145 train i have ordered the carriage at a quarter before eleven  may i go to the train with you papa  certainly i shall be delighted  papa mary said as soon as she found herself seated beside her father in the carriage  my dear  oh papa and she threw herself on to his breast he put his arm round her and kissed heras he would have had so much delight in doing as he would have done so often before had there not been this ground of discord she was very sweet to him it had never seemed to him that she had disgraced herself by loving tregearbut that a great misfortune had fallen upon her silverbridge when he had gone into a racing partnership with tifto and gerald when he had played for money which he did not possess haddegraded themselves in his estimation he would not have used such a word but it was his feeling they were less noble less pure than they might have been had they kept themselves free from such stain but this girlwhether she should live and fade by his side or whether she should give her hand to some fitting noble suitoror even though she might at last become the wife of this man who loved her would always have been pure it was sweet to him to have something to caress now in the solitude of his life as years were coming on him he felt how necessary it was that he should have someone who would love him since his wife had left him he had been debarred from these caresses by the necessity of showing his antagonism to her dearest wishes it had been his duty to be stern in all his words to his daughter he had been governed by a conviction that he never ought to allow the duty of separating her from her lover to be absent from his mind he was not prepared to acknowledge that that duty had ceasedbut yet there had crept over him a feeling that as he was half conquered why should he not seek some recompense in his daughters love papa she said you do not hate me  hate you my darling  because i am disobedient oh papa i cannot help it he should not have come he should not have been let to come he had not a word to say to her he could not as yet bring himself to tell herthat it should be as she desired much less could he now argue with her as to the impossibility of such a marriage as he had done on former occasions when the matter had been discussed he could only press his arm tightly round her waist and be silent it cannot be altered now papa look at me tell me that you love me  have you doubted my love  no papabut i would do anything to make you happy anything that i could do papa you do not want me to marry lord popplecourt  i would not have you marry any man without loving him  i never can love anybody else that is what i wanted you to know papa  to this he made no reply nor was there anything else said upon the subject before the carriage drove up to the railway station do not get out dear he said seeing that her eyes had been filled with tears it is not worth while god bless you my child you will be up in london i hope in a fortnight and we must try to make the house a little less dull for you  and so he had encountered the third attack  lady mary as she was driven home recovered her spirits wonderfully not a word had fallen from her father which she could use hereafter as a refuge from her embarrassments he had made her no promise he had assented to nothing but there had been something in his manner in his gait in his eye in the pressure of his arm which made her feel that her troubles would soon be at an end  i do love you so much she said to mrs finn late on that afternoon  i am glad of that dear  i shall always love youbecause you have been on my side all through  no marythat is not so  i know it is so of course you have to be wise because you are older and papa would not have you here with me if you were not wise but i know you are on my sideand papa knows it too and someone else shall know it some day     chapter lxvii  he is such a beast   lord silverbridge remained hunting in the brake country till a few days before the meeting of parliament and had he been left to himself he would have had another week in the country and might probably have overstayed the opening day but he had not been left to himself in the last week in january an important despatch reached his hands from no less important a person than sir timothy beeswax suggesting to him that he should undertake the duty of seconding the address in the house of commons when the proposition first reached him it made his hair stand on end he had never yet risen to his feet in the house he had spoken at those election meetings in cornwall and had found it easy enough after the first or second time he had thought it good fun but he knew that standing up in the house of commons would be different from that then there would be the dress i should so hate to fig myself out and look like a guy he said to tregear to whom of course he confided the offer that was made to him tregear was very anxious that he should accept it a man should never refuse anything of that kind which comes in his way tregear said  it is only because i am the governors son silverbridge pleaded  partly so perhaps but if it be altogether so what of that take the goods the gods provide you of course all these things which our ambition covets are easier to dukes sons than to others but not on that account should a dukes son refuse them a man when he sees a rung vacant on the ladder should always put his feet there  ill tell you what said silverbridge if i thought this was all fair sailing id do it i should feel certain that i should come a cropper but still id try it as you say a fellow should try but its all meant as a blow at the governor old beeswax thinks that if he can get me up to swear that he and his crew are real firstchop hands that will hit the governor hard its as much as saying to the governorthis chap belongs to me not to you thats a thing i wont go in for then tregear counselled him to write to his father for advice and at the same time to ask sir timothy to allow him a day or two for consideration this counsel he took his letter reached his father two days before he left matching in answer to it there came first a telegram begging silverbridge to be in london on the monday and then a letter in which the duke expressed himself as being anxious to see his son before giving a final answer to the question thus it was that silverbridge had been taken away from his hunting  isabel boncassen however was now in london and from her it was possible that he might find consolation he had written to her soon after reaching harrington telling her that he had had it all out with the governor there is a good deal that i can only tell you when i see you he said then he assured her with many lovers protestations that he was and always would be till death altogether her own most loving s to this he had received an answer by return of post she would be delighted to see him up in townas would her father and mother they had now got a comfortable house in brook street and then she signed herself his sincere friend isabel silverbridge thought that it was cold and remembered certain scraps in another feminine handwriting in which more passion was expressed perhaps this was the way with american young ladies when they were in love  yes said the duke i am glad that you have come up at once as sir timothy should have his answer without further delay  but what shall i say  the duke though he had already considered the matter very seriously nevertheless took a few minutes to consider it again the offer said he must be acknowledged as very flattering  but the circumstances are not usual  it cannot often be the case that a minister should ask the son of his keenest political opponent to render him such a service but however we will put that aside  not quite sir  for the present we will put that on one side not looking at the party which you may be called upon to support having for the moment no regard to this or that line in politics there is no opening to the real duties of parliamentary life which i would sooner see accorded to you than this  but if i were to break down talking to his father he could not quite venture to ask what might happen if he were to come a cropper  none but the brave deserve the fair said the duke slapping his hands upon the table why if we fail we fail but screw your courage to the sticking place and well not fail what high point would ever be reached if caution such as that were allowed to prevail what young men have done before cannot you do i have no doubt of your capacity none  havent you sir said silverbridge considerably gratifiedand also surprised  none in the least but perhaps some of your diligence  i could learn it by heart sirif you mean that  but i dont mean that or rather i mean much more than that you have first to realise in your mind the thing to be said and then the words in which you should say it before you come to learning by heart  some of them i suppose would tell me what to say  no doubt with your inexperience it would be unfit that you should be left entirely to yourself but i would wish you to knowperhaps i should say to feelthat the sentiments to be expressed by you were just  i should have to praise sir timothy  not that necessarily but you would have to advocate that course in parliament which sir timothy and his friends have taken and propose to take  but i hate him like poison  there need be no personal feeling in the matter i remember that when i moved the address in your house mr mildmay was prime ministera man for whom my regard and esteem were unboundedwho had been in political matters the preceptor of my youth whom as a patriotic statesman i almost worshipped whom i now remember as a man whose departure from the arena of politics left the country very destitute no one has sprung up since like to himor hardly second to him but in speaking on so large a subject as the policy of a party i thought it beneath me to eulogise a man the same policy reversed may keep you silent respecting sir timothy  i neednt of course say what i think about him  i suppose you do agree with sir timothy as to his general policy on no other condition can you undertake such a duty  of course i have voted with him  so i have observednot so regularly perhaps as mr roby would have desired mr roby was the conservative whip  and i suppose the people at silverbridge expect me to support him  i hardly know how that may be they used to be contented with my poor services no doubt they feel they have changed for the better  you shouldnt say that sir  i am bound to suppose that they think so because when the matter was left in their own hands they at once elected a conservative you need not fear that you will offend them by seconding the address they will probably feel proud to see their young member brought forward on such an occasion as i shall be proud to see my son  you would if it were on the other side sir  yes silverbridge yes i should be very proud if it were on the other side but there is a useful old adage which bids us not cry for spilt milk you have a right to your opinions though perhaps i may think that in adopting what i must call new opinions you were a little precipitate we cannot act together in politics but not the less on that account do i wish to see you take an active and useful part on that side to which you have attached yourself as he said this he rose from his seat and spoke with emphasis as though he were addressing some imaginary speaker or a house of legislators around i shall be proud to hear you second the address if you do it as gracefully and as fitly as i am sure you may if you will give yourself the trouble i shall hear you do it with infinite satisfaction even though i shall feel at the same time anxious to answer all your arguments and to disprove all your assertions i should be listening no doubt to my opponentbut i should be proud to feel that i was listening to my son my advice to you is to do as sir timothy has asked you  he is such a beast sir said silverbridge  pray do not speak in that way on matters so serious  i do not think you quite understand it sir  perhaps not can you enlighten me  i believe he has done this only to annoy you  the duke who had again seated himself and was leaning back in his chair raised himself up placed his hands on the table before him and looked his son hard in the face the idea which silverbridge had just expressed had certainly occurred to himself he remembered well all the circumstances of the time when he and sir timothy beeswax had been members of the same governmentand he remembered how animosities had grown and how treacherous he had thought the man from the moment in which he had read the ministers letter to the young member he had felt that the offer had too probably come from a desire to make the political separation between himself and his son complete but he had thought that in counselling his son he was bound to ignore such a feeling and it certainly had not occurred to him that silverbridge would be astute enough to perceive the same thing  what makes you fancy that said the duke striving to conceal by his manner but not altogether successful in concealing the gratification which he certainly felt  well sir i am not sure that i can explain it of course it is putting you in a different boat from me  you have already chosen your boat  perhaps he thinks i may get out again i dislike the skipper so much that i am not sure that i shall not  oh silverbridgethat is such a fault so much is included in that which is unstatesmanlike unpatriotic almost dishonest do you mean to say that you would be this or that in politics according to your personal liking for an individual  when you dont trust the leader you cant believe very firmly in the followers said silverbridge doggedly i wont say sir what i may do though i dare say that what i think is not of much account i do think a good deal about it  i am glad of that  and as i think it not at all improbable that i may go back again if you dont mind it i will refuse of course after that the duke had no further arguments to use in favour of sir timothys proposition     chapter lxviii  brook street   silverbridge had now a week on his hands which he felt he might devote to the lady of his love it was a comfort to him that he need have nothing to do with the address to have to go day after day to the treasury in order that he might learn his lesson would have been disagreeable to him he did not quite know how the lesson would have been communicated but fancied it would have come from old roby whom he did not love much better than sir timothy then the speech must have been composed and afterwards submitted to someoneprobably to old roby again by whom no doubt it would be cut and slashed and made quite a different speech than he had intended if he had not praised sir timothy himself robyor whatever other tutor might have been assigned to himwould have put the praise in and then how many hours it would have taken to learn the horrid thing by heart he proudly felt that he had not been prompted by idleness to decline the task but not the less was he glad to have shuffled the burden from off his shoulders  early the next morning he was in brook street having sent a note to say he would call and having even named the hour and yet when he knocked at the door he was told with the utmost indifference by a london footman that miss boncassen was not at homealso that mrs boncassen was not at homealso that mr boncassen was not at home when he asked at what hour miss boncassen was expected home the man answered him just as though he had been anybody else that he knew nothing about it he turned away in disgust and had himself driven to the beargarden in his misery he had recourse to gamepie and a pint of champagne for his lunch halloa old fellow what is this i hear about you said nidderdale coming in and sitting opposite to him  i dont know what you have heard  you are going to second the address what made them pick you out from the lot of us  it is just what i am not going to do  i saw it all in the papers  i dare sayand yet it isnt true i shouldnt wonder if they ask you at this moment a waiter handed a large official letter to lord nidderdale saying that the messenger who had brought it was waiting for an answer in the hall the letter bore the important signature of t beeswax on the corner of the envelope and so disturbed lord nidderdale that he called at once for a glass of sodaandbrandy when opened it was found to be very nearly a counterpart of that which silverbridge had received down in the country there was however added a little prayer that lord nidderdale would at once come down to the treasury chambers  they must be very hard up said lord nidderdale but i shall do it cantrip is always at me to do something and you see if i dont butter them up properly then having fortified himself with gamepie and a glass of brown sherry he went away at once to the treasury chambers  silverbridge felt himself a little better after his lunchbetter still when he had smoked a couple of cigarettes walking about the empty smokingroom and as he walked he collected his thoughts she could hardly have meant to slight him no doubt her letter down to him at harrington had been very cold no doubt he had been illtreated in being sent away so unceremoniously from the door but yet she could hardly intend that everything between them should be over even an american girl could not be so unreasonable as that he remembered the passionate way in which she had assured him of her love all that could not have been forgotten he had done nothing by which he could have forfeited her esteem she had desired him to tell the whole affair to her father and he had done so mr boncassen might perhaps have objected it might be that this american was so prejudiced against english aristocrats as to desire no commerce with them there were not many englishmen who would not have welcomed him as soninlaw but americans might be different stillstill isabel would hardly have shown her obedience to her father in this way she was too independent to obey her father in a matter concerning her own heart and if he had not been the possessor of her heart at that last interview then she must have been false indeed so he got once more into his hansom and had himself taken back to brook street  mrs boncassen was in the drawingroom alone  i am so sorry said the lady but mr boncassen has i think just gone out  indeed and where is isabel  isabel is downstairsthat is if she hasnt gone out too she did talk of going with her father to the museum she is getting quite bookish she has got a ticket and goes there and has all the things brought to her just like the other learned folks  i am anxious to see her mrs boncassen  my if she has gone out it will be a pity she was only saying yesterday she wouldnt wonder if you shouldnt turn up  of course ive turned up mrs boncassen i was here an hour ago  was it you who called and asked all them questions my we couldnt make out who it was the man said it was a flurried young gentleman who wouldnt leave a cardbut who wanted to see mr boncassen most especial  it was isabel i wanted to see didnt i leave a card no i dont think i did i felt soalmost at home that i didnt think of a card  thats very kind of you lord silverbridge  i hope you are going to be my friend mrs boncassen  i am sure i dont know lord silverbridge isabel is most used to having her own way i guess i think when hearts are joined almost nothing ought to stand between them but mr boncassen does have doubts he dont wish as isabel should force herself anywhere but here she is and now she can speak for herself whereupon not only did isabel enter the room but at the same time mrs boncassen most discreetly left it it must be confessed that american mothers are not afraid of their daughters  silverbridge when the door was closed stood looking at the girl for a moment and thought that she was more lovely than ever she was dressed for walking she still had on her fur jacket but had taken off her hat i was in the parlour downstairs she said when you came in with papa and we were going out together but when i heard who was here i made him go alone was i not good  he had not thought of a word to say or a thing to dobut he felt as he looked at her that the only thing in the world worth living for was to have her for his own for a moment he was half abashed then in the next she was close in his arms with his lips pressed to hers he had been so sudden that she had been unable at any rate thought that she had been unable to repress him lord silverbridge she said i told you i would not have it you have offended me  isabel  yes isabel isabel is offended with you why did you do it  why did he do it it seemed to him to be the most unnecessary question i want you to know how i love you  will that tell me that only tells me how little you think of me  then it tells you a falsehoodfor i am thinking of you always and i always think of you as being the best and dearest and sweetest thing in the world and now i think you dearer and sweeter than ever upon this she tried to frown but her frown at once broke out into a smile when i wrote to say that i was coming why did you not stay at home for me this morning  i got no letter lord silverbridge  why didnt you get it  that i cannot say lord silverbridge  isabel if you are so formal you will kill me  lord silverbridge if you are so forward you will offend me then it turned out that no letter from him had reached the house and as the letter had been addressed to bruton street instead of brook street the failure on the part of the postoffice was not surprising  whether or no she were offended or he killed he remained with her the whole of that afternoon of course i love you she said do you suppose i should be here with you if i did not or that you could have remained in the house after what you did just now i am not given to run into rhapsodies quite so much as you areand being a woman perhaps it is as well that i dont but i think i can be quite as true to you as you are to me  i am so much obliged to you for that he said grasping at her hand  but i am sure that rhapsodies wont do any good now ill tell you my mind  you know mine said silverbridge  i will take it for granted that i do your mind is to marry me will ye nill ye as the people say he answered this by merely nodding his head and getting a little nearer to her that is all very well in its way and i am not going to say but what i am gratified then he did grasp her hand if it pleases you to hear me say so lord silverbridge  not lord  then i shall call you plantagenetonly it sounds so horribly historical why are you not thomas or abraham but if it will please you to hear me say so i am ready to acknowledge that nothing in all my life ever came near to the delight i have in your love hereupon he almost succeeded in getting his arm round her waist but she was strong and seized his hand and held it and i speak no rhapsodies i tell you a truth which i want you to know and to keep in your heartso that you may be always always sure of it  i never will doubt it  but that marrying will ye nill ye will not suit me there is so much wanted for happiness in life  i will do all that i can  yes even though it be hazardous i am willing to trust you if you were as other men are if you could do as you please as lower men may do i would leave father and mother and my own countrythat i might be your wife i would do that because i love you but what will my life be here if they who are your friends turn their backs upon me what will your life be if through all that you continue to love me  that will all come right  and what will your life be or mine she said going on with her own thoughts without seeming to have heard his last words if in such a condition as that you did not continue to love me  i should always love you  it might be very hardand if once felt to be hard then impossible you have not looked at it as i have done why should you even with a wife that was a trouble to you  oh isabel  his arm was now round her waist but she continued speaking as though she were not aware of the embrace yes a trouble i shall not be always just what i am now now i can be bright and pretty and hold my own with others because i am so but are you surei am notthat i am such stuff as an english lady should be made of if in ten years time you found that others did not think sothat worse again you did not think so yourself would you be true to me then  i will always be true to you  she gently extricated herself as though she had done so that she might better turn round and look into his face oh my own one who can say of himself that it would be so how could it be so when you would have all the world against you you would still be what you arewith a clog round your leg while at home in parliament among your friends at your clubs you would be just what you are you would be that lord silverbridge who had all good things at his disposalexcept that he had been unfortunate in his marriage but what should i be though she paused he could not answer hernot yet there was a solemnity in her speech which made it necessary that he should hear her to the end i too have my friends in my own country it is no disgrace to me there that my grandfather worked on the quays no one holds her head higher than i do or is more sure of being able to hold it i have there that assurance of esteem and honour which you have here i would lose it all to do you a good but i will not lose it to do you an injury  i dont know about injuries he said getting up and walking about the room but i am sure of this you will have to be my wife  if your father will take me by the hand and say that i shall be his daughter i will risk all the rest even then it might not be wise but we love each other too well not to run some peril do you think that i want anything better than to preside in your home to soften your cares to welcome your joys to be the mother perhaps of your children and to know that you are proud that i should be so no my darling i can see a paradiseonly only i may not be fit to enter it i must use some judgment better than my own sounder dear than yours tell the duke what i saytell him with what language a son may use to his father and remember that all you ask for yourself you will ask doubly for me  i will ask him so that he cannot refuse me  if you do i shall be contented and now go i have said ever so much and i am tired  isabel oh my love  yes isabelyour love i am that at any rate for the presentand proud to be so as a queen well if it must be this onceas i have been so hard to you then she gave him her cheek to kiss but of course he took more than she gave  when he got out into the street it was dark and there was still standing the faithful cab but he felt that at the present moment it would be impossible to sit still and he dismissed the equipage he walked rapidly along brook street into park lane and from thence to the park hardly knowing whither he went in the enthusiasm of the moment he walked back to the marble arch and thence round by the drive to the guard house and the bridge over the serpentine by the knightsbridge barracks to hyde park corner though he should give up everything and go and live in her own country with her he would marry her his politics his hunting his address to the queen his horses his guns his fathers wealth and his own rankwhat were they all to isabel boncassen in meeting her he had met the one human being in all the world who could really be anything to him either in friendship or in love when she had told him what she would do for him to make his home happy it had seemed to him that all other delights must fade away from him for ever how odious were tifto and his racehorses how unmeaning the noise of his club how terrible the tedium of those parliamentary benches he could not tell his love as she had told hers he acknowledged to himself that his words could not be as her wordsnor his intellect as hers but his heart could be as true she had spoken to him of his name his rank and all his outside world around him he would make her understand at last that they were nothing to him in comparison with her when he had got round to hyde park corner he felt that he was almost compelled to go back again to brook street in no other place could there be anything to interest himnowhere else could there be light or warmth or joy but what would she think of him to go back hot and soiled with mud in order that he might say one more adieuthat possibly he might ravish one more kisswould hardly be manly he must postpone all that for the morrow on the morrow of course he would be there  but his work was all before him that prayer had to be made to his father or rather some wonderful effort of eloquence must be made by which his father might be convinced that this girl was so infinitely superior to anything of feminine creation that had ever hitherto been seen or heard of that all ideas as to birth country rank or name ought in this instance to count for nothing he did believe himself that he had found such a pearl that no question of setting need be taken into consideration if the duke would not see it the fault would be in the dukes eyes or perhaps in his own wordsbut certainly not in the pearl  then he compared her to poor lady mabel and in doing so did arrive at something near the truth in his inward delineation of the two characters lady mabel with all her grace with all her beauty with all her talent was a creature of efforts or as it might be called a manufactured article she strove to be graceful to be lovely to be agreeable and clever isabel was all this and infinitely more without any struggle when he was most fond of mabel most anxious to make her his wife there had always been present to him a feeling that she was old though he knew her age to a dayand knew her to be younger than himself yet she was old something had gone of her native bloom something had been scratched and chipped from the first fair surface and this had been repaired by varnish and veneering though he had loved her he had never been altogether satisfied with her but isabel was as young as hebe he knew nothing of her actual years but he did know that to have seemed younger or to have seemed olderto have seemed in any way different from what she waswould have been to be less perfect     chapter lxix  pert poppet   on a sunday morningwhile lord silverbridge was alone in a certain apartment in the house in carlton terrace which was called his own sittingroom the name was brought him of a gentleman who was anxious to see him he had seen his father and had used all the eloquence of which he was masterbut not quite with the effect which he had desired his father had been very kind but he too had been eloquentand had as is often the case with orators been apparently more moved by his own words than by those of his adversary if he had not absolutely declared himself as irrevocably hostile to miss boncassen he had not said a word that might be supposed to give token of assent  silverbridge therefore was moody contemplative and desirous of solitude nothing that the duke had said had shaken him he was still sure of his pearl and quite determined that he would wear it various thoughts were running through his brain what if he were to abdicate the title and become a republican he was inclined to think that he could not abdicate but he was quite sure that no one could prevent him from going to america and calling himself mr palliser that his father would forgive him and accept the daughterinlaw brought to him were he in the first place to marry without sanction he felt quite sure what was there that his father would not forgive but then isabel would not assent to this he was turning it all in his head and ever and anon trying to relieve his mind by clarissa which he was reading in conformity with his fathers advice when the gentlemans card was put into his hand whatever does he want here he said to himself and then he ordered that the gentleman might be shown up the gentleman in question was our old friend dolly longstaff dolly longstaff and silverbridge had been intimate as young men are but they were not friends nor as far as silverbridge knew had dolly ever set his foot in that house before well dolly said he whats the matter now  i suppose you are surprised to see me  i didnt think that you were ever up so early it was at this time almost noon  oh come now thats nonsense i can get up as early as anybody else i have changed all that for the last four months i was at breakfast this morning very soon after ten  what a miracle is there anything i can do for you  well yesthere is of course you are surprised to see me  you never were here before and therefore it is odd  it is odd i felt that myself and when i tell you what i have come about you will think it more odd i know i can trust you with a secret  that depends dolly  what i mean is i know you are goodnatured there are ever so many fellows that are ones most intimate friends that would say anything on earth they could that was illnatured  i hope they are not my friends  oh yes they are think of glasslough or popplecourt or hindes if they knew anything about you that you didnt want to have knownabout a young lady or anything of that kinddont you think theyd tell everybody  a man cant tell anything he doesnt know  thats true i had thought of that myself but then theres a particular reason for my telling you this it is about a young lady you wont tell will you  no i wont but i cant see why on earth you should come to me you are ever so many years older than i am  i had thought of that too but you are just the person i must tell i want you to help me  these last words were said in a whisper and dolly as he said them had drawn nearer to his friend silverbridge remained in suspense saying nothing by way of encouragement dolly either in love with his own mystery or doubtful of his own purpose sat still looking eagerly at his companion what the mischief is it asked silverbridge impatiently  i have quite made up my own mind  thats a good thing at any rate  i am not what you would have called a marrying sort of man  i should have saidno but i suppose most men do marry sooner or later  thats just what i said to myself it has to be done you know there are three different properties coming to me at least one has come already  youre a lucky fellow  ive made up my mind and when i say a thing i mean to do it  but what can i do  thats just what im coming to if a man does marry i think he ought to be attached to her to this as a broad proposition silverbridge was ready to accede but regarding dolly as a middleaged sort of fellow one of those men who marry because it is convenient to have a house kept for them he simply nodded his head i am awfully attached to her dolly went on to say  thats all right  of course there are fellows who marry girls for their money ive known men who have married their grandmothers  not really  that kind of thing when a woman is old it does not much matter who she is but my one shes not old  nor rich  well i dont know about that but im not after her money pray understand that its because im downright fond of her shes an american  a what said silverbridge startled  you know her thats the reason ive come to you its miss boncassen a dark frown came across the young mans face that all this should be said to him was disgusting that an owl like that should dare to talk of loving miss boncassen was offensive to him  its because you know her that ive come to you she thinks that youre after her dolly as he said this lifted himself quickly up in his seat and nodded his head mysteriously as he looked into his companions face it was as much as though he should say i see you are surprised but so it is then he went on she does the pert poppet this was almost too much for silverbridge but still he contained himself she wont look at me because she has got it into her head that perhaps some day she may be duchess of omnium that of course is out of the question  upon my word all this seems to me to be so veryverydistasteful that i think you had better say nothing more about it  it is distasteful said dolly but the truth is i am so downrightwhat you may call enamoured  dont talk such stuff as that here said silverbridge jumping up i wont have it  but i am there is nothing i wouldnt do to get her of course its a good match for her ive got three separate properties and when the governor goes off i shall have a clear fifteen thousand a year  oh bother  of course thats nothing to you but it is a very tidy income for a commoner and how is she to do better  i dont know how she could do much worse said silverbridge in a transport of rage then he pulled his moustache in vexation angry with himself that he should have allowed himself to say even a word on so preposterous a supposition isabel boncassen and dolly longstaff it was titania and bottom over again it was absolutely necessary that he should get rid of this intruder and he began to be afraid that he could not do this without using language which would be uncivil upon my word he said i think you had better not talk about it any more the young lady is one for whom i have a very great respect  i mean to marry her said dolly thinking thus to vindicate himself  you might as well think of marrying one of the stars  one of the stars  or a royal princess  well perhaps that is your opinion but i cant say that i agree with you i dont see why she shouldnt take me i can give her a position which you may call al out of the peerage i can bring her into society i can make an english lady of her  you cant make anything of herexcept to insult herand me too by talking of her  i dont quite understand this said the unfortunate lover getting up from his seat very likely she wont have me perhaps she has told you so  she never mentioned your name to me in her life i dont suppose she remembers your existence  but i say that there can be no insult in such a one as me asking such a one as her to be my wife to say that she doesnt remember my existence is absurd  why should i be troubled with all this  because i think youre making a fool of her and because im honest thats why said dolly with much energy there was something in this which partly reconciled silverbridge to his despised rival there was a touch of truth about the man though he was so utterly mistaken in his ideas i want you to give over in order that i may try again i dont think you ought to keep a girl from her promotion merely for the fun of a flirtation perhaps youre fond of herbut you wont marry her i am fond of her and i shall  after a minutes pause silverbridge resolved that he would be magnanimous miss boncassen is going to be my wife he said  your wife  yesmy wife and now i think you will see that nothing further can be said about this matter  duchess of omnium  she will be lady silverbridge  oh of course shell be that first then ive got nothing further to say im not going to enter myself to run against you only i shouldnt have believed it if anybody else had told me  such is my good fortune  oh ahyes of course that is one way of looking at it well silverbridge ill tell you what i shall do i shall hook it  no no not you  yes i shall i dare say you wont believe me but ive got such a feeling about me hereas he said this he laid his hand upon his heartthat if i stayed i should go in for hard drinking i shall take the great asiatic tour i know a fellow that wants to go but he hasnt got any money i dare say i shall be off before the end of next month you dont know any fellow that would buy halfadozen hunters do you silverbridge shook his head goodbye said dolly in a melancholy tone i am sure i am very much obliged to you for telling me if id known youd meant it i shouldnt have meddled of course duchess of omnium  look here dolly i have told you what i should not have told any one but i wanted to screen the young ladys name  it was so kind of you  do not repeat it it is a kind of thing that ladies are particular about they choose their own time for letting everybody know then dolly promised to be as mute as a fish and took his departure  silverbridge had felt towards the end of the interview that he had been arrogant to the unfortunate manparticularly in saying that the young lady would not remember the existence of such a suitorand had also recognised a certain honesty in the mans purpose which had not been the less honest because it was so absurd actuated by the consciousness of this he had swallowed his anger and had told the whole truth nevertheless things had been said which were horrible to him this buffoon of a man had called his isabel apert poppet how was he to get over the remembrance of such an offence and then the wretch had declared that he wasenamoured there was sacrilege in the term when applied by such a man to isabel boncassen he had thoughts of days to come when everything would be settled when he might sit close to her and call her pretty nameswhen he might in sweet familiarity tell her that she was a little yankee and a fierce republican and chaff her about the stars and stripes and then as he pictured the scene to himself in his imagination she would lean upon him and would give him back his chaff and would call him an aristocrat and would laugh at his titles as he thought of all this he would be proud with the feeling that such privileges would be his own and now this wretched man had called her a pert poppet  there was a sanctity about hera divinity which made it almost a profanity to have talked about her at all to such a one as dolly longstaff she was his holy of holies at which vulgar eyes should not even be allowed to gaze it had been a most unfortunate interview but this was clear that as he had announced his engagement to such a one as dolly longstaff the matter now would admit of no delay he would explain to his father that as tidings of the engagement had got abroad honour to the young lady would compel him to come forward openly as her suitor at once if this argument might serve him then perhaps this intrusion would not have been altogether a misfortune     chapter lxx  love may be a great misfortune   silverbridge when he reached brook street that day was surprised to find that a large party was going to lunch there isabel had asked him to come and he had thought her the dearest girl in the world for doing so but now his gratitude for that favour was considerably abated he did not care just now for the honour of eating his lunch in the presence of mr gotobed the american minister whom he found there already in the drawingroom with mrs gotobed nor with ezekiel sevenkings the great american poet from the far west who sat silent and stared at him in an unpleasant way when sir timothy beeswax was announced with lady beeswax and her daughter his gratification certainly was not increased and the last comerwho did not arrive indeed till they were all seated at the tablealmost made him start from his chair and take his departure suddenly that last comer was no other than mr adolphus longstaff as it happened he was seated next to dolly with lady beeswax on the other side of him whereas his holy of holies was on the other side of dolly the arrangement made seemed to him to have been monstrous he had endeavoured to get next to isabel but she had so manoeuvred that there should be a vacant chair between them he had not much regarded this because a vacant chair may be pushed on one side but before he had made all his calculations dolly longstaff was sitting there he almost thought that dolly winked at him in triumphthat very dolly who an hour ago had promised to take himself off upon his asiatic travels  sir timothy and the minister kept up the conversation very much between them sir timothy flattering everything that was american and the minister finding fault with very many things that were english now and then mr boncassen would put in a word to soften the severe honesty of his countryman or to correct the euphemistic falsehoods of sir timothy the poet seemed always to be biding his time dolly ventured to whisper a word to his neighbour it was but to say that the frost had broken up but silverbridge heard it and looked daggers at everyone then lady beeswax expressed to him a hope that he was going to do great things in parliament this session i dont mean to go near the place he said not at all conveying any purpose to which he had really come but driven by the stress of the moment to say something that should express his general hatred of everybody mr lupton was there on the other side of isabel and was soon engaged with her in a pleasant familiar conversation then silverbridge remembered that he had always thought lupton to be a most conceited prig nobody gave himself so many airs or was so careful as to the dyeing of his whiskers it was astonishing that isabel should allow herself to be amused by such an antiquated coxcomb when they had finished eating they moved about and changed their places mr boncassen being rather anxious to stop the flood of american eloquence which came from his friend mr gotobed british viands had become subject to his criticism and mr gotobed had declared to mr lupton that he didnt believe that london could produce a dish of squash or tomatoes he was quite sure you couldnt have sweet corn then there had been a moving of seats in which the minister was shuffled off to lady beeswax and the poet found himself by the side of isabel do you not regret our mountains and our prairies said the poet our great waters and our green savannahs i think more perhaps of fifth avenue said miss boncassen silverbridge who at this moment was being interrogated by sir timothy heard every word of it  i was so sorry lord silverbridge said sir timothy that you could not accede to our little request  i did not quite see my way said silverbridge with his eye upon isabel  so i understood but i hope that things will make themselves clearer to you shortly there is nothing that i desire so much as the support of young men such as yourselfthe very cream i may say of the whole country it is to the young conservative thoughtfulness and the truly british spirit of our springing aristocracy that i look for that reaction which i am sure will at last carry us safely over the rocks and shoals of communistic propensities  i shouldnt wonder if it did said silverbridge they didnt think that he was going to remain down there talking politics to an old humbug like sir timothy when the sun and moon and all the stars had gone up into the drawingroom for at that moment isabel was making her way to the door  but sir timothy had buttonholed him of course it is late now to say anything further about the address we have arranged that not quite as i would have wished for i had set my heart upon initiating you into the rapturous pleasure of parliamentary debate but i hope that a good time is coming and pray remember this lord silverbridgethere is no member sitting on our side of the house and i need hardly say on the other whom i would go farther to oblige than your fathers son  im sure thats very kind said silverbridge absolutely using a little force as he disengaged himself then he at once followed the ladies upstairs passing the poet on the stairs you have hardly spoken to me he whispered to isabel he knew that to whisper to her now with the eyes of many upon him with the ears of many open was an absurdity but he could not refrain himself  there are so many to beentertained as people say i dont think i ought to have to entertain you she answered laughing no one heard her but silverbridge yet she did not seem to whisper she left him however at once and was soon engaged in conversation with sir timothy  a convivial lunch i hold to be altogether bad but the worst of its many evils is that vacillating mind which does not know when to take its owner off silverbridge was on this occasion quite determined not to take himself off at all as it was only a lunch the people must go and then he would be left with isabel but the vacillation of the others was distressing to him mr lupton went and poor dolly got away apparently without a word but the beeswaxes and the gotobeds would not go and the poet sat staring immovably in the meanwhile silverbridge endeavoured to make the time pass lightly by talking to mrs boncassen he had been so determined to accept isabel with all her adjuncts that he had come almost to like mrs boncassen and would certainly have taken her part violently had any one spoken ill of her in his presence  then suddenly he found that the room was nearly empty the beeswaxes and the gotobeds were gone and at last the poet himself with a final glare of admiration at isabel had taken his departure when silverbridge looked round isabel also was gone then too mrs boncassen had left the room suddenly at the same instant mr boncassen entered by another door and the two men were alone together my dear lord silverbridge said the father i want to have a few words with you of course there was nothing for him but to submit you remember what you said to me down at matching  oh yes i remember that  you did me the great honour of expressing a wish to make my child your wife  i was asking for a very great favour  that alsofor there is no greater favour i could do to any man than to give him my daughter nevertheless you were doing me a great honourand you did it as you do everything with an honest grace that went far to win my heart i am not at all surprised sir that you should have won hers the young man as he heard this could only blush and look foolish if i know my girl neither your money nor your title would go for anything  i think much more of her love mr boncassen than i do of anything else in the world  but love my lord may be a great misfortune as he said this the tone of his voice was altered and there was a melancholy solemnity not only in his words but in his countenance i take it that young people when they love rarely think of more than the present moment if they did so the bloom would be gone from their romance but others have to do this for them if isabel had come to me saying that she loved a poor man there would not have been much to disquiet me a poor man may earn bread for himself and his wife and if he failed i could have found them bread nor had she loved somewhat below her own degree should i have opposed her so long as her husband had been an educated man there might have been no future punishment to fear  i dont think she could have done that said silverbridge  at any rate she has not done so but how am i to look upon this that she has done  ill do my best for her mr boncassen  i believe you would but even your love cant make her an englishwoman you can make her a duchess  not that sir  but you cant give her a parentage fit for a duchessnot fit at least in the opinion of those with whom you will pass your life with whomor perhaps without whomshe will be destined to pass her life if she becomes your wife unfortunately it does not suffice that you should think it fit though you loved each other as well as any man and woman that ever were brought into each others arms by the beneficence of god you cannot make her happyunless you can assure her the respect of those around her  all the world will respect her  her conductyes i think the world your world would learn to do that i do not think it could help itself but that would not suffice i may respect the man who cleans my boots but he would be a wretched man if he were thrown on me for society i would not give him my society will your duchesses and your countesses give her theirs  certainly they will  i do not ask for it as thinking it to be of more value than that of others but were she to become your wife she would be so abnormally placed as to require it for her comfort she would have become a lady of high ranknot because she loves rank but because she loves you  yes yes yes said silverbridge hardly himself knowing why he became impetuous  but having removed herself into that position being as she would be a countess or a duchess or what not how could she be happy if she were excluded from the community of countesses and duchesses  they are not like that said silverbridge  i will not say that they are but i do not know having anglican tendencies i have been wont to contradict my countrymen when they have told me of the narrow exclusiveness of your nobles having found your nobles and your commoners all alike in their courtesywhich is a cold word in their hospitable friendshipsi would now not only contradict but would laugh to scorn any such chargeso far he spoke somewhat loudly and then dropped his voice as he concludedwere it anything less than the happiness of my child that is in question  what am i to say sir i only know this i am not going to lose her  you are a fine fellow i was going to say that i wished you were an american so that isabel need not lose you but my boy i have told you that i do not know how it might be of all whom you know who could best tell me the truth on such a subject who is there whose age will have given him experience whose rank will have made him familiar with this matter who from friendship to you would be least likely to decide against your wishes who from his own native honesty would be most sure to tell the truth  you mean my father said silverbridge  i do mean your father happily he has taken no dislike to the girl herself i have seen enough of him to feel sure that he is devoted to his own children  indeed he is  a just and a liberal manone i should say not carried away by prejudices wellmy girl and i have just put our heads together and we have come to a conclusion if the duke of omnium will tell us that she would be safe as your wifesafe from the contempt of those around heryou shall have her and i shall rejoice to give her to younot because you are lord silverbridge not because of your rank and wealth but because you arethat individual human being whom i now hold by the hand  when the american had come to an end silverbridge was too much moved to make any immediate answer he had an idea in his own mind that the appeal was not altogether fair his father was a just manjust affectionate and liberal but then it will so often happen that fathers do not want their sons to marry those very girls on whom the sons have set their hearts he could only say that he would speak to his father again on the subject let him tell me that he is contented said mr boncassen and i will tell him that i am contented now my friend goodbye silverbridge begged that he might be allowed to see isabel before he was turned out but isabel had left the house in company with her mother     chapter lxxi  what am i to say sir   when silverbridge left mr boncassens house he was resolved to go to his father without an hours delay and represent to the duke exactly how the case stood he would be urgent piteous submissive and eloquent in any other matter he would promise to make whatever arrangements his father might desire he would make his father understand that all his happiness depended on this marriage when once married he would settle down even at gatherum castle if the duke should wish it he would not think of racehorses he would desert the beargarden he would learn bluebooks by heart and only do as much shooting and hunting as would become a young nobleman in his position all this he would say as eagerly and as pleasantly as it might be said but he would add to all this an assurance of his unchangeable intention it was his purpose to marry isabel boncassen if he could do this with his fathers good willso best but at any rate he would marry her  the world at this time was altogether busy with political rumours and it was supposed that sir timothy beeswax would do something very clever it was supposed also that he would sever himself from some of his present companions on that point everybody was agreedand on that point only everybody was right lord drummond who was the titular prime minister and sir timothy had during a considerable part of the last session and through the whole vacation so belarded each other with praise in all their public expressions that it was quite manifest that they had quarrelled when any body of statesmen make public asseverations by one or various voices that there is no discord among them not a dissentient voice on any subject people are apt to suppose that they cannot hang together much longer it is the man who has no peace at home that declares abroad that his wife is an angel he who lives on comfortable terms with the partner of his troubles can afford to acknowledge the ordinary rubs of life old mr mildmay who was prime minister for so many years and whom his party worshipped used to say that he had never found a gentleman who had quite agreed with him all round but sir timothy has always been in exact accord with all his colleaguestill he has left them or they him never had there been such concord as of lateand men clubs and newspapers now protested that as a natural consequence there would soon be a breakup  but not on that account would it perhaps be necessary that sir timothy should resignor not necessary that his resignation should be permanent the conservative majority had dwindledbut still there was a majority it certainly was the case that lord drummond could not get on without sir timothy but might it not be possible that sir timothy should get on without lord drummond if so he must begin his action in this direction by resigning he would have to place his resignation no doubt with infinite regret in the hands of lord drummond but if such a step were to be taken now just as parliament was about to assemble what would become of the queens speech of the address and of the noble peers and noble and other commoners who were to propose and second it in the two houses of parliament there were those who said that such a trick played at the last moment would be very shabby but then again there were those who foresaw that the shabbiness would be made to rest anywhere rather than on the shoulders of sir timothy if it should turn out that he had striven manfully to make things run smoothlythat the premiers incompetence or the chancellors obstinacy or this or that secretarys peculiarity of temper had done it allmight not sir timothy then be able to emerge from the confused flood and swim along pleasantly with his head higher than ever above the waters  in these great matters parliamentary management goes for so much if a man be really clever and handy at his trade if he can work hard and knows what he is about if he can give and take and be not thinskinned or sorebored if he can ask pardon for a peccadillo and seem to be sorry with a good grace if above all things he be able to surround himself with the prestige of success then so much will be forgiven him great gifts of eloquence are hardly wanted or a deepseated patriotism which is capable of strong indignation a party has to be managed and he who can manage it best will probably be its best leader the subordinate task of legislation and of executive government may well fall into the inferior hands of less astute practitioners it was admitted on both sides that there was no man like sir timothy for managing the house or coercing a party and there was therefore a general feeling that it would be a pity that sir timothy should be squeezed out he knew all the little secrets of the businesscould arrange let the cause be what it might to get a full house for himself and his friends and empty benches for his opponentscould foresee a thousand little things to which even a walpole would have been blind which a pitt would not have condescended to regard but with which his familiarity made him a very comfortable leader of the house of commons there were various ideas prevalent as to the politics of the coming session but the prevailing idea was in favour of sir timothy  the duke was at longroyston the seat of his old political ally the duke of st bungay and had been absent from sunday the 6th till the morning of friday the 11th on which day parliament was to meet on that morning at about noon a letter came to the son saying that his father had returned and would be glad to see him silverbridge was going to the house on that day and was not without his own political anxieties if lord drummond remained in he thought that he must for the present stand by the party which he had adopted if however sir timothy should become prime minister there would be a loophole for escape there were some three or four besides himself who detested sir timothy and in such case he might perhaps have company in his desertion all this was on his mind but through all this he was aware that there was a matter of much deeper moment which required his energies when his fathers message was brought to him he told himself at once that now was the time for his eloquence  well silverbridge said the duke how are matters going on with you there seemed to be something in his fathers manner more than ordinarily jocund and goodhumoured  with me sir  i dont mean to ask any party secrets if you and sir timothy understand each other of course you will be discreet  i cant be discreet sir because i dont know anything about him  when i heard said the duke smiling of your being in close conference with sir timothy  i sir  yes you mr boncassen told me that you and he were so deeply taken up with each other at his house that nobody could get a word with either of you  have you seen mr boncassen asked the son whose attention was immediately diverted from his fathers political badinage  yesi have seen him i happened to meet him where i was dining last sunday and he walked home with me he was so intent upon what he was saying that i fear he allowed me to take him out of his way  what was he talking about said silverbridge all his preparations all his eloquence all his method now seemed to have departed from him  he was talking about you said the duke  he had told me that he wanted to see you what did he say sir  i suppose you can guess what he said he wished to know what i thought of the offer you have made to his daughter the great subject had come up so easily so readily that he was almost aghast when he found himself in the middle of it and yet he must speak of the matter and that at once  i hope you raised no objection sir he said  the objection came mainly from him and i am bound to say that every word that fell from him was spoken with wisdom  but still he asked you to consent  by no means he told me his opinionand then he asked me a question  i am sure he did not say that we ought not to be married  he did say that he thought you ought not to be married if  if what sir  if there were probability that his daughter would not be well received as your wife then he asked me what would be my reception of her silverbridge looked up into his fathers face with beseeching imploring eyes as though everything now depended on the next few words that he might utter i shall think it an unwise marriage continued the duke silverbridge when he heard this at once knew that he had gained his cause his father had spoken of the marriage as a thing that was to happen a joyous light dawned in his eyes and the look of pain went from his brow all which the duke was not slow to perceive i shall think it an unwise marriage he continued repeating his words but i was bound to tell him that were miss boncassen to become your wife she would also become my daughter  oh sir  i told him why the marriage would be distasteful to me whether i may be wrong or right i think it to be for the good of our country for the good of our order for the good of our individual families that we should support each other by marriage it is not as though we were a narrow class already too closely bound together by family alliances the room for choice might be wide enough for you without going across the atlantic to look for her who is to be the mother of your children to this mr boncassen replied that he was to look solely to his daughters happiness he meant me to understand that he cared nothing for my feelings why should he that which to me is deep wisdom is to him an empty prejudice he asked me then how others would receive her  i am sure that everybody would like her said silverbridge  i like her i like her very much  i am so glad  but still all this is a sorrow to me when however he put that question to me about the world around heras to those among whom her lot would be cast i could not say that i thought she would be rejected  oh no the idea of rejecting isabel  she has a brightness and a grace all her own continued the duke which will ensure her acceptance in all societies  yes yesit is just that sir  you will be a nine days wonderthe foolish young nobleman who chose to marry an american  i think it will be just the other way up siramong the men  but her place will i think be secure to her that is what i told mr boncassen  it is all right with him thennow  if you call it all right you will understand of course that you are acting in opposition to my adviceand my wishes  what am i to say sir exclaimed silverbridge almost in despair when i love the girl better than my life and when you tell me that she can be mine if i choose to take her when i have asked her to be my wife and have got her to say that she likes me when her father has given way and all the rest of it would it be possible that i should say now that i will give her up  my opinion is to go for nothingin anything the duke as he said this knew that he was expressing aloud a feeling which should have been restrained within his own bosom it was natural that there should have been such plaints the same suffering must be encountered in regard to tregear and his daughter in every way he had been thwarted in every direction he was driven to yield and yet now he had to undergo rebuke from his own son because one of those inward plaints would force itself from his lips of course this girl was to be taken in among the pallisers and treated with an idolatrous loveas perfect as though all the blood of all the howards were running in her veins what further inch of ground was there for a fight and if the fight were over why should he rob his boy of one sparkle from off the joy of his triumph silverbridge was now standing before him abashed by that plaint inwardly sustained no doubt by the conviction of his great success but subdued by his fathers wailing howeverperhaps we had better let that pass said the duke with a long sigh then silverbridge took his fathers hand and looked up in his face i most sincerely hope that she may make you a good and loving wife said the duke and that she may do her duty by you in that not easy sphere of life to which she will be called  i am quite sure she will said silverbridge whose ideas as to isabels duties were confined at present to a feeling that she would now have to give him kisses without stint  what i have seen of her personally recommends her to me said the duke some girls are fools  thats quite true sir  who think that the world is to be nothing but dancing and going to parties  many have been doing it for so many years said silverbridge that they cant understand that there should be an end of it  a wife ought to feel the great responsibility of her position i hope she will  and the sooner she begins the better said silverbridge stoutly  and now said the duke looking at his watch we might as well have lunch and go down to the house i will walk with you if you please it will be about time for each of us then the son was forced to go down and witness the somewhat faded ceremony of seeing parliament opened by three lords sitting in commission before the throne whereas but for such stress as his father had laid upon him he would have disregarded his parliamentary duties and have rushed at once up to brook street as it was he was so handed over from one political pundit to another was so buttonholed by sir timothy so chaffed as to the address by phineas finn and at last so occupied with the whole matter that he was compelled to sit in his place till he had heard nidderdale make his speech this the young scotch lord did so well and received so much praise for the doing of it and looked so well in his uniform that silverbridge almost regretted the opportunity he had lost at seven the sitting was over the speeches though full of interest having been shorter than usual they had been full of interest but nobody understood in the least what was going to happen i dont know anything about the prime minister said mr lupton as he left the house with our hero and another not very staunch supporter of the government but ill back sir timothy to be the leader of the house on the last day of the session against all comers i dont think it much matters who is prime minister nowadays  at halfpast seven silverbridge was at the door in brook street yes miss boncassen was at home the servant thought that she was upstairs dressing then silverbridge made his way without further invitation into the drawingroom there he remained alone for ten minutes at last the door opened and mrs boncassen entered dear lord silverbridge who ever dreamed of seeing you i thought all you parliament gentlemen were going through your ceremonies isabel had a ticket and went down and saw your father  where is isabel  shes gone  gone where on earth has she gone to asked silverbridge as though fearing lest she had been carried off to the other side of the atlantic then mrs boncassen explained within the last three minutes mrs montacute jones had called and carried isabel off to the play mrs jones was up in town for a week and this had been a very old engagement i hope you did not want her very particularly said mrs boncassen  but i didmost particularly said lord silverbridge the door was opened and mr boncassen entered the room i beg your pardon for coming at such a time said the lover but i did so want to see isabel  i rather think she wants to see you said the father  i shall go to the theatre after her  that might be awkwardparticularly as i doubt whether anybody knows what theatre they are gone to can i receive a message for her my lord this was certainly not what lord silverbridge had intended you know perhaps that i have seen the duke  oh yesand i have seen him everything is settled  that is the only message she will want to hear when she comes home she is a happy girl and i am proud to think that i should live to call such a grand young briton as you my soninlaw then the american took the young mans two hands and shook them cordially while mrs boncassen bursting into tears insisted on kissing him  indeed she is a happy girl said she but i hope isabel wont be carried away too high and mighty     chapter lxxii  carlton terrace   three days after this it was arranged that isabel should be taken to carlton terrace to be accepted there into the full good graces of her future fatherinlaw and to go through the pleasant ceremony of seeing the house in which it was to be her destiny to live as mistress what can be more interesting to a girl than this first visit to her future home and now isabel boncassen was to make her first visit to the house in carlton terrace which the duke had already declared his purpose of surrendering to the young couple she was going among very grand thingsso grand that those whose affairs in life are less magnificent may think that her mind should have soared altogether above chairs and tables and reposed itself among diamonds gold and silver ornaments rich necklaces the old masters and alabaster statuary but dukes and duchesses must sit upon chairsor at any rate on sofasas well as their poorer brethren and probably have the same regard for their comfort isabel was not above her future furniture or the rooms that were to be her rooms or the stairs which she would have to tread or the pillow on which her head must rest she had never yet seen even the outside of the house in which she was to live and was now prepared to make her visit with as much enthusiasm as though her future abode was to be prepared for her in a small house in a small street beyond islington  but the duke was no doubt more than the house the fatherinlaw more than the tables isabel in the ordinary way of society he had already known almost with intimacy she the while had been well aware that if all things could possibly be made to run smoothly with her this lordly host who was so pleasantly courteous to her would become her fatherinlaw but she had known also that he in his courtesy had been altogether unaware of any such intention on her part and that she would now present herself to him in an aspect very different from that in which she had hitherto been regarded she was well aware that the duke had not wished to take her into his familywould not himself have chosen her for his sons wife she had seen enough to make her sure that he had even chosen another bride for his heir she had been too clever not to perceive that lady mabel grex had been not only selectedbut almost accepted as though the thing had been certain she had learned nearly the whole truth from silverbridge who was not good at keeping a secret from one to whom his heart was open that story had been all but read by her with exactness i cannot lose you now she had said to him leaning on his armi cannot afford to lose you now but i fear that someone else is losing you to this he answered nothing but simply pressed her closer to his side someone else she continued who perhaps may have reason to think that you have injured her no he said boldly no there is no such person for he had never ceased to assure himself that in all that matter with mabel grex he had been guilty of no treachery there had been a moment indeed in which she might have taken him but she had chosen to let it pass from her all of which or nearly all of whichisabel now saw and had seen also that the duke had been a consenting party to that other arrangement she had reason therefore to doubt the manner of her acceptance  but she had been accepted she had made such acceptance by him a stipulation in her acceptance of his son she was sure of the ground on which she trod and was determined to carry herself if not with pride yet with dignity there might be difficulties before her but it should not be her fault if she were not as good a countess andwhen time would have it soas good a duchess as another  the visit was made not quite in the fashion in which silverbridge himself had wished his idea had been to call for isabel in his cab and take her down to carlton terrace mother must go with me she had said then he looked blankas he could look when he was disappointed as he had looked when she would not talk to him at the lunch when she told him that it was not her business to entertain him dont be selfish she added laughing do you think that mother will not want to have seen the house that i am to live in  she shall come afterwards as often as she likes  whatpaying me morning visits from new york she must come now if you please love me love my mother  i am awfully fond of her said silverbridge who felt that he really had behaved well to the old lady  so am iand therefore she shall go and see the house now you are as good as goldand do everything just as i tell you but a good time is coming when i shall have to do everything that you tell me then it was arranged that mrs and miss boncassen were to be taken down to the house in their own carriage and were to be received at the door by lord silverbridge  another arrangement had also been made isabel was to be taken to the duke immediately upon her arrival and to be left for awhile with him alone so that he might express himself as he might find fit to do to this newlyadopted child it was a matter to him of such importance that nothing remaining to him in his life could equal it it was not simply that she was to be the wife of his sonthough that in itself was a consideration very sacred had it been gerald who was bringing to him a bride the occasion would have had less of awe but this girl this american girl was to be the mother and grandmother of future dukes of omniumthe ancestress it was to be hoped of all future dukes of omnium by what she might be by what she might have in her of mental fibre of high or low quality of true or untrue womanliness were to be fashioned those who in days to come might be amongst the strongest and most faithful bulwarks of the constitution an england without a duke of omniumor at any rate without any dukewhat would it be and yet he knew that with bad dukes his country would be in worse stress than though she had none at all an aristocracyyes but an aristocracy that shall be of the very best he believed himself thoroughly in his order but if his order or many of his order should become as was now lord grex then he thought that his order not only must go to the wall but that in the cause of humanity it had better do so with all this daily hourly always in his mind this matter of the choice of a wife for his heir was to him of solemn importance  when they arrived silverbridge was there and led them first of all into the diningroom my said mrs boncassen as she looked around her i thought that our fifth avenue parlours whipped everything in the way of city houses  what a nice little room for darby and joan to sit down to eat a muttonchop in said isabel  its a beastly great barrack said silverbridgebut the best of it is that we never use it well have a cosy little place for darby and joanyoull see now come to the governor ive got to leave you with him  oh me i am in such a fright  he cant eat you said mrs boncassen  and he wont even bite said silverbridge  i should not mind that because i could bite again but if he looks as though he thought i shouldnt do i shall drop  my belief is that hes almost as much in love with you as i am said silverbridge as he took her to the door of the dukes room here we are sir  my dear said the duke rising up and coming to her i am very glad to see you it is good of you to come to me then he took her in both his hands and kissed her forehead and her lips she as she put her face up to him stood quite still in his embrace but her eyes were bright with pleasure  shall i leave her said silverbridge  for a few minutes  dont keep her too long for i want to take her all over the house  a few minutesand then i will bring her up to the drawingroom upon this the door was closed and isabel was alone with her new father and so my dear you are to be my child  if you will have me  come here and sit down by me your father has already told you thathas he not  he has told me that you had consented  and silverbridge has said as much  i would sooner hear it from you than from either of them  then hear it from me you shall be my child and if you will love me you shall be very dear to me you shall be my own childas dear as my own i must either love his wife very dearly or else i must be an unhappy man and she must love me dearly or i must be unhappy  i will love you she said pressing his hand  and now let me say some few words to you only let there be no bitterness in them to your young heart when i say that i take you to my heart you may be sure that i do so thoroughly you shall be as dear to me and as near as though you had been all english  shall i  there shall no difference be made my boys wife shall be my daughter in very deed but i had not wished it to be so  i knew thatbut could i have given him up  he at any rate could not give you up there were little prejudicesyou can understand that  oh yes  we who wear black coats could not bring ourselves readily to put on scarlet garments nor should we sit comfortably with our legs crossed like turks  i am your scarlet coat and your crosslegged turk she said with feigned selfreproach in her voice but with a sparkle of mirth in her eye  but when i have once got into my scarlet coat i can be very proud of it and when i am once seated in my divan i shall find it of all postures the easiest do you understand me  i think so  not a shade of any prejudice shall be left to darken my mind there shall be no feeling but that you are in truth his chosen wife after all neither can country nor race nor rank nor wealth make a good woman education can do much but nature must have done much also  do not expect too much of me  i will so expect that all shall be taken for the best you know i think that i have liked you since i first saw you  i know that you have always been good to me  i have liked you from the first that you are lovely perhaps is no merit though to speak the truth i am well pleased that silverbridge should have found so much beauty  that is all a matter of taste i suppose she said laughing  but there is much that a young woman may do for herself which i think you have done a silly girl though she had been a second helen would hardly have satisfied me  or perhaps him said isabel  or him and it is in that feeling that i find my chief satisfactionthat he should have had the sense to have liked such a one as you better than others now i have said it as not being one of us i did at first object to his choice as being what you are yourself i am altogether reconciled to it do not keep him long waiting  i do not think he likes to be kept waiting for anything  i dare say not i dare say not and now there is one thing else then the duke unlocked a little drawer that was close to his hand and taking out a ring put it on her finger it was a bar of diamonds perhaps a dozen of them fixed in a little circlet of gold this must never leave you he said  it never shallhaving come from you  it was the first present that i gave to my wife and it is the first that i give to you you may imagine how sacred it is to me on no other hand could it be worn without something which to me would be akin to sacrilege now i must not keep you longer or silverbridge will be storming about the house he of course will tell me when it is to be but do not you keep him long waiting then he kissed her and led her up into the drawingroom when he had spoken a word of greeting to mrs boncassen he left them to their own devices  after that they spent the best part of an hour in going over the house but even that was done in a manner unsatisfactory to silverbridge wherever isabel went there mrs boncassen went also there might have been some fun in showing even the back kitchens to his brideelect by herselfbut there was none in wandering about those vast underground regions with a stout lady who was really interested with the cooking apparatus and the washhouses the bedrooms one after another became tedious to him when mrs boncassen would make communications respecting each of them to her daughter that is geralds room said silverbridge you have never seen gerald he is such a brick mrs boncassen was charmed with the whips and sticks and boxinggloves in geralds room and expressed an opinion that young men in the states mostly carried their knickknacks about with them to the universities when she was told that he had another collection of knickknacks at matching and another at oxford she thought that he was a very extravagant young man isabel who had heard all about the gambling in scotland looked round at her lover and smiled  well my dear said mrs boncassen as they took their leave it is a very grand house and i hope with all my heart you may have your health there and be happy but i dont know that youll be any happier because its so big  wait till you see gatherum said silverbridge that i own does make me unhappy it has been calculated that three months at gatherum castle would drive a philosopher mad  in all this there had been a certain amount of disappointment for silverbridge but on that evening before dinner in brook street he received compensation as the day was one somewhat peculiar in its nature he decided that it should be kept altogether as a holiday and he did not therefore go down to the house and not going to the house of course he spent the time with the boncassens you know you ought to go isabel said to him when they found themselves alone together in the back drawingroom  of course i ought  then go do you think i would keep a briton from his duties  not though the constitution should fall in ruins do you suppose that a man wants no rest after inspecting all the pots and pans in that establishment a woman i believe could go on doing that kind of thing all day long  you should remember at least that thewoman was interesting herself about your pots and pans  and now bella tell me what the governor said to you then she showed him the ring did he give you that she nodded her head in assent i did not think he would ever have parted with that  it was your mothers  she wore it always i almost think that i never saw her hand without it he would not have given you that unless he had meant to be very good to you  he was very good to me silverbridge i have a great deal to do to learn to be your wife  ill teach you  yes youll teach me but will you teach me right there is something almost awful in your fathers serious dignity and solemn appreciation of the responsibilities of his position will you ever come to that  i shall never be a great man as he is  it seems to me that life to him is a loadwhich he does not object to carry but which he knows must be carried with a great struggle  i suppose it ought to be so with everyone  yes she said but the higher you put your foot on the ladder the more constant should be your thought that your stepping requires care i fear that i am climbing too high  you cant come down now my young woman  i have to go on nowand do it as best i can i will try to do my best i will try to do my best i told him so and now i tell you so i will try to do my best  perhaps after all i am only a pert poppet she said half an hour afterwards for silverbridge had told her of that terrible mistake made by poor dolly longstaff  brute he exclaimed  not at all and when we are settled down in the real darbyandjoan way i shall hope to see mr longstaff very often i daresay he wont call me a pert poppet and i shall not remind him of the word but i shall always think of it and remembering the way in which my character struck an educated englishmanwho was not altogether illdisposed towards mei may hope to improve myself     chapter lxxiii  i have never loved you   silverbridge had now been in town three or four weeks and lady mabel grex had also been in london all that time and yet he had not seen her she had told him that she loved him and had asked him plainly to make her his wife he had told her that he could not do sothat he was altogether resolved to make another woman his wife then she had rebuked him and had demanded from him how he had dared to treat her as he had done his conscience was clear he had his own code of morals as to such matters and had as he regarded it kept within the law but she thought that she was badly treated and had declared that she was now left out in the cold for ever through his treachery then her last word had been almost the worst of all who can tell what may come to passshowing too plainly that she would not even now give up her hope before the month was up she wrote to him as follows      dear lord silverbridge     why do you not come and see me are friends so plentiful    with you that one so staunch as i may be thrown over    but of course i know why you do not come put all that    asideand come i cannot hurt you i have learned to    feel that certain things which the world regards as too    awful to be talked ofexcept in the way of scandal may    be discussed and then laid aside just like other subjects    what though i wear a wig or a wooden leg i may still be    fairly comfortable among my companions unless i crucify    myself by trying to hide my misfortune it is not the    presence of the skeleton that crushes us not even that    will hurt us much if we let him go about the house as he    lists it is the everlasting effort which the horror makes    to peep out of his cupboard that robs us of our ease at    any rate come and see me     of course i know that you are to be married to miss    boncassen who does not know it the trumpeters have been    at work for the last week     your very sincere friend     mabel   he wished that she had not written of course he must go to her and though there was a word or two in her letter which angered him his feelings towards her were kindly had not that american angel flown across the atlantic to his arms he could have been well content to make her his wife but the interview at the present moment could hardly be other than painful she could she said talk of her own misfortunes but the subject would be very painful to him it was not to him a skeleton to be locked out of sight but it had been a misfortune and the sooner that such misfortunes could be forgotten the better  he knew what she meant about trumpeters she had intended to signify that isabel in her pride had boasted of her matrimonial prospects of course there had been trumpets are there not always trumpets when a marriage is contemplated magnificent enough to be called an alliance as for that he himself had blown the trumpets he had told everybody that he was going to be married to miss boncassen isabel had blown no trumpets in her own straightforward way she had told the truth to whom it concerned of course he would go and see lady mabel but he trusted that for her own sake nothing would be said about trumpets  so you have come at last mabel said when he entered the room nomiss cassewary is not here as i wanted to see you alone i got her to go out this morning why did you not come before  you said in your letter that you knew why  but in saying so i was accusing you of cowardicewas i not  it was not cowardice  why then did you not come  i thought you would hardly wish to see me so soonafter what passed  that is honest at any rate you felt that i must be too much ashamed of what i said to be able to look you in the face  not that exactly  any other man would have felt the same but no other man would be honest enough to tell me so i do not think that ever in your life you have constrained yourself to the civility of a lie  i hope not  to be civil and false is often better than to be harsh and true i may be soothed by the courtesy and yet not deceived by the lie but what i told you in my letterwhich i hope you have destroyed  i will destroy it  do it was not intended for the partner of your future joys as i told you then i can talk freely why not we know itboth of us how your conscience may be i cannot tell but mine is clear from that soil with which you think it should be smirched  i think nothing of the sort  yes silverbridge you do you have said to yourself thisthat girl has determined to get me and she has not scrupled as to how she would do it  no such idea has ever crossed my mind  but you have never told yourself of the encouragement which you gave me such condemnation as i have spoken of would have been just if my efforts had been sanctioned by no words no looks no deeds from you did you give me warrant for thinking that you were my lover  that theory by which he had justified himself to himself seemed to fall away from him under her questioning he could not now remember his words to her in those old days before miss boncassen had crossed his path but he did know that he had once intended to make her understand that he loved her she had not understood himor understanding had not accepted his words and therefore he had thought himself free but it now seemed that he had not been entitled so to regard himself there she sat looking at him waiting for his answer and he who had been so sure that he had committed no sin against her had not a word to say to her  i want your answer to that lord silverbridge i have told you that i would have no skeleton in the cupboard down at matching and before that at killancodlem i appealed to you asking you to take me as your wife  hardly that  altogether that i will have nothing denied that i have donenor will i be ashamed of anything i did do soeven after this infatuation i thought then that one so volatile might perhaps fly back again  i shall not do that said he frowning at her  you need trouble yourself with no assurance my friend let us understand each other now i am not now supposing that you can fly back again you have found your perch and you must settle on it like a good domestic barndoor fowl again he scowled if she were too hard upon him he would certainly turn upon her no you will not fly back again nowbut was i or was i not justified when you came to killancodlem in thinking that my lover had come there  how can i tell it is my own justification i am thinking of  i see all that but we cannot both be justified did you mean me to suppose that you were speaking to me words in earnest when theresitting in that very spotyou spoke to me of your love  did i speak of my love  did you speak of your love and now silverbridgefor if there be an english gentleman on earth i think that you are oneas a gentleman tell me this did you not even tell your father that i should be your wife i know you did  did he tell you  men such as you and he who cannot even lie with your eyelids who will not condescend to cover up a secret by a moment of feigned inanimation have many voices he did tell me but he broke no confidence he told me but did not mean to tell me now you also have told me  i did i told him so and then i changed my mind  i know you changed your mind men often do a pinker pink a whiter whitea finger that will press you just half an ounce the closera cheek that will consent to let itself come just a little nearer  no no no it was because isabel had not easily consented to such approaches  trifles such as these will do itand some such trifles have done it with you it would be beneath me to make comparisons where i might seem to be the gainer i grant her beauty she is very lovely she has succeeded  i have succeeded  buti am justified and you are condemned is it not so tell me like a man  you are justified  and you are condemned when you told me that i should be your wife and then told your father the same story was i to think it all meant nothing have you deceived me  i did not mean it  have you deceived me what you cannot deny it and yet have not the manliness to own it to a poor woman who can only save herself from humiliation by extorting the truth from you  oh mabel i am so sorry it should be so  i believe you arewith a sorrow that will last till she is again sitting close to you nor silverbridge do i wish it to be longer nonono your fault after all has not been great you deceived but did not mean to deceive me  never never  and i fancy you have never known how much you bore about with you your modesty has been so perfect that you have not thought of yourself as more than other men you have forgotten that you have had in your hand the disposal to some one woman of a throne in paradise  i dont suppose you thought of that  but i did why should i tell falsehoods now i have determined that you should know everythingbut i could better confess to you my own sins when i had shown that you too have not been innocent not think of it do not men think of high titles and great wealth and power and place and if men why should not women do not men try to get themand are they not even applauded for their energy a woman has but one way to try i tried  i do not think it was all for that  how shall i answer that without a confession which even i am not hardened enough to make in truth silverbridge i have never loved you  he drew himself up slowly before he answered her and gradually assumed a look very different from that easy boyish smile which was customary to him i am glad of that he said  why are you glad  now i can have no regrets  you need have none it was necessary to me that i should have my little triumphthat i should show you that i knew how far you had wronged me but now i wish that you should know everything i have never loved you  there is an end of it then  but i have liked you so wellso much better than all others a dozen men have asked me to marry them and though they might be nothing till they made that request then they becamethings of horror to me but you were not a thing of horror i could have become your wife and i think that i could have learned to love you  it is best as it is  i ought to say so too but i have a doubt i should have liked to be duchess of omnium and perhaps i might have fitted the place better than one who can as yet know but little of its duties or its privileges i may perhaps think that that other arrangement would have been better even for you  i can take care of myself in that  i should have married you without loving you but i should have done so determined to serve you with a devotion which a woman who does love hardly thinks necessary i would have so done my duty that you should never have guessed that my heart had been in the keeping of another man  another man  yes of course if there had been no other man why not you am i so hard do you think that i can love no one are you not such a one that a girl would naturally lovewere she not preoccupied that a woman should love seems as necessary as that a man should not  a man can love too  nohardly he can admire and he can like and he can fondle and be fond he can admire and approve and perhaps worship he can know of a woman that she is part of himself the most sacred part and therefore will protect her from the very winds but all that will not make love it does not come to a man that to be separated from a woman is to be dislocated from his very self a man has but one centre and that is himself a woman has two though the second may never be seen by her may live in the arms of another may do all for that other that man can do for womanstill still though he be half the globe asunder from her still he is to her the half of her existence if she really love there is i fancy no end of it to the end of time i shall love frank tregear  tregear  who else  he is engaged to mary  of course he is why notto her or whomsoever else he might like best he is as true i doubt not to your sister as you are to your american beautyor as you would have been to me had fancy held he used to love me  you were always friends  alwaysdear friends and he would have loved me if a man were capable of loving but he could sever himself from me easily just when he was told to do so i thought that i could do the same but i cannot a jackal is born a jackal and not a lion and cannot help himself so is a woman borna woman they are clinging parasite things which cannot but adhere though they destroy themselves by adhering do not suppose that i take a pride in it i would give one of my eyes to be able to disregard him  time will do it  yes timethat brings wrinkles and rougepots and rheumatism though i have so hated those men as to be unable to endure them still i want some mans house and his namesome mans bread and winesome mans jewels and titles and woods and parks and gardensif i can get them time can help a man in his sorrow if he begins at forty to make speeches or to win races or to breed oxen he can yet live a prosperous life time is but a poor consoler for a young woman who has to be married  oh mabel  and now let there be not a word more about it i knowthat i can trust you  indeed you may  though you will tell her everything else you will not tell her this  nonot this  and surely you will not tell your sister  i shall tell no one  it is because you are so true that i have dared to trust you i had to justify myselfand then to confess had i at that one moment taken you at your word you would never have known anything of all this there is a tide in the affairs of men but i let the flood go by i shall not see you again now before you are married but come to me afterwards     chapter lxxiv  let us drink a glass of wine together   silverbridge pondered it all much as he went home what a terrible story was that he had heard the horror to him was chiefly in thisthat she should yet be driven to marry some man without even fancying that she could love him and this was lady mabel grex who on his own first entrance into london life now not much more than twelve months ago had seemed to him to stand above all other girls in beauty charm and popularity  as he opened the door of the house with his latchkey who should be coming out but frank tregearfrank tregear with his arm in a sling but still with an unmistakable look of general satisfaction when on earth did you come up asked silverbridge tregear told him that he had arrived on the previous evening from harrington and why the doctor would not have let you come if he could have helped it  when he found he could not help it he did let me come i am nearly all right if i had been nearly all wrong i should have had to come  and what are you doing here  well if youll allow me ill go back with you for a moment what do you think i have been doing  have you seen my sister  yes i have seen your sister and i have done better than that i have seen your father lord silverbridgebehold your brotherinlaw  you dont mean to say that it is arranged  i do  what did he say  he made me understand by most unanswerable arguments that i had no business to think of such a thing i did not fight the point with himbut simply stood there as conclusive evidence of my business he told me that we should have nothing to live on unless he gave us an income i assured him that i would never ask him for a shilling but i cannot allow her to marry a man without an income he said  i know his way so well  i had just two facts to go uponthat i would not give her up and that she would not give me up when i pointed that out he tore his hairin a mild way and said that he did not understand that kind of thing at all  and yet he gave way  of course he did they say that when a king of old would consent to see a petitioner for his life he was bound by his royalty to mercy so it was with the duke then very early in the argument he forgot himself and called hermary i knew he had thrown up the sponge then  how did he give way at last  he asked me what were my ideas about life in general i said that i thought parliament was a good sort of thing that i was lucky enough to have a seat and that i should take lodgings somewhere in westminster till till what he asked till something is settled i replied then he turned away from me and remained silent may i see lady mary i asked yes you may see her he replied as he rang the bell then when the servant was gone he stopped me i love her too dearly to see her grieve he said i hope you will show that you can be worthy of her then i made some sort of protestation and went upstairs while i was with mary there came a message to me telling me to come to dinner  the boncassens are all dining here  then we shall be a family party so far i suppose i may say it is settled when he will let us marry heaven only knows mary declares that she will not press him i certainly cannot do so it is all a matter of money  he wont care about that  but he may perhaps think that a little patience will do us good you will have to soften him then silverbridge told all that he knew about himself he was to be married in may was to go to matching for a week or two after his wedding was then to see the session to an end and after that to travel with his wife in the united states i dont suppose we shall be allowed to run about the world together so soon as that said tregear but i am too well satisfied with my days work to complain  did he say what he meant to give her  oh dear nonor even that he meant to give her anything i should not dream of asking a question about it nor when he makes any proposition shall i think of having any opinion of my own  hell make it all rightfor her sake you know  my chief object as regards him is that he should not think that i have been looking after her money well goodbye i suppose we shall all meet at dinner  when tregear left him silverbridge went to his fathers room he was anxious that they should understand each other as to marys engagement  i thought you were at the house said the duke  i was going there but i met tregear at the door he tells me you have accepted him for mary  i wish that he had never seen her do you think that a man can be thwarted in everything and not feel it  i thoughtyou had reconciled yourselfto isabel  if it were that alone i could do so the more easily because personally she wins upon me and this man tooit is not that i find fault with himself  he is in all respects a highminded gentleman  i hope so but yet had he a right to set his heart there where he could make his fortunehaving none of his own  he did not think of that  he should have thought of it a man does not allow himself to love without any consideration or purpose you say that he is a gentleman a gentleman should not look to live on means brought to him by a wife you say that he did not  he did not think of it  a gentleman should do more than not think of it he should think that it shall not be so a man should own his means or should earn them  how many men sir do neither  yes i know said the duke such a doctrine nowadays is caviare to the general one must live as others live around one i suppose i could not see her suffer it was too much for me when i became convinced that this was no temporary passion no romantic love which time might banish that she was of such a temperament that she could not changethen i had to give way gerald i suppose will bring me some kitchenmaid for his wife  oh sir you should not say that to me  noi should not have said it to you i beg your pardon silverbridge then he paused a moment turning over certain thoughts within his own bosom perhaps after all it is well that a pride of which i am conscious should be rebuked and it may be that the rebuke has come in such a form that i should be thankful i know that i can love isabel  that to me will be everything  and this young man has nothing that should revolt me i think he has been wrong but now that i have said it i will let all that pass from me he will dine with us today  silverbridge then went up to see his sister so you have settled your little business mary  oh silverbridge you will wish me joy  certainly why not  papa is so stern with me of course he has given way and of course i am grateful but he looks at me as though i had done something to be forgiven  take the good the gods provide you mary that will all come right  but i have not done anything wrong have i  that is a matter of opinion how can i answer about you when i dont quite know whether i have done anything wrong or not myself i am going to marry the girl i have chosen thats enough for me  but you did change  we need not say anything about that  but i have never changed papa just told me that he would consent and that i might write to him so i did write and he came but papa looks at me as though i had broken his heart  i tell you what it is mary you expect too much from him he has not had his own way with either of us and of course he feels it  as tregear had said there was quite a family party in carlton terrace though as yet the family was not bound together by family ties all the boncassens were there the father the mother and the promised bride mr boncassen bore himself with more ease than any one in the company having at his command a gift of manliness which enabled him to regard this marriage exactly as he would have done any other america was not so far distant but what he would be able to see his girl occasionally he liked the young man and he believed in the comfort of wealth therefore he was satisfied but when the marriage was spoken of or written of as an alliance then he would say a hard word or two about dukes and lords in general on such an occasion as this he was happy and at his ease  so much could not be said for his wife with whom the duke attempted to place himself on terms of family equality but in doing this he failed to hide the attempt even from her and she broke down under it had he simply walked into the room with her as he would have done on any other occasion and then remarked that the frost was keen or the thaw disagreeable it would have been better for her but when he told her that he hoped she would often make herself at home in that house and looked as he said it as though he were asking her to take a place among the goddesses of olympus she was troubled as to her answer oh my lord duke she said when i think of isabel living here and being called by such a name it almost upsets me  isabel had all her fathers courage but she was more sensitive and though she would have borne her honours well was oppressed by the feeling that the weight was too much for her mother she could not keep her ear from listening to her mothers words or her eye from watching her mothers motions she was prepared to carry her mother everywhere as other girls have to be taken with their belongings so must i if i be taken at all this she had said plainly enough there should be no division between her and her mother but still knowing that her mother was not quite at ease she was hardly at ease herself  silverbridge came in at the last moment and of course occupied a chair next to isabel as the house was sitting it was natural that he should come up in a flurry i left phineas he said pounding away in his old style at sir timothy bythebye isabel you must come down some day and hear sir timothy badgered i must be back again about ten well gerald how are they all at lazarus he made an effort to be free and easy but even he soon found that it was an effort  gerald had come up from oxford for the occasion that he might make acquaintance with the boncassens he had taken isabel in to dinner but had been turned out of his place when his brother came in he had been a little confused by the first impression made upon him by mrs boncassen and had involuntarily watched his father silver is going to have an odd sort of a motherinlaw he said afterwards to mary who remarked in reply that this would not signify as the motherinlaw would be in new york  tregears part was very difficult to play he could not but feel that though he had succeeded still he was as yet looked upon askance silverbridge had told him that by degrees the duke would be won round but that it was not to be expected that he should swallow at once all his regrets the truth of this could not but be accepted the immediate inconvenience however was not the less felt each and everyone there knew the position of each and everyonebut tregear felt it difficult to act up to his he could not play the wellpleased lover openly as did silverbridge mary herself was disposed to be very silent the heartbreaking tedium of her dull life had been removed her determination had been rewarded all that she had wanted had been granted to her and she was happy but she was not prepared to show off her happiness before others and she was aware that she was thought to have done evil by introducing her lover into her august family  but it was the duke who made the greatest efforts and with the least success he had told himself again and again that he was bound by every sense of duty to swallow all regrets he had taken himself to task on this matter he had done so even out loud to his son he had declared that he would let it all pass from him but who does not know how hard it is for a man in such matters to keep his word to himself who has not said to himself at the very moment of his own delinquency nowit is nowat this very instant of time that i should crush and quench and kill the evil spirit within me it is now that i should abate my greed or smother my illhumour or abandon my hatred it is now and here that i should drive out the fiend as i have sworn to myself that i would doand yet has failed  that it would be done would be done at last by this man was very certain when silverbridge assured his sister that it would come all right very soon he had understood his fathers character but it could not be completed quite at once had he been required to take isabel only to his heart it would have been comparatively easy there are men who do not seem at first sight very susceptible to feminine attractions who nevertheless are dominated by the grace of flounces who succumb to petticoats unconsciously and who are half in love with every woman merely for her womanhood so it was with the duke he had given way in regard to isabel with less than half the effort that frank tregear was likely to cost him  you were not at the house sir said silverbridge when he felt that there was a pause  no not today then there was a pause again  i think that we shall beat cambridge this year to a moral said gerald who was sitting at the round table opposite to his father mr boncassen who was next to him asked in irony probably rather than in ignorance whether the victory was to be achieved by mathematical or classical proficiency gerald turned and looked at him do you mean to say that you have never heard of the university boatraces  papa you have disgraced yourself for ever said isabel  have i my dear yes i have heard of them but i thought lord geralds protestation was too great for a mere aquatic triumph  now you are poking your fun at me said gerald  well he may said the duke sententiously we have laid ourselves very open to having fun poked at us in this matter  i think sir said tregear that they are learning to do the same sort of thing at the american universities  oh indeed said the duke in a solemn dry funereal tone and then all the little life which geralds remark about the boatrace had produced was quenched at once the duke was not angry with tregear for his little word of defencebut he was not able to bring himself into harmony with this one guest and was almost savage to him without meaning it he was continually asking himself why destiny had been so hard upon him as to force him to receive there at his table as his soninlaw a man who was distasteful to him and he was endeavouring to answer the question taking himself to task and telling himself that his destiny had done him no injury and that the pride which had been wounded was a false pride he was making a brave fight but during the fight he was hardly fit to be the genial father and fatherinlaw of young people who were going to be married to one another but before the dinner was over he made a great effort tregear he saidand even that was an effort for he had never hitherto mentioned the mans name without the formal mistertregear as this is the first time you have sat at my table let me be oldfashioned and ask you to drink a glass of wine with me  the glass of wine was drunk and the ceremony afforded infinite satisfaction at least to one person there mary could not keep herself from some expression of joy by pressing her finger for a moment against her lovers arm he though not usually given to such manifestations blushed up to his eyes but the feeling produced on the company was solemn rather than jovial everyone there understood it all mr boncassen could read the dukes mind down to the last line even mrs boncassen was aware that an act of reconciliation had been intended when the governor drank that glass of wine it seemed as though half the marriage ceremony had been performed gerald said to his brother that evening when the dukes glass was replaced on the table he himself was conscious of the solemnity of what he had done and was half ashamed of it  when the ladies had gone upstairs the conversation became political and lively the duke could talk freely about the state of things to mr boncassen and was able gradually to include tregear in the badinage with which he attacked the conservatism of his son and so the halfhour passed well upstairs the two girls immediately came together leaving mrs boncassen to chew the cud of the grandeur around her in the sleepy comfort of an armchair and so everything is settled for both of us said isabel  of course i knew it was to be settled for you you told me so at custins  i did not know it myself then i only told you that he had asked me and you hardly believed me  i certainly believed you  but you knew aboutlady mabel grex  i only suspected something and now i know it was a mistake it has never been more than a suspicion  and why when we were at custins did you not tell me about yourself  i had nothing to tell  i can understand that but is it not joyful that it should all be settled only poor lady mabel you have got no lady mabel to trouble your conscience from which it was evident that silverbridge had not told all     chapter lxxv  the majors story   by the end of march isabel was in paris whither she had forbidden her lover to follow her silverbridge was therefore reduced to the shifts of a bachelors life in which his friends seemed to think that he ought now to take special delight perhaps he did not take much delight in them he was no doubt impatient to commence that steady married life for which he had prepared himself but nevertheless just at present he lived a good deal at the beargarden where was he to live the boncassens were in paris his sister was at matching with a houseful of other pallisers and his father was again deep in politics  of course he was much in the house of commons but that also was stupid indeed everything would be stupid till isabel came back perhaps dinner was more comfortable at the club than at the house and then as everybody knew it was a good thing to change the scene therefore he dined at the club and though he would keep his hansom and go down to the house again in the course of the evening he spent many long hours at the beargarden therell very soon be an end of this as far as you are concerned said mr lupton to him one evening as they were sitting in the smokingroom after dinner  the sooner the better as far as this place is concerned  this place is as good as any other for the matter of that i like the beargarden since we got rid of two or three not very charming characters  you mean my poor friend tifto said silverbridge  noi was not thinking of tifto there were one or two here who were quite as bad as tifto i wonder what has become of that poor devil  i dont know in the least you heard of that row about the hounds  and his letter to you  he wrote to meand i answered him as you know but whither he vanished or what he is doing or how he is living i have not the least idea  gone to join those other fellows abroad i should say among them they got a lot of moneyas the duke ought to remember  he is not with them said silverbridge as though he were in some degree mourning over the fate of his unfortunate friend  i suppose captain green was the leader in all that  now it is all done and gone i own to a certain regard for the major he was true to me till he thought i snubbed him i would not let him go down to silverbridge with me i always thought that i drove the poor major to his malpractices  at this moment dolly longstaff sauntered into the room and came up to them it may be remembered that dolly had declared his purpose of emigrating as soon as he heard that the dukes heir had serious thoughts of marrying the lady whom he loved he withdrew at once from the contest but as he did so he acknowledged that there could be no longer a home for him in the country which isabel was to inhabit as the wife of another man gradually however better thoughts returned to him after all what was she but a pert poppet he determined that marriage clips a fellows wings confoundedly and so he set himself to enjoy life after his old fashion there was perhaps a little swagger as he threw himself into a chair and addressed the happy lover ill be shot if i didnt meet tifto at the corner of the street  tifto  yes tifto he looked awfully seedy with a greatcoat buttoned up to his chin a shabby hat and old gloves  did he speak to you asked silverbridge  nonor i to him he hadnt time to think whether he would speak or not and you may be sure i didnt  nothing further was said about the man but silverbridge was uneasy and silent when his cigar was finished he got up saying that he should go back to the house as he left the club he looked about him as though expecting to see his old friend and when he had passed through the first street and had got into the haymarket there he was the major came up to him touched his hat asked to be allowed to say a few words i dont think it can do any good said silverbridge the man had not attempted to shake hands with him or affected familiarity but seemed to be thoroughly humiliated i dont think i can be of any service to you and therefore i had rather decline  i dont want you to be of any service my lord  then whats the good  i have something to say may i come to you tomorrow  then silverbridge allowed himself to make an appointment and an hour was named at which tifto might call in carlton terrace he felt that he almost owed some reparation to the wretched manwhom he had unfortunately admitted among his friends whom he had used and to whom he had been uncourteous exactly at the hour named the major was shown into his room  dolly had said that he was shabbybut the man was altered rather than shabby he still had rings on his fingers and studs in his shirt and a jewelled pin in his cravatbut he had shaven off his moustache and the tuft from his chin and his hair had been cut short and in spite of his jewellery there was a hangdog look about him ive got something that i particularly want to say to you my lord silverbridge would not shake hands with him but could not refrain from offering him a chair  wellyou can say it now  yesbut it isnt so very easy to be said there are some things though you want to say them ever so you dont quite know how to do it  you have your choice major tifto you can speak or hold your tongue  then there was a pause during which silverbridge sat with his hands in his pockets trying to look unconcerned but if youve got it here and feel it as i dothe poor man as he said this put his hand upon his heartyou cant sleep in your bed till its out i did that thing that they said i did  what thing  why the nail it was i lamed the horse  i am sorry for it i can say nothing else  you aint so sorry for it as i am oh no you can never be that my lord after all what does it matter to you  very little i meant that i was sorry for your sake  i believe you are my lord for though you could be rough you was always kind now i will tell you everything and then you can do as you please  i wish to do nothing as far as i am concerned the matter is over it made me sick of horses and i do not wish to have to think of it again  nevertheless my lord ive got to tell it it was green who put me up to it he did it just for the plunder as god is my judge it was not for the money i did it  then it was revenge  it was the devil got hold of me my lord up to that i had always been squaresquare as a die i got to think that your lordship was upsetting i dont know whether your lordship remembers but you did put me down once or twice rather uncommon  i hope i was not unjust  i dont say you was my lord but i got a feeling on me that you wanted to get rid of me and i all the time doing the best i could for the orses i did do the best i could up to that very morning at doncaster wellit was green put me up to it i dont say i was to get nothing but it wasnt so much more than i could have got by the orse winning and ive lost pretty nearly all that i did get do you remember my lordand now the major sank his voice to a whisperwhen i come up to your bedroom that morning  i remember it  the first time  yes i remember it  because i came twice my lord when i came first it hadnt been done you turned me out  that is true major tifto  you was very rough then wasnt you rough  a mans bedroom is generally supposed to be private  yes my lordthats true i ought to have sent your man in first i came then to confess it all before it was done  then why couldnt you let the horse alone  i was in their hands and then you was so rough with me so i said to myself i might as well do itand i did it  what do you want me to say as far as my forgiveness goes you have it  thats saying a great deal my lorda great deal said tifto now in tears but i aint said it all yet hes here in london  whos here  green hes here he doesnt think that i know but i could lay my hand on him tomorrow  there is no human being alive major tifto whose presence or absence could be a matter of more indifference to me  ill tell you what ill do my lord ill go before any judge or magistrate or policeofficer in the country and tell the truth i wont ask even for a pardon they shall punish me and him too im in that state of mind that any change would be for the better but hehe ought to have it heavy  it wont be done by me major tifto look here major tifto you have come here to confess that you have done me a great injury  yes i have  and you say you are sorry for it  indeed i am  and i have forgiven you there is only one way in which you can show your gratitude hold your tongue about it let it be as a thing done and gone the money has been paid the horse has been sold the whole thing has gone out of my mind and i dont want to have it brought back again  and nothing is to be done to green  i should say nothingon that score  and he has got they say fiveandtwenty thousand pounds clear money  it is a pity but it cannot be helped i will have nothing further to do with it of course i cannot bind you but i have told you my wishes the poor wretch was silent but still it seemed as though he did not wish to go quite yet if you have said what you have got to say major tifto i may as well tell you that my time is engaged  and must that be all  what else  i am in such a state of mind lord silverbridge that it would be a satisfaction to tell it all even against myself  i cant prevent you  then tifto got up from his chair as though he were going i wish i knew what i was going to do with myself  i dont know that i can help you major tifto  i suppose not my lord i havent twenty pounds left in all the world its the only thing that wasnt square that ever i did in all my life your lordship couldnt do anything for me we was very much together at one time my lord  yes major tifto we were  of course i was a villain but it was only once and your lordship was so rough to me i am not saying but what i was a villain think of what i did for myself by that one piece of wickedness master of hounds member of the club and the horse would have run in my name and won the leger and everybody knew as your lordship and me was together in him then he burst out into a paroxysm of tears and sobbing  the young lord certainly could not take the man into partnership again nor could he restore to him either the hounds or his clubor his clean hands nor did he know in what way he could serve the man except by putting his hand into his pocketwhich he did tifto accepted the gratuity and ultimately became an annual pensioner on his former noble partner living on the allowance made him in some obscure corner of south wales     chapter lxxvi  on deportment   frank tregear had come up to town at the end of february he remained in london with an understanding that he was not to see lady mary again till the easter holidays he was then to pay a visit to matching and to enter in it may be presumed on the full fruition of his advantages as accepted suitor all this had been arranged with a good deal of precisionas though there had still been a hope left that lady mary might change her mind of course there was no such hope when the duke asked the young man to dine with him when he invited him to drink that memorable glass of wine when the young man was allowed in the presence of the boncassens to sit next lady mary it was of course settled but the father probably found some relief in yielding by slow degrees i would rather that there should be no correspondence till then he had said both to tregear and to his daughter and they had promised there should be no correspondence at easter they would meet after easter mary was to come up to london to be present at her brothers wedding to which also tregear had been formally invited and it was hoped that then something might be settled as to their own marriage tregear with the surgeons permission took his seat in parliament he was introduced by two leading members on the conservative side but immediately afterwards found himself seated next to his friend silverbridge on the top bench behind the ministers the house was very full as there was a feverish report abroad that sir timothy beeswax intended to make a statement no one quite knew what the statement was to be but every politician in the house and out of it thought that he knew that the statement would be a bid for higher power on the part of sir timothy himself if there had been dissensions in the cabinet the secret of them had been well kept to tregear who was not as yet familiar with the house there was no special appearance of activity but silverbridge could see that there was more than wonted animation that the treasury bench should be full at this time was a thing of custom a whole broadside of questions would be fired off one after another like a rattle of musketry down the ranks when as nearly as possible the report of each gun is made to follow close upon that of the gun beforewith this exception that in such case each little sound is intended to be as like as possible to the preceding whereas with the rattle of the questions and answers each question and each answer becomes a little more authoritative and less courteous than the last the treasury bench was ready for its usual responsive firing as the questioners were of course in their places the opposition front bench was also crowded and those behind were nearly equally full there were many peers in the gallery and a general feeling of sensation prevailed all this silverbridge had been long enough in the house to appreciatebut to tregear the house was simply the house  its odd enough we should have a row the very first day you come said silverbridge  you think there will be a row  beeswax has something special to say hes not here yet you see theyve left about six inches for him there between roper and sir orlando youll have the privilege of looking just down on the top of his head when he does come i shant stay much longer after that  where are you going  i dont mean today but i should not have been here nowin this very place i meanbut i want to stick to you just at first i shall move down below the gangway and not improbably creep over to the other side before long  you dont mean it  i think i shall i begin to feel ive made a mistake  in coming to this side at all  i think i have after all it is not very important  what is not important i think it very important  perhaps it may be to you and perhaps you may be able to keep it up but the more i think of it the less excuse i seem to have for deserting the old ways of the family what is there in those fellows down there to make a fellow feel that he ought to bind himself to them neck and heels  their principles  yes their principles i believe i have some vague idea as to supporting property and land and all that kind of thing i dont know that anybody wants to attack anything  somebody soon would want to attack it if there were no defenders  i suppose there is an outside powerthe people or public opinion or whatever they choose to call it and the country will have to go very much as that outside power chooses here in parliament everybody will be as conservative as the outside will let them i dont think it matters on which side you sitbut it does matter that you shouldnt have to act with those who go against the grain with you  i never heard a worse political argument in my life  i dare say not however heres sir timothy when he looks in that way all buckram deportment and solemnity i know hes going to pitch into somebody  at this moment the leader of the house came in from behind the speakers chair and took his place between mr roper and sir orlando drought silverbridge had been right in saying that sir timothys air was solemn when a man has to declare a solemn purpose on a solemn occasion in a solemn place it is needful that he should be solemn himself and though the solemnity which befits a man best will be that which the importance of the moment may produce without thought given by himself to his own outward person still who is there can refrain himself from some attempt who can boast who that has been versed in the ways and duties of high places that he has kept himself free from all study of grace of feature of attitude of gaitor even of dress for most of our bishops for most of our judges of our statesmen our orators our generals for many even of our doctors and our parsons even our attorneys our taxgatherers and certainly our butlers and our coachmen mr turveydrop the great professor of deportment has done much but there should always be the art to underlie and protect the artthe art that can hide the art the really clever archbishopthe really potent chief justice the man who as a politician will succeed in becoming a king of men should know how to carry his buckram without showing it it was in this that sir timothy perhaps failed a little there are men who look as though they were born to wear blue ribbons it has come probably from study but it seems to be natural sir timothy did not impose on those who looked at him as do these men you could see a little of the paint you could hear the crumple of the starch and the padding you could trace something of uneasiness in the wouldbe composed grandeur of the brow turveydrop the spectator would say to himself but after all it may be a question whether a man be open to reproach for not doing that well which the greatest among usif we could find one great enoughwould not do at all  for i think we must hold that true personal dignity should be achievedmust if it be quite true have been achievedwithout any personal effort though it be evinced in part by the carriage of the body that carriage should be the fruit of the operation of the mind even when it be assisted by external garniture such as special clothes and wigs and ornaments such garniture should have been prescribed by the sovereign or by custom and should not have been selected by the wearer in regard to speech a man may study all that which may make him suasive but if he go beyond that he will trench on those histrionic efforts which he will know to be wrong because he will be ashamed to acknowledge them it is good to be beautiful but it should come of god and not of the hairdresser and personal dignity is a great possession but a man should struggle for it no more than he would for beauty many however do struggle for it and with such success that though they do not achieve quite the real thing still they get something on which they can bolster themselves up and be mighty  others older men than silverbridge saw as much as did our young friend but they were more complaisant and more reasonable they too heard the crackle of the buckram and were aware that the last touch of awe had come upon that brow just as its owner was emerging from the shadow of the speakers chairbut to them it was a thing of course a real cæsar is not to be found every day nor can we always have a pitt to control our debates that kind of thing that last touch has its effect of course it is all paintbut how would the poor girl look before the gaslights if there were no paint the house of commons likes a little deportment on occasions if a special man looks bigger than you you can console yourself by reflecting that he also looks bigger than your fellows sir timothy probably knew what he was about and did himself on the whole more good than harm by his little tricks  as soon as sir timothy had taken his seat mr rattler got up from the opposition bench to ask him some question on a matter of finance the brewers were anxious about publican licences could the chancellor of the exchequer say a word on the matter notice had of course been given and the questioner had stated a quarter of an hour previously that he would postpone his query till the chancellor of the exchequer was in the house  sir timothy rose from his seat and in his blandest manner began by apologising for his late appearance he was sorry that he had been prevented by public business from being in his place to answer the honourable gentlemans question in its proper turn and even now he feared that he must decline to give any answer which could be supposed to be satisfactory it would probably be his duty to make a statement to the house on the following daya statement which he was not quite prepared to make at the present moment but in the existing state of things he was unwilling to make any reply to any question by which he might seem to bind the government to any opinion then he sat down and rising again not long afterwards when the house had gone through certain formal duties he moved that it should be adjourned till the next day then all the members trooped out and with the others tregear and lord silverbridge so that is the end of your first day of parliament said silverbridge  what does it all mean  let us go to the carlton and hear what the fellows are saying  on that evening both the young men dined at mr boncassens house though tregear had been cautioned not to write to lady mary and though he was not to see her before easter still it was so completely understood that he was about to become her husband that he was entertained in that capacity by all those who were concerned in the family and so they will all go out said mr boncassen  that seems to be the general idea said the expectant soninlaw when two men want to be first and neither will give way they cant very well get on in the same boat together then he expatiated angrily on the treachery of sir timothy and tregear in a more moderate way joined in the same opinion  upon my word young men i doubt whether you are right said mr boncassen whether it can be possible that a man should have risen to such a position with so little patriotism as you attribute to our friend i will not pretend to say i should think that in england it was impossible but of this i am sure that the facility which exists here for a minister or ministers to go out of office without disturbance of the crown is a great blessing you say the other party will come in  that is most probable said silverbridge  with us the other party never comes innever has a chance of coming inexcept once in four years when the president is elected that one event binds us all for four years  but you do change your ministers said tregear  a secretary may quarrel with the president or he may have the gout or be convicted of peculation  and yet you think yourselves more nearly free than we are  i am not so sure of that we have had a pretty difficult task that of carrying on a government in a new country which is nevertheless more populous than almost any old country the influxions are so rapid that every ten years the nature of the people is changed it isnt easy and though i think on the whole weve done pretty well i am not going to boast that washington is as yet the seat of a political paradise     chapter lxxvii  mabel goodbye   when tregear first came to town with his arm in a sling and bandages all round himin order that he might be formally accepted by the dukehe had himself taken to one other house besides the house in carlton terrace he went to belgrave square to announce his fate to lady mabel grexbut lady mabel grex was not there the earl was ill at brighton and lady mabel had gone down to nurse him the old woman who came to him in the hall told him that the earl was very illhe had been attacked by the gout but in spite of the gout and in spite of the doctors he had insisted on being taken to his club then he had been removed to brighton under the doctors advice chiefly in order that he might be kept out of the way of temptation now he was supposed to be very ill indeed my lord is so imprudent said the old woman shaking her old head in real unhappiness for though the earl had been a tyrant to everyone near him yet when a poor woman becomes old it is something to have a tyrant to protect her my lord always had been imprudent tregear knew that it had been the theory of my lords life that to eat and drink and die was better than to abstain and live then tregear wrote to his friend as follows      my dear mabel     i am up in town again as you will perceive although i am    still in a helpless condition and hardly able to write    even this letter i called today and was very sorry to    hear so bad an account of your father had i been able to    travel i should have come down to you when i am able i    will do so if you would wish to see me in the meantime    pray tell me how he is and how you are     my news is this the duke has accepted me it is great    news to me and i hope will be acceptable to you i do    believe that if ever a friend has been anxious for a    friends welfare you have been anxious for mineas i    have been and ever shall be for yours     of course this thing will be very much to me i will not    speak now of my love for the girl who is to become my    wife you might again call me romeo nor do i like to say    much of what may now be pecuniary prospects i did not ask    mary to become my wife because i supposed she would be    rich but i could not have married her or any one else who    had not money what are the dukes intentions i have not    the slightest idea nor shall i ask him i am to go down    to matching at easter and shall endeavour to have some    time fixed i suppose the duke will say something about    money if he does not i shall not     pray write to me at once and tell me when i shall see    you     your affectionate cousin     f o tregear   in answer to this there came a note in a very few words she congratulated himnot very warmlybut expressed a hope that she might see him soon but she told him not to come to brighton the earl was better but very cross and she would be up in town before long  towards the end of the month it became suddenly known in london that lord grex had died at brighton there was a garter to be given away and everybody was filled with regret that such an ornament to the peerage should have departed from them the conservative papers remembered how excellent a politician he had been in his younger days and the world was informed that the family of grex of grex was about the oldest in great britain of which authentic records were in existence then there came another note from lady mabel to tregear i shall be in town on the 31st in the old house with miss cassewary and will see you if you can come on the 1st come early at eleven if you can  on the day named and at the hour fixed he was in belgrave square he had known this house since he was a boy and could well remember how when he first entered it he had thought with some awe of the grandeur of the earl the earl had then not paid much attention to him but he had become very much taken by the grace and goodnature of the girl who had owned him as a cousin you are my cousin frank she had said i am so glad to have a cousin he could remember the words now as though they had been spoken only yesterday then there had quickly grown to be friendship between him and this as he thought sweetest of all girls at that time he had just gone to eton but before he left eton they had sworn to love each other and so it had been and the thing had grown till at last just when he had taken his degree two matters had been settled between them the first was that each loved the other irretrievably irrevocably passionately the second that it was altogether out of the question that they should ever marry each other  it is but fair to tregear to say that this last decision originated with the lady he had told her that he certainly would hold himself engaged to marry her at some future time but she had thrown this aside at once how was it possible she said that two such beings brought up in luxury and taught to enjoy all the good things of the world should expect to live and be happy together without an income he offered to go to the barbut she asked him whether he thought it well that such a one as she should wait say a dozen years for such a process when the time comes i should be an old woman and you would be a wretched man she released himdeclared her own purpose of marrying well and then though there had been a moment in which her own assurance of her own love had been passionate enough she went so far as to tell him that she was heartwhole we have been two foolish children but we cannot be children any longer she said there must be an end of it  what had hitherto been the result of this the reader knowsand tregear knew also he had taken the privilege given to him and had made so complete a use of it that he had in truth transferred his heart as well as his allegiance where is the young man who cannot do sohow few are there who do not do so when their first fit of passion has come on them at oneandtwenty and he had thought that she would do the same but gradually he found that she had not done so did not do so could not do so when she first heard of lady mary she had not reprimanded himbut she could not keep herself from showing the bitterness of her disappointment though she would still boast of her own strength and of her own purpose yet it was too clear to him that she was wounded and very sore she would have liked him to remain single at any rate till she herself were married but the permission had been hardly given before he availed himself of it and then he talked to her not only of the brilliancy of his prospectswhich she could have forgivenbut of his lovehis love  then she had refused one offer after another and he had known it all there was nothing in which she was concerned that she did not tell him then young silverbridge had come across her and she had determined that he should be her husband she had been nearly successfulso nearly that at moments she had felt sure of success but the prize had slipped from her through her own fault she knew well enough that it was her own fault when a girl submits to play such a game as that she should not stand on too nice scruples she had told herself this many a time sincebut the prize was gone  all this tregear knew and knowing it almost dreaded the coming interview he could not without actual cruelty have avoided her had he done so before he could not have continued to do so now when she was left alone in the world her father had not been much to her but still his presence had enabled her to put herself before the world as being somebody now she would be almost nobody and she had lost her rich prize while heout of the same treasury as it werehad won his  the door was opened to him by the same old woman and he was shown at a funereal pace up into the drawingroom which he had known so well he was told that lady mabel would be down to him directly as he looked about him he could see that already had been commenced that work of division of spoil which is sure to follow the death of most of us things were already gone which used to be familiar to his eyes and the room though not dismantled had been deprived of many of its little prettinesses and was ugly  in about ten minutes she came down to himwith so soft a step that he would not have been aware of her entrance had he not seen her form in the mirror then when he turned round to greet her he was astonished by the blackness of her appearance she looked as though she had become ten years older since he had last seen her as she came up to him she was grave and almost solemn in her gait but there was no sign of any tears why should there have been a tear women weep and men too not from grief but from emotion indeed grave and slow as was her step and serious almost solemn as was her gait there was something of a smile on her mouth as she gave him her hand and yet her face was very sad declaring to him too plainly something of the hopelessness of her heart and so the duke has consented she said he had told her that in his letter but since that her father had died and she had been left he did not as yet know how far impoverished but he feared with no pleasant worldly prospects before her  yes mabelthat i suppose will be settled i have been so shocked to hear all this  it has been very sadhas it not sit down frank you and i have a good deal to say to each other now that we have met it was no good your going down to brighton he would not have seen you and at last i never left him  was percival there she only shook her head that was dreadful  it was not percivals fault he would not see him nor till the last hour or two would he believe in his own danger nor was he ever frightened for a momentnot even then  was he good to you  good to me wellhe liked my being there poor papa it had gone so far with him that he could not be good to any one i think that he felt that it would be unmanly not to be the same to the end  he would not see percival  when it was suggested he would only ask what good percival could do him i did send for him at last in my terror but he did not see his father alive when he did come he only told me how badly his father had treated him it was very dreadful  i did so feel for you  i am sure you did and will after all frank i think that the pious godly people have the best of it in this world let them be ever so covetous ever so false ever so hardhearted the mere fact that they must keep up appearances makes them comfortable to those around them poor papa was not comfortable to me a little hypocrisy a little sacrifice to the feelings of the world may be such a blessing  i am sorry that you should feel it so  yes it is sad but youeverything is smiling with you let us talk about your plans  another time will do for that i had come to hear about your own affairs  there they are she said pointing round the room i have no other affairs you see that i am going from here  and where are you going she shook her head with whom will you live  with miss casstwo old maids together i know nothing further  but about money that is if i am justified in asking  what would you not be justified in asking do you not know that i would tell you every secret of my heartif my heart had a secret it seems that i have given up what was to have been my fortune there was a claim of £12000 on grex but i have abandoned it  and there is nothing  there will be scrapings they tell meunless percival refuses to agree this house is mortgaged but not for its value and there are some jewels but all that is detestablea mere grovelling among mean hundreds whereas youyou will soar among  oh mabel do not say hard things to me  no indeed why should ii who have been preaching that comfortable doctrine of hypocrisy i will say nothing hard but i would sooner talk of your good things than of my evil ones  i would not  then you must talk about them for my sake how was it that the duke came round at last  i hardly know she sent for me  a fine highspirited girl these pallisers have more courage about them than one expects from their outward manner silverbridge has plenty of it  i remember telling you he could be obstinate  and i remember that i did not believe you now i know it he has the sort of pluck which enables a man to break a girls heartor to destroy a girls hopeswithout wincing he can tell a girl to her face that she can go to themischief for him there are so many men who cant do that from cowardice though their hearts be ever so well inclined i have changed my mind there is something great in the courage of a man who can say that to a woman in so many words most of them when they escape escape by lies and subterfuges or they run away and wont allow themselves to be heard of they trust to a chapter of accidents and leave things to arrange themselves but when a man can look a girl in the face with those seemingly soft eyes and say with that seemingly soft mouthi have changed my mindthough she would look him dead in return if she could still she must admire him  are you speaking of silverbridge now  of course i am speaking of silverbridge i suppose i ought to hide it all and not to tell you but as you are the only person i do tell you must put up with me yeswhen i taxed him with his falsehoodfor he had been falsehe answered me with those very words i have changed my mind he could not lie to speak the truth was a necessity to him even at the expense of his gallantry almost of his humanity  has he been false to you mabel  of course he has but there is nothing to quarrel about if you mean that people do not quarrel now about such things a girl has to fight her own battle with her own pluck and her own wits as with these weapons she is generally stronger than her enemy she succeeds sometimes although everything else is against her i think i am courageous but his courage beat mine i craned at the first fence when he was willing to swallow my bait my hand was not firm enough to strike the hook in his jaws had i not quailed then i think i should havehad him  it is horrid to hear you talk like this she was leaning over from her seat looking black as she was so much older than her wont with something about her of that unworldly serious thoughtfulness which a mourning garb always gives and yet her words were so worldly so unfeminine  i have got to tell the truth to somebody it was so just as i have said of course i did not love him how could i love him after what has passed but there need have been nothing much in that i dont suppose that dukes eldest sons often get married for love  miss boncassen loves him  i dare say the beggars daughter loved king cophetua when you come to distances such as that there can be love the very fact that a man should have descended so far in quest of beautythe flattery of it alonewill produce love when the angels came after the daughters of men of course the daughters of men loved them the distance between him and me is not great enough to have produced that sort of worship there was no reason why lady mabel grex should not be good enough wife for the son of the duke of omnium  certainly not  and therefore i was not struck as by the shining of a light from heaven i cannot say i loved him franki am beyond worshipping even an angel from heaven  then i do not know that you could blame him he said very seriously  just soand as i have chosen to be honest i have told him everything but i had my revenge first  i would have said nothing  you would have recommendeddelicacy no doubt you think that women should be delicate let them suffer what they may a woman should not let it be known that she has any human nature in her i had him on the hip and for a moment i used my power he had certainly done me a wrong he had asked for my loveand with the delicacy which you commend i had not at once grasped at all that such a request conveyed then as he told me so frankly he changed his mind did he not wrong me  he should not have raised false hopes  he told me thathe had changed his mind i think i loved him then as nearly as ever i didbecause he looked me full in the face theni told him i had never cared for him and that he need have nothing on his conscience but i doubt whether he was glad to hear it men are so vain i have talked too much of myself and so you are to be the dukes soninlaw and she will have hundreds of thousands  thousands perhaps but i do not think very much about it i feel that he will provide for her  and that you having secured her can creep under his wing like an additional ducal chick it is very comfortable the duke will be quite a providence to you i wonder that all young gentlemen do not marry heiressesit is so easy and you have got your seat in parliament too oh your luck when i look back upon it all it seems so hard to me it was for youfor you that i used to be anxious now it is i who have not an inch of ground to stand upon then he approached her and put out his hand to her no she said putting both her hands behind her back for gods sake let there be no tenderness but is it not cruel think of my advantages at that moment when you and i agreed that our paths should be separate my fortune then had not been made quite shipwreck by my father and brother i had before me all that society could offer i was called handsome and clever where was there a girl more likely to make her way to the top  you may do so still  nonoi cannot and you at least should not tell me so i did not know then the virulence of the malady which had fallen on me i did not know then that because of you other men would be abhorrent to me i thought that i was as easyhearted as you have proved yourself  how cruel you can be  have i done anything to interfere with you have i said a word even to that young lad when i might have said a word yes to him i did say something but i waited and would not say it while a word could hurt you shall i tell you what i told him just everything that has ever happened between you and me  you did  yesbecause i saw that i could trust him i told him because i wanted him to be quite sure that i had never loved him but frank i have put no spoke in your wheel there has not been a moment since you told me of your love for this rich young lady in which i would not have helped you had help been in my power whomever i may have harmed i have never harmed you  am i not as clear from blame towards you  no frank you have done me the terrible evil of ceasing to love me  it was at your own bidding  certainly but if i were to bid you to cut my throat would you do it  was it not you who decided that we could not wait for each other  and should it not have been for you to decide that you would wait  you also would have married  it almost angers me that you should not see the difference a girl unless she marries becomes nothing as i have become nothing now a man does not want a pillar on which to lean a man when he has done as you had done with me and made a girls heart all his own even though his own heart had been flexible and plastic as yours is should have been true to her at least for a while did it never occur to you that you owed something to me  i have always owed you very much  there should have been some touch of chivalry if not of love to make you feel that a second passion should have been postponed for a year or two you could wait without growing old you might have allowed yourself a little space to dwelli was going to say on the sweetness of your memories but they were not sweet frank they were not sweet to you  these rebukes mabel will rob them of their sweetnessfor a time  it is gone all gone she said shaking her headgone from me because i have been so easily deserted gone from you because the change has been so easy to you how long was it frank after you had left me before you were basking happily in the smiles of lady mary palliser  it was not very long as months go  say days frank  i have to defend myself and i will do so with truth it was not very longas months go but why should it have been less long whether for months or days i had to cure myself of a wound  to put a plaster on a scratch frank  and the sooner a man can do that the more manly he is is it a sign of strength to wail under a sorrow that cannot be curedor of truth to perpetuate the appearance of a woe  has it been an appearance with me  i am speaking of myself now i am driven to speak of myself by the bitterness of your words it was you who decided  you accepted my decision easily  because it was based not only on my unfitness for such a marriage but on yours when i saw that there would be perhaps some years of misery for you of course i accepted your decision the sweetness had been very sweet to me  oh frank was it ever sweet to you  and the triumph of it had been very great i had been assured of the love of her who among all the high ones of the world seemed to me to be the highest then came your decision do you really believe that i could abandon the sweetness that i could be robbed of my triumph that i could think i could never again be allowed to put my arm round your waist never again to feel your cheek close to mine that i should lose all that had seemed left to me among the gods without feeling it  frank frank she said rising to her feet and stretching out her hands as though she were going to give him back all these joys  of course i felt it i did not then know what was before me when he said this she sank back immediately upon her seat i was wretched enough i had lost a limb and could not walk my eyes and must always hereafter be blind my fitness to be among men and must always hereafter be secluded it is so that a man is stricken down when some terrible trouble comes upon him but it is given to him to retrick his beams  you have retricked yours  yesand the strong man will show his strength by doing it quickly mabel i sorrowed for myself greatly when that word was spoken partly because i thought that your love could so easily be taken from me and since i have found that it has not been so i have sorrowed for you also but i do not blame myself andand i will not submit to have blame even from you she stared him in the face as he said this a man should never submit to blame  but if he has deserved it  who is to be the judge but why should we contest this you do not really wish to trample on me  nonot that  nor to disgrace me nor to make me feel myself disgraced in my own judgment then there was a pause for some moments as though he had left her without another word to say shall i go now he asked  oh frank  i fear that my presence only makes you unhappy  then what will your absence do when shall i see you again but no i will not see you again not for many daysnot for years why should i frank is it wicked that i should love you he could only shake his head in answer to this if it be so wicked that i must be punished for it eternally still i love you i can never never never love another you cannot understand it oh godthat i had never understood it myself i think i think that i would go with you now anywhere facing all misery all judgments all disgrace you know do you not that if it were possible i should not say so but as i know that you would not stir a step with me i do say so  i know it is not meant  it is meant though it could not be done frank i must not see her not for awhile not for years i do not wish to hate her but how can i help it do you remember when she flew into your arms in this room  i remember it  of course you do it is your great joy now to remember that and such like she must be very good though i hate her  do not say that you hate her mabel  though i hate her she must be good it was a fine and a brave thing to do i have done it but never before the world like that have i frank oh frank i shall never do it again go now and do not touch me let us both pray that in ten years we may meet as passionless friends he came to her hardly knowing what he meant but purposing as though by instinct to take her hand as he parted from her but she putting both her hands before her face and throwing herself on to the sofa buried her head among the cushions  is there not to be another word he said lying as she did she still was able to make a movement of dissent and he left her muttering just one word between his teeth mabel goodbye     chapter lxxviii  the duke returns to office   that farewell took place on the friday morning tregear as he walked out of the square knew now that he had been the cause of a great shipwreck at first when that passionate love had been declaredhe could hardly remember whether with the fullest passion by him or by herhe had been as a god walking upon air that she who seemed to be so much above him should have owned that she was all his own seemed then to be world enough for him for a few weeks he lived a hero to himself and was able to tell himself that for him the glory of a passion was sufficient in those halcyon moments no common human care is allowed to intrude itself to one who has thus entered in upon the heroism of romance his own daily work his dinners clothes income father and mother sisters and brothers his own street and house are nothing hunting shooting rowing alpineclimbing even speeches in parliamentif they perchance have been attained toall become leather or prunella the heavens have been opened to him and he walks among them like a god so it had been with tregear then had come the second phase of his passionwhich is also not uncommon to young men who soar high in their first assaults he was told that it would not do and was not so told by a hardhearted parent but by the young lady herself and she had spoken so reasonably that he had yielded and had walked away with that sudden feeling of a vile return to his own mean belongings to his lodgings and his income which not a few ambitious young men have experienced but she had convinced him then had come the journey to italy and the reader knows all the rest he certainly had not derogated in transferring his affectionsbut it may be doubted whether in his second love he had walked among the stars as in the first a man can hardly mount twice among the stars but he had been as eagerand as true and he had succeeded without any flaw on his conscience it had been agreed when that first disruption took place that he and mabel should be friends and as to a friend he had told her of his hopes when first she had mingled something of sarcasm with her congratulations though it had annoyed him it had hardly made him unhappy when she called him romeo and spoke of herself as rosaline he took her remark as indicating some petulance rather than an enduring love that had been womanly and he could forgive it he had his other great and solid happiness to support him then he had believed that she would soon marry if not silverbridge then some other fitting young nobleman and that all would be well but now things were very far from well the storm which was now howling round her afflicted him much  perhaps the bitterest feeling of all was that her love should have been so much stronger so much more enduring than his own he could not but remember how in his first agony he had blamed her because she had declared that they should be severed he had then told himself that such severing would be to him impossible and that had her nature been as high as his it would have been as impossible to her which nature must he now regard as the higher she had done her best to rid herself of the load of her passion and had failed but he had freed himself with convenient haste all that he had said as to the manliness of conquering grief had been wise enough but still he could not quit himself of some feeling of disgrace in that he had changed and she had not he tried to comfort himself with reflecting that mary was all his ownthat in that matter he had been victorious and happybut for an hour or two he thought more of mabel than of mary  when the time came in which he could employ himself he called for silverbridge and they walked together across the park to westminster silverbridge was gay and full of eagerness as to the coming ministerial statement but tregear could not turn his mind from the work of the morning i dont seem to care very much about it he said at last  i do care very much said silverbridge  what difference will it make  i breakfasted with the governor this morning and i have not seen him in such good spirits since well for a long time the date to which silverbridge would have referred had he not checked himself was that of the evening on which it had been agreed between him and his father that mabel grex should be promoted to the seat of highest honour in the house of palliserbut that was a matter which must henceforward be buried in silence he did not say as much but i feel perfectly sure that he and mr monk have arranged a new government  i dont see any matter for joy in that to conservatives like you and me  he is my fatherand as he is going to be your fatherinlaw i should have thought that you might have been pleased  oh yesif he likes it but i have heard so often of the crushing cares of office and i had thought that of all living men he had been the most crushed by them  all that had to be done in the house of commons on that afternoon was finished before five oclock by halfpast five the house and all the purlieus of the house were deserted and yet at four immediately after prayers there had been such a crowd that members had been unable to find seats tregear and silverbridge having been early had succeeded but those who had been less careful were obliged to listen as best they could in the galleries the stretching out of necks and the holding of hands behind the ears did not last long sir timothy had not had much to say but what he did say was spoken with a dignity which seemed to anticipate future exaltation rather than present downfall there had arisen a question in regard to revenuehe need hardly tell them that it was that question in reference to brewers licences to which the honourable gentleman opposite had alluded on the previous dayas to which unfortunately he was not in accord with his noble friend the prime minister under the circumstances it was hardly possible that they should at once proceed to business and he therefore moved that the house should stand adjourned till tuesday next that was the whole statement  not very long afterwards the prime minister made another statement in the house of lords as the chancellor of the exchequer had very suddenly resigned and had thereby broken up the ministry he had found himself compelled to place his resignation in the hands of her majesty then that house was also adjourned on that afternoon all the clubs were alive with admiration at the great cleverness displayed by sir timothy in this transaction it was not only that he had succeeded in breaking up the ministry and that he had done this without incurring violent disgrace but he had so done it as to throw all the reproach upon his late unfortunate colleague it was thus that mr lupton explained it sir timothy had been at the pains to ascertain on what matters connected with the revenue lord drummondor lord drummonds closest advisershad opinions of their own opinions strong enough not to be abandoned and having discovered that he also discovered arguments on which to found an exactly contrary opinion but as the revenue had been entrusted specially to his unworthy hands he was entitled to his own opinion on this matter the majority of the house said mr lupton and the entire public will no doubt give him credit for great selfabnegation  all this happened on the friday during the saturday it was considered probable that the cabinet would come to terms with itself and that internal wounds would be healed the general opinion was that lord drummond would give way but on the sunday morning it was understood that lord drummond would not yield it was reported that lord drummond was willing to purchase his separation from sir timothy even at the expense of his office that sir timothy should give way seemed to be impossible had he done so it would have been impossible for him to recover the respect of the house then it was rumoured that two or three others had gone with sir timothy and on monday morning it was proclaimed that the prime minister was not in a condition to withdraw his resignation on the tuesday the house met and mr monk announced still from the opposition benches that he had that morning been with the queen then there was another adjournment and all the liberals knew that the gates of paradise were again about to be opened to them  this is only interesting to us as affecting the happiness and character of our duke he had consented to assist mr monk in forming a government and to take office under mr monks leadership he had had many contests with himself before he could bring himself to this submission he knew that if anything could once again make him contented it would be work he knew that if he could serve his country it was his duty to serve it and he knew also that it was only by the adhesion of such men as himself that the traditions of his party could be maintained but he had been prime ministerand he was sure he could never be prime minister again there are in all matters certain little almost hidden signs by which we can measure within our own bosoms the extent of our successes and our failures our dukes friends had told him that his ministry had been serviceable to the country but no one had ever suggested to him that he would again be asked to fill the place which he had filled he had stopped a gap he would beforehand have declared himself willing to serve his country even in this way but having done sohaving done that and no more than thathe felt that he had failed he had in his soreness declared to himself that he would never more take office he had much to do to overcome this promise to himselfbut when he had brought himself to submit he was certainly a happier man  there was no going to see the queen that on the present occasion was done simply by mr monk but on the wednesday morning his name appeared in the list of the new cabinet as president of the council he was perhaps a little fidgety a little too anxious to employ himself and to be employed a little too desirous of immediate workbut still he was happy and gracious to those around him i suppose you like that particular office silverbridge said to him  well yesnot best of all you know and he smiled as he made this admission  you mean prime minister  no indeed i dont i am inclined to think that the premier should always sit in your house no silverbridge if i could have my waywhich is of course impossible for i cannot put off my honoursi would return to my old place i would return to the exchequer where the work is hard and certain where a man can do or at any rate attempt to do some special thing a man there if he sticks to that and does not travel beyond it need not be popular need not be a partisan need not be eloquent need not be a courtier he should understand his profession as should a lawyer or a doctor if he does that thoroughly he can serve his country without recourse to that parliamentary strategy for which i know that i am unfit  you cant do that in the house of lords sir  no no i wish the title could have passed over my head silverbridge and gone to you at once i think we both should have been suited better but there are things which one should not consider even in this place i may perhaps do something shall you attack us very bitterly  i am the only man who does not mean to make any change  how so  i shall stay where i amon the government side of the house  are you clear about that my boy  quite clear  such changes should not be made without very much consideration  i have already written to them at silverbridge and have had three or four answers mr de boung says that the borough is more than grateful mr sprout regrets it much and suggests a few months consideration mr sprugeon seems to think it does not signify  that is hardly complimentary  nonot to me but he is very civil to the family as long as a palliser represents the borough mr sprugeon thinks that it does not matter much on which side he may sit i have had my little vagary and i dont think that i shall change again  i suppose it is your republican brideelect that has done that said the duke laughing     chapter lxxix  the first wedding   as easter sunday fell on the 17th april and as the arrangement of the new cabinet with its inferior offices was not completed till the 6th of that month there was only just time for the new elections before the holidays mr monk sat on his bench so comfortably that he hardly seemed ever to have been off it and phineas finn resumed the peculiar ministerial tone of voice just as though he had never allowed himself to use the free and indignant strains of opposition as to a majoritynothing as yet was known about that some few besides silverbridge might probably transfer themselves to the government none of the ministers lost their seats at the new elections the opposite party seemed for a while to have been paralysed by the defection of sir timothy and men who liked a quiet life were able to comfort themselves with the reflection that nothing could be done this session  for our lovers this was convenient neither of them would have allowed their parliamentary energies to have interfered at such a crisis with his domestic affairs but still it was well to have time at command the day for the marriage of isabel and silverbridge had been now fixed that was to take place on the wednesday after easter and was to be celebrated by special royal favour in the chapel at whitehall all the pallisers would be there and all the relations of all the pallisers all the ambassadors and of course all the americans in london it would be a wretched grind as silverbridge said but it had to be done in the meantime the whole party including the new president of the council were down at matching even isabel though it must be presumed that she had much to do in looking after her bridal garments was able to be there for a day or two but tregear was the person to whom this visit was of the greatest importance  he had been allowed to see lady mary in london but hardly to do more than see her with her he had been alone for about five minutes and then cruel circumstancescircumstances however which were not permanently cruelhad separated them all their great difficulties had been settled and no doubt they were happy tregear though he had been as it were received into grace by that glass of wine still had not entered into the intimacies of the house this he felt himself he had been told that he had better restrain himself from writing to mary and he had restrained himself he had therefore no immediate opportunity of creeping into that perfect intimacy with the house and household which is generally accorded to a promised soninlaw  on this occasion he travelled down alone and as he approached the house he who was not by nature timid felt himself to be somewhat cowed that the duke should not be cold to him was almost impossible of course he was there in opposition to the dukes wishes even silverbridge had never quite liked the match of course he was to have all that he desired of course he was the most fortunate of men of course no man had ever stronger reason to be contented with the girl he loved but still his heart was a little low as he was driven up to the door  the first person whom he saw was the duke himself who as the fly from the station arrived was returning from his walk you are welcome to matching he said taking off his hat with something of ceremony this was said before the servants but tregear was then led into the study and the door was closed i never do anything by halves mr tregear he said since it is to be so you shall be the same to me as though you had come under other auspices of yourself personally i hear all that is good consider yourself at home here and in all things use me as your friend tregear endeavoured to make some reply but could not find words that were fitting i think that the young people are out continued the duke mr warburton will help you to find them if you like to go upon the search the words had been very gracious but still there was something in the manner of the man which made tregear find it almost impossible to regard him as he might have regarded another fatherinlaw he had often heard the duke spoken of as a man who could become awful if he pleased almost without an effort he had been told of the mans mingled simplicity courtesy and selfassertion against which no impudence or raillery could prevail and now he seemed to understand it  he was not driven to go under the private secretarys escort in quest of the young people mary had understood her business much better than that if you please sir lady mary is in the little drawingroom said a wellarrayed young girl to him as soon as the dukes door was closed this was lady marys own maid who had been on the lookout for the fly lady mary had known all details as to the arrival of the trains and the length of the journey from the station and had not been walking with the other young people when the duke had intercepted her lover even that delay she had thought was hard the discreet maid opened the door of the little drawingroomand discreetly closed it instantly at last she said throwing herself into his arms  yesat last  on this occasion time did not envy them the long afternoons of spring had come and as tregear had reached the house between four and five they were able to go out together before the sun set no she said when he came to inquire as to her life during the last twelve months you had not much to be afraid of as to my forgetting  but when everything was against me  one thing was not against you you ought to have been sure of that  and so i was and yet i felt that i ought not to have been sure sometimes in my solitude i used to think that i myself had been wrong i began to doubt whether under any circumstances i could have been justified in asking your fathers daughter to be my wife  because of his rank  not so much his rank as his money  ought that to be considered  a poor man who marries a rich woman will always be suspected  because people are so mean and poorspirited and because they think that money is more than anything else it should be nothing at all in such matters i dont know how it can be anything they have been saying that to me all alongas though one were to stop to think whether one was rich or poor tregear when this was said could not but remember that at a time not very much prior to that at which mary had not stopped to think neither for a while had he and mabel i suppose it was worse for me than for you she added  i hope not  but it was frank and therefore i ought to have it made up to me now it was very bad to be alone here particularly when i felt that papa always looked at me as though i were a sinner he did not mean it but he could not help looking at me like that and there was nobody to whom i could say a word  it was pretty much the same with me  yes but you were not offending a father who could not keep himself from looking reproaches at you i was like a boy at school who had been put into coventry and then they sent me to lady cantrip  was that very bad  i do believe that if i were a young woman with a wellordered mind i should feel myself very much indebted to lady cantrip she had a terrible task of it but i could not teach myself to like her i believe she knew all through that i should get my way at last  that ought to have made you friends  but yet she tried everything she could and when i told her about that meeting up at lord grexs she was so shocked do you remember that  do i remember it  were not you shocked this question was not to be answered by any word i was she continued it was an awful thing to do but i was determined to show them all that i was in earnest do you remember how miss cassewary looked  miss cassewary knew all about it  i daresay she did and so i suppose did mabel grex i had thought that perhaps i might make mabel a confidante but then she looked up into his face  but what  you like mabel do you not i do  i like her very very much  perhaps you have liked her too well for that eh frank  too well for what  that she should have heard all that i had to say about you with sympathy if so i am so sorry  you need not fear that i have ever for a moment been untrue either to her or you  i am sure you have not to me poor mabel then they took me to custins that was worst of all i cannot quite tell you what happened there of course he asked herbut as she had said she could not quite tell him about lord popplecourt  the next morning the duke asked his guest in a playful tone what was his christian name it could hardly be that he should not have known but yet he asked the question francis oliphant said tregear those are two christian names i suppose but what do they call you at home  frank whispered mary who was with them  then i will call you frank if you will allow me the use of christian names is i think pleasant and hardly common enough among us i almost forget my own boys name because the practice has grown up of calling him by a title  i am going to call him abraham said isabel  abraham is a good name only i do not think he got it from his godfathers and godmothers  who can call a man plantagenet i should as soon think of calling my fatherinlaw coeur de lion  so he is said mary whereupon the duke kissed the two girls and went his wayshowing that by this time he had adopted the one and the proposed husband of the other into his heart  the day before the duke started for london to be present at the grand marriage he sent for frank i suppose said he that you would wish that some time should be fixed for your own marriage to this the accepted suitor of course assented but before we can do that something must be settled aboutmoney tregear when he heard this became hot all over and felt that he could not restrain his blushes such must be the feeling of a man when he finds himself compelled to own to a girls father that he intends to live upon her money and not upon his own i do not like to be troublesome continued the duke or to ask questions which might seem to be impertinent  oh no of course i feel my position i can only say that it was not because your daughter might probably have money that i first sought her love  it shall be so received and now but perhaps it will be best that you should arrange all this with my man of business mr moreton shall be instructed mr moreton lives near my place in barsetshire but is now in london if you will call on him he shall tell you what i would suggest i hope you will find that your affairs will be comfortable and now as to the time  isabels wedding was declared by the newspapers to have been one of the most brilliant remembered in the metropolis there were six bridesmaids of whom of course mary was oneand of whom poor lady mabel grex was equally of course not another poor lady mabel was at this time with miss cassewary at grex paying what she believed would be a last visit to the old family home among the others were two american girls brought into that august society for the sake of courtesy rather than of personal love and there were two other palliser girls and a scotch mccloskie cousin the breakfast was of course given by mr boncassen at his house in brook street where the bridal presents were displayed and not only were they displayed but a list of them with an approximating statement as to their value appeared in one or two of the next days newspapersas to which terrible sin against good taste neither was mr or mrs boncassen guilty but in these days in which such splendid things were done on so very splendid a scale a young lady cannot herself lay out her friends gifts so as to be properly seen by her friends some wellskilled wellpaid hand is needed even for that and hence comes this public information on affairs which should surely be private in our grandmothers time the happy brides happy mother herself compounded the cakeor at any rate the trusted housekeeper but we all know that terrible tower of silver which now stands niddlenoddling with its appendages of flags and spears on the modern wedding breakfasttable it will come to pass with some of us soon that we must deny ourselves the pleasure of having young friends because their marriage presents are so costly  poor mrs boncassen had not perhaps a happy time with her august guests on that morning but when she retired to give isabel her last kiss in privacy she did feel proud to think that her daughter would some day be an english duchess     chapter lxxx  the second wedding   november is not altogether an hymeneal month but it was not till november that lady mary palliser became the wife of frank tregear it was postponed a little perhaps in order that the silverbridgesas they were now calledmight be present the silverbridges who were now quite darby and joan had gone to the states when the session had been brought to a close early in august and had remained there nearly three months isabel had taken infinite pleasure in showing her english husband to her american friends and the american friends had no doubt taken a pride in seeing so glorious a british husband in the hands of an american wife everything was new to silverbridge and he was happy in his new possession she too enjoyed it infinitely and so it happened that they had been unwilling to curtail their sojourn but in november they had to return because mary had declared that her marriage should be postponed till it could be graced by the presence of her elder brother  the marriage of silverbridge had been august there had been a manifest intention that it should be so nobody knew with whom this originated mrs boncassen had probably been told that it ought to be so and mr boncassen had been willing to pay the bill external forces had perhaps operated the duke had simply been passive and obedient there had however been a general feeling that the bride of the heir of the house of omnium should be produced to the world amidst a blare of trumpets and a glare of torches so it had been but both the duke and mary were determined that this other wedding should be different it was to take place at matching and none would be present but they who were staying in the house or who lived aroundsuch as tenants and dependants four clergymen united their forces to tie isabel to her husband one of whom was a bishop one a canon and the two others royal chaplains but there was only to be the vicar of the parish at matching and indeed there were no guests in the house except the two bridesmaids and mr and mrs finn as to mrs finn mary had made a request and then the duke had suggested that the husband should be asked to accompany his wife  it was very pretty the church itself is pretty standing in the park close to the ruins of the old priory not above three hundred yards from the house and they all walked taking the broad pathway through the ruins going under that figure of sir guy which silverbridge had pointed out to isabel when they had been whispering there together the duke led the way with his girl upon his arm the two bridesmaids followed then silverbridge and his wife with phineas and his wife gerald and the bridegroom accompanied them belonging as it were to the same party it was very rusticalmost improper this is altogether wrong you know said gerald you should appear coming from some other part of the world as if you were almost unexpected you ought not to have been in the house at all and certainly should have gone under some disguise  there had been rich presents too on this occasion but they were shown to none except to mrs finn and the bridesmaidsand perhaps to the favoured servants in the house at any rate there was nothing said of them in the newspapers one present there wasgiven not to the bride but to the bridegroomwhich he showed to no one except to her this came to him only on the morning of his marriage and the envelope containing it bore the postmark of sedbergh he knew the handwriting well before he opened the parcel it contained a small signetring with his crest and with it there were but a few words written on a scrap of paper i pray that you may be happy this was to have been given to you long ago but i kept it back because of that decision he showed the ring to mary and told her it had come from lady mabelbut the scrap of paper no one saw but himself  perhaps the matter most remarkable in the wedding was the hilarity of the duke one who did not know him well might have said that he was a man with few cares and who now took special joy in the happiness of his childrenwho was thoroughly contented to see them marry after their own hearts and yet as he stood there on the altarsteps giving his daughter to that new son and looking first at his girl and then at his married son he was reminding himself of all that he had suffered  after the breakfastwhich was by no means a grand repast and at which the cake did not look so like an illsoldered silver castle as that other construction had donethe happy couple were sent away in a modest chariot to the railway station and not above halfadozen slippers were thrown after them there were enough for luckor perhaps there might have been luck even without them for the wife thoroughly respected her husband as did the husband his wife mrs finn when she was alone with phineas said a word or two about frank tregear when she first told me of her engagement i did not think it possible that she should marry him but after he had been with me i felt sure that he would succeed  well sir said silverbridge to the duke when they were out together in the park that afternoon what do you think about him  i think he is a manly young man  he is certainly that and then he knows things and understands them it was never a surprise to me that mary should have been so fond of him  i do not know that one ought to be surprised at anything perhaps what surprised me most was that he should have looked so high there seemed to be so little to justify it but now i will accept that as courage which i before regarded as arrogance
