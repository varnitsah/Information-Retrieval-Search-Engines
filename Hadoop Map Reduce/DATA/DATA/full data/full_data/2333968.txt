kindartedness is often only another name for artfulness same as sam smalls kindness to ginger dick and peter russet  it started with a row  they was just back from a vyge and ad taken a nice room together in wapping and for the fust day or two wot with aving plenty o money to spend and nothing to do they was like three brothers  then in a little oldfashioned publicouse down poplar way one night they fell out over a little joke ginger played on sam  it was the fust drink that evening and sam ad just ordered a pot o beer and three glasses when ginger winked at the landlord and offered to bet sam a level arfdollar that e wouldnt drink off that pot o beer without taking breath  the landlord held the money and old sam with a appy smile on is face ad just taken up the mug when he noticed the odd way in which they was all watching him  twice he took the mug up and put it down agin without starting and asked em wot the little game was but they ony laughed  he took it up the third time and started and he ad just got about arfway through when ginger turns to the landlord and ses  did you catch it in the mousetrap he ses or did it die of poison  pore sam started as though he ad been shot and arter getting rid of the beer in is mouth stood there olding the mug away from im and making such orrible faces that they was amost frightened  wots the matter with him  ive never seen im carry on like that over a drop of beer before ses ginger staring  he usually likes it ses peter russet  not with a dead mouse in it ses sam trembling with passion  mouse ses ginger innercentlike  mouse  why i didnt say it was in your beer sam  wotever put that into your ead  and made you lose your bet ses peter  then old sam see ow hed been done and the way he carried on when the landlord gave ginger the arfdollar and said it was won fair and honest was a disgrace  he opped about that bar arf crazy until at last the landlord and is brother and a couple o soldiers and a helpless cripple wot wos selling matches put im outside and told im to stop there  he stopped there till ginger and peter came out and then drawing imself up in a proud way he told em their characters and wot he thought about em  and he said e never wanted to see wot they called their faces agin as long as he lived  ive done with you he ses both of you for ever  all right ses ginger moving off  tata for the present  lets ope hell come ome in a better temper peter  ome ses sam with a nasty laugh ome  dye think im coming back to breathe the same air as you ginger  dye think i want to be suffocated  he held his ead up very igh and arter looking at them as if they was dirt he turned round and walked off with his nose in the air to spend the evening by imself  his temper kept him up for a time but arter a while he ad to own up to imself that it was very dull and the later it got the more he thought of is nice warm bed  the more e thought of it the nicer and warmer it seemed and arter a struggle between his pride and a few arfpints he got is good temper back agin and went off ome smiling  the room was dark when e got there and arter standing listening a moment to ginger and peter snoring he took off is coat and sat down on is bed to take is boots off  he only sat down for a flash and then he bent down and hit his ead an awful smack against another ead wot ad just started up to see wot it was sitting on its legs  he thought it was peter or ginger in the wrong bed at fust but afore he could make it out ginger ad got out of is own bed and lit the candle then e saw it was a stranger in is bed and without saying a word he laid old of him by the air and began dragging him out  here stop that ses ginger catching hold of im  lend a hand ere peter  peter lent a hand and screwed it into the back o sams neck till he made im leave go and then the stranger a nastylooking little chap with a yellow face and a little dark moustache told sam wot hed like to do to him  who are you ses sam and wot are you adoing of in my bed  its our lodger ses ginger  your wot ses sam ardly able to believe his ears  our lodger ses peter russet  weve let im the bed you said you didnt want for sixpence a night  now

it  he rushed at the lodger but peter and ginger got hold of im agin and put im down on the floor and sat on im till he promised to beave himself  they let im get up at last and then arter calling themselves names for their kindartedness they said if he was very good he might sleep on the floor  sam looked at em for a moment and then without a word he took off is boots and put on is coat and went up in a corner to be out of the draught but wot with the cold and is temper and the hardness of the floor it was a long time afore e could get to sleep  he dropped off at last and it seemed to im that he ad only just closed is eyes when it was daylight  he opened one eye and was just going to open the other when he saw something as made im screw em both up sharp and peep through is eyelashes  the lodger was standing at the foot o gingers bed going through is pockets and then arter waiting a moment and aving a look round he went through peter russets  sam lay still mouse while the lodger tiptoed out o the room with is boots in his and and then springing up follered him downstairs  he caught im up just as he ad undone the front door and catching hold of im by the back o the neck shook im till e was tired  then he let go of im and holding his fist under is nose told im to hand over the money and look sharp about it  yeyeyes sir ses the lodger who was arf choked  sam held out his and and the lodger arter saying it was only a little bit o fun on is part and telling im wot a fancy he ad taken to im from the fust put gingers watch and chain into his ands and eighteen pounds four shillings and sevenpence  sam put it into his pocket and arter going through the lodgers pockets to make sure he adnt forgot anything opened the door and flung im into the street  he stopped on the landing to put the money in a belt he was wearing under is clothes and then e went back on tiptoe to is corner and went to sleep with one eye open and the appiest smile that had been on his face for years  he shut both eyes when he eard ginger wake up and he slept like a child through the orrible noise that peter and ginger see fit to make when they started to put their clothes on  he got tired of it afore they did and arter opening is eyes slowly and yawning he asked ginger wot he meant by it  youll wake your lodger up if you aint careful making that noise he ses  wots the matter  sam ses

while longer chinking is money and when he took off his coat to wash ginger dick poured the water out for im and peter russet picked up the soap which ad fallen on the floor  then they started pitying themselves looking very ard at the back of old sam while they did it  i spose weve got to starve peter ses ginger in a sad voice  looks like it ses peter dressing hisself very slowly  theres nobodyll

ankercher  he went out and ad a steak and onions and a pint o beer but although he kept looking up sudden from is plate he didnt see peter or ginger it spoilt is dinner a bit but arter he got outside e saw them standing at the corner and pretending not to see them he went off for a walk down the mile end road  illustration we thought you might want it sam ses peter  he walked as far as bow with them folleringim and then he jumped on a bus and rode back as far as whitechapel  there was no sign of em when he got off and feeling a bit lonesome he stood about looking in shop windows until e see them coming along as hard as they could come  why halloa he ses  where did you spring from  weweweve beenfor a bit of a walk ses ginger dick puffing and blowing like a grampus  tokeep down the unger

nice gal with black air and her fingers covered all over with rings said that it did im credit and they stood there talking about tramps and beggars and suchlike till peter and ginger nearly choked  he stood there watching em and smoking a threepenny cigar and when they ad finished he told the barmaid to give em a sausageroll each and went off  peter and ginger snatched up their sausagerolls and follered im and at last ginger swallowed his pride and walked up to im and asked im to lend them some money  youll get it back agin he ses  you know that well enough  certnly not ses sam and im

dinner with im at browns and nothing they could do pleased him  he spoke to peter russet out loud about making a noise while he was eating and directly arterwards he told ginger to use his pocket ankercher  pore ginger sat there looking at im and swelling and swelling until he nearly bust and sam told im if he couldnt keep is temper when people was trying to do im a kindness hed better go and get somebody else to keep him  he took em to a musicall that night but he spoilt it all for em by taking em into the little publicouse in whitechapel road fust and standing em a drink  he told the barmaid e was keeping em till they could find a job and arter she ad told him he was too softarted and would only be took advantage of she brought another barmaid up to look at em and ask em wot they could do and why they didnt do it  sam served em like that for over a week and he ad so much praise from mr brown and other people that it nearly turned his ead  for once in his life he ad it pretty near all is own way  twice ginger dick slipped off and tried to get a ship and came back sulky and hungry and once peter russet sprained his thumb trying to get a job at the docks  they gave it up then and kept to sam like a couple o shadders only giving im backanswers when they felt as if something ud give way inside if they didnt  for the fust time in their lives they began to count the days
