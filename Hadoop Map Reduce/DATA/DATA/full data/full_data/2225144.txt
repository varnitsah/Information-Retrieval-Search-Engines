2225144	uncle toms cabin  young folks edition   by  harriet beecher stowe    uncle toms cabin     chapter i   uncle tom and little harry are sold   very many years ago instead of having servants to wait upon them and work for them people used to have slaves these slaves were paid no wages their masters gave them only food and clothes in return for their work  when any one wanted servants he went to market to buy them just as nowadays we buy horses and cows or even tables and chairs  if the poor slaves were bought by kind people they would be quite happy then they would work willingly for their masters and mistresses and even love them but very often cruel people bought slaves these cruel people used to beat them and be unkind to them in many other ways  it was very wicked to buy and sell human beings as if they were cattle yet christian people did it and many who were good and kind otherwise thought there was no wrong in being cruel to their poor slaves they are only black people they said to themselves black people do not feel things as we do that was not kind as black people suffer pain just in the same way as white people do  one of the saddest things for the poor slaves was that they could never long be a happy family all togetherfather mother and little brothers and sistersbecause at any time the master might sell the father or the mother or one of the children to some one else when this happened those who were left behind were very sad indeedmore sad than if their dear one had died  uncle tom was a slave he was a very faithful and honest servant and his master mr shelby was kind to him uncle toms wife was called aunt chloe she was mr shelbys head cook and a very good one too she was nobody in all the country round could make such delicious pies and cakes as aunt chloe  uncle tom and aunt chloe lived together in a pretty little cottage built of wood quite close to mr shelbys big house  the little cottage was covered with climbing roses and the garden was full of beautiful bright flowers and lovely fruit trees  uncle tom and aunt chloe lived happily for many years in their little cottage or cabin as it was called all day uncle tom used to work in the fields while aunt chloe was busy in the kitchen at mr shelbys house when evening came they both went home to their cottage and their children and were merry together  mr shelby was a good man and kind to his slaves but he was not very careful of his money when he had spent all he had he did not know what to do to get more at last he borrowed money from a man called haley hoping to be able to pay it back again some day  but that day never came haley grew impatient and said if you dont pay what you owe me i will take your house and lands and sell them to pay myself back all the money i have lent to you  so mr shelby sold everything he could spare and gathered money together in every way he could think of but still there was not enough  then haley said give me that slave of yours called tomhe is worth a lot of money  but mr shelby knew that haley was not a nice man he knew he did not want tom for a servant but only wanted to sell him again to make more money so mr shelby said no i cant do that i never mean to sell any of my slaves least of all tom he has been with me since he was a little boy  oh very well said haley i shall sell your house and lands as i said i should  mr shelby could not bear to think of that so he agreed to let haley have tom he made him promise however not to sell tom again except to a kind master  very well said haley but tom isnt enough i must have another slave  just at this moment a little boy came dancing into the room where mr shelby and haley were talking  he was a pretty merry little fellow the son of a slave called eliza who was mrs shelbys maid  there now said haley give me that little chap as well as tom and we will say no more about the money you owe me  i cant said mr shelby my wife is very fond of eliza and would never hear of having harry sold  oh very well said haley once more i must just sell your house  so again mr shelby gave in and haley went away with the promise that next morning uncle tom and little harry should be given to him to be his slaves     chapter ii   eliza runs away with little harry   mr shelby was very unhappy because of what he had done he knew his wife would be very unhappy too and he did not know how to tell her  he had to do it that night however before she went to bed  mrs shelby could hardly believe it oh you do not mean this she said you must not sell our good tom and dear little harry do anything rather than that it is a wicked wicked thing to do  there is nothing else i can do said mr shelby i have sold everything i can think of and at any rate now that haley has set his heart on having tom and harry he would not take anything or anybody instead  mrs shelby cried very much about it but at last though she was very very unhappy she fell asleep  but some one whom mr and mrs shelby never thought of was listening to this talk  eliza was sitting in the next room the door was not quite closed so she could not help hearing what was said as she listened she grew pale and cold and a terrible look of pain came into her face  eliza had had three dear little children but two of them had died when they were tiny babies she loved and cared for harry all the more because she had lost the others now he was to be taken from her and sold to cruel men and she would never see him again she felt she could not bear it  elizas husband was called george and was a slave too he did not belong to mr shelby but to another man who had a farm quite near george and eliza could not live together as a husband and wife generally do indeed they hardly ever saw each other georges master was a cruel man and would not let him come to see his wife he was so cruel and beat george so dreadfully that the poor slave made up his mind to run away he had come that very day to tell eliza what he meant to do  as soon as mr and mrs shelby stopped talking eliza crept away to her own room where little harry was sleeping there he lay with his pretty curls around his face his rosy mouth was half open his fat little hands thrown out over the bedclothes and a smile like a sunbeam upon his face  my baby my sweetone said eliza they have sold you but mother will save you yet  she did not cry she was too sad and sorrowful for that taking a piece of paper and a pencil she wrote quickly  illustration  oh missis dear missis dont think me ungratefuldont think hard of me anyway i heard all you and master said tonight i am going to try to save my boyyou will not blame me i god bless and reward you for all your kindness  eliza was going to run away  she gathered a few of harrys clothes into a bundle put on her hat and jacket and went to wake him  poor harry was rather frightened at being waked in the middle of the night and at seeing his mother bending over him with her hat and jacket on  what is the matter mother he said beginning to cry  illustration  hush she said harry mustnt cry or speak aloud or they will hear us a wicked man was coming to take little harry away from his mother and carry him way off in the dark but mother wont let him shes going to put on her little boys cap and coat and run off with him so the ugly man cant catch him  harry stopped crying at once and was good and quiet as a little mouse while his mother dressed him when he was ready she lifted him in her arms and crept softly out of the house  it was a beautiful clear starlight night but very cold for it was wintertime eliza ran quickly to uncle toms cottage and tapped on the window  aunt chloe was not asleep so she jumped up at once and opened the door she was very much astonished to see eliza standing there with harry in her arms uncle tom followed her to the door and was very much astonished too  im running away uncle tom and aunt chloecarrying off my child said eliza master sold him  sold him they both echoed lifting up their hands in dismay  yes sold him said eliza i heard master tell missis that he had sold my harry and you uncle tom the man is coming to take you away tomorrow  at first tom could hardly believe what he heard then he sank down and buried his face in his hands  the good lord have pity on us said aunt chloe what has tom done that master should sell him  illustration  he hasnt done anythingit isnt for that master dont want to sell but he owes this man money if he doesnt pay him it will end in his having to sell the house and all the slaves master said he was sorry but missis she talked like an angel im a wicked girl to leave her so but i cant help it it must be right but if it ant right the good lord will forgive me for i cant help doing it  tom said aunt chloe why dont you go too theres time  tom slowly raised his head and looked sorrowfully at her  no no he said let eliza go it is right that she should try to save her boy masr has always trusted me and i cant leave him like that it is better for me to go alone than for the whole place to be sold masr isnt to blame chloe he will take care of you and the poor  tom could say no more big man though he was he burst into tears at the thought of leaving his wife and dear little children never to see them any more  aunt chloe said eliza in a minute or two i must go i saw my husband today he told me he meant to run away soon because his master is so cruel to him try to send him a message from me tell him i have run away to save our boy tell him to come after me if he can goodbye goodbye god bless you  then eliza went out again into the dark night with her little boy in her arms and aunt chloe shut the door softly behind her     chapter iii   the morning after   next morning when it was discovered that eliza had run away with her little boy there was great excitement and confusion all over the house  mrs shelby was very glad thank god she said i hope eliza will get right away i could not bear to think of harry being sold to that cruel man  mr shelby was angry haley knew i didnt want to sell the child he said he will blame me for this  one person only was quite silent and that was aunt chloe she went on making the breakfast as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement round her  all the little black boys belonging to the house thought it was fine fun very soon about a dozen young imps were roosting like so many crows on the railings waiting for haley to come they wanted to see how angry he would be when he heard the news  and he was dreadfully angry the little nigger boys thought it was grand they shouted and laughed and made faces at him to their hearts content  at last haley became so angry that mr shelby offered to give him two men to help him to find eliza  but these two men sam and andy knew quite well that mrs shelby did not want eliza to be caught so they put off as much time as they could  they let loose their horses and haleys too then they frightened and chased them till they raced like mad things all over the great lawns which surrounded the house  whenever it seemed likely that a horse would be caught sam ran up waving his hat and shouting wildly now for it cotch him cotch him this frightened the horses so much that they galloped off faster than before  haley rushed up and down shouting and using dreadful naughty words and stamping with rage all the time  at last about twelve oclock sam came riding up with haleys horse hes cotched he said seemingly very proud of himself i cotched him  of course now it was too late to start before dinner besides the horses were so tired with all their running about that they had to have a rest  when at last they did start sam led them by a wrong road so the sun was almost setting before they arrived at the village where haley hoped to find eliza     chapter iv   the chase   when eliza left uncle toms cabin she felt very sad and lonely she knew she was leaving all the friends she had ever had behind her  at first harry was frightened soon he grew sleepy mother i dont need to keep awake do i he said  no my darling sleep if you want to  but mother if i do get asleep you wont let the bad man take me  no  youre sure ant you mother  yes sure  illustration  harry dropped his little weary head upon her shoulder and was soon fast asleep  eliza walked on and on never resting all through the night when the sun rose she was many miles away from her old home still she walked on only stopping in the middle of the day to buy a little dinner for herself and harry at a farmhouse  at last when it was nearly dark she arrived at a village on the banks of the river ohio if she could only get across that river eliza felt she would be safe  she went to a little inn on the bank where a kindlooking woman was busy cooking supper  is there a boat that takes people across the river now she asked  no indeed replied the woman the boats has stopped running it isnt safe there be too many blocks of ice floating about  eliza looked so sad and disappointed when she heard this that the good woman was sorry for her harry too was so tired that he began to cry  illustration  here take him into this room said the woman opening the door into a small bedroom  eliza laid her tired little boy upon the bed and he soon fell fast asleep but for her there was no rest she stood at the window watching the river with its great floating blocks of ice wondering how she could cross it  as she stood there she heard a shout looking up she saw sam she drew back just in time for haley and andy were riding only a yard or two behind him  it was a dreadful moment for eliza her room opened by a side door to the river she seized her child and sprang down the steps towards it  haley caught sight of her as she disappeared down the bank throwing himself from his horse and calling loudly to sam and andy he was after her in a moment  in that terrible moment her feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground the next she was at the waters edge  on they came behind her with one wild cry and flying leap she jumped right over the water by the shore on to the raft of ice beyond it was a desperate leap haley sam and andy cried out and lifted up their hands in astonishment  the great piece of ice pitched and creaked as her weight came upon it but she stayed there not a moment with wild cries she leaped to another and still anotherstumblingleapingslippingspringing up again  her shoes were gone her stockings cut from her feet by the sharp edges of the ice blood marked every step but she knew nothing felt nothing till dimly as in a dream she saw the ohio side and a man helping her up the bank  yer a brave gal now whoever ye are said the man  oh save medo save medo hide me she cried  why whats the matter asked the man  my child this boymasr sold him theres his new masr she said pointing to the other shore oh save me  yer a right brave gal said the man go there pointing to a big white house close by they are kind folks theyll help you  oh thank you thank you said eliza as she walked quickly away the man stood and looked after her wonderingly  on the other side of the river haley was standing perfectly amazed at the scene when eliza disappeared over the bank he turned and looked at sam and andy with terrible anger in his eyes  but sam and andy were glad oh so glad that eliza had escaped they were so glad that they laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks  ill make ye laugh said haley laying about their heads with his riding whip  they ducked their heads ran shouting up the bank and were on their horses before he could reach them  good evening masr said sam i berry much spect missis be anxious bout us masr haley wont want us no longer then off they went as fast as their horses could gallop  it was late at night before they reached home again but mrs shelby was waiting for them as soon as she heard the horses galloping up she ran out to the balcony  is that you sam she called where are they  masr haleys arestin at the tavern hes drefful fatigued missis  and eliza sam  come up here sam called mr shelby who had followed his wife and tell your mistress what she wants to know  so sam went up and told the wonderful story of how eliza had crossed the river on the floating ice mr and mrs shelby found it hard to believe that such a thing was possible  mrs shelby was very very glad that eliza had escaped she told aunt chloe to give sam and andy a specially good supper then they went to bed quite pleased with their days work     chapter v   eliza finds a refuge   a lady and gentleman were sitting talking happily together in the drawingroom of the white house to which eliza had gone suddenly their old black manofallwork put his head in at the door and said will missis come into the kitchen  the lady went presently she called to her husband i do wish you would come here a moment  he rose and went into the kitchen  there lay eliza on two kitchen chairs her poor feet were all cut and bleeding and she had fainted quite away the master of the house drew his breath short and stood silent  illustration  his wife and the cook were trying to bring eliza round the old man had harry on his knee and was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings to warm the little cold feet  poor creature said the lady  suddenly eliza opened her eyes a dreadful look of pain came into her face she sprang up saying oh my harry have they got him  as soon as he heard her voice harry jumped from the old mans knee and running to her side put up his arms  oh hes here hes here she said kissing him oh maam she went on turning wildly to the lady of the house do protect us dont let them get him  nobody shall hurt you here poor woman said the lady you are safe dont be afraid  god bless you said eliza covering her face and sobbing while harry seeing her crying tried to get into her lap to comfort her  you neednt be afraid of anything we are friends here poor woman tell me where you come from and what you want said the lady  i came from the other side of the river said eliza  when said the gentleman very much astonished  tonight  how did you come  i crossed on the ice  crossed on the ice exclaimed every one  yes said eliza slowly i did god helped me and i crossed on the ice they were close behind meright behind and there was no other way  law missis said the old servant the ice is all in broken up blocks aswinging up and down in the water  i know it is i know it said eliza wildly but i did it i wouldnt have thought i couldi didnt think i

maam to go all alonea baby that had never been away from his mother in his life i couldnt bear it i took him and ran away in the night they chased me they were coming down close behind me and i heard em i jumped right on to the ice how i got across i dont know the first i knew a man was helping me up the bank  it was such a sad story that the tears came into the eyes of everyone who heard her tell it  illustration  where do you mean to go to poor woman asked the lady  to canada if i only knew where that was is it very far off is canada said eliza looking up in a simple trusting way to the kind ladys face  poor woman said she again  is it a great way off asked eliza  yes said the lady of the house sadly it is far away but we will try to help you to get there eliza wanted to go to canada because it belonged to the british they did not allow any one to be made a slave there george too was going to try to reach canada  wife said the gentleman when they had gone back again into their own sittingroom we must get that poor woman away tonight she is not safe here i know some good people far in the country who will take care of her  so this kind gentleman got the carriage ready and drove eliza and her boy a long long way through the dark night to a cottage far in the country there he left her with a good man and his wife who promised to be kind to her and help her to go to canada he gave some money to the good man too and told him to use it for eliza     chapter vi   uncle tom says goodbye   the day after the hunt for eliza was a very sad one in uncle toms cabin it was the day on which haley was going to take uncle tom away  aunt chloe had been up very early she had washed and ironed all toms clothes and packed his trunk neatly now she was cooking the breakfastthe last breakfast she would ever cook for her dear husband her eyes were quite red and swollen with crying and the tears kept running down her cheeks all the time  its the last time said tom sadly  aunt chloe could not answer she sat down buried her face in her hands and sobbed aloud  spose we must be resigned but o lord how can i if i knew anything where you was goin or how theyd treat you missis says shell try and buy you back again in a year or two but lor nobody never comes back that goes down there  therell be the same god there chloe that there is here  well said aunt chloe spose dere will but the lord lets drefful things happen sometimes i dont seem to get no comfort dat way  lets think on our mercies said tom in a shaking voice  mercies said aunt chloe dont see any mercies in t it isnt right it isnt right it should be so masr never ought to have left it so that ye could be took for his debts mebbe he cant help himself now but i feel its wrong nothing can beat that out of me such a faithful crittur as yeve been reckonin on him more than your own wife and chilen  chloe now if ye love me you wont talk so when it is perhaps jest the last time well ever have together said tom  wall anyway theres wrong about it somewhere said aunt chloe i cant jest make out where tis but there is wrong somewhere im sure of that  neither tom nor chloe could eat any breakfast their hearts were too full of sorrow but the little children who hardly understood what was happening enjoyed theirs it was not often that they had such a fine one as chloe had cooked for toms last morning at home  illustration  breakfast was just finished when mrs shelby came chloe was not very pleased to see her she was angry and blamed her for letting tom be sold  but mrs shelby did not seem to see aunt chloes angry looks tom she said turning to him i come to she could say no more she was crying so bitterly  then all aunt chloes anger faded away  lor now missis dontdont she said she too burst out crying again and for a few minutes they all sobbed together  tom said mrs shelby at last i cant do anything for you now but i promise you most solemnly to save as much money as i can as soon as i have enough i will buy you back again  just then haley arrived tom said a last sad goodbye to his wife and children and got into the cart which haley had brought with him  as soon as tom was seated in the cart haley took a heavy chain and fastened it round his ankles poor tom had done nothing wrong yet he was treated worse than a thief just because he was a slave  you dont need to do that said mrs shelby tom wont run away  dont know so much about that maam ive lost one already i cant afford to run any more risks replied haley  please give my love to masr george said tom looking round sadly tell him how sorry i am he is not at home to say goodbye  master george was mr and mrs shelbys son he was very fond of tom and was teaching him to write he often used to come and have tea in uncle toms little cottage aunt chloe used to make her very nicest cakes when masr george came to tea but he was not at home now and did not know that tom had been sold  haley whipped up the horse and with a last sad look at the old place tom was whirled away to a town called washington     chapter vii   uncle tom meets eva   haley stayed in washington several days he went to market each day and bought more slaves he put heavy chains on their hands and feet and sent them to prison along with tom  when he had bought all the slaves he wanted and was ready to go he drove them before him like a herd of cattle on to a boat which was going south  it was a beautiful boat the deck was gay with lovely ladies and fine gentlemen walking about enjoying the bright spring sunshine  down on the lower deck in the dark among the luggage were crowded tom and the other poor slaves  some of the ladies and gentlemen on board were very sorry for the poor niggers and pitied them others never thought about them at all or if they did thought it was quite just and proper that they should be treated badly they are only slaves they said  among the passengers was a pretty little girl about six years old she had beautiful golden hair and big blue eyes she ran about here there and everywhere dancing and laughing like a little fairy there were other children on board but not one so pretty or so merry as she she was always dressed in white and tom thought she looked like a little angel as she danced and ran about  often and often she would come and walk sadly around the place where the poor slaves sat in their chains she would look pityingly at them and then go slowly away once or twice she came with her dress full of sweets nuts and oranges and gave them all some  tom watched the little lady and tried to make friends with her his pockets were full of all kinds of things with which he used to amuse his old masters children  he could make whistles of every sort and size cut baskets out of cherrystones faces out of nutshells jumping figures out of bits of wood he brought these out one by one and though the little girl was shy at first they soon grew to be great friends  what is missys name said tom one day  evangeline st clare said the little girl though papa and everybody else call me eva now whats your name  my names tom the little chilen at my old home used to call me uncle tom  then i mean to call you uncle tom because you see i like you said eva so uncle tom where are you going  i dont know miss eva  dont know said eva  no im going to be sold to somebody i dont know who  my papa can buy you said eva quickly if he buys you you will have good times i mean to ask him to this very day  thank you my little lady said tom  just at this moment the boat stopped at a small landingplace to take in some wood eva heard her fathers voice and ran away to speak to him  tom too rose and walked to the side he was allowed to go about now without chains he was so good and gentle that even a man like haley could not help seeing that it could do no harm to let him go free  tom helped the sailors to carry the wood on the boat he was so big and strong that they were very glad to have his help  illustration  eva and her father were standing by the railings as the boat once more began to move it had hardly left the landingstage when some how or other eva lost her balance she fell right over the side of the boat into the water  tom was standing just under her on the lower deck as she fell in one moment he sprang after her the next he had caught her his arms and was swimming with her to the boatside where eager hands were held out to take her  the whole boat was in confusion every one ran to help eva while the poor slave went back to his place unnoticed and uncared for  but mr st clare did not forget  the next day tom sat on the lower deck with folded arms anxiously watching him as he talked to haley  evas father was a very handsome man he was like eva with the same beautiful blue eyes and goldenbrown hair he was very fond of fun and laughter and though he had quite made up his mind to buy tom he was now teasing haley and pretending to think that he was asking too much money for him  illustration  papa do buy him its no matter what you pay whispered eva softly putting her arms around her fathers neck you have money enough i know i want him  what for pussy are you going to use him for a rattlebox or a rockinghorse or what  i want to make him happy  mr st clare laughed but after making a few more jokes about it he gave haley the money he asked for and tom had a new master  come eva said mr st clare and taking her hand went across the boat to tom  look up tom he said to him and see how you like your new master  tom looked up mr st clare had such a gay young handsome face that tom could not help feeling glad grateful tears rushed to his eyes as he said god bless you masr  can you drive horses tom  ive been allays used to horses said tom  well i think ill make you a coachman but you must not get drunk  tom looked surprised and a little hurt  i never drink masr he said  never mind my boy said mr st clare seeing him look so grave i dont doubt you mean to do well  i certainly do masr said tom  and you shall have good times said eva papa is very good to everybody only he always will laugh at them  papa is much obliged to you said mr st clare laughing as he walked away     chapter viii   eliza among the quakers   while uncle tom was sailing south down the wide river to his new masters home eliza with her boy was travelling north to canada  kind people helped her all the way she passed from friend to friend till she arrived safely at a village where the people were quakers  the quakers were gentle quiet people they all dressed alike in plain grey clothes and the women wore big white muslin caps because they thought it was wicked to have slaves they helped those who ran away from their cruel masters often they were punished for doing this but still they went on helping the poor slaves for though the laws said it was wrong they felt quite sure that it was really right to do so  the kind quaker women grew to be very fond of eliza and would have been glad if she would have stayed with them  but eliza said no i must go on i dare not stop i cant sleep at night i cant rest last night i dreamed i saw that man come into the yard  poor child said rachel the kind quaker woman to whom she was speaking poor child thee mustnt feel so no slave that has run away has ever been stolen from our village it is safe here  while they were talking simeon rachels husband came to the door and called wife i want to speak to thee a minute  rachel went out to him elizas husband is here he said  art thee sure asked rachel her face bright with joy  yes quite certain he will be here soon will thee tell her  rachel went back into the kitchen where eliza was sewing and opening the door of a small bedroom said gently come in here with me my daughter i have news to tell thee  eliza rose trembling she was so afraid it was bad news  no no never fear thee its good news eliza said simeon  rachel shut the door and drew eliza towards her the lord has been very good to thee she said gently thy husband hath escaped and will be here tonight  tonight repeated eliza tonight  then it seemed as if the room and everything in it swam round her and she fell into rachels arms  very gently rachel laid her down on the bed eliza slept as she had not slept since the dreadful night when she had taken her boy and run away through the cold dark night  she dreamed of a beautiful countrya land it seemed to her of restgreen shores pleasant islands and lovely glittering water there in a house which kind voices told her was her home she saw harry playing happily she heard her husbands footstep she felt him coming nearer his arms were around her his tears falling upon her face and she awoke  it was no dream the sun had set the candles were lit harry was sleeping by her side and george her husband was holding her in his arms     chapter ix   uncle toms new home   uncle tom soon settled down in his new home he was as happy as he could be so far away from his wife and dear little children he had a kind master  mrs st clare however was not nearly so nice as her husband she was cruel and would often have beaten her poor slaves but mr st clare would not allow it  she always pretended that she was very ill and spent most of her time lying on a sofa or driving about in her comfortable carriage  mrs st clare said she really was too ill to look after the house so everything was left to the slaves soon things began to be very uncomfortable and even goodnatured mr st clare could stand it no longer  he went to his cousin miss ophelia st clare and begged her to come and keep house for him and to look after eva it was on the journey back with her that the accident to eva happened which ended in his buying tom  miss ophelia was a very prim and precise person not at all like the st clares in her home people did not have slaves though her cousin had a great many and was kind to them she could not help seeing that it was a very wicked thing to buy and sell men and women as if they were cattle she was very very sorry for the poor slaves and would have liked to free them all yet she did not love them she could not bear even to have them near her nor to touch them just because they were black  illustration  it made her quite ill to see eva kissing and hugging the black slave women when she came home  well i couldnt do that she said  why not said mr st clare who was looking on  well i want to be kind to every one i wouldnt have anybody hurt but as to kissing niggers she gave a little shudder how can she  presently a gay laugh sounded from the court mr st clare stepped out to see what was happening  what is it said miss ophelia following him  there sat tom on a little mossy seat in the court every one of his buttonholes was stuck full of flowers eva laughing gaily was hanging a wreath of roses round his neck then still laughing she perched on his knee like a little sparrow  oh tom you look so funny  tom had a sober smile on his face he seemed in his own quiet way to be enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress when he lifted his eyes and saw his master he looked as if he were afraid he might be scolded but mr st clare only smiled  how can you let her do that said miss ophelia  why not said mr st clare  why i dont know it seems dreadful to me  you would think it was quite right and natural if you saw eva playing with a large dog even if he was black but a fellowcreature that can think and reason and feel and is immortal you shudder at i know how you northcountry people feel about it you loathe the blacks as you would a toad or a snake yet you pity them and are angry because they are often illtreated  well cousin said miss ophelia thoughtfully i daresay you are right i suppose i must try to get over my feeling     chapter x   uncle toms letter   uncle tom felt that he was indeed very fortunate to have found such a kind master and so good a home he had nice clothes plenty of food and a comfortable room to sleep in he had no hard disagreeable work to do his chief duties were to drive mrs st clares carriage when she wanted to go out and to attend on eva when she wanted him he soon grew to love his little mistress very very much indeed  mr st clare too began to find tom very useful he was dreadfully careless about money and his chief servant was just as careless as his master so between them a great deal was not only spent but wasted  mr shelby had trusted tom in everything and tom had always been careful of his masters moneyas careful as if it had been his own waste seemed dreadful to him and he tried to do something to stop it now  mr st clare was not long in finding out how clever tom was and soon trusted him as thoroughly as mr shelby had done  but in spite of all his good fortune tom used to long very much to go home to see his dear ones again he had plenty of spare time and whenever he had nothing to do he would pull his bible out of his pocket and try to find comfort in reading it  illustration  but as time went on uncle tom longed more and more for his home at last one day he had a grand idea he would write a letter  before uncle tom was sold george shelby had been teaching him to write so he thought he could manage a letter  he begged a sheet of writingpaper from eva and going to his room began to make a rough copy on his slate  it was very difficult poor uncle tom found that he had quite forgotten how to make some of the letters of those he did remember he was not quite sure which he ought to use yes it was a very difficult thing indeed  while he was working away breathing very hard over it eva came behind him and peeped over his shoulder  oh uncle tom what funny things you are making there  eva put her little golden head close to uncle toms black one and the two began a grave and anxious talk over the letter they were both very earnest and both very ignorant but after a great deal of consulting over every word the writing began they really thought to look quite like a proper letter  yes uncle tom it begins to look beautiful said eva gazing on it with delight how pleased your wife will be and the poor little children oh it is a shame that you ever had to go away from them i mean to ask papa to let you go back some day  missis said that she would send down money for me as soon as they could get it together said tom young masr george he said hed come for me he gave me this dollar as a sign and tom drew the precious dollar from under his coat  oh he is sure to come then said eva i am so glad  i wanted to send a letter you see to let em know where i was and tell poor chloe that i was well off cause she felt so dreadful poor soul  i say tom said mr st clare coming in at the door at this minute  tom and eva both started  whats this mr st clare went on coming up and looking at the slate  oh its toms letter im helping him to write it said eva isnt it nice  i wouldnt discourage either of you said her father but i rather think tom you had better let me write your letter for you ill do it when i come home from my ride  it is very important that he should write said eva because his mistress is going to send money to buy him back again you know papa he told me they had said so  mr st clare thought in his heart that very likely this meant nothing he thought it was only one of these things which goodnatured people said to their slaves to comfort them when they were taken away from their dear ones to be sold he did not really believe mrs shelby meant to buy tom back again however he did not say so out loud but just told tom to get the horses ready for a ride  that evening the letter was written and uncle tom carried it joyfully to the postoffice  illustration     chapter xii   george fights for freedom   the day after george and eliza met each other once more at the end of so many sad months of parting was a very happy one in the quaker house  the two had much to say to each other george had to tell how he had escaped from his cruel master and how he had followed eliza all the way and at last found her then there were plans to make for going on towards canada it was arranged that they should start that night at ten oclock the pursuers are hard after thee we must not delay said simeon  rachel was happy and busy packing up food and clothes for them to take on the journey  late in the afternoon another quaker called phineas came with the dreadful news that the wicked men whom haley had sent to catch eliza were only a few miles away  so george and eliza decided to start as soon as it was dark a little while after supper a large covered waggon drew up before the door they got in and the waggon drove off  on and on all through the dark night they drove about three oclock george heard the click of a horses hoof coming behind them  thats simeon said phineas who was driving as he pulled up the horses to listen  halloa there simeon he shouted what news are they coming  yes right on behind eight or ten of them  oh what shall we do groaned eliza  but phineas knew the road well he lashed the horses till they flew along the waggon rattling and jumping over the hard road behind them  illustration  on they went till they came to a place where the rocks rose straight up from the road like a wall it seemed impossible for any one to climb up there but phineas knew a way  he stopped the horses here simeon he said take the waggon and drive on as fast as thou canst and bring back help now follow me he said to the others quick for your lives run now if you you ever did run  quicker than we can say it they were following him up a tiny narrow path to the top of the rocks and simeon was galloping the horses with the empty waggon along the road  we are pretty safe here said phineas when they had reached the top only one person can come up that path at a time if any one tries it shoot him  the men who were chasing them had now arrived at the foot of of the rocks they were led by a big man called tom loker and another meanlooking little man whom haley had sent  after some hunting about they found the path and headed by tom loker began to climb up  come up if you like george called out but if you do we will shoot you  for answer the little man took aim at george and fired  eliza screamed but the shot did not hurt him it passed close to his hair nearly touched her cheek and struck a tree behind  tom loker came on george waited until he was near enough then he fired the shot hit him in the side but though wounded he would not go back with a yell like that of a mad bull he came leaping on and sprang right in among them  quakers are not allowed to use guns and pistols so phineas had been standing back while george shot now he sprang forward as tom loker landed in the middle of them he gave him a great push saying friend thee isnt wanted here  down fell tom loker down down the steep side of the rock he crashed and crackled among trees bushes logs loose stones till he lay bruised and groaning far below the fall might have killed him had it not been broken by his clothes catching on the branches of a large tree  cruel people are very often cowardly too when the men saw their leader first wounded and then thrown down they all ran away  mounting their horses they rode off as fast as they could leaving tom loker lying on the ground wounded and groaning with pain  as soon as phineas and the others saw that the wicked men had really ridden away they climbed down meaning to walk along the road till they met simeon  they had just reached the bottom when they saw him coming back with the waggon and two other men  now we are safe cried phineas joyfully  well do stop then said eliza and do something for that poor man he is groaning dreadfully  it would be no more than christian said george let us take him with us  they lifted the wounded man gently as if he had been a friend instead of a cruel enemy and laid him in the waggon then they all set out once more  illustration  a drive of about an hour brought them to a neat farmhouse there the tired travellers were kindly received and given a good breakfast  tom loker was put into a comfortable bed far cleaner and softer than any he had ever slept in before george and eliza walked about the garden handinhand feeling happy together and almost safe they were so near canada now     chapter xiii   aunt dinah   miss ophelia found that it was no easy matter to bring anything like order into the st clare household the slaves had been left to themselves so long and had grown so untidy that they were not at all pleased with miss feely as they called her for trying to make them be tidy however she had quite made up her mind that order there must be she got up at four oclock in the morning much to the surprise of the housemaids all day long she was busy dusting and tidying till mrs st clare said it made her tired to see cousin ophelia so busy     chapter xiv   topsy   one morning while miss ophelia was busy as usual she heard mr st clare calling her from the foot of the stairs  come down here cousin i have something to show you  what is it said miss ophelia coming down with her sewing in her hand  i have bought something for you see here he said pulling forward a little negro girl of about eight or nine years old  she was quite black her round shining eyes glittered like glass beads her wooly hair was plaited into little tails which stuck out in all directions her clothes were dirty and ragged miss ophelia thought she had never seen such a dreadful little girl in all her life  cousin what in the world have you brought that thing here for she asked in dismay  for you to teach to be sure and train in the way she should go said mr st clare laughing topsy he went on this is your new mistress see now that you behave yourself  yes masr said topsy gravely but her eyes had a wicked twinkle in them  youre going to be good topsy you understand said mr st clare  oh yes masr said topsy again meekly folding her hands but with another twinkle in her eyes  now cousin what is this for your house is full of these little plagues as it is i get up in the morning and find one asleep behind the door see one black head poking out from under the table another lying on the mat they tumble over the kitchen floor so that a body cant put their foot down without treading on them what on earth did you want to bring this one for  for you to teach didnt i tell you  i dont want her im sure i have more to do with them now than i want  well the fact is cousin said mr st clare drawing her aside she belonged to some people who were dreadfully cruel and beat her i couldnt bear to hear her screaming every day so i bought her i will give her to you do try and make something of her  well ill do what i can said miss ophelia she is fearfully dirty and half naked  well take her downstairs and tell somebody to clean her up and give her some decent clothes  getting topsy clean was a very long business but at last it was done  then sitting down before her miss ophelia began to question her  how old are you topsy  dunno missis said she grinning like an ugly little black doll  dont know how old you are did nobody ever tell you who was your mother  never had none said topsy with another grin  never had any mother what do you mean where were you born  never was born  you mustnt answer me like that child said miss ophelia sternly i am not playing with you tell me where you were born and who your father and mother were  never was born said topsy again very decidedly never had no father nor mother nor nothin  miss ophelia hardly knew what to make of her how long have you lived with your master and mistress then she asked  dunno missis  is it a year or more or less  dunno missis  have you ever heard anything about god topsy asked miss ophelia next  topsy looked puzzled but kept on grinning  do you know who made you  nobody as i knows on replied topsy with a laugh spect i growd dont think nobody ever made me  illustration  do you know how to sew asked miss ophelia quite shocked  no missis  what can you do what did you do for your master and mistress  fetch water and wash dishes and clean knives and wait on folks  well now topsy im going to show you just how my bed is to be made i am very particular about my bed you must learn exactly how to do it  yes missis said topsy with a deep sigh and a face of woeful earnestness  now topsy look here this is the hem of the sheet this is the right side of the sheet this is the wrong will you remember  yes missis said topsy with another sigh  well now the undersheet you must bring over the bolsterso and tuck it right down under the mattress nice and smoothso do you see  yes missis  but the upper sheet said miss ophelia must be brought down in this way and tucked under firm and smooth at the footso the narrow hem at the foot  yes missis said topsy as before but while miss ophelia was bending over the bed she had quickly seized a pair of gloves and a ribbon which were lying on the dressingtable and slipped them up her sleeves when miss ophelia looked up again the naughty little girl was standing with meeklyfolded hand as before  now topsy let me see you do this said miss ophelia pulling the clothes off again and seating herself  topsy looking very earnest did it all just as she had been shown she did it so quickly and well that miss ophelia was very pleased but alas as she was finishing an end of ribbon came dangling out of her sleeve  what is this said miss ophelia seizing it you naughty wicked childyou have been stealing this  the ribbon was pulled out of topsys own sleeve yet she did not seem a bit ashamed she only looked at it with an air of surprise and innocence  why thats miss feelys ribbon ant it how could it a got into my sleeve  topsy you naughty girl dont tell me a lie you stole that ribbon  missis i declare i didnt never seed it till dis blessed minnit  topsy said miss ophelia dont you know it is wicked to tell lies  i never tells no lies miss feely said topsy its jist the truth ive been tellin now it ant nothin else  illustration  topsy i shall have to whip you if you tell lies so  laws missis if you whips all day couldnt say no other way said topsy beginning to cry i never seed dat ribbon it must a caught in my sleeve miss feely musta left it on the bed and it got caught in the clothes and so got in my sleeve  miss ophelia was so angry at such a barefaced lie that she caught topsy and shook her dont tell me that again she said  the shake brought the gloves on the floor from the other sleeve  there said miss ophelia will you tell me now you didnt steal the ribbon  topsy now confessed to stealing the gloves but she still said she had not taken the ribbon  now topsy said miss ophelia kindly if you will confess all about it i wont whip you this time  so topsy confessed to having stolen both the ribbon and the gloves she said she was very very sorry and would never do it again  well now tell me said miss ophelia have you taken anything else since you have been in the house if you confess i wont whip you  laws missis i took miss evas red thing she wears on her neck  you did you naughty child well what else  i took rosas earringsthem red ones  go and bring them to me this minuteboth of them  laws missis i canttheys burnt up  burnt up what a story go and get them or i shall whip you  topsy began to cry and groan and declare that she could not theys burnt up they is  what did you burn them up for asked miss ophelia  cause is wicked i is is mighty wicked anyhow i cant help it  just at this minute eva came into the room wearing her coral necklace  why eva where did you get your necklace said miss ophelia  get it why i have had it on all day answered eva rather surprised and what is funny aunty i had it on all night too i forgot to take it off when i went to bed  miss ophelia looked perfectly astonished she was more astonished still when next minute rosa who was one of the housemaids came in with a basket of clean clothes wearing her coral earrings as usual  im sure i dont know what to do with such a child she said in despair what in the world made you tell me you took those things topsy  why missis said i must fess i couldnt think of nothing else to fess said topsy wiping her eyes  but of course i didnt want you to confess things you didnt do said miss ophelia that is telling a lie just as much as the other  laws now is it said topsy looking surprised and innocent  poor topsy said eva why need you steal you are going to be taken good care of now i am sure i would rather give you anything of mine than have you steal it  topsy had never been spoken to so kindly and gently in all her life for a minute she looked as if she were going to cry the next she was grinning as usual in her ugly way  what was to be done with topsy miss ophelia was quite puzzled she shut her up in a dark room till she could think about it  i dont see she said to mr st clare how i am going to manage that child without whipping her  well whip her then  i never heard of bringing up children without it said miss ophelia  oh well do as you think best only i have seen this child beaten with a poker knocked down with the shovel or tongs or anything that came handy so i dont think your beatings will have much effect  what is to be done with her then said miss ophelia i never saw such a child as this  but mr st clare could not answer her question so miss ophelia had to go on as best she could trying to make topsy a good girl  she taught her to read and to sew topsy liked reading and learned her letters like magic but she could not bear sewing so she broke her needles or threw them away she tangled broke and dirtied her cotton and hid her reels miss ophelia felt sure all these things could not be accidents yet she could never catch topsy doing them  in a very few days topsy had learned how to do miss ophelias room perfectly for she was very quick and clever but if miss ophelia ever left her to do it by herself there was sure to be dreadful confusion  instead of making the bed she would amuse herself with pulling off the pillowcases then she would butt her woolly head among the pillows until it was covered with feathers sticking out in all directions she would climb the bedpost and hang head downwards from the top wave the sheets and covers all over the room dress the bolster up in miss ophelias nightgown and act scenes with it singing whistling and making faces at herself in the lookingglass all the time  topsy miss ophelia would say when her patience was at an end what makes you behave so badly  dunno missisispects cause is so wicked  i dont know what i shall do with you topsy  laws missis you must whip me my old missis always did i ant used to workin unless i gets whipped  so miss ophelia tried it topsy would scream and groan and implore but half an hour later she would be sitting among the other little niggers belonging to the house laughing about it miss feely whip she would say she cant do it nohow  law you niggers she would go on does you know yous all sinners well you is everybody is white folks is sinners toomiss feely says so but i spects niggers is the biggest ones but ye ant any of ye up to me is so awful wicked there cant nobody do nothin with me i spects is the wickedest crittur in the world then she would turn a somersault and come up bright and smiling evidently quite pleased with herself     chapter xv   eva and topsy   two or three years passed uncle tom was still with mr st clare far away from his home he was not really unhappy but always in his heart was the aching longing to see his dear ones again  now he began to have a new sorrow he loved his little mistress eva very tenderly and she was ill  he saw that she was growing white and thin she no longer ran and played in the garden for hours together as she used to do she was always tired now  miss ophelia noticed it too and tried to make mr st clare see it but he would not he loved his little eva so much that he did not want to believe that anything could be the matter with her  mrs st clare never thought that any one except herself could be ill so eva grew daily thinner and weaker and uncle tom and aunt ophelia more and more sad and anxious  but at last she became so unwell that even mr st clare had to own that something was wrong and the doctor was sent for  in a week or two she was very much better once more she ran about playing and laughing and her father was delighted only miss ophelia and the doctor sighed and shook their heads and little eva herself knew but she was not troubled she knew she was going to god  papa she said one day there are some things i want to say to you i want to say them now while i am able  she seated herself on his knee and laid her head on his shoulder  it is all no use papa to keep it to myself any longer the time is coming when i am going to leave you i am going never to come back and eva sobbed  eva darling dont say such things you are better you know  no papa i am not any better i know it quite well and i am going soon  and i want to go she went on only i dont want to leave youit almost breaks my heart  dont eva dont talk so what makes you so sad  i feel sad for our poor people i wish papa they were all free isnt there any way to have all slaves made free  that is a difficult question dearest there is no doubt that this way is a very bad one a great many people think so i do myself i wish there was not a slave in the land but then i dont know what is to be done about it  papa you are such a good man and so noble and kind couldnt you go all around and try and persuade people to do right about this when i am dead papa then you will think of me and do it for my sake  when you are dead eva oh child dont talk to me so  promise me at least father that tom shall have his freedom as soon as i am gone  yes dear i will do anything you wish only dont talk so  miss ophelia and eva had been to church together miss ophelia had gone to her room to take off her bonnet while eva talked to her father  suddenly mr st clare and his little girl heard a great noise coming from miss ophelias room a minute later she appeared dragging topsy behind her  come out here she was saying i will tell your master  what is the matter now asked mr st clare  the matter is that i cannot be plagued with this child any longer said miss ophelia it is past all bearing here i locked her up and gave her a hymn to learn what does she do but spy out where i put my key she has gone to my wardrobe taken a bonnettrimming and cut it all to pieces to make dolls jackets i never saw anything like it in my life  illustration  i dont know what to do she went on i have taught and taught i have talked till im tired ive whipped her ive punished her in every way i can think of and still she is as naughty as she was at first  come here topsy you monkey said mr st clare  topsy came her hard round eyes glittering and blinking half in fear half in mischief  what makes you behave so said mr st clare who could not help being amused at her funny expression  spects its my wicked heart miss feely says so  dont you see how much miss ophelia has done for you she says she has done everything she can think of  lor yes masr old missis used to say so too she whipped me a heap harder and used to pull my hair and knock my head agin the door but it didnt do me no good i spect if they is to pull every hair out o my head it wouldnt do no good neither is so wicked laws is nothin but a nigger noways  i shall have to give her up said miss ophelia i cant have that trouble any longer  eva had stood silent listening now she took topsy by the hand and led her into a little room close by  what makes you so naughty topsy she said with tears in her eyes why dont you try to be good dont you love anybody topsy  dunno nothin bout love i love candy thats all  but you love your father and mother  never had none ye know i telled ye that miss eva  oh i forgot said eva sadly but hadnt you any brother or sister or aunt or  no none on em never had nothin nor nobody  but topsy if you would only try to be good you might  couldnt never be nothin but a nigger if i was ever so good said topsy if i could be skinned and come white id try then  but people can love you if you are black topsy miss ophelia would love you if you were good  topsy laughed scornfully  dont you think so said eva  no she cant bear me cause im a nigger shed as soon have a toad touch her there cant nobody love niggers and niggers cant do nothin i dont care and topsy began whistling to show that she didnt  oh topsy i love you said eva laying her little thin hand on topsys shoulder i love you because you havent had any mother or father or friends because you have been a poor illused child i love you and i want you to be good it makes me sorry to have you so naughty i wish you would try to be good for my sake because im going to die soon i shant be here very long  topsys round bright eyes grew suddenly dim with tears she did believe at last that it was possible for some one to love her she laid her head down between her knees and wept and sobbed  poor topsy said eva gently  illustration  oh miss eva dear miss eva cried the poor little black child i will try i will try i never did care nothin about it before     chapter xvi   evas last goodbye   it soon became quite plain to everybody that eva was very ill indeed she never ran about and played now but spent most of the day lying on the sofa in her own pretty room  every one loved her and tried to do things for her even naughty little topsy used to bring her flowers and try to be good for her sake  uncle tom was a great deal in evas room she used to get very restless and then she liked to be carried about he was so big and strong that he could do it very easily he would walk about with her under the orangetrees in the garden or sitting down on some of their old seats would sing their favorite hymns  he loved to do it and could not bear to be long away from his little mistress he gave up sleeping in his bed and lay all night on the mat outside her door  one day eva made her aunt cut off a lot of her beautiful hair then she called all the slaves together said goodbye to them and gave them each a curl of her hair as a keepsake they all cried very much and said they would never forget her and would try to be good for her sake  a few nights later miss ophelia came quickly to tom as he lay on the mat outside evas door go tom she said go as fast as you can for the doctor  tom ran but in the morning little eva lay on her bed cold and white with closed eyes and folded hands  she had gone to god  mr st clare was very very unhappy for a long time after eva died he had loved her so much that now his life seemed quite empty without her  he did not forget his promise to her about tom he went to his lawyer and told him to begin writing out the papers that would make tom free it took some time to make a slave free  well tom said mr st clare the day after he had spoken to his lawyer im going to make a free man of you so have your trunk packed and get ready to set out for home  joy shone in uncle toms face bless the lord he said raising his hands to heaven  mr st clare felt rather hurt he did not like tom to be so glad to leave him  you havent had such a very bad time here that you need be in such rapture tom he said  no no masr tant that its bein a free man thats what im joyin for  why tom dont you think that you are really better off as you are  no indeed masr st clare said tom very decidedly no indeed  but tom you couldnt possibly have earned by your work such clothes and such nice comfortable rooms and good food as i have given you  i knows all that masr st clare masr has been too good but masr id rather have poor clothes poor house poor everything and have em mine than have the best and have em any mans else i had so masr i thinks its nature masr  i suppose so tom you will be going off and leaving me in a month or two he said rather discontentedly though why you shouldnt i dont know he added in a gayer voice  illustration  not while masr is in trouble said tom ill stay with masr as long as he wants meso as i can be of any use  not while i am in trouble tom said mr st clare looking sadly out of the window and when will my trouble be over then halfsmiling he turned from the window and laid his hand on toms shoulder ah tom you soft silly boy he said i wont keep you go home to your wife and children and give them all my love  cousin said miss ophelia coming into the room i want to speak to you about topsy  what has she been doing now  illustration  nothing she is a much better girl than she used to be but i want to ask you whose is sheyours or mine  why yours of course i gave her to you said mr st clare  but not by law there is no use my trying to make this child a christian unless i can be quite sure that she will not be sold as a slave again if you are really willing i should have her i want you to give me a paper saying she is mine  but you think it is wicked to keep slaves now you want to have one of your own oh shocking cousin said mr st clare who loved to tease  nonsense i only want to have her so that i can set her free  very well said mr st clare i will write the paper for you then he sat down and began to read  but i want it done now said miss ophelia  why are you in such a hurry  because now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in said miss ophelia want to make sure of it you may die or lose all your money then topsy would be taken away and sold in spite of anything i could say  mr st clare hated being made to do things when he didnt want to however after teasing his cousin a little more he wrote out the paper and topsy belonged to miss ophelia that evening mr st clare went out for a ride  tom saw him go and asked if he should come too no my boy said mr st clare i shall be back in an hour  tom sat down on the verandah to wait till his master came home while he waited he fell asleep  presently he was awakened by loud knocking and the sound of voices at the gate  he ran to open it  several men were there carrying a load it was mr st clare he had been hurt in an accident and was dying  very gently they laid him on a sofa nothing could be done in a short time he had gone to join his little eva     chapter xvii   uncle toms new master   there had been great grief in the house when eva died now there was not only sorrow but gloom and fear  the kind master was dead and the poor slaves asked themselves in despair what would happen to them now  they were not long left in doubt one morning mrs st clare told them that they were all to be sold she was going back to her fathers house to live and would not want them any more  poor uncle tom the news was a dreadful blow to him for a few days he had been so happy in the thought of going home once more after all these years he thought he would see his dear wife and little children now at one stroke he had lost both his kind master and his hope of freedom  instead of going home he was to be sent farther away than ever from his dear ones he could not bear it he tried to say thy will be done but bitter tears almost choked the words  he had one hope left he would ask miss ophelia to speak to mrs st clare for him  masr st clare promised me my freedom miss feely he said he told me that he had begun to take it out for me and now perhaps if you would be good enough to speak about it to missis she would feel like going on with it seeing it was masr st clares wish she might  ill speak for you tom and do my best said miss ophelia i havent much hope but i will try  so miss ophelia asked mrs st clare to set tom free  indeed i shall do no such thing she replied tom is worth more than any of the other slaves i couldnt afford to lose so much money besides what does he want with his freedom he is a great deal better off as he is  but he does want it very much replied miss ophelia and his master promised it to him  i dare say he does want it replied mrs st clare they all want it just because they are a discontented set always wanting what they havent got  but tom is so good and gentle and such a splendid worker if you sell him there is the chance of his getting a bad master  oh i have no fear about that most masters are good in spite of all the talk people make about it replied mrs st clare  well said miss ophelia at last i know it was one of the last wishes of your husband that tom should have his freedom he promised dear little eva that he should have it i think you ought to do it  then mrs st clare began to cry and say every one was unkind to her and miss ophelia saw it was no use saying anything more there was only one other thing she could do she wrote to mrs shelby telling her that poor uncle tom was going to be sold again she asked her to send money to buy him back as soon as possible  the next day uncle tom and the other slaves belonging to mr st clare were sent to market to be sold  as uncle tom stood in the marketplace waiting for some one to buy him he looked anxiously round in the crowd of faces he was trying to find one kind handsome one like mr st clares but there was none  presently a short broad man with a coarse ugly face and dirty hands came up to tom he looked him all over pulled his mouth open and looked at his teeth pinched his arms made him walk and jump and indeed treated him as he would a horse or cow he had wished to buy  tom knew from the way this man looked and spoke that he must be bad and cruel he prayed in his heart that this might not be his new master but it was his name was legree he bought uncle tom several other men slaves and two women one of the women was a pretty young girl who had never been away from her mother before and who was very much afraid of her new master the other was an old woman the two women were chained together the men uncle tom among them had heavy chains put on both hands and feet then legree drove them all on to a boat which was going up the river to his plantation  it was a sad journey this time there was no pretty eva nor kindhearted mr st clare to bring any happiness to the poor slaves  one of the first things legree did was to take away all toms nice clothes which mr st clare had given him  he made him put on his oldest clothes then he sold all the others to the sailors  legree made his slaves unhappy in every way he could think of then he would come up to them and say come come i dont allow any sulky looks be cheerful now or and he would crack his whip in a way to make them tremble  at last the weary journey was over legree and his slaves landed his house was a long way from the river the men slaves walked while legree and the two women drove in a cart  mile after mile they trudged along over the rough road through wild and dreary country till hungry thirsty and tired they arrived at the farm or plantation as it was called  legree was not a gentleman like mr shelby or mr st clare he was a very rough kind of farmer on his farm he grew cotton the cotton had to be gathered and tied into bundles then he sold it to people who made it into calico muslin and other things which we need to use and wear gathering cotton is very hard work  the house legree lived in had once been a very fine one and had belonged to a rich gentleman now it was old neglected and almost in ruins  the house was bad enough but the cabins where the slaves lived were far worse they were roughly built of wood the wind and the rain came through the chinks between the planks there were no windows the floors were nothing but the bare earth there was no furniture of any kind in them only heaps of dirty straw to sleep upon  uncle tom felt more unhappy than ever he had hoped at least to have a little room which he could keep clean and tidy but this hole he did not even have to himself he had to share it with five or six others  now began the saddest time of uncle toms life every morning very early the slaves were driven out into the fields like cattle all day long they worked hard the burning sun blazed down upon them making them hot and tired legree and his two chief slaves called quimbo and sambo marched about all the time with whips in their hands at night they drove the slaves back again to their miserable huts  but before they could rest they had to grind and cook the corn for their supper when at last they did go to sleep they had to lie on the heaps of dirty straw instead of in comfortable beds     chapter xviii   george and eliza find freedom   tom loker lay tossing and tumbling in his clean comfortable bed at the quaker farmhouse a pretty old quaker lady with white hair and a kind face was nursing him tom loker did not like being ill and having to lie in bed he threw the clothes about grumbling and using naughty words all the tune  i must ask thee thomas loker not to use such language said the nice lady as she smoothed his sheets and made his bed comfortable again for him  well i wont granny if i can help it he replied but it is enough to make a fellow swear it is so awfully hot he gave another great lunge and made the sheets and blankets all untidy again  i suppose that fellow george and the girl eliza are here he said in a sulky voice after a few minutes silence  yes they are said the old lady  they had better get away across the lake said tom loker the quicker the better  very likely they will do so said the old lady calmly going on with her knitting  but listen said tom loker getting excited there are people who are watching the boats for us i dont care if i tell now i hope they will get away just to spite the others for going and leaving me as they didthe mean puppies the  thomas loker said the old lady  i tell you granny if you bottle a fellow up too tight hell split said tom loker but about elizatell them to dress her up some way so as to alter her we have sent a description of what she looks like to the town where the boats start from she will be caught yet if she doesnt dress up differently  i thank thee thomas loker replied the old lady with her usual calmness we will attend to that thank thee then she went to tell george and eliza what tom loker had said  they were indeed very grateful to him and very glad that they had not left him as his own friends had done to die by the roadside  so next day eliza cut off all her beautiful black hair and dressed herself like a boy  dont i make a pretty young fellow she said to george laughing and blushing at the same time  you always will be pretty said george gravely do what you will  what makes you so sober asked eliza kneeling on one knee and laying her hand on his we are within twentyfour hours of canada they say only a day and a night on the lake and thenoh then  o eliza said george holding her fast that is just it to be so near liberty to be almost in sight of itand then if we lost it o eliza i should die  dont fear said eliza hopefully the good lord would not have brought us so far if he didnt mean to save us i seem to feel him with us george  so george kissed his wife and took heart again then the kind old lady brought harry in dressed as a little girl and a very pretty girl he made too they called him harriet as it was so like harry it was easy to remember  harry did not know his mamma dressed as she was and clung to the kind lady feeling rather afraid of the strange young man that was just as well as he was too young to understand what this dressingup and pretending meant and he might have spoiled it all by calling the nicelooking young man mamma so the kind lady was going with them pretending to be the little girls aunt  when everything was ready they got into a cab and drove to the wharf the two young men as they seemed to be got out eliza helping the kind lady and little girl while george saw to the luggage  as he was standing at the office taking the tickets george overheard two men talking by his side  ive watched every one that came on board said one and i know they are not on this boat  you would scarcely know the woman from a white one said the other the man is very fair too he has an h burned into the palm of his hand  the hand with which george was taking the tickets and change trembled a little but he turned calmly round looked straight at the speaker and then walked slowly away to where eliza was waiting for him  it was a terribly anxious time but at last the bell rang the boat began to move and george and eliza drew long sighs of relief as they saw the shore getting farther and farther away  it was a lovely day the blue waves of lake erie danced rippling and sparkling in the sunlight hour after hour the boat steamed on  night came and in the morning clear and beautiful before them rose the shores of canada  george and his wife stood arm in arm as the boat came near the little town where they were going to land his breath came thick and short a mist gathered before his eyes he silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his arm  the bell rangthe boat stopped  illustration  scarcely seeing what he did george looked out his luggage and gathered his little party  they were landed on the shore and stood still till the boat had started again  then with tears of joy the husband and wife with their wondering little boy in their arms knelt down and lifted up their hearts to god they were free     chapter xix   uncle tom finds freedom   the letter which miss ophelia wrote to mrs shelby telling her that tom was to be sold again was delayed a long time in the post when at last it did arrive mr shelby was very ill and though mrs shelby felt dreadfully sorry about uncle tom she could do nothing as her husband was so ill soon mr shelby died mrs shelby was very sad but in her sorrow she did not forget her promise to aunt chloe and uncle tom as soon as she could she sold some land and george shelby taking the money with him went off to try to find uncle tom and buy him back again  but by the time george shelby came to the place where mr st clare used to live uncle tom had been sold to legree and no one knew where he had gone  at last after searching about for months george shelby found out where uncle tom was and followed him  two days after legree had been so cruel george shelby drove up the avenue and stopped at the door of the old house  i hear he said to legree that you bought a slave named tom he used to belong to my father i have come to buy him back again  legrees face grew black with anger yes i did buy such a fellow he growled in rage and a bad bargain it was too the most rebellious saucy impudent dog set up my niggers to run away he owned to it and when i bid him tell me where they were he said he knew but wouldnt tell he stuck to it too though i gave him the very worst beating i ever gave a nigger yet i believe he is trying to die i shouldnt wonder if he did  where is he said george let me see him his cheeks were crimson and his eye flashed fire at the thought that legree had dared to treat dear uncle tom so badly  he is in that shed said a little fellow who was holding george shelbys horse  george without saying another word hurried to the place to which the little boy pointed  as he entered the shed his head felt giddy and his heart sick  uncle tom lay on a heap of straw on the floor still and quiet  oh dear uncle tom cried george as he knelt beside him dear uncle tom do wakedo speak once more heres masr georgeyour own little masr george dont you know me  masr george said tom opening his eyes and speaking in a feeble voice masr george it isit is its all i wanted they havent forgot me it warms my soul it does my old heart good now i shall die content  you shant die you mustnt die nor think of it ive come to buy you and take you home said george and the tears came into his eyes as he bent over poor uncle tom  oh masr george yere too late the lord has bought me and is going to take me home  illustration  oh dont it breaks my heart to think of what youve sufferedlying in this old shed too  you mustnt now tell chloe poor soul how ye found me said tom taking george by the hand it would seem so dreadful to her only tell her ye found me going into glory and that i couldnt stay for no one and oh the poor chilen and the babymy old hearts been most broke for them tell them to follow me give my love to masr and dear good missis and everybody in the place i love them all  he closed his eyes and with a smile he fell asleep uncle tom too was free  beyond the gates of legrees farm george had noticed a dry sandy knoll shaded by a few trees there he made uncle toms grave no stone marks his last restingplace he needs none god knows where he lies  kneeling there george bent his head in shame and sorrow here me dear god he said from this day i will do what one man can to drive out the curse of slavery from this land     chapter xx   george shelby frees his slaves   george shelby wrote a little note to his mother telling her that he was coming home he tried to write about uncle tom but he could not tears blinded him and sobs choked him  on the day he was expected every one was in a state of bustle and excitement aunt chloe in a new print dress and clean white apron walked round the suppertable making sure that everything was right her black face shone with joy at the thought of seeing uncle tom again  im thinking my old man wont know the boys and the baby she said  mrs shelby sighed ever since the letter had come from george she had had a very sad heart she felt sure something must be wrong  he wont know the baby my old man wont said chloe again why its five years since they took him  just then the sound of wheels was heard  its masr george cried aunt chloe running to the window in great excitement  mrs shelby ran to the door as george met her he put his arms round her and kissed her tenderly  aunt chloe stood behind anxiously looking out into the darkness  oh poor aunt chloe said george gently taking her hard black hand between both his own id have given all my fortune to have brought uncle tom home with me but he has gone to a better country mrs shelby cried out as if she had been hurt but aunt chloe did not make a sound  in silence they went into the supperroom  illustration  there said aunt chloe holding out her trembling hands to her mistress its just as i knew it would be hes been sold and murdered on dem old plantations  then she turned and walked proudly out of the room mrs shelby followed her softly took one of her hands drew her down into a chair and sat down beside her  my poor good chloe she said gently  chloe leaned her head on her mistresss shoulder and sobbed out oh missis scuse me my hearts brokedats all  i know it is said mrs shelby as her tears fell fast and i cannot heal it  there was silence for a little as they wept together then george sat down beside aunt chloe and took her hand he talked gently to her telling her of uncle toms last loving messages so she was comforted a little  one morning about a month after this george shelby called all his servants together telling them he had something to say to them  they wondered what it could be and were very much surprised when he appeared carrying a bundle of papers in his hand  they were still more astonished when he gave a paper to each one and told them all that they were free  with sobs and tears and shouts they pressed round him thanking and blessing him but some of them came with anxious faces begging him to take their free papers back again and not to send them away  we dont want to be any freer than we are they said we have always had all we wanted  we dont want to leave the old place and young masr and missis and the rest  illustration  my good friends said george when he could get silence there will be no need for you to leave me we want quite as many servants as we did before but now you are free men and free women i shall pay you wages for your work and if i die or get into debt you cant be taken away to be sold that is all the difference i want you all to stay with me for i want to teach you how to live as free men and women ought  one thing more added george when the cheering and rejoicing had died away a little you all remember our good old uncle tom you have heard how he died and how he sent his love to you all it was on his grave my friends that i made up my mind with gods help never to own another slave if it were possible to free him i resolved that nobody through my fault should ever run the risk of being parted from his dear ones and of dying far from them as he died  so when you rejoice in your freedom remember that you owe it to dear old uncle tom and pay it back in kindness to his wife and children think of your freedom every time you see uncle toms cabin and let it help you to try to live as he did and be as honest and faithful and christian as he was   the end
