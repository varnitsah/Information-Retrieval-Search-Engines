35531107	the bostonians                                  a novel                               by henry james                               in two volumes                                  vol ii    macmillan and co limited st martins street london 1921  first published in 1886     book second continued     xxiv   a little more than an hour after this he stood in the parlour of doctor tarrants suburban residence in monadnoc place he had induced a juvenile maidservant by an appeal somewhat impassioned to let the ladies know that he was there and she had returned after a long absence to say that miss tarrant would come down to him in a little while he possessed himself according to his wont of the nearest book it lay on the table with an old magazine and a little japanned tray containing tarrants professional cardshis denomination as a mesmeric healer and spent ten minutes in turning it over it was a biography of mrs ada t p foat the celebrated trancelecturer and was embellished by a portrait representing the lady with a surprised expression and innumerable ringlets ransom said to himself after reading a few pages that much ridicule had been cast upon southern literature but if that was a fair specimen of northernand he threw it back upon the table with a gesture almost as contemptuous as if he had not known perfectly after so long a residence in the north that it was not while he wondered whether this was the sort of thing miss tarrant had been brought up on there was no other book to be seen and he remembered to have read the magazine so there was finally nothing for him as the occupants of the house failed still to appear but to stare before him into the bright bare common little room which was so hot that he wished to open a window and of which an ugly undraped crosslight seemed to have taken upon itself to reveal the poverty ransom as i have mentioned had not a high standard of comfort and noticed little usually how peoples houses were furnishedit was only when they were very pretty that he observed but what he saw while he waited at doctor tarrants made him say to himself that it was no wonder verena liked better to live with olive chancellor he even began to wonder whether it were for the sake of that superior softness she had cultivated miss chancellors favour and whether mrs luna had been right about her being mercenary and insincere so many minutes elapsed before she appeared that he had time to remember he really knew nothing to the contrary as well as to consider the oddity so great when one did consider it of his coming out to cambridge to see her when he had only a few hours in boston to spare a year and a half after she had given him her very casual invitation she had not refused to receive him at any rate she was free to if it didnt please her and not only this but she was apparently making herself fine in his honour inasmuch as he heard a rapid footstep move to and fro above his head and even through the slightness which in monadnoc place did service for an upper floor the sound of drawers and presses opened and closed some one was flying round as they said in mississippi at last the stairs creaked under a light tread and the next moment a brilliant person came into the room  his reminiscence of her had been very pretty but now that she had developed and matured the little prophetess was prettier still her splendid hair seemed to shine her cheek and chin had a curve which struck him by its fineness her eyes and lips were full of smiles and greetings she had appeared to him before as a creature of brightness but now she lighted up the place she irradiated she made everything that surrounded her of no consequence dropping upon the shabby sofa with an effect as charming as if she had been a nymph sinking on a leopardskin and with the native sweetness of her voice forcing him to listen till she spoke again it was not long before he perceived that this added lustre was simply success she was young and tender still but the sound of a great applauding audience had been in her ears it formed an element in which she felt buoyant and floated still however her glance was as pure as it was direct and that fantastic fairness hung about her which had made an impression on him of old and which reminded him of unworldly placeshe didnt know whereconventcloisters or vales of arcady at that other time she had been particoloured and bedizened and she had always an air of costume only now her costume was richer and more chastened it was her line her condition part of her expression if at miss birdseyes and afterwards in charles street she might have been a ropedancer today she made a scene of the mean little room in monadnoc place such a scene as a prima donna makes of daubed canvas and dusty boards she addressed basil ransom as if she had seen him the other week and his merits were fresh to her though she let him while she sat smiling at him explain in his own rather ceremonious way why it was he had presumed to call upon her on so slight an acquaintanceon an invitation which she herself had had more than time to forget his explanation as a finished and satisfactory thing quite broke down there was no more impressive reason than that he had simply wished to see her he became aware that this motive loomed large and that her listening smile innocent as it was in the arcadian manner of mockery seemed to accuse him of not having the courage of his inclination he had alluded especially to their meeting at miss chancellors there it was that she had told him she should be glad to see him in her home  oh yes i remember perfectly and i remember quite as well seeing you at miss birdseyes the night before i made a speechdont you remember that was delightful  it was delightful indeed said basil ransom  i dont mean my speech i mean the whole thing it was then i made miss chancellors acquaintance i dont know whether you know how we work together she has done so much for me  do you still make speeches ransom asked conscious as soon as he had uttered it that the question was below the mark  still why i should hope so its all im good for its my lifeor its going to be and its miss chancellors too we are determined to do something  and does she make speeches too  well she makes mineor the best part of them she tells me what to saythe real things the strong things its miss chancellor as much as me said the singular girl with a generous complacency which was yet half ludicrous  i should like to hear you again basil ransom rejoined  well you must come some night you will have plenty of chances we are going on from triumph to triumph  her brightness her selfpossession her air of being a public character her mixture of the girlish and the comprehensive startled and confounded her visitor who felt that if he had come to gratify his curiosity he should be in danger of going away still more curious than satiated she added in her gay friendly trustful tonethe tone of facile intercourse the tone in which happy flowercrowned maidens may have talked to sunburnt young men in the golden agei am very familiar with your name miss chancellor has told me all about you  all about me ransom raised his black eyebrows how could she do that she doesnt know anything about me  well she told me you are a great enemy to our movement isnt that true i think you expressed some unfavourable idea that day i met you at her house  if you regard me as an enemy its very kind of you to receive me  oh a great many gentlemen call verena said calmly and brightly some call simply to inquire some call because they have heard of me or been present on some occasion when i have moved them every one is so interested  and you have been in europe ransom remarked in a moment  oh yes we went over to see if they were in advance we had a magnificent timewe saw all the leaders  the leaders ransom repeated  of the emancipation of our sex there are gentlemen there as well as ladies olive had splendid introductions in all countries and we conversed with all the earnest people we heard much that was suggestive and as for europeand the young lady paused smiling at him and ending in a happy sigh as if there were more to say on the subject than she could attempt on such short notice  i suppose its very attractive said ransom encouragingly  its just a dream  and did you find that they were in advance  well miss chancellor thought they were she was surprised at some things we observed and concluded that perhaps she hadnt done the europeans justiceshe has got such an open mind its as wide as the seawhile i incline to the opinion that on the whole we make the better show the state of the movement there reflects their general culture and their general culture is higher than ours i mean taking the term in its broadest sense on the other hand the special conditionmoral social personalof our sex seems to me to be superior in this country i mean regarded in relationin proportion as it wereto the social phase at large i must add that we did see some noble specimens over there in england we met some lovely women highly cultivated and of immense organising power in france we saw some wonderful contagious types we passed a delightful evening with the celebrated marie verneuil she was released from prison you know only a few weeks before our total impression was that it is only a question of timethe future is ours but everywhere we heard one cryhow long o lord how long  basil ransom listened to this considerable statement with a feeling which as the current of miss tarrants facile utterance flowed on took the form of an hilarity charmed into stillness by the fear of losing something there was indeed a sweet comicality in seeing this pretty girl sit there and in answer to a casual civil inquiry drop into oratory as a natural thing had she forgotten where she was and did she take him for a full house she had the same turns and cadences almost the same gestures as if she had been on the platform and the great queerness of it was that with such a manner she should escape being odious she was not odious she was delightful she was not dogmatic she was genial no wonder she was a success if she speechified as a bird sings ransom could see too from her easy lapse how the lecturetone was the thing in the world with which by education by association she was most familiar he didnt know what to make of her she was an astounding young phenomenon the other time came back to him afresh and how she had stood up at miss birdseyes it occurred to him that an element here had been wanting several moments after she had ceased speaking he became conscious that the expression of his face presented a perceptible analogy to a broad grin he changed his posture saying the first thing that came into his head i presume you do without your father now  without my father  to set you going as he did that time i heard you  oh i see you thought i had begun a lecture and she laughed in perfect good humour they tell me i speak as i talk so i suppose i talk as i speak but you mustnt put me on what i saw and heard in europe thats to be the title of an address i am now preparing by the way yes i dont depend on father any more she went on while ransoms sense of having said too sarcastic a thing was deepened by her perfect indifference to it he finds his patients draw off about enough any way but i owe him everything if it hadnt been for him no one would ever have known i had a giftnot even myself he started me so once for all that i now go alone  you go beautifully said ransom wanting to say something agreeable and even respectfully tender to her but troubled by the fact that there was nothing he could say that didnt sound rather like chaff there was no resentment in her however for in a moment she said to him as quickly as it occurred to her in the manner of a person repairing an accidental omission it was very good of you to come so far  this was a sort of speech it was never safe to make to ransom there was no telling what retribution it might entail do you suppose any journey is too great too wearisome when its a question of so great a pleasure on this occasion it was not worse than that  well people have come from other cities verena answered not with pretended humility but with pretended pride do you know cambridge  this is the first time i have ever been here  well i suppose you have heard of the university its so celebrated  yeseven in mississippi i suppose its very fine  i presume it is said verena but you cant expect me to speak with much admiration of an institution of which the doors are closed to our sex  do you then advocate a system of education in common  i advocate equal rights equal opportunities equal privileges so does miss chancellor verena added with just a perceptible air of feeling that her declaration needed support  oh i thought what she wanted was simply a different inequalitysimply to turn out the men altogether ransom said  well she thinks we have great arrears to make up i do tell her sometimes that what she desires is not only justice but vengeance i think she admits that verena continued with a certain solemnity the subject however held her but an instant and before ransom had time to make any comment she went on in a different tone you dont mean to say you live in mississippi now miss chancellor told me when you were in boston before that you had located in new york she persevered in this reference to himself for when he had assented to her remark about new york she asked him whether he had quite given up the south  given it upthe poor dear desolate old south heaven forbid basil ransom exclaimed  she looked at him for a moment with an added softness i presume it is natural you should love your home but i am afraid you think i dont love mine much i have been herefor so longso little miss chancellor has absorbed methere is no doubt about that but its a pity i wasnt with her today ransom made no answer to this he was incapable of telling miss tarrant that if she had been he would not have called upon her it was not indeed that he was not incapable of hypocrisy for when she had asked him if he had seen his cousin the night before and he had replied that he hadnt seen her at all and she had exclaimed with a candour which the next minute made her blush ah you dont mean to say you havent forgiven herafter this he put on a look of innocence sufficient to carry off the inquiry forgiven her for what  verena coloured at the sound of her own words well i could see how much she felt that time at her house  what did she feel basil ransom asked with the natural provokingness of a man  i know not whether verena was provoked but she answered with more spirit than sequence well you know you did pour contempt on us ever so much i could see how it worked olive up are you not going to see her at all  well i shall think about that i am here only for three or four days said ransom smiling as men smile when they are perfectly unsatisfactory  it is very possible that verena was provoked inaccessible as she was in a general way to irritation for she rejoined in a moment with a little deliberate air well perhaps its as well you shouldnt go if you havent changed at all  i havent changed at all said the young man smiling still with his elbows on the arms of his chair his shoulders pushed up a little and his thin brown hands interlocked in front of him  well i have had visitors who were quite opposed verena announced as if such news could not possibly alarm her then she added how then did you know i was out here  miss birdseye told me  oh i am so glad you went to see her the girl cried speaking again with the impetuosity of a moment before  i didnt go to see her i met her in the street just as she was leaving miss chancellors door i spoke to her and accompanied her some distance i passed that way because i knew it was the direct way to cambridgefrom the commonand i was coming out to see you any wayon the chance  on the chance verena repeated  yes mrs luna in new york told me you were sometimes here and i wanted at any rate to make the attempt to find you  it may be communicated to the reader that it was very agreeable to verena to learn that her visitor had made this arduous pilgrimage for she knew well enough how people in boston regarded a winter journey to the academic suburb with only half the prospect of a reward but her pleasure was mixed with other feelings or at least with the consciousness that the whole situation was rather less simple than the elements of her life had been hitherto there was the germ of disorder in this invidious distinction which mr ransom had suddenly made between olive chancellor who was related to him by blood and herself who had never been related to him in any way whatever she knew olive by this time well enough to wish not to reveal it to her and yet it would be something quite new for her to undertake to conceal such an incident as her having spent an hour with mr ransom during a flying visit he had made to boston she had spent hours with other gentlemen whom olive didnt see but that was different because her friend knew about her doing it and didnt care in regard to the personsdidnt care that is as she would care in this case it was vivid to verenas mind that now olive would care she had talked about mr burrage and mr pardon and even about some gentlemen in europe and she had not after the first few days a year and a half before talked about mr ransom  nevertheless there were reasons clear to verenas view for wishing either that he would go and see olive or would keep away from her and the responsibility of treating the fact that he had not so kept away as a secret seemed the greater perhaps in the light of this other fact that so far as simply seeing mr ransom wentwhy she quite liked it she had remembered him perfectly after their two former meetings superficial as their contact then had been she had thought of him at moments and wondered whether she should like him if she were to know him better now at the end of twenty minutes she did know him better and found that he had rather a curious but still a pleasant way there he was at any rate and she didnt wish his call to be spoiled by any uncomfortable implication of consequences so she glanced off at the touch of mrs lunas name it seemed to afford relief oh yes mrs lunaisnt she fascinating  ransom hesitated a little well no i dont think she is  you ought to like hershe hates our movement and verena asked further numerous questions about the brilliant adeline whether he saw her often whether she went out much whether she was admired in new york whether he thought her very handsome he answered to the best of his ability but soon made the reflexion that he had not come out to monadnoc place to talk about mrs luna in consequence of which to change the subject as well as to acquit himself of a social duty he began to speak of verenas parents to express regret that mrs tarrant had been sick and fear that he was not to have the pleasure of seeing her she is a great deal better verena said but shes lying down she lies down a great deal when she has got nothing else to do mothers very peculiar she added in a moment she lies down when she feels well and happy and when shes sick she walks aboutshe roams all round the house if you hear her on the stairs a good deal you can be pretty sure shes very bad shell be very much interested to hear about you after you have left  ransom glanced at his watch i hope i am not staying too longthat i am not taking you away from her  oh no she likes visitors even when she cant see them if it didnt take her so long to rise she would have been down here by this time i suppose you think she has missed me since i have been so absorbed well so she has but she knows its for my good she would make any sacrifice for affection  the fancy suddenly struck ransom of asking in response to this and you would you make any  verena gave him a bright natural stare any sacrifice for affection she thought a moment and then she said i dont think i have a right to say because i have never been asked i dont remember ever to have had to make a sacrificenot an important one  lord you must have had a happy life  i have been very fortunate i know that i dont know what to do when i think how some womenhow most womensuffer but i must not speak of that she went on with her smile coming back to her if you oppose our movement you wont want to hear of the suffering of women  the suffering of women is the suffering of all humanity ransom returned do you think any movement is going to stop thator all the lectures from now to doomsday we are born to sufferand to bear it like decent people  oh i adore heroism verena interposed  and as for women ransom went on they have one source of happiness that is closed to usthe consciousness that their presence here below lifts half the load of our suffering  verena thought this very graceful but she was not sure it was not rather sophistical she would have liked to have olives judgement upon it as that was not possible for the present she abandoned the question since learning that mr ransom had passed over olive to come to her she had become rather fidgety and inquired of the young man irrelevantly whether he knew any one else in cambridge  not a creature as i tell you i have never been here before your image alone attracted me this charming interview will be henceforth my only association with the place  its a pity you couldnt have a few more said verena musingly  a few more interviews i should be unspeakably delighted  a few more associations did you see the colleges as you came  i had a glimpse of a large enclosure with some big buildings perhaps i can look at them better as i go back to boston  oh yes you ought to see themthey have improved so much of late the inner life of course is the greatest interest but there is some fine architecture if you are not familiar with europe she paused a moment looking at him with an eye that seemed to brighten and continued quickly like a person who had collected herself for a little jump if you would like to walk round a little i shall be very glad to show you  to walk roundwith you to show me ransom repeated my dear miss tarrant it would be the greatest privilegethe greatest happinessof my life what a delightful ideawhat an ideal guide  verena got up she would go and put on her hat he must wait a little her offer had a frankness and friendliness which gave him a new sensation and he could not know that as soon as she had made it though she had hesitated too with a moment of intense reflexion she seemed to herself strangely reckless an impulse pushed her she obeyed it with her eyes open she felt as a girl feels when she commits her first conscious indiscretion she had done many things before which many people would have called indiscreet but that quality had not even faintly belonged to them in her own mind she had done them in perfect good faith and with a remarkable absence of palpitation this superficially ingenuous proposal to walk around the colleges with mr ransom had really another colour it deepened the ambiguity of her position by reason of a prevision which i shall presently mention if olive was not to know that she had seen him this extension of their interview would double her secret and yet while she saw it growthis monstrous little mysteryshe couldnt feel sorry that she was going out with olives cousin as i have already said she had become nervous she went to put on her hat but at the door of the room she stopped turned round and presented herself to her visitor with a small spot in either cheek which had appeared there within the instant i have suggested this because it seems to me i ought to do something for youin return she said its nothing simply sitting there with me and we havent got anything else this is our only hospitality and the day seems so splendid  the modesty the sweetness of this little explanation with a kind of intimated desire constituting almost an appeal for rightness which seemed to pervade it left a fragrance in the air after she had vanished ransom walked up and down the room with his hands in his pockets under the influence of it without taking up even once the book about mrs foat he occupied the time in asking himself by what perversity of fate or of inclination such a charming creature was ranting upon platforms and living in olive chancellors pocket or how a ranter and sycophant could possibly be so engaging and she was so disturbingly beautiful too this last fact was not less evident when she came down arranged for their walk they left the house and as they proceeded he remembered that he had asked himself earlier how he could do honour to such a combination of leisure and ethereal mildness as he had waked up to that morninga mildness that seemed the very breath of his own latitude this question was answered now to do exactly what he was doing at that moment was an observance sufficiently festive     xxv   they passed through two or three small short streets which with their little wooden houses with still more wooden dooryards looked as if they had been constructed by the nearest carpenter and his boya sightless soundless interspaced embryonic regionand entered a long avenue which fringed on either side with fresh villas offering themselves trustfully to the public had the distinction of a wide pavement of neat red brick the new paint on the square detached houses shone afar off in the transparent air they had on top little cupolas and belvederes in front a pillared piazza made bare by the indoor life of winter on either side a bowwindow or two and everywhere an embellishment of scallops brackets cornices wooden flourishes they stood for the most part on small eminences lifted above the impertinence of hedge or paling well up before the world with all the good conscience which in many cases came as ransom saw and he had noticed the same ornament when he traversed with olive the quarter of boston inhabited by miss birdseye from a silvered number affixed to the glass above the door in figures huge enough to be read by the people who in the periodic horsecars travelled along the middle of the avenue it was to these glittering badges that many of the houses on either side owed their principal identity one of the horsecars now advanced in the straight spacious distance it was almost the only object that animated the prospect which in its large cleanness its implication of strict businesshabits on the part of all the people who were not there ransom thought very impressive as he went on with verena he asked her about the womens convention the year before whether it had accomplished much work and she had enjoyed it  what do you care about the work it accomplished said the girl you dont take any interest in that  you mistake my attitude i dont like it but i greatly fear it  in answer to this verena gave a free laugh i dont believe you fear much  the bravest men have been afraid of women wont you even tell me whether you enjoyed it i am told you made an immense sensation therethat you leaped into fame  verena never waved off an allusion to her ability her eloquence she took it seriously without any flutter or protest and had no more manner about it than if it concerned the goddess minerva i believe i attracted considerable attention of course thats what olive wantsit paves the way for future work i have no doubt i reached many that wouldnt have been reached otherwise they think thats my great useto take hold of the outsiders as it were of those who are prejudiced or thoughtless or who dont care about anything unless its amusing i wake up the attention  thats the class to which i belong ransom said am i not an outsider i wonder whether you would have reached meor waked up my attention  verena was silent awhile as they walked he heard the light click of her boots on the smooth bricks theni think i have waked it up a little she replied looking straight before her  most assuredly you have made me wish tremendously to contradict you  well thats a good sign  i suppose it was very excitingyour convention ransom went on in a moment the sort of thing you would miss very much if you were to return to the ancient fold  the ancient fold you say very well where women were slaughtered like sheep oh last june for a week we just quivered there were delegates from every state and every city we lived in a crowd of people and of ideas the heat was intense the weather magnificent and great thoughts and brilliant sayings flew round like darting fireflies olive had six celebrated highminded women staying in her housetwo in a room and in the summer evenings we sat in the open windows in her parlour looking out on the bay with the lights gleaming in the water and talked over the doings of the morning the speeches the incidents the fresh contributions to the cause we had some tremendously earnest discussions which it would have been a benefit to you to hear or any man who doesnt think that we can rise to the highest point then we had some refreshmentwe consumed quantities of icecream said verena in whom the note of gaiety alternated with that of earnestness almost of exaltation in a manner which seemed to basil ransom absolutely and fascinatingly original those were great nights she added between a laugh and a sigh  her description of the convention put the scene before him vividly he seemed to see the crowded overheated hall which he was sure was filled with carpetbaggers to hear flushed women with loosened bonnetstrings forcing thin voices into ineffectual shrillness it made him angry and all the more angry that he hadnt a reason to think of the charming creature at his side being mixed up with such elements pushed and elbowed by them conjoined with them in emulation in unsightly strainings and clappings and shoutings in wordy windy iteration of inanities worst of all was the idea that she should have expressed such a congregation to itself so acceptably have been acclaimed and applauded by hoarse throats have been lifted up to all the vulgar multitude as the queen of the occasion he made the reflexion afterwards that he was singularly illgrounded in his wrath inasmuch as it was none of his business what use miss tarrant chose to make of her energies and in addition to this nothing else was to have been expected of her but that reflexion was absent now and in its absence he saw only the fact that his companion had been odiously perverted well miss tarrant he said with a deeper seriousness than showed in his voice i am forced to the painful conclusion that you are simply ruined  ruined ruined yourself  oh i know the kind of women that miss chancellor had at her house and what a group you must have made when you looked out at the back bay it depresses me very much to think of it  we made a lovely interesting group and if we had had a spare minute we would have been photographed verena said  this led him to ask her if she had ever subjected herself to the process and she answered that a photographer had been after her as soon as she got back from europe and that she had sat for him and that there were certain shops in boston where her portrait could be obtained she gave him this information very simply without pretence of vagueness of knowledge spoke of the matter rather respectfully indeed as if it might be of some importance and when he said that he should go and buy one of the little pictures as soon as he returned to town contented herself with replying well be sure you pick out a good one he had not been altogether without a hope that she would offer to give him one with her name written beneath which was a mode of acquisition he would greatly have preferred but this evidently had not occurred to her and now as they went further her thought was following a different train that was proved by her remarking at the end of a silence inconsequently well it showed i have a great use as he stared wondering what she meant she explained that she referred to the brilliancy of her success at the convention it proved i have a great use she repeated and that is all i care for  the use of a truly amiable woman is to make some honest man happy ransom said with a sententiousness of which he was perfectly aware  it was so marked that it caused her to stop short in the middle of the broad walk while she looked at him with shining eyes see here mr ransom do you know what strikes me she exclaimed the interest you take in me isnt really controversiala bit its quite personal she was the most extraordinary girl she could speak such words as those without the smallest look of added consciousness coming into her face without the least supposable intention of coquetry or any visible purpose of challenging the young man to say more  my interest in youmy interest in you he began then hesitating he broke off suddenly it is certain your discovery doesnt make it any less  well thats better she went on for we neednt dispute  he laughed at the way she arranged it and they presently reached the irregular group of heterogeneous buildingschapels dormitories libraries hallswhich scattered among slender trees over a space reserved by means of a low rustic fence rather than enclosed for harvard knows nothing either of the jealousy or the dignity of high walls and guarded gateways constitutes the great university of massachusetts the yard or collegeprecinct is traversed by a number of straight little paths over which at certain hours of the day a thousand undergraduates with books under their arm and youth in their step flit from one school to another verena tarrant knew her way round as she said to her companion it was not the first time she had taken an admiring visitor to see the local monuments basil ransom walking with her from point to point admired them all and thought several of them exceedingly quaint and venerable the rectangular structures of old red brick especially gratified his eye the afternoon sun was yellow on their homely faces their windows showed a peep of flowerpots and brightcoloured curtains they wore an expression of scholastic quietude and exhaled for the young mississippian a tradition an antiquity this is the place where i ought to have been he said to his charming guide i should have had a good time if i had been able to study here  yes i presume you feel yourself drawn to any place where ancient prejudices are garnered up she answered not without archness i know by the stand you take about our cause that you share the superstitions of the old bookmen you ought to have been at one of those really mediæval universities that we saw on the other side at oxford or göttingen or padua you would have been in perfect sympathy with their spirit  well i dont know much about those old haunts ransom rejoined i reckon this is good enough for me and then it would have had the advantage that your residence isnt far you know  oh i guess we shouldnt have seen you much at my residence as you live in new york you come but here you wouldnt that is always the way with this light philosophy verena beguiled the transit to the library into which she introduced her companion with the air of a person familiar with the sanctified spot this edifice a diminished copy of the chapel of kings college at the greater cambridge is a rich and impressive institution and as he stood there in the bright heated stillness which seemed suffused with the odour of old print and old bindings and looked up into the high light vaults that hung over quiet bookladen galleries alcoves and tables and glazed cases where rarer treasures gleamed more vaguely over busts of benefactors and portraits of worthies bowed heads of working students and the gentle creak of passing messengersas he took possession in a comprehensive glance of the wealth and wisdom of the place he felt more than ever the soreness of an opportunity missed but he abstained from expressing it it was too deep for that and in a moment verena had introduced him to a young lady a friend of hers who as she explained was working on the catalogue and whom she had asked for on entering the library at a desk where another young lady was occupied miss catching the firstmentioned young lady presented herself with promptness offered verena a lowtoned but appreciative greeting and after a little undertook to explain to ransom the mysteries of the catalogue which consisted of a myriad little cards disposed alphabetically in immense chests of drawers ransom was deeply interested and as with verena he followed miss catching about she was so good as to show them the establishment in all its ramifications he considered with attention the young ladys fair ringlets and refined anxious expression saying to himself that this was in the highest degree a new england type verena found an opportunity to mention to him that she was wrapped up in the cause and there was a moment during which he was afraid that his companion would expose him to her as one of its traducers but there was that in miss catchings manner and in the influence of the lofty halls which deprecated loud pleasantry and seemed to say moreover that if she were treated to such a revelation she should not know under what letter to range it  now there is one place where perhaps it would be indelicate to take a mississippian verena said after this episode i mean the great place that towers above the othersthat big building with the beautiful pinnacles which you see from every point but basil ransom had heard of the great memorial hall he knew what memories it enshrined and the worst that he should have to suffer there and the ornate overtopping structure which was the finest piece of architecture he had ever seen had moreover solicited his enlarged curiosity for the last halfhour he thought there was rather too much brick about it but it was buttressed cloistered turreted dedicated superscribed as he had never seen anything though it didnt look old it looked significant it covered a large area and it sprang majestic into the winter air it was detached from the rest of the collegiate group and stood in a grassy triangle of its own as he approached it with verena she suddenly stopped to decline responsibility now mind if you dont like whats inside it isnt my fault  he looked at her an instant smiling is there anything against mississippi  well no i dont think she is mentioned but there is great praise of our young men in the war  it says they were brave i suppose  yes it says so in latin  well so they werei know something about that basil ransom said i must be brave enough to face themit isnt the first time and they went up the low steps and passed into the tall doors the memorial hall of harvard consists of three main divisions one of them a theatre for academic ceremonies another a vast refectory covered with a timbered roof hung about with portraits and lighted by stained windows like the halls of the colleges of oxford and the third the most interesting a chamber high dim and severe consecrated to the sons of the university who fell in the long civil war ransom and his companion wandered from one part of the building to another and stayed their steps at several impressive points but they lingered longest in the presence of the white ranged tablets each of which in its proud sad clearness is inscribed with the name of a studentsoldier the effect of the place is singularly noble and solemn and it is impossible to feel it without a lifting of the heart it stands there for duty and honour it speaks of sacrifice and example seems a kind of temple to youth manhood generosity most of them were young all were in their prime and all of them had fallen this simple idea hovers before the visitor and makes him read with tenderness each name and placenames often without other history and forgotten southern battles for ransom these things were not a challenge nor a taunt they touched him with respect with the sentiment of beauty he was capable of being a generous foeman and he forgot now the whole question of sides and parties the simple emotion of the old fightingtime came back to him and the monument around him seemed an embodiment of that memory it arched over friends as well as enemies the victims of defeat as well as the sons of triumph  it is very beautifulbut i think it is very dreadful this remark from verena called him back to the present its a real sin to put up such a building just to glorify a lot of bloodshed if it wasnt so majestic i would have it pulled down  that is delightful feminine logic ransom answered if when women have the conduct of affairs they fight as well as they reason surely for them too we shall have to set up memorials  verena retorted that they would reason so well they would have no need to fightthey would usher in the reign of peace but this is very peaceful too she added looking about her and she sat down on a low stone ledge as if to enjoy the influence of the scene ransom left her alone for ten minutes he wished to take another look at the inscribed tablets and read again the names of the various engagements at several of which he had been present when he came back to her she greeted him abruptly with a question which had no reference to the solemnity of the spot if miss birdseye knew you were coming out to see me cant she easily tell olive then wont olive make her reflexions about your neglect of herself  i dont care for her reflexions at any rate i asked miss birdseye as a favour not to mention to her that she had met me ransom added  verena was silent a moment your logic is most as good as a womans do change your mind and go to see her now she went on she will probably be at home by the time you get to charles street if she was a little strange a little stiff with you before i know just how she must have been all that will be different today  why will it be different  oh she will be easier more genial much softer  i dont believe it said ransom and his scepticism seemed none the less complete because it was light and smiling  she is much happier nowshe can afford not to mind you  not to mind me thats a nice inducement for a gentleman to go and see a lady  well she will be more gracious because she feels now that she is more successful  you mean because she has brought you out oh i have no doubt that has cleared the air for her immensely and you have improved her very much but i have got a charming impression out here and i have no wish to put anotherwhich wont be charming anyhow you arrange iton top of it  well she will be sure to know you have been round here at any rate verena rejoined  how will she know unless you tell her  i tell her everything said the girl and now as soon as she had spoken she blushed he stood before her tracing a figure on the mosaic pavement with his cane conscious that in a moment they had become more intimate they were discussing their affairs which had nothing to do with the heroic symbols that surrounded them but their affairs had suddenly grown so serious that there was no want of decency in their lingering there for the purpose the implication that his visit might remain as a secret between them made them both feel it differently to ask her to keep it so would have been as it seemed to ransom a liberty and moreover he didnt care so much as that but if she were to prefer to do so such a preference would only make him consider the more that his expedition had been a success  oh then you can tell her this he said in a moment  if i shouldnt it would be the first and verena checked herself  you must arrange that with your conscience ransom went on laughing  they came out of the hall passed down the steps and emerged from the delta as that portion of the college precinct is called the afternoon had begun to wane but the air was filled with a pink brightness and there was a cool pure smell a vague breath of spring  well if i dont tell olive then you must leave me here said verena stopping in the path and putting out a hand of farewell  i dont understand what has that to do with it besides i thought you said you must tell ransom added in playing with the subject this way in enjoying her visible hesitation he was slightly conscious of a mans brutalityof being pushed by an impulse to test her goodnature which seemed to have no limit it showed no sign of perturbation as she answered  well i want to be freeto do as i think best and if there is a chance of my keeping it back there mustnt be anything morethere must not mr ransom really  anything more why what are you afraid there will beif i should simply walk home with you  i must go alone i must hurry back to mother she said for all reply and she again put out her hand which he had not taken before  of course he took it now and even held it a moment he didnt like being dismissed and was thinking of pretexts to linger miss birdseye said you would convert me but you havent yet it came into his head to say  you cant tell yet wait a little my influence is peculiar it sometimes comes out a long time afterwards this speech on verenas part was evidently perfunctory and the grandeur of her selfreference jocular she was much more serious when she went on quickly do you mean to say miss birdseye promised you that  oh yes talk about influence you should have seen the influence i obtained over her  well what good will it do if im going to tell olive about your visit  well you see i think she hopes you wont she believes you are going to convert me privatelyso that i shall blaze forth suddenly out of the darkness of mississippi as a firstclass proselyte very effective and dramatic  verena struck basil ransom as constantly simple but there were moments when her candour seemed to him preternatural if i thought that would be the effect i might make an exception she remarked speaking as if such a result were after all possible  oh miss tarrant you will convert me enough any way said the young man  enough what do you mean by enough  enough to make me terribly unhappy  she looked at him a moment evidently not understanding but she tossed him a retort at a venture turned away and took her course homeward the retort was that if he should be unhappy it would serve him righta form of words that committed her to nothing as he returned to boston he saw how curious he should be to learn whether she had betrayed him as it were to miss chancellor he might learn through mrs luna that would almost reconcile him to going to see her again olive would mention it in writing to her sister and adeline would repeat the complaint perhaps she herself would even make him a scene about it that would be for him part of the unhappiness he had foretold to verena tarrant     xxvi   mrs henry burrage at home wednesday evening march 26th at halfpast nine oclock it was in consequence of having received a card with these words inscribed upon it that basil ransom presented himself on the evening she had designated at the house of a lady he had never heard of before the account of the relation of effect to cause is not complete however unless i mention that the card bore furthermore in the lefthand lower corner the words an address from miss verena tarrant he had an idea it came mainly from the look and even the odour of the engraved pasteboard that mrs burrage was a member of the fashionable world and it was with considerable surprise that he found himself in such an element he wondered what had induced a denizen of that fine air to send him an invitation then he said to himself that obviously verena tarrant had simply requested that this should be done mrs henry burrage whoever she might be had asked her if she shouldnt like some of her own friends to be present and she had said oh yes and mentioned him in the happy group she had been able to give mrs burrage his address for had it not been contained in the short letter he despatched to monadnoc place soon after his return from boston in which he thanked miss tarrant afresh for the charming hour she had enabled him to spend at cambridge she had not answered his letter at the time but mrs burrages card was a very good answer such a missive deserved a rejoinder and it was by way of rejoinder that he entered the street car which on the evening of march 26th was to deposit him at a corner adjacent to mrs burrages dwelling he almost never went to evening parties he knew scarcely any one who gave them though mrs luna had broken him in a little and he was sure this occasion was of festive intention would have nothing in common with the nocturnal exercises at miss birdseyes but he would have exposed himself to almost any social discomfort in order to see verena tarrant on the platform the platform it evidently was to beprivate if not publicsince one was admitted by a ticket given away if not sold he took his in his pocket quite ready to present it at the door it would take some time for me to explain the contradiction to the reader but basil ransoms desire to be present at one of verenas regular performances was not diminished by the fact that he detested her views and thought the whole business a poor perversity he understood her now very well since his visit to cambridge he saw she was honest and natural she had queer bad lectureblood in her veins and a comically false idea of the aptitude of little girls for conducting movements but her enthusiasm was of the purest her illusions had a fragrance and so far as the mania for producing herself personally was concerned it had been distilled into her by people who worked her for ends which to basil ransom could only appear insane she was a touching ingenuous victim unconscious of the pernicious forces which were hurrying her to her ruin with this idea of ruin there had already associated itself in the young mans mind the ideaa good deal more dim and incompleteof rescue and it was the disposition to confirm himself in the view that her charm was her own and her fallacies her absurdity a mere reflexion of unlucky circumstance that led him to make an effort to behold her in the position in which he could least bear to think of her such a glimpse was all that was wanted to prove to him that she was a person for whom he might open an unlimited credit of tender compassion he expected to sufferto suffer deliciously  by the time he had crossed mrs burrages threshold there was no doubt whatever in his mind that he was in the fashionable world it was embodied strikingly in the stout elderly ugly lady dressed in a brilliant colour with a twinkle of jewels and a bosom much uncovered who stood near the door of the first room and with whom the people passing in before him were shaking hands ransom made her a mississipian bow and she said she was delighted to see him while people behind him pressed him forward he yielded to the impulsion and found himself in a great saloon amid lights and flowers where the company was dense and there were more twinkling smiling ladies with uncovered bosoms it was certainly the fashionable world for there was no one there whom he had ever seen before the walls of the room were covered with picturesthe very ceiling was painted and framed the people pushed each other a little edged about advanced and retreated looking at each other with differing facessometimes blandly unperceivingly sometimes with a harshness of contemplation a kind of cruelty ransom thought sometimes with sudden nods and grimaces inarticulate murmurs followed by a quick reaction a sort of gloom he was now absolutely certain that he was in the best society he was carried further and further forward and saw that another room stretched beyond the one he had entered in which there was a sort of little stage covered with a red cloth and an immense collection of chairs arranged in rows he became aware that people looked at him as well as at each other rather more indeed than at each other and he wondered whether it were very visible in his appearance that his being there was a kind of exception he didnt know how much his head looked over the heads of others or that his brown complexion fuliginous eye and straight black hair the leonine fall of which i mentioned in the first pages of this narrative gave him that relief which in the best society has the great advantage of suggesting a topic but there were other topics besides as was proved by a fragment of conversation between two ladies which reached his ear while he stood rather wistfully wondering where verena tarrant might be  are you a member one of the ladies said to the other i didnt know you had joined  oh i havent nothing would induce me  thats not fair you have all the fun and none of the responsibility  oh thethe fun exclaimed the second lady  you neednt abuse us or i will never invite you said the first  well i thought it was meant to be improving thats all i mean very good for the mind now this woman tonight isnt she from boston  yes i believe they have brought her on just for this  well you must be pretty desperate when you have got to go to boston for your entertainment  well theres a similar society there and i never heard of their sending to new york  of course not they think they have got everything but doesnt it make your life a burden thinking what you can possibly have  oh dear no i am going to have professor gougenheimall about the talmud you must come  well ill come said the second lady but nothing would induce me to be a regular member  whatever the mystic circle might be ransom agreed with the second lady that regular membership must have terrors and he admired her independence in such an artificial world a considerable part of the company had now directed itself to the further apartmentpeople had begun to occupy the chairs to confront the empty platform he reached the wide doors and saw that the place was a spacious musicroom decorated in white and gold with a polished floor and marble busts of composers on brackets attached to the delicate panels he forbore to enter however being shy about taking a seat and seeing that the ladies were arranging themselves first he turned back into the first room to wait till the audience had massed itself conscious that even if he were behind every one he should be able to make a long neck and here suddenly in a corner his eyes rested upon olive chancellor she was seated a little apart in an angle of the room and she was looking straight at him but as soon as she perceived that he saw her she dropped her eyes giving no sign of recognition ransom hesitated a moment but the next he went straight over to her it had been in his mind that if verena tarrant was there she would be there an instinct told him that miss chancellor would not allow her dear friend to come to new york without her it was very possible she meant to cut himespecially if she knew of his having cut her the other week in boston but it was his duty to take for granted she would speak to him until the contrary should be definitely proved though he had seen her only twice he remembered well how acutely shy she was capable of being and he thought it possible one of these spasms had seized her at the present time  when he stood before her he found his conjecture perfectly just she was white with the intensity of her selfconsciousness she was altogether in a very uncomfortable state she made no response to his offer to shake hands with her and he saw that she would never go through that ceremony again she looked up at him when he spoke to her and her lips moved but her face was intensely grave and her eye had almost a feverish light she had evidently got into her corner to be out of the way he recognised in her the air of an interloper as he had felt it in himself the small sofa on which she had placed herself had the form to which the french give the name of causeuse there was room on it for just another person and ransom asked her with a cheerful accent if he might sit down beside her she turned towards him when he had done so turned everything but her eyes and opened and shut her fan while she waited for her fit of diffidence to pass away ransom himself did not wait he took a jocular tone about their encounter asking her if she had come to new york to rouse the people she glanced round the room the backs of mrs burrages guests mainly were presented to them and their position was partly masked by a pyramid of flowers which rose from a pedestal close to olives end of the sofa and diffused a fragrance in the air  do you call these the people she asked  i havent the least idea i dont know who any of them are not even who mrs henry burrage is i simply received an invitation  miss chancellor gave him no information on the point he had mentioned she only said in a moment do you go wherever you are invited  why i go if i think i may find you there the young man replied gallantly my card mentioned that miss tarrant would give an address and i knew that wherever she is you are not far off i have heard you are inseparable from mrs luna  yes we are inseparable that is exactly why i am here  its the fashionable world then you are going to stir up  olive remained for some time with her eyes fastened to the floor then she flashed them up at her interlocutor its a part of our life to go anywhereto carry our work where it seems most needed we have taught ourselves to stifle repulsion distaste  oh i think this is very amusing said ransom its a beautiful house and there are some very pretty faces we havent anything so brilliant in mississippi  to everything he said olive offered at first a momentary silence but the worst of her shyness was apparently leaving her  are you successful in new york do you like it she presently asked uttering the inquiry in a tone of infinite melancholy as if the eternal sense of duty forced it from her lips  oh successful i am not successful as you and miss tarrant are for to my barbaric eyes it is a great sign of prosperity to be the heroines of an occasion like this  do i look like the heroine of an occasion asked olive chancellor without an intention of humour but with an effect that was almost comical  you would if you didnt hide yourself away are you not going into the other room to hear the speech everything is prepared  i am going when i am notifiedwhen i am invited  there was considerable majesty in her tone and ransom saw that something was wrong that she felt neglected to see that she was as ticklish with others as she had been with him made him feel forgiving and there was in his manner a perfect disposition to forget their differences as he said oh there is plenty of time the place isnt half full yet  she made no direct rejoinder to this but she asked him about his mother and sisters what news he received from the south have they any happiness she inquired rather as if she warned him to take care not to pretend they had he neglected her warning to the point of saying that there was one happiness they always hadthat of having learned not to think about it too much and to make the best of their circumstances she listened to this with an air of great reserve and apparently thought he had wished to give her a lesson for she suddenly broke out you mean that you have traced a certain line for them and that thats all you know about it  ransom stared at her surprised he felt now that she would always surprise him ah dont be rough with me he said in his soft southern voice dont you remember how you knocked me about when i called on you in boston  you hold us in chains and then when we writhe in our agony you say we dont behave prettily these words which did not lessen ransoms wonderment were the young ladys answer to his deprecatory speech she saw that he was honestly bewildered and that in a moment more he would laugh at her as he had done a year and a half before she remembered it as if it had been yesterday and to stop that off at any cost she went on hurriedlyif you listen to miss tarrant you will know what i mean  oh miss tarrantmiss tarrant and basil ransoms laughter came  she had not escaped that mockery after all and she looked at him sharply now her embarrassment having quite cleared up what do you know about her what observation have you had  ransom met her eye and for a moment they scrutinised each other did she know of his interview with verena a month before and was her reserve simply the wish to place on him the burden of declaring that he had been to boston since they last met and yet had not called in charles street he thought there was suspicion in her face but in regard to verena she would always be suspicious if he had done at that moment just what would gratify him he would have said to her that he knew a great deal about miss tarrant having lately had a long walk and talk with her but he checked himself with the reflexion that if verena had not betrayed him it would be very wrong in him to betray her the sweetness of the idea that she should have thought the episode of his visit to monadnoc place worth placing under the rose was quenched for the moment in his regret at not being able to let his disagreeable cousin know that he had passed her over dont you remember my hearing her speak that night at miss birdseyes he said presently and i met her the next day at your house you know  she has developed greatly since then olive remarked dryly and ransom felt sure that verena had held her tongue  at this moment a gentleman made his way through the clusters of mrs burrages guests and presented himself to olive if you will do me the honour to take my arm i will find a good seat for you in the other room its getting to be time for miss tarrant to reveal herself i have been taking her into the pictureroom there were some things she wanted to see she is with my mother now he added as if miss chancellors grave face constituted a sort of demand for an explanation of her friends absence she said she was a little nervous so i thought we would just move about  its the first time i have ever heard of that said olive chancellor preparing to surrender herself to the young mans guidance he told her that he had reserved the best seat for her it was evidently his desire to conciliate her to treat her as a person of importance before leading her away he shook hands with ransom and remarked that he was very glad to see him and ransom saw that he must be the master of the house though he could scarcely be the son of the stout lady in the doorway he was a fresh pleasant handsome young man with a bright friendly manner he recommended ransom to take a seat in the other room without delay if he had never heard miss tarrant he would have one of the greatest pleasures of his life  oh mr ransom only comes to ventilate his prejudices miss chancellor said as she turned her back to her kinsman he shrank from pushing into the front of the company which was now rapidly filling the musicroom and contented himself with lingering in the doorway where several gentlemen were stationed the seats were all occupied all that is save one towards which he saw miss chancellor and her companion direct themselves squeezing and edging past the people who were standing up against the walls this was quite in front close to the little platform every one noticed olive as she went and ransom heard a gentleman near him say to anotheri guess shes one of the same kind he looked for verena but she was apparently keeping out of sight suddenly he felt himself smartly tapped on the back and turning round perceived mrs luna who had been prodding him with her fan     xxvii   you wont speak to me in my own housethat i have almost grown used to but if you are going to pass me over in public i think you might give me warning first this was only her archness and he knew what to make of that now she was dressed in yellow and looked very plump and gay he wondered at the unerring instinct by which she had discovered his exposed quarter the outer room was completely empty she had come in at the further door and found the field free for her operations he offered to find her a place where she could see and hear miss tarrant to get her a chair to stand on even if she wished to look over the heads of the gentlemen in the doorway a proposal which she greeted with the inquirydo you suppose i came here for the sake of that chatterbox havent i told you what i think of her  well you certainly did not come here for my sake said ransom anticipating this insinuation for you couldnt possibly have known i was coming  i guessed ita presentiment told me mrs luna declared and she looked up at him with searching accusing eyes i know what you have come for she cried in a moment you never mentioned to me that you knew mrs burrage  i donti never had heard of her till she asked me  then why in the world did she ask you  ransom had spoken a trifle rashly it came over him quickly that there were reasons why he had better not have said that but almost as quickly he covered up his mistake i suppose your sister was so good as to ask for a card for me  my sister my grandmother i know how olive loves you mr ransom you are very deep she had drawn him well into the room out of earshot of the group in the doorway and he felt that if she should be able to compass her wish she would organise a little entertainment for herself in the outer drawingroom in opposition to miss tarrants address please come and sit down here a moment we shall be quite undisturbed i have something very particular to say to you she led the way to the little sofa in the corner where he had been talking with olive a few minutes before and he accompanied her with extreme reluctance grudging the moments that he should be obliged to give to her he had quite forgotten that he once had a vision of spending his life in her society and he looked at his watch as he made the observation  i havent the least idea of losing any of the sport in there you know  he felt the next instant that he oughtnt to have said that either but he was irritated disconcerted and he couldnt help it it was in the nature of a gallant mississippian to do everything a lady asked him and he had never remarkable as it may appear been in the position of finding such a request so incompatible with his own desires as now it was a new predicament for mrs luna evidently meant to keep him if she could she looked round the room more and more pleased at their having it to themselves and for the moment said nothing more about the singularity of his being there on the contrary she became freshly jocular remarked that now they had got hold of him they wouldnt easily let him go they would make him entertain them induce him to give a lectureon the lights and shadows of southern life or the social peculiarities of mississippibefore the wednesday club  and what in the world is the wednesday club i suppose its what those ladies were talking about ransom said  i dont know your ladies but the wednesday club is this thing i dont mean you and me here together but all those deluded beings in the other room it is new york trying to be like boston it is the culture the good form of the metropolis you might not think it but it is its the quiet set they are quiet enough you might hear a pin drop in there is some one going to offer up a prayer how happy olive must be to be taken so seriously they form an association for meeting at each others houses every week and having some performance or some paper read or some subject explained the more dreary it is and the more fearful the subject the more they think it is what it ought to be they have an idea this is the way to make new york society intellectual theres a sumptuary lawisnt that what you call itabout suppers and they restrict themselves to a kind of spartan broth when its made by their french cooks it isnt bad mrs burrage is one of the principal membersone of the founders i believe and when her turn has come round formerlyit comes only once in the winter for eachi am told she has usually had very good music but that is thought rather a base evasion a begging of the question the vulgar set can easily keep up with them on music so mrs burrage conceived the extraordinary ideaand it was wonderful to hear how mrs luna pronounced that adjectiveof sending on to boston for that girl it was her son of course who put it into her head he has been at cambridge for some yearsthats where verena lived you knowand he was as thick with her as you please out there now that he is no longer there it suits him very well to have her here she is coming on a visit to his mother when olive goes i asked them to stay with me but olive declined majestically she said they wished to be in some place where they would be free to receive sympathising friends so they are staying at some extraordinary kind of new jerusalem boardinghouse in tenth street olive thinks its her duty to go to such places i was greatly surprised that she should let verena be drawn into such a worldly crowd as this but she told me they had made up their minds not to let any occasion slip that they could sow the seed of truth in drawingrooms as well as in workshops and that if a single person was brought round to their ideas they should have been justified in coming on thats what they are doing in theresowing the seed but you shall not be the one thats brought round i shall take care of that have you seen my delightful sister yet the way she does arrange herself when she wants to protest against frills she looks as if she thought it pretty barren ground round here now she has come to see it i dont think she thinks you can be saved in a french dress anyhow i must say i call it a very base evasion of mrs burrages producing verena tarrant its worse than the meretricious music why didnt she honestly send for a ballerina from niblosif she wanted a young woman capering about on a platform they dont care a fig about poor olives ideas its only because verena has strange hair and shiny eyes and gets herself up like a prestidigitators assistant i have never understood how olive can reconcile herself to verenas really low style of dress i suppose its only because her clothes are so fearfully made you look as if you didnt believe mebut i assure you that the cut is revolutionary and thats a salve to olives conscience  ransom was surprised to hear that he looked as if he didnt believe her for he had found himself after his first uneasiness listening with considerable interest to her account of the circumstances under which miss tarrant was visiting new york after a moment as the result of some private reflexion he propounded this question is the son of the lady of the house a handsome young man very polite in a white vest  i dont know the colour of his vestbut he has a kind of fawning manner verena judges from that that he is in love with her  perhaps he is said ransom you say it was his idea to get her to come on  oh he likes to flirt that is highly probable  perhaps she has brought him round  not to where she wants i think the property is very large he will have it all one of these days  do you mean she wishes to impose on him the yoke of matrimony ransom asked with southern languor  i believe she thinks matrimony an exploded superstition but there is here and there a case in which it is still the best thing when the gentlemans name happens to be burrage and the young ladys tarrant i dont admire burrage so much myself but i think she would have captured this present scion if it hadnt been for olive olive stands between themshe wants to keep her in the single sisterhood to keep her above all for herself of course she wont listen to her marrying and she has put a spoke in the wheel she has brought her to new york that may seem against what i say but the girl pulls hard she has to humour her to give her her head sometimes to throw something overboard in short to save the rest you may say as regards mr burrage that its a queer taste in a gentleman but there is no arguing about that its queer taste in a lady too for she is a lady poor olive you can see that tonight she is dressed like a bookagent but she is more distinguished than any one here verena beside her looks like a walking advertisement  when mrs luna paused basil ransom became aware that in the other room verenas address had begun the sound of her clear bright ringing voice an admirable voice for public uses came to them from the distance his eagerness to stand where he could hear her better and see her into the bargain made him start in his place and this movement produced an outgush of mocking laughter on the part of his companion but she didnt saygo go deluded man i take pity on you she only remarked with light impertinence that he surely wouldnt be so wanting in gallantry as to leave a lady absolutely alone in a public placeit was so mrs luna was pleased to qualify mrs burrages drawingroomin the face of her entreaty that he would remain with her she had the better of poor ransom thanks to the superstitions of mississippi it was in his simple code a gross rudeness to withdraw from conversation with a lady at a party before another gentleman should have come to take ones place it was to inflict on the lady a kind of outrage the other gentlemen at mrs burrages were all too well occupied there was not the smallest chance of one of them coming to his rescue he couldnt leave mrs luna and yet he couldnt stay with her and lose the only thing he had come so much out of his way for let me at least find you a place over there in the doorway you can stand upon a chairyou can lean on me  thank you very much i would much rather lean on this sofa and i am much too tired to stand on chairs besides i wouldnt for the world that either verena or olive should see me craning over the heads of the crowdas if i attached the smallest importance to their perorations  it isnt time for the peroration yet ransom said with savage dryness and he sat forward with his elbow on his knees his eyes on the ground a flush in his sallow cheek  its never time to say such things as those mrs luna remarked arranging her laces  how do you know what she is saying  i can tell by the way her voice goes up and down it sounds so silly  ransom sat there five minutes longerminutes which he felt the recording angel ought to write down to his creditand asked himself how mrs luna could be such a goose as not to see that she was making him hate her but she was goose enough for anything he tried to appear indifferent and it occurred to him to doubt whether the mississippi system could be right after all it certainly hadnt foreseen such a case as this its as plain as day that mr burrage intends to marry herif he can he said in a minute that remark being better calculated than any other he could think of to dissimulate his real state of mind  it drew no rejoinder from his companion and after an instant he turned his head a little and glanced at her the result of something that silently passed between them was to make her say abruptly mr ransom my sister never sent you an invitation to this place didnt it come from verena tarrant  i havent the least idea  as you hadnt the least acquaintance with mrs burrage who else could it have come from  if it came from miss tarrant i ought at least to recognise her courtesy by listening to her  if you rise from this sofa i will tell olive what i suspect she will be perfectly capable of carrying verena off to chinaor anywhere out of your reach  and pray what is it you suspect  that you two have been in correspondence  tell her whatever you like mrs luna said the young man with the grimness of resignation  you are quite unable to deny it i see  i never contradict a lady  we shall see if i cant make you tell a fib havent you been seeing miss tarrant too  where should i have seen her i cant see all the way to boston as you said the other day  havent you been thereon secret visits  ransom started just perceptibly but to conceal it the next instant he stood up  they wouldnt be secret if i were to tell you  looking down at her he saw that her words were a happy hit not the result of definite knowledge but she appeared to him vain egotistical grasping odious  well i shall give the alarm she went on that is i will if you leave me is that the way a southern gentleman treats a lady do as i wish and i will let you off  you wont let me off from staying with you  is it such a corvée i never heard of such rudeness mrs luna cried all the same i am determined to keep you if i can  ransom felt that she must be in the wrong and yet superficially she seemed and it was quite intolerable to have right on her side all this while verenas golden voice with her words indistinct solicited tantalised his ear the question had evidently got on mrs lunas nerves she had reached that point of feminine embroilment when a woman is perverse for the sake of perversity and even with a clear vision of bad consequences  you have lost your head he relieved himself by saying as he looked down at her  i wish you would go and get me some tea  you say that only to embarrass me he had hardly spoken when a great sound of applause the clapping of many hands and the cry from fifty throats of brava brava floated in and died away all ransoms pulses throbbed he flung his scruples to the winds and after remarking to mrs lunastill with all due ceremonythat he feared he must resign himself to forfeiting her good opinion turned his back upon her and strode away to the open door of the musicroom well i have never been so insulted he heard her exclaim with exceeding sharpness as he left her and glancing back at her as he took up his position he saw her still seated on her sofaalone in the lamplit desertwith her eyes making across the empty space little vindictive points well she could come where he was if she wanted him so much he would support her on an ottoman and make it easy for her to see but mrs luna was uncompromising he became aware after a minute that she had withdrawn majestically from the place and he did not see her again that evening     xxviii   he could command the musicroom very well from where he stood behind a thick outer fringe of intently listening men verena tarrant was erect on her little platform dressed in white with flowers in her bosom the red cloth beneath her feet looked rich in the light of lamps placed on high pedestals on either side of the stage it gave her figure a setting of colour which made it more pure and salient she moved freely in her exposed isolation yet with great sobriety of gesture there was no table in front of her and she had no notes in her hand but stood there like an actress before the footlights or a singer spinning vocal sounds to a silver thread there was such a risk that a slim provincial girl pretending to fascinate a couple of hundred blasé new yorkers by simply giving them her ideas would fail of her effect that at the end of a few moments basil ransom became aware that he was watching her in very much the same excited way as if she had been performing high above his head on the trapeze yet as one listened it was impossible not to perceive that she was in perfect possession of her faculties her subject her audience and he remembered the other time at miss birdseyes well enough to be able to measure the ground she had travelled since then this exhibition was much more complete her manner much more assured she seemed to speak and survey the whole place from a much greater height her voice too had developed he had forgotten how beautiful it could be when she raised it to its full capacity such a tone as that so pure and rich and yet so young so natural constituted in itself a talent he didnt wonder that they had made a fuss about her at the female convention if she filled their hideous hall with such a music he had read of old of the improvisatrice of italy and this was a chastened modern american version of the type a new england corinna with a mission instead of a lyre the most graceful part of her was her earnestness the way her delightful eyes wandering over the fashionable audience before which she was so perfectly unabashed as if she wished to resolve it into a single sentient personality seemed to say that the only thing in life she cared for was to put the truth into a form that would render conviction irresistible she was as simple as she was charming and there was not a glance or motion that did not seem part of the pure stillburning passion that animated her she had indeedit was manifestreduced the company to unanimity their attention was anything but languid they smiled back at her when she smiled they were noiseless motionless when she was solemn and it was evident that the entertainment which mrs burrage had had the happy thought of offering to her friends would be memorable in the annals of the wednesday club it was agreeable to basil ransom to think that verena noticed him in his corner her eyes played over her listeners so freely that you couldnt say they rested in one place more than another nevertheless a single rapid ray which however didnt in the least strike him as a deviation from her ridiculous fantastic delightful argument let him now that he had been missed and now was particularly spoken to this glance was a sufficient assurance that his invitation had come to him by the girls request he took for granted the matter of her speech was ridiculous how could it help being and what did it signify if it was she was none the less charming for that and the moonshine she had been plied with was none the less moonshine for her being charming after he had stood there a quarter of an hour he became conscious that he should not be able to repeat a word she had said he had not definitely heeded it and yet he had not lost a vibration of her voice he had discovered olive chancellor by this time she was in the front row of chairs at the end on the left her back was turned to him but he could see half her sharp profile bent down a little and absolutely motionless even across the wide interval her attitude expressed to him a kind of rapturous stillness the concentration of triumph there were several irrepressible effusions of applause instantly selfchecked but olive never looked up at the loudest and such a calmness as that could only be the result of passionate volition success was in the air and she was tasting it she tasted it as she did everything in a way of her own success for verena was success for her and ransom was sure that the only thing wanting to her triumph was that he should have been placed in the line of her vision so that she might enjoy his embarrassment and confusion might say to him in one of her dumb cold flashesnow do you think our movement is not a forcenow do you think that women are meant to be slaves honestly he was not conscious of any confusion it subverted none of his heresies to perceive that verena tarrant had even more power to fix his attention than he had hitherto supposed it was fixed in a way it had not been yet however by his at last understanding her speech feeling it reach his inner sense through the impediment of mere dazzled vision certain phrases took on a meaning for himan appeal she was making to those who still resisted the beneficent influence of the truth they appeared to be mocking cynical men mainly many of whom were such triflers and idlers so heartless and brainless that it didnt matter much what they thought on any subject if the old tyranny needed to be propped up by them it showed it was in a pretty bad way but there were others whose prejudice was stronger and more cultivated pretended to rest upon study and argument to those she wished particularly to address herself she wanted to waylay them to say look here youre all wrong youll be so much happier when i have convinced you just give me five minutes she should like to say just sit down here and let me ask a simple question do you think any state of society can come to good that is based upon an organised wrong that was the simple question that verena desired to propound and basil smiled across the room at her with an amused tenderness as he gathered that she conceived it to be a poser he didnt think it would frighten him much if she were to ask him that and he would sit down with her for as many minutes as she liked  he of course was one of the systematic scoffers one of those to whom she saiddo you know how you strike me you strike me as men who are starving to death while they have a cupboard at home all full of bread and meat and wine or as blind demented beings who let themselves be cast into a debtors prison while in their pocket they have the key of vaults and treasurechests heaped up with gold and silver the meat and wine the gold and silver verena went on are simply the suppressed and wasted force the precious sovereign remedy of which society insanely deprives itselfthe genius the intelligence the inspiration of women it is dying inch by inch in the midst of old superstitions which it invokes in vain and yet it has the elixir of life in its hands let it drink but a draught and it will bloom once more it will be refreshed radiant it will find its youth again the heart the heart is cold and nothing but the touch of woman can warm it make it act we are the heart of humanity and let us have the courage to insist on it the public life of the world will move in the same barren mechanical vicious circlethe circle of egotism cruelty ferocity jealousy greed of blind striving to do things only for some at the cost of others instead of trying to do everything for all all all who dares to say all when we are not there we are an equal a splendid an inestimable part try us and youll seeyou will wonder how without us society has ever dragged itself even this distanceso wretchedly small compared with what it might have beenon its painful earthly pilgrimage that is what i should like above all to pour into the ears of those who still hold out who stiffen their necks and repeat hard empty formulas which are as dry as a broken gourd that has been flung away in the desert i would take them by their selfishness their indolence their interest i am not here to recriminate nor to deepen the gulf that already yawns between the sexes and i dont accept the doctrine that they are natural enemies since my plea is for a union far more intimateprovided it be equalthan any that the sages and philosophers of former times have ever dreamed of therefore i shall not touch upon the subject of mens being most easily influenced by considerations of what is most agreeable and profitable for them i shall simply assume that they are so influenced and i shall say to them that our cause would long ago have been gained if their vision were not so dim so veiled even in matters in which their own interests are concerned if they had the same quick sight as women if they had the intelligence of the heart the world would be very different now and i assure you that half the bitterness of our lot is to see so clearly and not to be able to do good gentlemen all if i could make you believe how much brighter and fairer and sweeter the garden of life would be for you if you would only let us help you to keep it in order you would like so much better to walk there and you would find grass and trees and flowers that would make you think you were in eden that is what i should like to press home to each of you personally individuallyto give him the vision of the world as it hangs perpetually before me redeemed transfigured by a new moral tone there would be generosity tenderness sympathy where there is now only brute force and sordid rivalry but you really do strike me as stupid even about your own welfare some of you say that we have already all the influence we can possibly require and talk as if we ought to be grateful that we are allowed even to breathe pray who shall judge what we require if not we ourselves we require simply freedom we require the lid to be taken off the box in which we have been kept for centuries you say its a very comfortable cozy convenient box with nice glass sides so that we can see out and that all thats wanted is to give another quiet turn to the key that is very easily answered good gentlemen you have never been in the box and you havent the least idea how it feels  the historian who has gathered these documents together does not deem it necessary to give a larger specimen of verenas eloquence especially as basil ransom through whose ears we are listening to it arrived at this point at a definite conclusion he had taken her measure as a public speaker judged her importance in the field of discussion the cause of reform her speech in itself had about the value of a pretty essay committed to memory and delivered by a bright girl at an academy it was vague thin rambling a tissue of generalities that glittered agreeably enough in mrs burrages veiled lamplight from any serious point of view it was neither worth answering nor worth considering and basil ransom made his reflexions on the crazy character of the age in which such a performance as that was treated as an intellectual effort a contribution to a question he asked himself what either he or any one else would think of it if miss chancelloror even mrs lunahad been on the platform instead of the actual declaimer nevertheless its importance was high and consisted precisely in part of the fact that the voice was not the voice of olive or of adeline its importance was that verena was unspeakably attractive and this was all the greater for him in the light of the fact which quietly dawned upon him as he stood there that he was falling in love with her it had tapped at his heart for recognition and before he could hesitate or challenge the door had sprung open and the mansion was illuminated he gave no outward sign he stood gazing as at a picture but the room wavered before his eyes even verenas figure danced a little this did not make the sequel of her discourse more clear to him her meaning faded again into the agreeable vague and he simply felt her presence tasted her voice yet the act of reflexion was not suspended he found himself rejoicing that she was so weak in argument so inevitably verbose the idea that she was brilliant that she counted as a factor only because the public mind was in a muddle was not an humiliation but a delight to him it was a proof that her apostleship was all nonsense the most passing of fashions the veriest of delusions and that she was meant for something divinely differentfor privacy for him for love he took no measure of the duration of her talk he only knew when it was over and succeeded by a clapping of hands an immense buzz of voices and shuffling of chairs that it had been capitally bad and that her personal success wrapping it about with a glamour like the silver mist that surrounds a fountain was such as to prevent its badness from being a cause of mortification to her lover the companysuch of it as did not immediately close together around verenafiled away into the other rooms bore him in its current into the neighbourhood of a table spread for supper where he looked for signs of the sumptuary law mentioned to him by mrs luna it appeared to be embodied mainly in the glitter of crystal and silver and the fresh tints of mysterious viands and jellies which looked desirable in the soft circle projected by lacefringed lamps he heard the popping of corks he felt a pressure of elbows a thickening of the crowd perceived that he was glowered at squeezed against the table by contending gentlemen who observed that he usurped space was neither feeding himself nor helping others to feed he had lost sight of verena she had been borne away in clouds of compliment but he found himself thinkingalmost paternallythat she must be hungry after so much chatter and he hoped some one was getting her something to eat after a moment just as he was edging away for his own opportunity to sup much better than usual was not what was uppermost in his mind this little vision was suddenly embodiedembodied by the appearance of miss tarrant who faced him in the press attached to the arm of a young man now recognisable to him as the son of the housethe smiling fragrant youth who an hour before had interrupted his colloquy with olive he was leading her to the table while people made way for them covering verena with gratulations of word and look ransom could see that according to a phrase which came back to him just then oddly out of some novel or poem he had read of old she was the cynosure of every eye she looked beautiful and they were a beautiful couple as soon as she saw him she put out her left hand to himthe other was in mr burrages armand said well dont you think its all true  no not a word of it ransom answered with a kind of joyous sincerity but it doesnt make any difference  oh it makes a great deal of difference to me verena cried  i mean to me i dont care in the least whether i agree with you ransom said looking askance at young mr burrage who had detached himself and was getting something for verena to eat  ah well if you are so indifferent  its not because im indifferent his eyes came back to her own the expression of which had changed before they quitted them she began to complain to her companion who brought her something very dainty on a plate that mr ransom was standing out that he was about the hardest subject she had encountered yet henry burrage smiled upon ransom in a way that was meant to show he remembered having already spoken to him while the mississippian said to himself that there was nothing on the face of it to make it strange there should be between these fair successful young persons some such question of love or marriage as mrs luna had tattled about mr burrage was successful he could see that in the turn of an eye not perhaps as having a commanding intellect or a very strong character but as being rich polite handsome happy amiable and as wearing a splendid camellia in his buttonhole and that he at any rate thought verena had succeeded was proved by the casual civil tone and the contented distraction of eye with which he exclaimed you dont mean to say you were not moved by that its my opinion that miss tarrant will carry everything before her he was so pleased himself and so safe in his conviction that it didnt matter to him what any one else thought which was after all just basil ransoms own state of mind  oh i didnt say i wasnt moved the mississippian remarked  moved the wrong way said verena never mind youll be left behind  if i am you will come back to console me  back i shall never come back the girl replied gaily  youll be the very first ransom went on feeling himself now and as if by a sudden clearing up of his spiritual atmosphere no longer in the vein for making the concessions of chivalry and yet conscious that his words were an expression of homage  oh i call that presumptuous mr burrage exclaimed turning away to get a glass of water for verena who had refused to accept champagne mentioning that she had never drunk any in her life and that she associated a kind of iniquity with it olive had no wine in her house not that verena gave this explanation but her fathers old madeira and a little claret of the former of which liquors basil ransom had highly approved the day he dined with her  does he believe in all those lunacies he inquired knowing perfectly what to think about the charge of presumption brought by mr burrage  why hes crazy about our movement verena responded hes one of my most gratifying converts  and dont you despise him for it  despise him why you seem to think i swing round pretty often  well i have an idea that i shall see you swing round yet ransom remarked in a tone in which it would have appeared to henry burrage had he heard these words that presumption was pushed to fatuity  on verena however they produced no impression that prevented her from saying simply without the least rancour well if you expect to draw me back five hundred years i hope you wont tell miss birdseye and as ransom did not seize immediately the reason of her allusion she went on you know she is convinced it will be just the other way i went to see her after you had been at cambridgealmost immediately  darling old ladyi hope shes well the young man said  well shes tremendously interested  shes always interested in something isnt she  well this time its in our relations yours and mine verena replied in a tone in which only verena could say a thing like that you ought to see how she throws herself into them she is sure it will all work round for your good  all what miss tarrant ransom asked  well what i told her she is sure you are going to become one of our leaders that you are very gifted for treating great questions and acting on masses of people that you will become quite enthusiastic about our uprising and that when you go up to the top as one of our champions it will all have been through me  ransom stood there smiling at her the dusky glow in his eyes expressed a softness representing no prevision of such laurels but which testified none the less to verenas influence and what you want is that i shouldnt undeceive her  well i dont want you to be hypocriticalif you shouldnt take our side but i do think that it would be sweet if the dear old thing could just cling to her illusion she wont live so very long probably she told me the other day she was ready for her final rest so it wouldnt interfere much with your freedom she feels quite romantic about ityour being a southerner and all and not naturally in sympathy with boston ideas and your meeting her that way in the street and making yourself known to her she wont believe but what i shall move you  dont fear miss tarrant she shall be satisfied ransom said with a laugh which he could see she but partially understood he was prevented from making his meaning more clear by the return of mr burrage bringing not only verenas glass of water but a smoothfaced rosy smiling old gentleman who had a velvet waistcoat and thin white hair brushed effectively and whom he introduced to verena under a name which ransom recognised as that of a rich and venerable citizen conspicuous for his public spirit and his large almsgiving ransom had lived long enough in new york to know that a request from this ancient worthy to be made known to miss tarrant would mark her for the approval of the respectable stamp her as a success of no vulgar sort and as he turned away a faint inaudible sigh passed his lips dictated by the sense that he himself belonged to a terribly small and obscure minority he turned away because as we know he had been taught that a gentleman talking to a lady must always do that when a new gentleman is presented though he observed looking back after a minute that young mr burrage evidently had no intention of abdicating in favour of the eminent philanthropist he thought he had better go home he didnt know what might happen at such a party as that nor when the proceedings might be supposed to terminate but after considering it a minute he dismissed the idea that there was a chance of verenas speaking again if he was a little vague about this however there was no doubt in his mind as to the obligation he was under to take leave first of mrs burrage he wished he knew where verena was staying he wanted to see her alone not in a supperroom crowded with millionaires as he looked about for the hostess it occurred to him that she would know and that if he were able to quench a certain shyness sufficiently to ask her she would tell him having satisfied himself presently that she was not in the supperroom he made his way back to the parlours where the company now was much diminished he looked again into the musicroom tenanted only by halfadozen couples who were cultivating privacy among the empty chairs and here he perceived mrs burrage sitting in conversation with olive chancellor the latter apparently had not moved from her place before the deserted scene of verenas triumph his search had been so little for olive that at the sight of her he faltered a moment then he pulled himself together advancing with a consciousness of the mississippi manner he felt olives eyes receiving him she looked at him as if it was just the hope that she shouldnt meet him again that had made her remain where she was mrs burrage got up as he bade her goodnight and olive followed her example  so glad you were able to come wonderful creature isnt she she can do anything she wants  these words from the elder lady ransom received at first with a reserve which as he trusted suggested extreme respect and it was a fact that his silence had a kind of southern solemnity in it then he said in a tone equally expressive of great deliberation  yes madam i think i never was present at an exhibition an entertainment of any kind which held me more completely under the charm  delighted you liked it i didnt know what in the world to have and this has proved an inspirationfor me as well as for miss tarrant miss chancellor has been telling me how they have worked together its really quite beautiful miss chancellor is miss tarrants great friend and colleague miss tarrant assures me that she couldnt do anything without her after which explanation turning to olive mrs burrage murmured let me introduce mr  introduce mr   but she had forgotten poor ransoms name forgotten who had asked her for a card for him and perceiving it he came to her rescue with the observation that he was a kind of cousin of miss olives if she didnt repudiate him and that he knew what a tremendous partnership existed between the two young ladies when i applauded i was applauding the firmthat is you too he said smiling to his kinswoman  your applause i confess i dont understand it olive replied with much promptitude  well to tell the truth i didnt myself  oh yes of course i know thats whythats why and this further speech of mrs burrages in reference to the relationship between the young man and her companion faded also into vagueness she had been on the point of saying it was the reason why he was in her house but she had bethought herself in time that this ought to pass as a matter of course basil ransom could see she was a woman who could carry off an awkwardness like that and he considered her with a sense of her importance she had a brisk familiar slightly impatient way and if she had not spoken so fast and had more of the softness of the southern matron she would have reminded him of a certain type of woman he had seen of old before the changes in his own part of the worldthe clever capable hospitable proprietress widowed or unmarried of a big plantation carried on by herself if you are her cousin do take miss chancellor to have some supperinstead of going away she went on with her infelicitous readiness  at this olive instantly seated herself again  i am much obliged to you i never touch supper i shall not leave this roomi like it  then let me send you somethingor let mr  your cousin remain with you  olive looked at mrs burrage with a strange beseechingness i am very tired i must rest these occasions leave me exhausted  ah yes i can imagine that well then you shall be quite quieti shall come back to you and with a smile of farewell for basil ransom mrs burrage moved away  basil lingered a moment though he saw that olive wished to get rid of him i wont disturb you further than to ask you a single question he said where are you staying i want to come and see miss tarrant i dont say i want to come and see you because i have an idea that it would give you no pleasure it had occurred to him that he might obtain their address from mrs lunahe only knew vaguely it was tenth street much as he had displeased her she couldnt refuse him that but suddenly the greater simplicity and frankness of applying directly to olive even at the risk of appearing to brave her recommended itself he couldnt of course call upon verena without her knowing it and she might as well make her protest since he proposed to pay no heed to it sooner as later he had seen nothing personally of their life together but it had come over him that what miss chancellor most disliked in him had she not on the very threshold of their acquaintance had a sort of mystical foreboding of it was the possibility that he would interfere it was quite on the cards that he might yet it was decent all the same to ask her rather than any one else it was better that his interference should be accompanied with all the forms of chivalry  olive took no notice of his remark as to how she herself might be affected by his visit but she asked in a moment why he should think it necessary to call on miss tarrant you know you are not in sympathy she added in a tone which contained a really touching element of entreaty that he would not even pretend to prove he was  i know not whether basil was touched but he said with every appearance of a conciliatory purposei wish to thank her for all the interesting information she has given me this evening  if you think it generous to come and scoff at her of course she has no defence you will be glad to know that  dear miss chancellor if you are not a defencea battery of many guns ransom exclaimed  well she at least is not mine olive returned springing to her feet she looked round her as if she were really pressed too hard panting like a hunted creature  your defence is your certain immunity from attack perhaps if you wont tell me where you are staying you will kindly ask miss tarrant herself to do so would she send me a word on a card  we are in west tenth street olive said and she gave the number of course you are free to come  of course i am why shouldnt i be but i am greatly obliged to you for the information i will ask her to come out so that you wont see us and he turned away with the sense that it was really insufferable her attempt always to give him the air of being in the wrong if that was the kind of spirit in which women were going to act when they had more power     xxix   mrs luna was early in the field the next day and her sister wondered to what she owed the honour of a visit from her at eleven oclock in the morning she very soon saw when adeline asked her whether it had been she who procured for basil ransom an invitation to mrs burrages  mewhy in the world should it have been me olive asked feeling something of a pang at the implication that it had not been adeline as she supposed  i didnt knowbut you took him up so  why adeline luna when did i ever miss chancellor exclaimed staring and intensely grave  you dont mean to say you have forgotten how you brought him on to see you a year and a half ago  i didnt bring him oni said if he happened to be there  yes i remember how it was he did happen and then you happened to hate him and tried to get out of it  miss chancellor saw i say why adeline had come to her at the hour she knew she was always writing letters after having given her all the attention that was necessary the day before she had come simply to make herself disagreeable as olive knew of old the spirit sometimes moved her irresistibly to do it seemed to her that adeline had been disagreeable enough in not having beguiled basil ransom into a marriage according to that memorable calculation of probabilities in which she indulged with a licence that she scarcely liked definitely to recall when the pair made acquaintance under her eyes in charles street and mrs luna seemed to take to him as much as she herself did little she would gladly have accepted him as a brotherinlaw for the harm such a relation could do one was limited and definite whereas in his general capacity of being at large in her life the ability of the young mississippian to injure her seemed somehow immense i wrote to himthat timefor a perfectly definite reason she said i thought mother would have liked us to know him but it was a mistake  how do you know it was a mistake mother would have liked him i daresay  i mean my acting as i did it was a theory of duty which i allowed to press me too much i always do duty should be obvious one shouldnt hunt round for it  was it very obvious when it brought you on here asked mrs luna who was distinctly out of humour  olive looked for a moment at the toe of her shoe i had an idea that you would have married him by this time she presently remarked  marry him yourself my dear what put such an idea into your head  you wrote to me at first so much about him you told me he was tremendously attentive and that you liked him  his state of mind is one thing and mine is another how can i marry every man that hangs about methat dogs my footsteps i might as well become a mormon at once mrs luna delivered herself of this argument with a certain charitable air as if her sister could not be expected to understand such a situation by her own light  olive waived the discussion and simply said i took for granted you had got him the invitation  i my dear that would be quite at variance with my attitude of discouragement  then she simply sent it herself  whom do you mean by she  mrs burrage of course  i thought that you might mean verena said mrs luna casually  verenato him why in the world and olive gave the cold glare with which her sister was familiar  why in the world notsince she knows him  she had seen him twice in her life before last night when she met him for the third time and spoke to him  did she tell you that  she tells me everything  are you very sure  adeline luna what do you mean miss chancellor murmured  are you very sure that last night was only the third time mrs luna went on  olive threw back her head and swept her sister from her bonnet to her lowest flounce you have no right to hint at such a thing as that unless you know  oh i knowi know at any rate more than you do and then mrs luna sitting with her sister much withdrawn in one of the windows of the big hot faded parlour of the boardinghouse in tenth street where there was a rug before the chimney representing a newfoundland dog saving a child from drowning and a row of chromolithographs on the walls imparted to her the impression she had received the evening beforethe impression of basil ransoms keen curiosity about verena tarrant verena must have asked mrs burrage to send him a card and asked it without mentioning the fact to olivefor wouldnt olive certainly have remembered it it was no use her saying that mrs burrage might have sent it of her own movement because she wasnt aware of his existence and why should she be basil ransom himself had told her he didnt know mrs burrage mrs luna knew whom he knew and whom he didnt or at least the sort of people and they were not the sort that belonged to the wednesday club that was one reason why she didnt care about him for any intimate relationthat he didnt seem to have any taste for making nice friends olive would know what her taste was in this respect though it wasnt that young womans own any more than his it was positive that the suggestion about the card could only have come from verena at any rate olive could easily ask or if she was afraid of her telling a fib she could ask mrs burrage it was true mrs burrage might have been put on her guard by verena and would perhaps invent some other account of the matter therefore olive had better just believe what she believed that verena had secured his presence at the party and had had private reasons for doing so it is to be feared that ransoms remark to mrs luna the night before about her having lost her head was near to the mark for if she had not been blinded by her rancour she would have guessed the horror with which she inspired her sister when she spoke in that offhand way of verenas lying and mrs burrages lying did people lie like that in mrs lunas set it was olives plan of life not to lie and attributing a similar disposition to people she liked it was impossible for her to believe that verena had had the intention of deceiving her mrs luna in a calmer hour might also have divined that olive would make her private comments on the strange story of basil ransoms having made up to verena out of pique at adelines rebuff for this was the account of the matter that she now offered to miss chancellor olive did two things she listened intently and eagerly judging there was distinct danger in the air which however she had not wanted mrs luna to tell her having perceived it for herself the night before and she saw that poor adeline was fabricating fearfully that the rebuff was altogether an invention mr ransom was evidently preoccupied with verena but he had not needed mrs lunas cruelty to make him so so olive maintained an attitude of great reserve she did not take upon herself to announce that her own version was that adeline for reasons absolutely imperceptible to others had tried to catch basil ransom had failed in her attempt and furious at seeing verena preferred to a person of her importance olive remembered the spretae injuria formae now wished to do both him and the girl an ill turn this would be accomplished if she could induce olive to interfere miss chancellor was conscious of an abundant readiness to interfere but it was not because she cared for adelines mortification i am not sure even that she did not think her fiasco but another illustration of her sisters general uselessness and rather despise her for it being perfectly able at once to hold that nothing is baser than the effort to entrap a man and to think it very ignoble to have to renounce it because you cant olive kept these reflexions to herself but she went so far as to say to her sister that she didnt see where the pique came in how could it hurt adeline that he should turn his attention to verena what was verena to her  why olive chancellor how can you ask mrs luna boldly responded isnt verena everything to you and arent you everything to me and wouldnt an attempta successful oneto take verena away from you knock you up fearfully and shouldnt i suffer as you know i suffer by sympathy  i have said that it was miss chancellors plan of life not to lie but such a plan was compatible with a kind of consideration for the truth which led her to shrink from producing it on poor occasions so she didnt say dear me adeline what humbug you know you hate verena and would be very glad if she were drowned she only said well i see but its very roundabout what she did see was that mrs luna was eager to help her to stop off basil ransom from making head as the phrase was and the fact that her motive was spite and not tenderness for the bostonians would not make her assistance less welcome if the danger were real she herself had a nervous dread but she had that about everything still adeline had perhaps seen something and what in the world did she mean by her reference to verenas having had secret meetings when pressed on this point mrs luna could only say that she didnt pretend to give definite information and she wasnt a spy anyway but that the night before he had positively flaunted in her face his admiration for the girl his enthusiasm for her way of standing up there of course he hated her ideas but he was quite conceited enough to think she would give them up perhaps it was all directed at heras if she cared it would depend a good deal on the girl herself certainly if there was any likelihood of verenas being affected she should advise olive to look out she knew best what to do it was only adelines duty to give her the benefit of her own impression whether she was thanked for it or not she only wished to put her on her guard and it was just like olive to receive such information so coldly she was the most disappointing woman she knew  miss chancellors coldness was not diminished by this rebuke for it had come over her that after all she had never opened herself at that rate to adeline had never let her see the real intensity of her desire to keep the sort of danger there was now a question of away from verena had given her no warrant for regarding her as her friends keeper so that she was taken aback by the flatness of mrs lunas assumption that she was ready to enter into a conspiracy to circumvent and frustrate the girl olive put on all her majesty to dispel this impression and if she could not help being aware that she made mrs luna still angrier on the whole than at first she felt that she would much rather disappoint her than give herself away to herespecially as she was intensely eager to profit by her warning     xxx   mrs luna would have been still less satisfied with the manner in which olive received her proffered assistance had she known how many confidences that reticent young woman might have made her in return olives whole life now was a matter for whispered communications she felt this herself as she sought the privacy of her own apartment after her interview with her sister she had for the moment time to think verena having gone out with mr burrage who had made an appointment the night before to call for her to drive at that early hour they had other engagements in the afternoonthe principal of which was to meet a group of earnest people at the house of one of the great local promoters olive would whisk verena off to these appointments directly after lunch she flattered herself that she could arrange matters so that there would not be half an hour in the day during which basil ransom complacently calling would find the bostonians in the house she had had this well in mind when at mrs burrages she was driven to give him their address and she had had it also in mind that she would ask verena as a special favour to accompany her back to boston on the next day but one which was the morning of the morrow there had been considerable talk of her staying a few days with mrs burragestaying on after her own departure but verena backed out of it spontaneously seeing how the idea worried her friend olive had accepted the sacrifice and their visit to new york was now cut down in intention to four days one of which the moment she perceived whither basil ransom was tending miss chancellor promised herself also to suppress she had not mentioned that to verena yet she hesitated a little having a slightly bad conscience about the concessions she had already obtained from her friend verena made such concessions with a generosity which caused ones heart to ache for admiration even while one asked for them and never once had olive known her to demand the smallest credit for any virtue she showed in this way or to bargain for an instant about any effort she made to oblige she had been delighted with the idea of spending a week under mrs burrages roof she had said too that she believed her mother would die happy not that there was the least prospect of mrs tarrants dying if she could hear of her having such an experience as that and yet perceiving how solemn olive looked about it how she blanched and brooded at the prospect she had offered to give it up with a smile sweeter if possible than any that had ever sat in her eyes olive knew what that meant for her knew what a power of enjoyment she still had in spite of the tension of their common purpose their vital work which had now as they equally felt passed into the stage of realisation of fruition and that is why her conscience rather pricked her for consenting to this further act of renunciation especially as their position seemed really so secure on the part of one who had already given herself away so sublimely  secure as their position might be olive called herself a blind idiot for having in spite of all her first shrinkings agreed to bring verena to new york verena had jumped at the invitation the very unexpectedness of which on mrs burrages partit was such an odd idea to have come to a mere worldlingcarried a kind of persuasion with it olives immediate sentiment had been an instinctive general fear but later she had dismissed that as unworthy she had decided and such a decision was nothing new that where their mission was concerned they ought to face everything such an opportunity would contribute too much to verenas reputation and authority to justify a refusal at the bidding of apprehensions which were after all only vague olives specific terrors and dangers had by this time very much blown over basil ransom had given no sign of life for ages and henry burrage had certainly got his quietus before they went to europe if it had occurred to his mother that she might convert verena into the animating principle of a big soiree she was at least acting in good faith for it could be no more her wish today that he should marry selah tarrants daughter than it was her wish a year before and then they should do some good to the benighted the most benighted the fashionable benighted they should perhaps make them furiousthere was always some good in that lastly olive was conscious of a personal temptation in the matter she was not insensible to the pleasure of appearing in a distinguished new york circle as a representative woman an important bostonian the prompter colleague associate of one of the most original girls of the time basil ransom was the person she had least expected to meet at mrs burrages it had been her belief that they might easily spend four days in a city of more than a million of inhabitants without that disagreeable accident but it had occurred nothing was wanting to make it seem serious and setting her teeth she shook herself morally hard for having fallen into the trap of fate well she would scramble out with only a scare probably henry burrage was very attentive but somehow she didnt fear him now and it was only natural he should feel that he couldnt be polite enough after they had consented to be exploited in that worldly way by his mother the other danger was the worst the palpitation of her strange dread the night of miss birdseyes party came back to her mr burrage seemed indeed a protection she reflected with relief that it had been arranged that after taking verena to drive in the park and see the museum of art in the morning they should in the evening dine with him at delmonicos he was to invite another gentleman and go afterwards to the german opera olive had kept all this to herself as i have said revealing to her sister neither the vividness of her prevision that basil ransom would look blank when he came down to tenth street and learned they had flitted nor the eagerness of her desire just to find herself once more in the boston train it had been only this prevision that sustained her when she gave mr ransom their number  verena came to her room shortly before luncheon to let her know she had returned and while they sat there waiting to stop their ears when the gong announcing the repast was beaten at the foot of the stairs by a negro in a white jacket she narrated to her friend her adventures with mr burrageexpatiated on the beauty of the park the splendour and interest of the museum the wonder of the young mans acquaintance with everything it contained the swiftness of his horses the softness of his english cart the pleasure of rolling at that pace over roads as firm as marble the entertainment he promised them for the evening olive listened in serious silence she saw verena was quite carried away of course she hadnt gone so far with her without knowing that phase  did mr burrage try to make love to you miss chancellor inquired at last without a smile  verena had taken off her hat to arrange her feather and as she placed it on her head again her uplifted arms making a frame for her face she said yes i suppose it was meant for love  olive waited for her to tell more to tell how she had treated him kept him in his place made him feel that that question was over long ago but as verena gave her no further information she did not insist conscious as she always was that in such a relation as theirs there should be a great respect on either side for the liberty of each she had never yet infringed on verenas and of course she wouldnt begin now moreover with the request that she meant presently to make of her she felt that she must be discreet she wondered whether henry burrage were really going to begin again whether his mother had only been acting in his interest in getting them to come on certainly the bright spot in such a prospect was that if she listened to him she couldnt listen to basil ransom and he had told olive herself last night when he put them into their carriage that he hoped to prove to her yet that he had come round to her gospel but the old sickness stole upon her again the faintness of discouragement as she asked herself why in the name of pity verena should listen to any one at all but olive chancellor again it came over her when she saw the brightness the happy look the girl brought back as it had done in the earlier months that the great trouble was that weak spot of verenas that sole infirmity and subtle flaw which she had expressed to her very soon after they began to live together in saying she remembered it through the ineffaceable impression made by her friends avowal ill tell you what is the matter with youyou dont dislike men as a class verena had replied on this occasion well no i dont dislike them when they are pleasant as if organised atrociousness could ever be pleasant olive disliked them most when they were least unpleasant after a little at present she remarked referring to henry burrage it is not right of him not decent after your making him feel how while he was at cambridge he wearied you tormented you  oh i didnt show anything said verena gaily i am learning to dissimulate she added in a moment i suppose you have to as you go along i pretend not to notice  at this moment the gong sounded for luncheon and the two young women covered up their ears face to face verena with her quick smile olive with her pale patience when they could hear themselves speak the latter said abruptly  how did mrs burrage come to invite mr ransom to her party he told adeline he had never seen her before  oh i asked her to send him an invitationafter she had written to me to thank me when it was definitely settled we should come on she asked me in her letter if there were any friends of mine in the city to whom i should like her to send cards and i mentioned mr ransom  verena spoke without a single instants hesitation and the only sign of embarrassment she gave was that she got up from her chair passing in this manner a little out of olives scrutiny it was easy for her not to falter because she was glad of the chance she wanted to be very simple in all her relations with her friend and of course it was not simple so soon as she began to keep things back she could at any rate keep back as little as possible and she felt as if she were making up for a dereliction when she answered olives inquiry so promptly  you never told me of that miss chancellor remarked in a low tone  i didnt want to i know you dont like him and i thought it would give you pain yet i wanted him to be therei wanted him to hear  what does it matterwhy should you care about him  well because he is so awfully opposed  how do you know that verena  at this point verena began to hesitate it was not after all so easy to keep back only a little it appeared rather as if one must either tell everything or hide everything the former course had already presented itself to her as unduly harsh it was because it seemed so that she had ended by keeping the incident of basil ransoms visit to monadnoc place buried in unspoken in unspeakable considerations the only secret she had in the worldthe only thing that was all her own she was so glad to say what she could without betraying herself that it was only after she had spoken that she perceived there was a danger of olives pushing the inquiry to the point where to defend herself as it were she should be obliged to practise a positive deception and she was conscious at the same time that the moment her secret was threatened it became dearer to her she began to pray silently that olive might not push for it would be odious it would be impossible to defend herself by a lie meanwhile however she had to answer and the way she answered was by exclaiming much more quickly than the reflexions i note might have appeared to permit well if you cant tell from his appearance hes the type of the reactionary  verena went to the toiletglass to see that she had put on her hat properly and olive slowly got up in the manner of a person not in the least eager for food let him react as he likesfor heavens sake dont mind him that was miss chancellors rejoinder and verena felt that it didnt say all that was in her mind she wished she would come down to luncheon for she at least was honestly hungry she even suspected olive had an idea she was afraid to express such distress it would bring with it well you know verena this isnt our real lifeit isnt our work olive went on  well no it isnt certainly said verena not pretending at first that she did not know what olive meant in a moment however she added do you refer to this social intercourse with mr burrage  not to that only then olive asked abruptly looking at her how did you know his address  his address  mr ransomsto enable mrs burrage to invite him  they stood for a moment interchanging a gaze it was in a letter i got from him  at these words there came into olives face an expression which made her companion cross over to her directly and take her by the hand but the tone was different from what verena expected when she said with cold surprise oh you are in correspondence it showed an immense effort of selfcontrol  he wrote to me oncei never told you verena rejoined smiling she felt that her friends strange uneasy eyes searched very far a little more and they would go to the very bottom well they might go if they would she didnt after all care so much about her secret as that for the moment however verena did not learn what olive had discovered inasmuch as she only remarked presently that it was really time to go down as they descended the staircase she put her arm into miss chancellors and perceived that she was trembling  of course there were plenty of people in new york interested in the uprising and olive had made appointments in advance which filled the whole afternoon everybody wanted to meet them and wanted everybody else to do so and verena saw they could easily have quite a vogue if they only chose to stay and work that vein very likely as olive said it wasnt their real life and people didnt seem to have such a grip of the movement as they had in boston but there was something in the air that carried one along and a sense of vastness and variety of the infinite possibilities of a great city whichverena hardly knew whether she ought to confess it to herselfmight in the end make up for the want of the boston earnestness certainly the people seemed very much alive and there was no other place where so many cheering reports could flow in owing to the number of electric feelers that stretched away everywhere the principal centre appeared to be mrs crouchers on fiftysixth street where there was an informal gathering of sympathisers who didnt seem as if they could forgive her when they learned that she had been speaking the night before in a circle in which none of them were acquainted certainly they were very different from the group she had addressed at mrs burrages and verena heaved a thin private sigh expressive of some helplessness as she thought what a big complicated world it was and how it evidently contained a little of everything there was a general demand that she should repeat her address in a more congenial atmosphere to which she replied that olive made her engagements for her and that as the address had been intended just to lead people on perhaps she would think mrs crouchers friends had reached a higher point she was as cautious as this because she saw that olive was now just straining to get out of the city she didnt want to say anything that would tie them when she felt her trembling that way before luncheon it made her quite sick to realise how much her friend was wrapped up in herhow terribly she would suffer from the least deviation after they had started for their round of engagements the very first thing verena spoke of in the carriage olive had taken one in her liberal way for the whole time was the fact that her correspondence with mr ransom as her friend had called it had consisted on his part of only one letter it was a very short one too it had come to her a little more than a month before olive knew she got letters from gentlemen she didnt see why she should attach such importance to this one miss chancellor was leaning back in the carriage very still very grave with her head against the cushioned surface only turning her eyes towards the girl  you attach importance yourself otherwise you would have told me  i knew you wouldnt like itbecause you dont like him  i dont think of him said olive hes nothing to me then she added suddenly have you noticed that i am afraid to face what i dont like  verena could not say that she had and yet it was not just on olives part to speak as if she were an easy person to tell such a thing to the way she lay there white and weak like a wounded creature sufficiently proved the contrary you have such a fearful power of suffering she replied in a moment  to this at first miss chancellor made no rejoinder but after a little she said in the same attitude yes you could make me  verena took her hand and held it awhile i never will till i have been through everything myself  you were not made to sufferyou were made to enjoy olive said in very much the same tone in which she had told her that what was the matter with her was that she didnt dislike men as a classa tone which implied that the contrary would have been much more natural and perhaps rather higher perhaps it would but verena was unable to rebut the charge she felt this as she looked out of the window of the carriage at the bright amusing city where the elements seemed so numerous the animation so immense the shops so brilliant the women so strikingly dressed and knew that these things quickened her curiosity all her pulses  well i suppose i mustnt presume on it she remarked glancing back at olive with her natural sweetness her uncontradicting grace  that young lady lifted her hand to her lipsheld it there a moment the movement seemed to say when you are so divinely docile how can i help the dread of losing you this idea however was unspoken and olive chancellors uttered words as the carriage rolled on were different  verena i dont understand why he wrote to you  he wrote to me because he likes me perhaps youll say you dont understand why he likes me the girl continued laughing he liked me the first time he saw me  oh that time olive murmured  and still more the second  did he tell you that in his letter miss chancellor inquired  yes my dear he told me that only he expressed it more gracefully verena was very happy to say that a written phrase of basil ransoms sufficiently justified her  it was my intuitionit was my foreboding olive exclaimed closing her eyes  i thought you said you didnt dislike him  it isnt dislikeits simple dread is that all there is between you  why olive chancellor what do you think verena asked feeling now distinctly like a coward five minutes afterwards she said to olive that if it would give her pleasure they would leave new york on the morrow without taking a fourth day and as soon as she had done so she felt better especially when she saw how gratefully olive looked at her for the concession how eagerly she rose to the offer in saying well if you do feel that it isnt our own lifeour very own it was with these words and others besides and with an unusually weak indefinite kiss as if she wished to protest that after all a single day didnt matter and yet accepted the sacrifice and was a little ashamed of itit was in this manner that the agreement as to an immediate retreat was sealed verena could not shut her eyes to the fact that for a month she had been less frank and if she wished to do penance this abbreviation of their pleasure in new york even if it made her almost completely miss basil ransom was easier than to tell olive just now that the letter was not all that there had been a long visit a talk and a walk besides which she had been covering up for ever so many weeks and of what consequence anyway was the missing was it such a pleasure to converse with a gentleman who only wanted to let you knowand why he should want it so much verena couldnt guessthat he thought you quite preposterous olive took her from place to place and she ended by forgetting everything but the present hour and the bigness and variety of new york and the entertainment of rolling about in a carriage with silk cushions and meeting new faces new expressions of curiosity and sympathy assurances that one was watched and followed mingled with this was a bright consciousness sufficient for the moment that one was moreover to dine at delmonicos and go to the german opera there was enough of the epicurean in verenas composition to make it easy for her in certain conditions to live only for the hour     xxxi   when she returned with her companion to the establishment in tenth street she saw two notes lying on the table in the hall one of which she perceived to be addressed to miss chancellor the other to herself the hand was different but she recognised both olive was behind her on the steps talking to the coachman about sending another carriage for them in half an hour they had left themselves but just time to dress so that she simply possessed herself of her own note and ascended to her room as she did so she felt that all the while she had known it would be there and was conscious of a kind of treachery an unfriendly wilfulness in not being more prepared for it if she could roll about new york the whole afternoon and forget that there might be difficulties ahead that didnt alter the fact that there were difficulties and that they might even become considerablemight not be settled by her simply going back to boston half an hour later as she drove up the fifth avenue with olive there seemed to be so much crowded into that one day smoothing her light gloves wishing her fan were a little nicer and proving by the answering familiar brightness with which she looked out on the lamplighted streets that whatever theory might be entertained as to the genesis of her talent and her personal nature the blood of the lecturegoing nightwalking tarrants did distinctly flow in her veins as the pair proceeded i say to the celebrated restaurant at the door of which mr burrage had promised to be in vigilant expectancy of their carriage verena found a sufficiently gay and natural tone of voice for remarking to her friend that mr ransom had called upon her while they were out and had left a note in which there were many compliments for miss chancellor  thats wholly your own affair my dear olive replied with a melancholy sigh gazing down the vista of fourteenth street which they happened just then to be traversing with much agitation toward the queer barrier of the elevated railway  it was nothing new to verena that if the great striving of olives life was for justice she yet sometimes failed to arrive at it in particular cases and she reflected that it was rather late for her to say like that that basil ransoms letters were only his correspondents business had not his kinswoman quite made the subject her own during their drive that afternoon verena determined now that her companion should hear all there was to be heard about the letter asking herself whether if she told her at present more than she cared to know it wouldnt make up for her hitherto having told her less he brought it with him written in case i should be out he wants to see me tomorrowhe says he has ever so much to say to me he proposes an hoursays he hopes it wont be inconvenient for me to see him about eleven in the morning thinks i may have no other engagement so early as that of course our return to boston settles it verena added with serenity  miss chancellor said nothing for a moment then she replied yes unless you invite him to come on with you in the train  why olive how bitter you are verena exclaimed in genuine surprise  olive could not justify her bitterness by saying that her companion had spoken as if she were disappointed because verena had not so she simply remarked i dont see what he can have to say to youthat would be worth your hearing  well of course its the other side he has got it on the brain said verena with a laugh which seemed to relegate the whole matter to the category of the unimportant  if we should stay would you see himat eleven oclock olive inquired  why do you ask thatwhen i have given it up  do you consider it such a tremendous sacrifice  no said verena goodnaturedly but i confess i am curious  curioushow do you mean  well to hear the other side  oh heaven olive chancellor murmured turning her face upon her  you must remember i have never heard it and verena smiled into her friends wan gaze  do you want to hear all the infamy that is in the world  no it isnt that but the more he should talk the better chance he would give me i guess i can meet him  life is too short leave him as he is  well verena went on there are many i havent cared to move at all whom i might have been more interested in than in him but to make him give in just at two or three pointsthat i should like better than anything i have done  you have no business to enter upon a contest that isnt equal and it wouldnt be with mr ransom  the inequality would be that i have right on my side  what is thatfor a man for what was their brutality given them but to make that up  i dont think hes brutal i should like to see said verena gaily  olives eyes lingered a little on her own then they turned away vaguely blindly out of the carriagewindow and verena made the reflexion that she looked strangely little like a person who was going to dine at delmonicos how terribly she worried about everything and how tragical was her nature how anxious suspicious exposed to subtle influences in their long intimacy verena had come to revere most of her friends peculiarities they were a proof of her depth and devotion and were so bound up with what was noble in her that she was rarely provoked to criticise them separately but at present suddenly olives earnestness began to appear as inharmonious with the scheme of the universe as if it had been a broken saw and she was positively glad she had not told her about basil ransoms appearance in monadnoc place if she worried so about what she knew how much would she not have worried about the rest verena had by this time made up her mind that her acquaintance with mr ransom was the most episodical most superficial most unimportant of all possible relations  olive chancellor watched henry burrage very closely that evening she had a special reason for doing so and her entertainment during the successive hours was derived much less from the delicate little feast over which this insinuating proselyte presided in the brilliant public room of the establishment where french waiters flitted about on deep carpets and parties at neighbouring tables excited curiosity and conjecture or even from the magnificent music of lohengrin than from a secret process of comparison and verification which shall presently be explained to the reader as some discredit has possibly been thrown upon her impartiality it is a pleasure to be able to say that on her return from the opera she took a step dictated by an earnest consideration of justiceof the promptness with which verena had told her of the note left by basil ransom in the afternoon she drew verena into her room with her the girl on the way back to tenth street had spoken only of wagners music of the singers the orchestra the immensity of the house her tremendous pleasure olive could see how fond she might become of new york where that kind of pleasure was so much more in the air  well mr burrage was certainly very kind to usno one could have been more thoughtful olive said and she coloured a little at the look with which verena greeted this tribute of appreciation from miss chancellor to a single gentleman  i am so glad you were struck with that because i do think we have been a little rough to him verenas we was angelic he was particularly attentive to you my dear he has got over me he looked at you so sweetly dearest olive if you marry him and miss tarrant who was in high spirits embraced her companion to check her own silliness  he wants you to stay there all the same they havent given that up olive remarked turning to a drawer out of which she took a letter  did he tell you that pray he said nothing more about it to me  when we came in this afternoon i found this note from mrs burrage you had better read it and she presented the document open to verena  the purpose of it was to say that mrs burrage could really not reconcile herself to the loss of verenas visit on which both she and her son had counted so much she was sure they would be able to make it as interesting to miss tarrant as it would be to themselves she mrs burrage moreover felt as if she hadnt heard half she wanted about miss tarrants views and there were so many more who were present at the address who had come to her that afternoon losing not a minute as miss chancellor could see to ask how in the world they too could learn morehow they could get at the fair speaker and question her about certain details she hoped so much therefore that even if the young ladies should be unable to alter their decision about the visit they might at least see their way to staying over long enough to allow her to arrange an informal meeting for some of these poor thirsty souls might she not at least talk over the question with miss chancellor she gave her notice that she would attack her on the subject of the visit too might she not see her on the morrow and might she ask of her the very great favour that the interview should be at mrs burrages own house she had something very particular to say to her as regards which perfect privacy was a great consideration and miss chancellor would doubtless recognise that this would be best secured under mrs burrages roof she would therefore send her carriage for miss chancellor at any hour that would be convenient to the latter she really thought much good might come from their having a satisfactory talk  verena read this epistle with much deliberation it seemed to her mysterious and confirmed the idea she had received the night beforethe idea that she had not got quite a correct impression of this clever worldly curious woman on the occasion of her visit to cambridge when they met her at her sons rooms as she gave the letter back to olive she said thats why he didnt seem to believe we are really leaving tomorrow he knows she had written that and he thinks it will keep us  well if i were to say it mayshould you think me too miserably changeful  verena stared with all her candour and it was so very queer that olive should now wish to linger that the sense of it for the moment almost covered the sense of its being pleasant but that came out after an instant and she said with great honesty you neednt drag me away for consistencys sake it would be absurd for me to pretend that i dont like being here  i think perhaps i ought to see her olive was very thoughtful  how lovely it must be to have a secret with mrs burrage verena exclaimed  it wont be a secret from you  dearest you neednt tell me unless you want verena went on thinking of her own unimparted knowledge  i thought it was our plan to divide everything it was certainly mine  ah dont talk about plans verena exclaimed rather ruefully you see if we are going to stay tomorrow how foolish it was to have any there is more in her letter than is expressed she added as olive appeared to be studying in her face the reasons for and against making this concession to mrs burrage and that was rather embarrassing  i thought it over all the eveningso that if now you will consent we will stay  darlingwhat a spirit you have got all through all those dear little dishesall through lohengrin as i havent thought it over at all you must settle it you know i am not difficult  and would you go and stay with mrs burrage after all if she should say anything to me that seems to make it desirable  verena broke into a laugh you know its not our real life  olive said nothing for a moment then she replied dont think i can forget that if i suggest a deviation its only because it sometimes seems to me that perhaps after all almost anything is better than the form reality may take with us this was slightly obscure as well as very melancholy and verena was relieved when her companion remarked in a moment you must think me strangely inconsequent for this gave her a chance to reply soothingly  why you dont suppose i expect you to keep always screwed up i will stay a week with mrs burrage or a fortnight or a month or anything you like she pursued anything it may seem to you best to tell her after you have seen her  do you leave it all to me you dont give me much help olive said  help to what  help to help you  i dont want any help i am quite strong enough verena cried gaily the next moment she inquired in an appeal half comical half touching my dear colleague why do you make me say such conceited things  and if you do stayjust even tomorrowshall you bevery much of the timewith mr ransom  as verena for the moment appeared ironicallyminded she might have found a fresh subject for hilarity in the tremulous tentative tone in which olive made this inquiry but it had not that effect it produced the first manifestation of impatiencethe first literally and the first note of reproachthat had occurred in the course of their remarkable intimacy the colour rose to verenas cheek and her eye for an instant looked moist  i dont know what you always think olive nor why you dont seem able to trust me you didnt from the first with gentlemen perhaps you were right theni dont say but surely it is very different now i dont think i ought to be suspected so much why have you a manner as if i had to be watched as if i wanted to run away with every man that speaks to me i should think i had proved how little i care i thought you had discovered by this time that i am serious that i have dedicated my life that there is something unspeakably dear to me but you begin again every timeyou dont do me justice i must take everything that comes i mustnt be afraid i thought we had agreed that we were to do our work in the midst of the world facing everything keeping straight on always taking hold and now that it all opens out so magnificently and victory is really sitting on our banners it is strange of you to doubt of me to suppose i am not more wedded to all our old dreams than ever i told you the first time i saw you that i could renounce and knowing better today perhaps what that means i am ready to say it again that i can that i will why olive chancellor verena cried panting a moment with her eloquence and with the rush of a culminating idea havent you discovered by this time that i have renounced  the habit of public speaking the training the practice in which she had been immersed enabled verena to unroll a coil of propositions dedicated even to a private interest with the most touching most cumulative effect olive was completely aware of this and she stilled herself while the girl uttered one soft pleading sentence after another into the same rapt attention she was in the habit of sending up from the benches of an auditorium she looked at verena fixedly felt that she was stirred to her depths that she was exquisitely passionate and sincere that she was a quivering spotless consecrated maiden that she really had renounced that they were both safe and that her own injustice and indelicacy had been great she came to her slowly took her in her arms and held her longgiving her a silent kiss from which verena knew that she believed her     xxxii   the hour that olive proposed to mrs burrage in a note sent early the next morning for the interview to which she consented to lend herself was the stroke of noon this period of the day being chosen in consequence of a prevision of many subsequent calls upon her time she remarked in her note that she did not wish any carriage to be sent for her and she surged and swayed up the fifth avenue on one of the convulsive clattering omnibuses which circulate in that thoroughfare one of her reasons for mentioning twelve oclock had been that she knew basil ransom was to call at tenth street at eleven and as she supposed he didnt intend to stay all day this would give her time to see him come and go it had been tacitly agreed between them the night before that verena was quite firm enough in her faith to submit to his visit and that such a course would be much more dignified than dodging it this understanding passed from one to the other during that dumb embrace which i have described as taking place before they separated for the night shortly before noon olive passing out of the house looked into the big sunny double parlour where in the morning with all the husbands absent for the day and all the wives and spinsters launched upon the town a young man desiring to hold a debate with a young lady might enjoy every advantage in the way of a clear field basil ransom was still there he and verena with the place to themselves were standing in the recess of a window their backs presented to the door if he had got up perhaps he was going and olive softly closing the door again waited a little in the hall ready to pass into the back part of the house if she should hear him coming out no sound however reached her ear apparently he did mean to stay all day and she should find him there on her return she left the house knowing they were looking at her from the window as she descended the steps but feeling she could not bear to see basil ransoms face as she walked averting her own towards the fifth avenue on the sunny side she was barely conscious of the loveliness of the day the perfect weather all suffused and tinted with spring which sometimes descends upon new york when the winds of march have been stilled she was given up only to the remembrance of that moment when she herself had stood at a window the second time he came to see her in boston and watched basil ransom pass out with adelinewith adeline who had seemed capable then of getting such a hold on him but had proved as ineffectual in this respect as she was in every other she recalled the vision she had allowed to dance before her as she saw the pair cross the street together laughing and talking and how it seemed to interpose itself against the fears which already thenso strangelyhaunted her now that she saw it so fruitlessand that verena moreover had turned out really so greatshe was rather ashamed of it she felt associated however remotely in the reasons which had made mrs luna tell her so many fibs the day before and there could be nothing elevating in that as for the other reasons why her fidgety sister had failed and mr ransom had held his own course naturally miss chancellor didnt like to think of them  if she had wondered what mrs burrage wished so particularly to talk about she waited some time for the clearingup of the mystery during this interval she sat in a remarkably pretty boudoir where there were flowers and faiences and little french pictures and watched her hostess revolve round the subject in circles the vagueness of which she tried to dissimulate olive believed she was a person who never could enjoy asking a favour especially of a votary of the new ideas and that was evidently what was coming she had asked one already but that had been handsomely paid for the note from mrs burrage which verena found awaiting her in tenth street on her arrival contained the largest cheque this young woman had ever received for an address the request that hung fire had reference to verena too of course and olive needed no prompting to feel that her friends being a young person who took money could not make mrs burrages present effort more agreeable to this taking of money for when it came to verena it was as if it came to her as well she herself was now completely inured money was a tremendous force and when one wanted to assault the wrong with every engine one was happy not to lack the sinews of war she liked her hostess better this morning than she had liked her before she had more than ever the air of taking all sorts of sentiments and views for granted between them which could only be flattering to olive so long as it was really mrs burrage who made each advance while her visitor sat watchful and motionless she had a light clever familiar way of traversing an immense distance with a very few words as when she remarked well then it is settled that she will come and will stay till she is tired  nothing of the kind had been settled but olive helped mrs burrage this time more than she knew by saying why do you want her to visit you mrs burrage why do you want her socially are you not aware that your son a year ago desired to marry her  my dear miss chancellor that is just what i wish to talk to you about i am aware of everything i dont believe you ever met any one who is aware of more things than i and olive had to believe this as mrs burrage held up smiling her intelligent proud goodnatured successful head i knew a year ago that my son was in love with your friend i know that he has been so ever since and that in consequence he would like to marry her today i daresay you dont like the idea of her marrying at all it would break up a friendship which is so full of interest olive wondered for a moment whether she had been going to say so full of profit for you this is why i hesitated but since you are willing to talk about it that is just what i want  i dont see what good it will do olive said  how can we tell till we try i never give a thing up till i have turned it over in every sense  it was mrs burrage however who did most of the talking olive only inserted from time to time an inquiry a protest a correction an ejaculation tinged with irony none of these things checked or diverted her hostess olive saw more and more that she wished to please her to win her over to smooth matters down to place them in a new and original light she was very clever and little by little olive said to herself absolutely unscrupulous but she didnt think she was clever enough for what she had undertaken this was neither more nor less in the first place than to persuade miss chancellor that she and her son were consumed with sympathy for the movement to which miss chancellor had dedicated her life but how could olive believe that when she saw the type to which mrs burrage belongeda type into which nature herself had inserted a face turned in the very opposite way from all earnest and improving things people like mrs burrage lived and fattened on abuses prejudices privileges on the petrified cruel fashions of the past it must be added however that if her hostess was a humbug olive had never met one who provoked her less she was such a brilliant genial artistic one with such a recklessness of perfidy such a willingness to bribe you if she couldnt deceive you she seemed to be offering olive all the kingdoms of the earth if she would only exert herself to bring about a state of feeling on verena tarrants part which would lead the girl to accept henry burrage  we know its youthe whole business that you can do what you please you could decide it tomorrow with a word  she had hesitated at first and spoken of her hesitation and it might have appeared that she would need all her courage to say to olive that way face to face that verena was in such subjection to her but she didnt look afraid she only looked as if it were an infinite pity miss chancellor couldnt understand what immense advantages and rewards there would be for her in striking an alliance with the house of burrage olive was so impressed with this so occupied even in wondering what these mystic benefits might be and whether after all there might not be a protection in them from something worse a fund of some sort that she and verena might convert to a large use setting aside the mother and son when once they had got what they had to giveshe was so arrested with the vague daze of this vision the sense of mrs burrages full hands her eagerness her thinking it worth while to flatter and conciliate whatever her pretexts and pretensions might be that she was almost insensible for the time to the strangeness of such a womans coming round to a positive desire for a connexion with the tarrants mrs burrage had indeed explained this partly by saying that her sons condition was wearing her out and that she would enter into anything that would make him happier make him better she was fonder of him than of the whole world beside and it was an anguish to her to see him yearning for miss tarrant only to lose her she made that charge about olives power in the matter in such a way that it seemed at the same time a tribute to her force of character  i dont know on what terms you suppose me to be with my friend olive returned with considerable majesty she will do exactly as she likes in such a case as the one you allude to she is absolutely free you speak as if i were her keeper  then mrs burrage explained that of course she didnt mean that miss chancellor exercised a conscious tyranny but only that verena had a boundless admiration for her saw through her eyes took the impress of all her opinions preferences she was sure that if olive would only take a favourable view of her son miss tarrant would instantly throw herself into it its very true that you may ask me added mrs burrage smiling how you can take a favourable view of a young man who wants to marry the very person in the world you want most to keep unmarried  this description of verena was of course perfectly correct but it was not agreeable to olive to have the fact in question so clearly perceived even by a person who expressed it with an air intimating that there was nothing in the world she couldnt understand  did your son know that you were going to speak to me about this olive asked rather coldly waiving the question of her influence on verena and the state in which she wished her to remain  oh yes poor dear boy we had a long talk yesterday and i told him i would do what i could for him do you remember the little visit i paid to cambridge last spring when i saw you at his rooms then it was i began to perceive how the wind was setting but yesterday we had a real éclaircissement i didnt like it at all at first i dont mind telling you that nownow that i am really enthusiastic about it when a girl is as charming as original as miss tarrant it doesnt in the least matter who she is she makes herself the standard by which you measure her she makes her own position and then miss tarrant has such a future mrs burrage added quickly as if that were the last thing to be overlooked the whole question has come up againthe feeling that henry tried to think dead or at least dying has revived through thei hardly know what to call it but i really may say the unexpectedly great effect of her appearance here she was really wonderful on wednesday evening prejudice conventionality every presumption there might be against her had to fall to the ground i expected a success but i didnt expect what you gave us mrs burrage went on smiling while olive noted her you in short my poor boy flamed up again and now i see that he will never again care for any girl as he cares for that one my dear miss chancellor jen ai pris mon parti and perhaps you know my way of doing that sort of thing i am not at all good at resigning myself but i am excellent at taking up a craze i havent renounced i have only changed sides for or against i must be a partisan dont you know that kind of nature henry has put the affair into my hands and you see i put it into yours do help me let us work together  this was a long explicit speech for mrs burrage who dealt usually in the cursory and allusive and she may very well have expected that miss chancellor would recognise its importance what olive did in fact was simply to inquire by way of rejoinder why did you ask us to come on  if mrs burrage hesitated now it was only for twenty seconds simply because we are so interested in your work  that surprises me said olive thoughtfully  i daresay you dont believe it but such a judgement is superficial i am sure we give proof in the offer we make mrs burrage remarked with a good deal of point there are plenty of girlswithout any views at allwho would be delighted to marry my son he is very clever and he has a large fortune add to that that hes an angel  that was very true and olive felt all the more that the attitude of these fortunate people for whom the world was so well arranged just as it was was very curious but as she sat there it came over her that the human spirit has many variations that the influence of the truth is great and that there are such things in life as happy surprises quite as well as disagreeable ones nothing certainly forced such people to fix their affections on the daughter of a healer it would be very clumsy to pick her out of her generation only for the purpose of frustrating her moreover her observation of their young host at delmonicos and in the spacious box at the academy of music where they had privacy and ease and murmured words could pass without making neighbours more given up to the stage turn their headsher consideration of henry burrages manner suggested to her that she had measured him rather scantily the year before that he was as much in love as the feebler passions of the age permitted for though miss chancellor believed in the amelioration of humanity she thought there was too much water in the blood of all of us that he prized verena for her rarity which was her genius her gift and would therefore have an interest in promoting it and that he was of so soft and fine a paste that his wife might do what she liked with him of course there would be the motherinlaw to count with but unless she was perjuring herself shamelessly mrs burrage really had the wish to project herself into the new atmosphere or at least to be generous personally so that oddly enough the fear that most glanced before olive was not that this high free matron slightly irritable with cleverness and at the same time goodnatured with prosperity would bully her sons bride but rather that she might take too fond a possession of her it was a fear which may be described as a presentiment of jealousy it occurred accordingly to miss chancellors quick conscience that possibly the proposal which presented itself in circumstances so complicated and anomalous was simply a magnificent chance an improvement on the very best even that she had dreamed of for verena it meant a large command of moneymuch larger than her own the association of a couple of clever people who simulated conviction very well whether they felt it or not and who had a hundred useful worldly ramifications and a kind of social pedestal from which she might really shine afar the conscience i have spoken of grew positively sick as it thought of having such a problem as that to consider such an ordeal to traverse in the presence of such a contingency the poor girl felt grim and helpless she could only vaguely wonder whether she were called upon in the name of duty to lend a hand to the torture of her own spirit  and if she should marry him how could i be sure thatafterwardsyou would care so much about the question which has all our thoughts hers and mine this inquiry evolved itself from olives rapid meditation but even to herself it seemed a little rough  mrs burrage took it admirably you think we are feigning an interest only to get hold of her thats not very nice of you miss chancellor but of course you have to be tremendously careful i assure you my son tells me he firmly believes your movement is the great question of the immediate future that it has entered into a new phase into what does he call it the domain of practical politics as for me you dont suppose i dont want everything we poor women can get or that i would refuse any privilege or advantage thats offered me i dont rant or rave about anything but i haveas i told you just nowmy own quiet way of being zealous if you had no worse partisan than i you would do very well my son has talked to me immensely about your ideas and even if i should enter into them only because he does i should do so quite enough you may say you dont see henry dangling about after a wife who gives public addresses but i am convinced that a great many things are coming to passvery soon toothat we dont see in advance henry is a gentleman to his fingertips and there is not a situation in which he will not conduct himself with tact  olive could see that they really wanted verena immensely and it was impossible for her to believe that if they were to get her they would not treat her well it came to her that they would even overindulge her flatter her spoil her she was perfectly capable for the moment of assuming that verena was susceptible of deterioration and that her own treatment of her had been discriminatingly severe she had a hundred protests objections replies her only embarrassment could be as to which she should use first  i think you have never seen doctor tarrant and his wife she remarked with a calmness which she felt to be very pregnant  you mean they are absolutely fearful my son has told me they are quite impossible and i am quite prepared for that do you ask how we should get on with them my dear young lady we should get on as you do  if olive had answers so had mrs burrage she had still an answer when her visitor taking up the supposition that it was in her power to dispose in any manner whatsoever of verena declared that she didnt know why mrs burrage addressed herself to her that miss tarrant was free as air that her future was in her own hands that such a matter as this was a kind of thing with which it could never occur to one to interfere dear miss chancellor we dont ask you to interfere the only thing we ask of you is simply not to interfere  and have you sent for me only for that  for that and for what i hinted at in my note that you would really exercise your influence with miss tarrant to induce her to come to us now for a week or two that is really after all the main thing i ask lend her to us here for a little while and we will take care of the rest that sounds conceitedbut she would have a good time  she doesnt live for that said olive  what i mean is that she should deliver an address every night mrs burrage returned smiling  i think you try to prove too much you do believethough you pretend you dontthat i control her actions and as far as possible her desires and that i am jealous of any other relations she may possibly form i can imagine that we may perhaps have that air though it only proves how little such an association as ours is understood and how superficial is stillolive felt that her still was really historicalthe interpretation of many of the elements in the activity of women how much the public conscience with regard to them needs to be educated your conviction with respect to my attitude being what i believe it to be miss chancellor went on i am surprised at your not perceiving how little it is in my interest to deliver mymy victim up to you  if we were at this moment to take in a single glance an inside view of mrs burrage a liberty we have not yet ventured on i suspect we should find that she was considerably exasperated at her visitors superior tone at seeing herself regarded by this dry shy obstinate provincial young woman as superficial if she liked verena very nearly as much as she tried to convince miss chancellor she was conscious of disliking miss chancellor more than she should probably ever be able to reveal to verena it was doubtless partly her irritation that found a voice as she said after a selfadministered pinch of caution not to say too much of course it would be absurd in us to assume that miss tarrant would find my son irresistible especially as she has already refused him but even if she should remain obdurate should you consider yourself quite safe as regards others  the manner in which miss chancellor rose from her chair on hearing these words showed her hostess that if she had wished to take a little revenge by frightening her the experiment was successful what others do you mean olive asked standing very straight and turning down her eyes as from a great height  mrs burragesince we have begun to look into her mind we may continue the processhad not meant any one in particular but a train of association was suddenly kindled in her thought by the flash of the girls resentment she remembered the gentleman who had come up to her in the musicroom after miss tarrants address while she was talking with olive and to whom that young lady had given so cold a welcome i dont mean any one in particular but for instance there is the young man to whom she asked me to send an invitation to my party and who looked to me like a possible admirer mrs burrage also got up then she stood a moment closer to her visitor dont you think its a good deal to expect that young pretty attractive clever charming as she is you should be able to keep her always to exclude other affections to cut off a whole side of life to defend her against dangersif you call them dangersto which every young woman who is not positively repulsive is exposed my dear young lady i wonder if i might give you three words of advice mrs burrage did not wait till olive had answered this inquiry she went on quickly with her air of knowing exactly what she wanted to say and feeling at the same time that good as it might be the manner of saying it like the manner of saying most other things was not worth troubling much about dont attempt the impossible you have got hold of a good thing dont spoil it by trying to stretch it too far if you dont take the better perhaps you will have to take the worse if its safety you want i should think she was much safer with my sonfor with us you know the worstthan as a possible prey to adventurers to exploiters or to people who once they had got hold of her would shut her up altogether  olive dropped her eyes she couldnt endure mrs burrages horrible expression of being near the mark her look of worldly cleverness of a confidence born of much experience she felt that nothing would be spared her that she should have to go to the end that this ordeal also must be faced and that in particular there was a detestable wisdom in her hostesss advice she was conscious however of no obligation to recognise it then and there she wanted to get off and even to carry mrs burrages sapient words along with herto hurry to some place where she might be alone and think i dont know why you have thought it right to send for me only to say this i take no interest whatever in your sonin his settling in life and she gathered her mantle more closely about her turning away  it is exceedingly kind of you to have come said mrs burrage imperturbably think of what i have said i am sure you wont feel that you have wasted your hour  i have a great many things to think of olive exclaimed insincerely for she knew that mrs burrages ideas would haunt her  and tell her that if she will make us the little visit all new york shall sit at her feet  that was what olive wanted and yet it seemed a mockery to hear mrs burrage say it miss chancellor retreated making no response even when her hostess declared again that she was under great obligations to her for coming when she reached the street she found she was deeply agitated but not with a sense of weakness she hurried along excited and dismayed feeling that her insufferable conscience was bristling like some irritated animal that a magnificent offer had really been made to verena and that there was no way for her to persuade herself she might be silent about it of course if verena should be tempted by the idea of being made so much of by the burrages the danger of basil ransom getting any kind of hold on her would cease to be pressing that was what was present to olive as she walked along and that was what made her nervous conscious only of this problem that had suddenly turned the bright day to greyness heedless of the sophisticatedlooking people who passed her on the wide fifth avenue pavement it had risen in her mind the day before planted first by mrs burrages note and then as we know she had vaguely entertained the conception asking verena whether she would make the visit if it were again to be pressed upon them it had been pressed certainly and the terms of the problem were now so much sharper that they seemed cruel what had been in her own mind was that if verena should appear to lend herself to the burrages basil ransom might be discouragedmight think that shabby and poor there was no chance for him as against people with every advantage of fortune and position she didnt see him relax his purpose so easily she knew she didnt believe he was of that pusillanimous fibre still it was a chance and any chance that might help her had been worth considering at present she saw it was a question not of verenas lending herself but of a positive gift or at least of a bargain in which the terms would be immensely liberal it would be impossible to use the burrages as a shelter on the assumption that they were not dangerous for they became dangerous from the moment they set up as sympathisers took the ground that what they offered the girl was simply a boundless opportunity it came back to olive again and again that this was and could only be fantastic and false but it was always possible that verena might not think it so might trust them all the way when miss chancellor had a pair of alternatives to consider a question of duty to study she put a kind of passion into itfelt above all that the matter must be settled that very hour before anything in life could go on it seemed to her at present that she couldnt reenter the house in tenth street without having decided first whether she might trust the burrages or not by trust them she meant trust them to fail in winning verena over while at the same time they put basil ransom on a false scent olive was able to say to herself that he probably wouldnt have the hardihood to push after her into those gilded saloons which in any event would be closed to him as soon as the mother and son should discover what he wanted she even asked herself whether verena would not be still better defended from the young southerner in new york amid complicated hospitalities than in boston with a cousin of the enemy she continued to walk down the fifth avenue without noticing the crossstreets and after a while became conscious that she was approaching washington square by this time she had also definitely reasoned it out that basil ransom and henry burrage could not both capture miss tarrant that therefore there could not be two dangers but only one that this was a good deal gained and that it behoved her to determine which peril had most reality in order that she might deal with that one only she held her way to the square which as all the world knows is of great extent and open to the encircling street the trees and grassplats had begun to bud and sprout the fountains plashed in the sunshine the children of the quarter both the dingier types from the south side who played games that required much chalking of the paved walks and much sprawling and crouching there under the feet of passers and the little curled and feathered people who drove their hoops under the eyes of french nursemaidsall the infant population filled the vernal air with small sounds which had a crude tender quality like the leaves and the thin herbage olive wandered through the place and ended by sitting down on one of the continuous benches it was a long time since she had done anything so vague so wasteful there were a dozen things which as she was staying over in new york she ought to do but she forgot them or if she thought of them felt that they were now of no moment she remained in her place an hour brooding tremulous turning over and over certain thoughts it seemed to her that she was face to face with a crisis of her destiny and that she must not shrink from seeing it exactly as it was before she rose to return to tenth street she had made up her mind that there was no menace so great as the menace of basil ransom she had accepted in thought any arrangement which would deliver her from that if the burrages were to take verena they would take her from olive immeasurably less than he would do it was from him from him they would take her most she walked back to her boardinghouse and the servant who admitted her said in answer to her inquiry as to whether verena were at home that miss tarrant had gone out with the gentleman who called in the morning and had not yet come in olive stood staring the clock in the hall marked three     xxxiii   come out with me miss tarrant come out with me do come out with me that was what basil ransom had been saying to verena when they stood where olive perceived them in the embrasure of the window it had of course taken considerable talk to lead up to this for the tone even more than the words indicated a large increase of intimacy verena was mindful of this when he spoke and it frightened her a little made her uneasy which was one of the reasons why she got up from her chair and went to the windowan inconsequent movement inasmuch as her wish was to impress upon him that it was impossible she should comply with his request it would have served this end much better for her to sit very firmly in her place he made her nervous and restless she was beginning to perceive that he produced a peculiar effect upon her certainly she had been out with him at home the very first time he called upon her but it seemed to her to make an important difference that she herself should then have proposed the walksimply because it was the easiest thing to do when a person came to see you in monadnoc place  they had gone out that time because she wanted to not because he did and then it was one thing for her to stroll with him round cambridge where she knew every step and had the confidence and freedom which came from being on her own ground and the pretext which was perfectly natural of wanting to show him the colleges and quite another thing to go wandering with him through the streets of this great strange city which attractive delightful as it was had not the suitableness even of being his home not his real one he wanted to show her something he wanted to show her everything but she was not sure nowafter an hours talkthat she particularly wanted to see anything more that he could show her he had shown her a great deal while he sat there especially what balderdash he thought itthe whole idea of womens being equal to men he seemed to have come only for that for he was all the while revolving round it she couldnt speak of anything but what he brought it back to the question of some new truth like that he didnt say so in so many words on the contrary he was tremendously insinuating and satirical and pretended to think she had proved all and a great deal more than she wanted to prove but his exaggeration and the way he rung all the changes on two or three of the points she had made at mrs burrages were just the sign that he was a scoffer of scoffers he wouldnt do anything but laugh he seemed to think that he might laugh at her all day without her taking offence well he might if it amused him but she didnt see why she should ramble round new york with him to give him his opportunity  she had told him and she had told olive that she was determined to produce some effect on him but now suddenly she felt differently about thatshe ceased to care whether she produced any effect or not she didnt see why she should take him so seriously when he wouldnt take her so that is wouldnt take her ideas she had guessed before that he didnt want to discuss them this had been in her mind when she said to him at cambridge that his interest in her was personal not controversial then she had simply meant that as an inquiring young southerner he had wanted to see what a bright new england girl was like but since then it had become a little more clear to herher short talk with ransom at mrs burrages threw some light upon the questionwhat the personal interest of a young southerner however inquiring merely might amount to did he too want to make love to her this idea made verena rather impatient weary in advance the thing she desired least in the world was to be put into the wrong with olive for she had certainly given her ground to believe not only in their scene the night before which was a simple repetition but all along from the very first that she really had an interest which would transcend any attraction coming from such a source as that if yesterday it seemed to her that she should like to struggle with mr ransom to refute and convince him she had this morning gone into the parlour to receive him with the idea that now they were alone together in a quiet favourable place he would perhaps take up the different points of her address one by one as several gentlemen had done after hearing her on other occasions there was nothing she liked so well as that and olive never had anything to say against it but he hadnt taken up anything he had simply laughed and chaffed and unrolled a string of queer fancies about the delightful way women would fix things when as she said in her address they should get out of their box he kept talking about the box he seemed as if he wouldnt let go that simile he said that he had come to look at her through the glass sides and if he wasnt afraid of hurting her he would smash them in he was determined to find the key that would open it if he had to look for it all over the world it was tantalising only to be able to talk to her through the keyhole if he didnt want to take up the subject he at least wanted to take her upto keep his hand upon her as long as he could verena had had no such sensation since the first day she went in to see olive chancellor when she felt herself plucked from the earth and borne aloft  its the most lovely day and i should like so much to show you new york as you showed me your beautiful harvard basil ransom went on pressing her to accede to his proposal you said that was the only thing you could do for me then and so this is the only thing i can do for you here it would be odious to see you go away giving me nothing but this stiff little talk in a boardinghouse parlour  mercy if you call this stiff verena exclaimed laughing while at that moment olive passed out of the house and descended the steps before her eyes  my poor cousins stiff she wont turn her head a hairs breadth to look at us said the young man olives figure as she went by was for verena full of a queer touching tragic expression saying ever so many things both familiar and strange and basil ransoms companion privately remarked how little men knew about women or indeed about what was really delicate that he without any cruel intention should attach an idea of ridicule to such an incarnation of the pathetic should speak rough derisive words about it ransom in truth today was not disposed to be very scrupulous and he only wanted to get rid of olive chancellor whose image at last decidedly bothered and bored him he was glad to see her go out but that was not sufficient she would come back quick enough the place itself contained her expressed her for today he wanted to take possession of verena to carry her to a distance to reproduce a little the happy conditions they had enjoyed the day of his visit to cambridge and the fact that in the nature of things it could only be for today made his desire more keen more full of purpose he had thought over the whole question in the last fortyeight hours and it was his belief that he saw things in their absolute reality he took a greater interest in her than he had taken in any one yet but he proposed after today not to let that accident make any difference this was precisely what gave its high value to the present limited occasion he was too shamefully poor too shabbily and meagrely equipped to have the right to talk of marriage to a girl in verenas very peculiar position he understood now how good that position was from a worldly point of view her address at mrs burrages gave him something definite to go upon showed him what she could do that people would flock in thousands to an exhibition so charming and small blame to them that she might easily have a big career like that of a distinguished actress or singer and that she would make money in quantities only slightly smaller than performers of that kind who wouldnt pay half a dollar for such an hour as he had passed at mrs burrages the sort of thing she was able to do to say was an article for which there was more and more demandfluent pretty thirdrate palaver conscious or unconscious perfected humbug the stupid gregarious gullible public the enlightened democracy of his native land could swallow unlimited draughts of it he was sure she could go like that for several years with her portrait in the druggists windows and her posters on the fences and during that time would make a fortune sufficient to keep her in affluence for evermore i shall perhaps expose our young man to the contempt of superior minds if i say that all this seemed to him an insuperable impediment to his making up to verena his scruples were doubtless begotten of a false pride a sentiment in which there was a thread of moral tinsel as there was in the southern idea of chivalry but he felt ashamed of his own poverty the positive flatness of his situation when he thought of the gilded nimbus that surrounded the protégée of mrs burrage this shame was possible to him even while he was conscious of what a mean business it was to practise upon human imbecility how much better it was even to be seedy and obscure discouraged about ones self he had been born to the prospect of a fortune and in spite of the years of misery that followed the war had never rid himself of the belief that a gentleman who desired to unite himself to a charming girl couldnt yet ask her to come and live with him in sordid conditions on the other hand it was no possible basis of matrimony that verena should continue for his advantage the exercise of her remunerative profession if he should become her husband he should know a way to strike her dumb in the midst of this an irrepressible desire urged him on to taste for once deeply all that he was condemned to lose or at any rate forbidden to attempt to gain to spend a day with her and not to see her againthat presented itself to him at once as the least and the most that was possible he did not need even to remind himself that young mr burrage was able to offer her everything he lacked including the most amiable adhesion to her views  it will be charming in the park today why not take a stroll with me there as i did with you in the little park at harvard he asked when olive had disappeared  oh i have seen it very well in every corner a friend of mine kindly took me to drive there yesterday verena said  a frienddo you mean mr burrage and ransom stood looking at her with his extraordinary eyes of course i havent a vehicle to drive you in but we can sit on a bench and talk she didnt say it was mr burrage but she was unable to say it was not and something in her face showed him that he had guessed so he went on is it only with him you can go out wont he like it and may you only do what he likes mrs luna told me he wants to marry you and i saw at his mothers how he stuck to you if you are going to marry him you can drive with him every day in the year and thats just a reason for your giving me an hour or two now before it becomes impossible he didnt mind much what he saidit had been his plan not to mind much todayand so long as he made her do what he wanted he didnt care much how he did it but he saw that his words brought the colour to her face she stared surprised at his freedom and familiarity he went on dropping the hardness the irony of which he was conscious out of his tone i know its no business of mine whom you marry or even whom you drive with and i beg your pardon if i seem indiscreet and obtrusive but i would give anything just to detach you a little from your ties your belongings and feel for an hour or two as ifas if and he paused  as if what she asked very seriously  as if there were no such person as mr burrageas miss chancellorin the whole place this had not been what he was going to say he used different words  i dont know what you mean why you speak of other persons i can do as i like perfectly but i dont know why you should take so for granted that that would be it verena spoke these words not out of coquetry or to make him beg her more for a favour but because she was thinking and she wanted to gain a moment his allusion to henry burrage touched her his belief that she had been in the park under circumstances more agreeable than those he proposed they were not somehow she wanted him to know that to wander there with a companion slowly stopping lounging looking at the animals as she had seen the people do the day before to sit down in some outoftheway part where there were distant views which she had noticed from her high perch beside henry burrageshe had to look down so it made her feel unduly fine that was much more to her taste much more her idea of true enjoyment it came over her that mr ransom had given up his work to come to her at such an hour people of his kind in the morning were always getting their living and it was only for mr burrage that it didnt matter inasmuch as he had no profession mr ransom simply wanted to give up his whole day that pressed upon her she was as the most goodnatured girl in the world too entirely tender not to feel any sacrifice that was made for her she had always done everything that people asked then if olive should make that strange arrangement for her to go to mrs burrages he would take it as a proof that there was something serious between her and the gentleman of the house in spite of anything she might say to the contrary moreover if she should go she wouldnt be able to receive mr ransom there olive would trust her not to and she must certainly in future not disappoint olive nor keep anything back from her whatever she might have done in the past besides she didnt want to do that she thought it much better not it was this idea of the episode which was possibly in store for her in new york and from which her present companion would be so completely excluded that worked upon her now with a rapid transition urging her to grant him what he asked so that in advance she should have made up for what she might not do for him later but most of all she disliked his thinking she was engaged to some one she didnt know it is true why she should mind it and indeed at this moment our young ladys feelings were not in any way clear to her she did not see what was the use of letting her acquaintance with mr ransom become much closer since his interest did really seem personal and yet she presently asked him why he wanted her to go out with him and whether there was anything particular he wanted to say to her there was no one like verena for making speeches apparently flirtatious with the best faith and the most innocent intention in the world as if that would not be precisely a reason to make it well she should get rid of him altogether  of course i have something particular to say to youi have a tremendous lot to say to you the young man exclaimed far more than i can say in this stuckup confined room which is public too so that any one may come in from one moment to another besides he added sophistically it isnt proper for me to pay a visit of three hours  verena did not take up the sophistry nor ask him whether it would be more proper for her to ramble about the city with him for an equal period she only said is it something that i shall care to hear or that will do me any good  well i hope it will do you good but i dont suppose you will care much to hear it basil ransom hesitated a moment smiling at her then he went on its to tell you once for all how much i really do differ from you he said this at a venture but it was a happy inspiration  if it was only that verena thought she might go for that was not personal well im glad you care so much she answered musingly but she had another scruple still and she expressed it in saying that she should like olive very much to find her when she came in  thats all very well ransom returned but does she think that she only has a right to go out does she expect you to keep the house because shes abroad if she stays out long enough she will find you when she comes in  her going out that wayit proves that she trusts me verena said with a candour which alarmed her as soon as she had spoken  her alarm was just for basil ransom instantly caught up her words with a great mocking amazement trusts you and why shouldnt she trust you are you a little girl of ten and she your governess havent you any liberty at all and is she always watching you and holding you to an account have you such vagabond instincts that you are only thought safe when you are between four walls ransom was going on to speak in the same tone of her having felt it necessary to keep olive in ignorance of his visit to cambridgea fact they had touched on by implication in their short talk at mrs burrages but in a moment he saw that he had said enough as for verena she had said more than she meant and the simplest way to unsay it was to go and get her bonnet and jacket and let him take her where he liked five minutes later he was walking up and down the parlour waiting while she prepared herself to go out  they went up to the central park by the elevated railway and verena reflected as they proceeded that anyway olive was probably disposing of her somehow at mrs burrages and that therefore there wasnt much harm in her just taking this little run on her own responsibility especially as she should only be out an hourwhich would be just the duration of olives absence the beauty of the elevated was that it took you up to the park and brought you back in a few minutes and you had all the rest of the hour to walk about and see the place it was so pleasant now that one was glad to see it twice over the long narrow enclosure across which the houses in the streets that border it look at each other with their glittering windows bristled with the raw delicacy of april and in spite of its rockwork grottoes and tunnels its pavilions and statues its too numerous paths and pavements lakes too big for the landscape and bridges too big for the lakes expressed all the fragrance and freshness of the most charming moment of the year once verena was fairly launched the spirit of the day took possession of her she was glad to have come she forgot about olive enjoyed the sense of wandering in the great city with a remarkable young man who would take beautiful care of her while no one else in the world knew where she was it was very different from her drive yesterday with mr burrage but it was more free more intense more full of amusing incident and opportunity she could stop and look at everything now and indulge all her curiosities even the most childish she could feel as if she were out for the day though she was not reallyas she had not done since she was a little girl when in the country once or twice when her father and mother had drifted into summer quarters gone out of town like people of fashion she had with a chance companion strayed far from home spent hours in the woods and fields looking for raspberries and playing she was a gipsy basil ransom had begun with proposing strenuously that she should come somewhere and have luncheon he had brought her out half an hour before that meal was served in west tenth street and he maintained that he owed her the compensation of seeing that she was properly fed he knew a very quiet luxurious french restaurant near the top of the fifth avenue he didnt tell her that he knew it through having once lunched there in company with mrs luna verena for the present declined his hospitalitysaid she was going to be out so short a time that it wasnt worth the trouble she should not be hungry luncheon to her was nothing she would eat when she went home when he pressed her she said she would see later perhaps if she should find she wanted something she would have liked immensely to go with him to an eatinghouse and yet with this she was afraid just as she was rather afraid at bottom and in the intervals of her quick pulsations of amusement of the whole expedition not knowing why she had come though it made her happy and reflecting that there was really nothing mr ransom could have to say to her that would concern her closely enough he knew what he intended about her sharing the noonday repast with him somehow it had been part of his plan that she should sit opposite him at a little table taking her napkin out of its curious foldssit there smiling back at him while he said to her certain things that hummed like memories of tunes in his fancy and they waited till something extremely good and a little vague chosen out of a french carte was brought them that was not at all compatible with her going home at the end of half an hour as she seemed to expect to they visited the animals in the little zoological garden which forms one of the attractions of the central park they observed the swans in the ornamental water and they even considered the question of taking a boat for half an hour ransom saying that they needed this to make their visit complete verena replied that she didnt see why it should be complete and after having threaded the devious ways of the ramble lost themselves in the maze and admired all the statues and busts of great men with which the grounds are decorated they contented themselves with resting on a sequestered bench where however there was a pretty glimpse of the distance and an occasional stroller creaked by on the asphalt walk  they had had by this time a great deal of talk none of which nevertheless had been serious to verenas view mr ransom continued to joke about everything including the emancipation of women verena who had always lived with people who took the world very earnestly had never encountered such a power of disparagement or heard so much sarcasm levelled at the institutions of her country and the tendencies of the age at first she replied to him contradicted showed a high spirit of retort turning his irreverence against himself she was too quick and ingenious not to be able to think of something to opposetalking in a fanciful strainto almost everything he said but little by little she grew weary and rather sad brought up as she had been to admire new ideas to criticise the social arrangements that one met almost everywhere and to disapprove of a great many things she had yet never dreamed of such a wholesale arraignment as mr ransoms so much bitterness as she saw lurking beneath his exaggerations his misrepresentations she knew he was an intense conservative but she didnt know that being a conservative could make a person so aggressive and unmerciful she thought conservatives were only smug and stubborn and selfcomplacent satisfied with what actually existed but mr ransom didnt seem any more satisfied with what existed than with what she wanted to exist and he was ready to say worse things about some of those whom she would have supposed to be on his own side than she thought it right to say about almost any one she ceased after a while to care to argue with him and wondered what could have happened to him to make him so perverse probably something had gone wrong in his lifehe had had some misfortune that coloured his whole view of the world he was a cynic she had often heard about that state of mind though she had never encountered it for all the people she had seen only cared if possible too much of basil ransoms personal history she knew only what olive had told her and that was but a general outline which left plenty of room for private dramas secret disappointments and sufferings as she sat there beside him she thought of some of these things asked herself whether they were what he was thinking of when he said for instance that he was sick of all the modern cant about freedom and had no sympathy with those who wanted an extension of it what was needed for the good of the world was that people should make a better use of the liberty they possessed such declarations as this took verenas breath away she didnt suppose you could hear any one say such a thing as that in the nineteenth century even the least advanced it was of a piece with his denouncing the spread of education he thought the spread of education a gigantic farcepeople stuffing their heads with a lot of empty catchwords that prevented them from doing their work quietly and honestly you had a right to an education only if you had an intelligence and if you looked at the matter with any desire to see things as they are you soon perceived that an intelligence was a very rare luxury the attribute of one person in a hundred he seemed to take a pretty low view of humanity anyway verena hoped that something really bad had happened to himnot by way of gratifying any resentment he aroused in her nature but to help herself to forgive him for so much contempt and brutality she wanted to forgive him for after they had sat on their bench half an hour and his jesting mood had abated a little so that he talked with more consideration as it seemed and more sincerity a strange feeling came over her a perfect willingness not to keep insisting on her own side and a desire not to part from him with a mere accentuation of their differences strange i call the nature of her reflexions for they softly battled with each other as she listened in the warm still air touched with the faraway hum of the immense city to his deep sweet distinct voice expressing monstrous opinions with exotic cadences and mild familiar laughs which as he leaned towards her almost tickled her cheek and ear it seemed to her strangely harsh almost cruel to have brought her out only to say to her things which after all free as she was to contradict them and tolerant as she always tried to be could only give her pain yet there was a spell upon her as she listened it was in her nature to be easily submissive to like being overborne she could be silent when people insisted and silent without acrimony her whole relation to olive was a kind of tacit tender assent to passionate insistence and if this had ended by being easy and agreeable to her and indeed had never been anything else it may be supposed that the struggle of yielding to a will which she felt to be stronger even than olives was not of long duration ransoms will had the effect of making her linger even while she knew the afternoon was going on that olive would have come back and found her still absent and would have been submerged again in the bitter waves of anxiety she saw her in fact as she must be at that moment posted at the window of her room in tenth street watching for some sign of her return listening for her step on the staircase her voice in the hall verena looked at this image as at a painted picture perceived all it represented every detail if it didnt move her more make her start to her feet dart away from basil ransom and hurry back to her friend this was because the very torment to which she was conscious of subjecting that friend made her say to herself that it must be the very last this was the last time she could ever sit by mr ransom and hear him express himself in a manner that interfered so with her life the ordeal had been so personal and so complete that she forgot for the moment it was also the first time it had occurred it might have been going on for months she was perfectly aware that it could bring them to nothing for one must lead ones own life it was impossible to lead the life of another especially when that other was so different so arbitrary and unscrupulous     xxxiv   i presume you are the only person in this country who feels as you do she observed at last  not the only person who feels so but very possibly the only person who thinks so i have an idea that my convictions exist in a vague unformulated state in the minds of a great many of my fellowcitizens if i should succeed some day in giving them adequate expression i should simply put into shape the slumbering instincts of an important minority  i am glad you admit its a minority verena exclaimed thats fortunate for us poor creatures and what do you call adequate expression i presume you would like to be president of the united states  and breathe forth my views in glowing messages to a palpitating senate that is exactly what i should like to be you read my aspirations wonderfully well  well do you consider that you have advanced far in that direction as yet verena asked  this question with the tone in which it happened to be uttered seemed to the young man to project rather an ironical light upon his present beggarly condition so that for a moment he said nothing a moment during which if his neighbour had glanced round at his face she would have seen it ornamented by an incipient blush her words had for him the effect of a sudden though on the part of a young woman who had of course every right to defend herself a perfectly legitimate taunt they appeared only to repeat in another form so at least his exaggerated southern pride his hot sensibility interpreted the matter the idea that a gentleman so dreadfully backward in the path of fortune had no right to take up the time of a brilliant successful girl even for the purpose of satisfying himself that he renounced her but the reminder only sharpened his wish to make her feel that if he had renounced it was simply on account of that same ugly accidental outside backwardness and if he had not he went so far as to flatter himself he might triumph over the whole accumulation of her prejudicesover all the bribes of her notoriety the deepest feeling in ransoms bosom in relation to her was the conviction that she was made for love as he had said to himself while he listened to her at mrs burrages she was profoundly unconscious of it and another ideal crude and thin and artificial had interposed itself but in the presence of a man she should really care for this false flimsy structure would rattle to her feet and the emancipation of olive chancellors sex what sex was it great heaven he used profanely to ask himself would be relegated to the land of vapours of dead phrases the reader may imagine whether such an impression as this made it any more agreeable to basil to have to believe it would be indelicate in him to try to woo her he would have resented immensely the imputation that he had done anything of that sort yet ah miss tarrant my success in life is one thingmy ambition is another he exclaimed presently in answer to her inquiry nothing is more possible than that i may be poor and unheard of all my days and in that case no one but myself will know the visions of greatness i have stifled and buried  why do you talk of being poor and unheard of arent you getting on quite well in this city  this question of verenas left him no time or at least no coolness to remember that to mrs luna and to olive he had put a fine face on his prospects and that any impression the girl might have about them was but the natural echo of what these ladies believed it had to his ear such a subtly mocking defiant unconsciously injurious quality that the only answer he could make to it seemed to him for the moment to be an outstretched arm which passing round her waist should draw her so close to him as to enable him to give her a concise account of his situation in the form of a deliberate kiss if the moment i speak of had lasted a few seconds longer i know not what monstrous proceeding of this kind it would have been my difficult duty to describe it was fortunately arrested by the arrival of a nurserymaid pushing a perambulator and accompanied by an infant who toddled in her wake both the nurse and her companion gazed fixedly and it seemed to ransom even sternly at the striking couple on the bench and meanwhile verena looking with a quickened eye at the children she adored children went on  it sounds too flat for you to talk about your remaining unheard of of course you are ambitious any one can see that to look at you and once your ambition is excited in any particular direction people had better look out with your will she added with a curious mocking candour  what do you know about my will he asked laughing a little awkwardly as if he had really attempted to kiss herin the course of the second independent interview he had ever had with herand been rebuffed  i know its stronger than mine it made me come out when i thought i had much better not and it keeps me sitting here long after i should have started for home  give me the day dear miss tarrant give me the day basil ransom murmured and as she turned her face upon him moved by the expression of his voice he addedcome and dine with me since you wouldnt lunch are you really not faint and weak  i am faint and weak at all the horrible things you have said i have lunched on abominations and now you want me to dine with you thank you i think youre cool verena cried with a laugh which her chronicler knows to have been expressive of some embarrassment though basil ransom did not  you must remember that i have on two different occasions listened to you for an hour in speechless submissive attention and that i shall probably do it a great many times more  why should you ever listen to me again when you loathe my ideas  i dont listen to your ideas i listen to your voice  ah i told olive said verena quickly as if his words had confirmed an old fear which was general however and did not relate particularly to him  ransom still had an impression that he was not making love to her especially when he could observe with all the superiority of a mani wonder whether you have understood ten words i have said to you  i should think you had made it clear enoughyou had rubbed it in  what have you understood then  why that you want to put us back further than we have been at any period  i have been joking i have been piling it up ransom said making that concession unexpectedly to the girl every now and then he had an air of relaxing himself becoming absent ceasing to care to discuss  she was capable of noticing this and in a moment she askedwhy dont you write out your ideas  this touched again upon the matter of his failure it was curious how she couldnt keep off it hit it every time do you mean for the public i have written many things but i cant get them printed  then it would seem that there are not so many peopleso many as you said just nowwho agree with you  well said basil ransom editors are a mean timorous lot always saying they want something original but deadly afraid of it when it comes  is it for papers magazines as it sank into verenas mind more deeply that the contributions of this remarkable young man had been rejectedcontributions in which apparently everything she held dear was riddled with scornshe felt a strange pity and sadness a sense of injustice i am very sorry you cant get published she said so simply that he looked up at her from the figure he was scratching on the asphalt with his stick to see whether such a tone as that in relation to such a fact were not put on but it was evidently genuine and verena added that she supposed getting published was very difficult always she remembered though she didnt mention how little success her father had when he tried she hoped mr ransom would keep on he would be sure to succeed at last then she continued smiling with more irony you may denounce me by name if you like only please dont say anything about olive chancellor  how little you understand what i want to achieve basil ransom exclaimed there you areyou womenall over always meaning yourselves something personal and always thinking it is meant by others  yes thats the charge they make said verena gaily  i dont want to touch you or miss chancellor or mrs farrinder or miss birdseye or the shade of eliza p moseley or any other gifted and celebrated being on earthor in heaven  oh i suppose you want to destroy us by neglect by silence verena exclaimed with the same brightness  no i dont want to destroy you any more than i want to save you there has been far too much talk about you and i want to leave you alone altogether my interest is in my own sex yours evidently can look after itself thats what i want to save  verena saw that he was more serious now than he had been before that he was not piling it up satirically but saying really and a trifle wearily as if suddenly he were tired of much talk what he meant to save it from what she asked  from the most damnable feminisation i am so far from thinking as you set forth the other night that there is not enough women in our general life that it has long been pressed home to me that there is a great deal too much the whole generation is womanised the masculine tone is passing out of the world its a feminine a nervous hysterical chattering canting age an age of hollow phrases and false delicacy and exaggerated solicitudes and coddled sensibilities which if we dont soon look out will usher in the reign of mediocrity of the feeblest and flattest and the most pretentious that has ever been the masculine character the ability to dare and endure to know and yet not fear reality to look the world in the face and take it for what it isa very queer and partly very base mixturethat is what i want to preserve or rather as i may say to recover and i must tell you that i dont in the least care what becomes of you ladies while i make the attempt  the poor fellow delivered himself of these narrow notions the rejection of which by leading periodicals was certainly not a matter for surprise with low soft earnestness bending towards her so as to give out his whole idea yet apparently forgetting for the moment how offensive it must be to her now that it was articulated in that calm severe way in which no allowance was to be made for hyperbole verena did not remind herself of this she was too much impressed by his manner and by the novelty of a man taking that sort of religious tone about such a cause it told her on the spot from one minute to the other and once for all that the man who could give her that impression would never come round she felt cold slightly sick though she replied that now he summed up his creed in such a distinct lucid way it was much more comfortableone knew with what one was dealing a declaration much at variance with the fact for verena had never felt less gratified in her life the ugliness of her companions profession of faith made her shiver it would have been difficult to her to imagine anything more crudely profane she was determined however not to betray any shudder that could suggest weakness and the best way she could think of to disguise her emotion was to remark in a tone which although not assumed for that purpose was really the most effective revenge inasmuch as it always produced on ransoms part it was not peculiar among women to verena an angry helplessnessmr ransom i assure you this is an age of conscience  thats a part of your cant its an age of unspeakable shams as carlyle says  well returned verena its all very comfortable for you to say that you wish to leave us alone but you cant leave us alone we are here and we have got to be disposed of you have got to put us somewhere its a remarkable social system that has no place for us the girl went on with her most charming laugh  no place in public my plan is to keep you at home and have a better time with you there than ever  im glad its to be better theres room for it woe to american womanhood when you start a movement for being morewhat you like to beat home  lord how youre perverted you the very genius basil ransom murmured looking at her with the kindest eyes  she paid no attention to this she went on and those who have got no home there are millions you know what are you going to do with them you must remember that women marryare given in marriageless and less that isnt their career as a matter of course any more you cant tell them to go and mind their husband and children when they have no husband and children to mind  oh said ransom thats a detail and for myself i confess i have such a boundless appreciation of your sex in private life that i am perfectly ready to advocate a mans having a halfadozen wives  the civilisation of the turks then strikes you as the highest  the turks have a secondrate religion they are fatalists and that keeps them down besides their women are not nearly so charming as oursor as ours would be if this modern pestilence were eradicated think what a confession you make when you say that women are less and less sought in marriage what a testimony that is to the pernicious effect on their manners their person their nature of this fatuous agitation  thats very complimentary to me verena broke in lightly  but ransom was carried over her interruption by the current of his argument there are a thousand ways in which any woman all women married or single may find occupation they may find it in making society agreeable  agreeable to men of course  to whom else pray dear miss tarrant what is most agreeable to women is to be agreeable to men that is a truth as old as the human race and dont let olive chancellor persuade you that she and mrs farrinder have invented any that can take its place or that is more profound more durable  verena waived this point of the discussion she only said well i am glad to hear you are prepared to see the place all choked up with old maids  i dont object to the old old maids they were delightful they had always plenty to do and didnt wander about the world crying out for a vocation it is the new old maid that you have invented from whom i pray to be delivered he didnt say he meant olive chancellor but verena looked at him as if she suspected him of doing so and to put her off that scent he went on taking up what she had said a moment before as for its not being complimentary to you my remark about the effect on the women themselves of this pernicious craze my dear miss tarrant you may be quite at your ease you stand apart you are unique extraordinary you constitute a category by yourself in you the elements have been mixed in a manner so felicitous that i regard you as quite incorruptible i dont know where you come from nor how you come to be what you are but you are outside and above all vulgarising influences besides you ought to know the young man proceeded in the same cool mild deliberate tone as if he were demonstrating a mathematical solution you ought to know that your connexion with all these rantings and ravings is the most unreal accidental illusory thing in the world you think you care about them but you dont at all they were imposed upon you by circumstances by unfortunate associations and you accepted them as you would have accepted any other burden on account of the sweetness of your nature you always want to please some one and now you go lecturing about the country and trying to provoke demonstrations in order to please miss chancellor just as you did it before to please your father and mother it isnt you the least in the world but an inflated little figure very remarkable in its way too whom you have invented and set on its feet pulling strings behind it to make it move and speak while you try to conceal and efface yourself there ah miss tarrant if its a question of pleasing how much you might please some one else by tipping your preposterous puppet over and standing forth in your freedom as well as in your loveliness  while basil ransom spokeand he had not spoken just that way yetverena sat there deeply attentive with her eyes on the ground but as soon as he ceased she sprang to her feetsomething made her feel that their association had already lasted quite too long she turned away from him as if she wished to leave him and indeed were about to attempt to do so she didnt desire to look at him now or even to have much more conversation with him something i say made her feel so but it was partly his curious mannerso serene and explicit as if he knew the whole thing to an absolute certaintywhich partly scared her and partly made her feel angry she began to move along the path to one of the gates as if it were settled that they should immediately leave the place he laid it all out so clearly if he had had a revelation he couldnt speak otherwise that description of herself as something different from what she was trying to be the charge of want of reality made her heart beat with pain she was sure at any rate it was her real self that was there with him now where she oughtnt to be in a moment he was at her side again going with her and as they walked it came over her that some of the things he had said to her were far beyond what olive could have imagined as the very worst possible what would be her state now poor forsaken friend if some of them had been borne to her in the voices of the air verena had been affected by her companions speech his manner had changed so it seemed to express something quite different in a way that pushed her to throw up the discussion and determine that as soon as they should get out of the park she would go off by herself but she still had her wits about her sufficiently to think it important she should give no sign of discomposure of confessing that she was driven from the field she appeared to herself to notice and reply to his extraordinary observations enough without taking them up too much when she said tossing the words over her shoulder at ransom while she moved quickly i presume from what you say that you dont think i have much ability  he hesitated before answering while his long legs easily kept pace with her rapid stepher charming touching hurrying step which expressed all the trepidation she was anxious to conceal immense ability but not in the line in which you most try to have it in a very different line miss tarrant ability is no word for it its genius  she felt his eyes on her faceever so close and fixed thereafter he had chosen to reply to her question that way she was beginning to blush if he had kept them longer and on the part of any one else she would have called such a stare impertinent verena had been commended of old by olive for her serenity while exposed to the gaze of hundreds but a change had taken place and she was now unable to endure the contemplation of an individual she wished to detach him to lead him off again into the general and for this purpose at the end of a moment she made another inquiry i am to understand then as your last word that you regard us as quite inferior  for public civic uses absolutelyperfectly weak and secondrate i know nothing more indicative of the muddled sentiment of the time than that any number of men should be found to pretend that they regard you in any other light but privately personally its another affair in the realm of family life and the domestic affections  at this verena broke in with a nervous laugh dont say that its only a phrase  well its a better one than any of yours said basil ransom turning with her out of one of the smaller gatesthe first they had come to they emerged into the species of plaza formed by the numbered street which constitutes the southern extremity of the park and the termination of the sixth avenue the glow of the splendid afternoon was over everything and the day seemed to ransom still in its youth the bowers and boskages stretched behind them the artificial lakes and cockneyfied landscapes making all the region bright with the sense of air and space and raw natural tints and vegetation too diminutive to overshadow the chocolatecoloured houses in tall new rows surveyed the expanse the street cars rattled in the foreground changing horses while the horses steamed and absorbing and emitting passengers and the beersaloons with exposed shoulders and sides which in new york do a good deal towards representing the picturesque the bit appreciated by painters announced themselves in signs of large lettering to the sky groups of the unemployed the children of disappointment from beyond the seas propped themselves against the low sunny wall of the park and on the other side the commercial vista of the sixth avenue stretched away with a remarkable absence of aerial perspective  i must go home goodbye verena said abruptly to her companion  go home you wont come and dine then  verena knew people who dined at midday and others who dined in the evening and others still who never dined at all but she knew no one who dined at halfpast three ransoms attachment to this idea therefore struck her as queer and infelicitous and she supposed it betrayed the habits of mississippi but that couldnt make it any more acceptable to her in spite of his looking so disappointedwith his dimlyglowing eyesthat he was heedless for the moment that the main fact connected with her return to tenth street was that she wished to go alone  i must leave you right away she said please dont ask me to stay you wouldnt if you knew how little i want to her manner was different now and her face as well and though she smiled more than ever she had never seemed to him more serious  alone do you mean really i cant let you do that ransom replied extremely shocked at this sacrifice being asked of him i have brought you this immense distance i am responsible for you and i must place you where i found you  mr ransom i must i will she exclaimed in a tone he had not yet heard her use so that a good deal amazed puzzled and pained he saw that he should make a mistake if he were to insist he had known that their expedition must end in a separation which could not be sweet but he had counted on making some of the terms of it himself when he expressed the hope that she would at least allow him to put her into a car she replied that she wished no car she wanted to walk this image of her streaking off by herself as he figured it did not mend the matter but in the presence of her sudden nervous impatience he felt that here was a feminine mystery which must be allowed to take its course  it costs me more than you probably suspect but i submit heaven guard you and bless you miss tarrant  she turned her face away from him as if she were straining at a leash then she rejoined in the most unexpected manner i hope very much you will get printed  get my articles published he stared and broke out oh you delightful being  goodbye she repeated and now she gave him her hand as he held it a moment and asked her if she were really leaving the city so soon that she mightnt see him again she answered if i stay it will be at a place to which you mustnt come they wouldnt let you see me  he had not intended to put that question to her he had set himself a limit but the limit had suddenly moved on do you mean at that house where i heard you speak  i may go there for a few days  if its forbidden to me to go and see you there why did you send me a card  because i wanted to convert you then  and now you give me up  no no i want you to remain as you are  she looked strange with her more mechanical smile as she said this and he didnt know what idea was in her head she had already left him but he called after her if you do stay i will come she neither turned nor made an answer and all that was left to him was to watch her till she passed out of sight her back with its charming young form seemed to repeat that last puzzle which was almost a challenge  for this however verena tarrant had not meant it she wanted in spite of the greater delay and the way olive would wonder to walk home because it gave her time to think and think again how glad she was really positively now that mr ransom was on the wrong side if he had been on the right she did not finish this proposition she found olive waiting for her in exactly the manner she had foreseen she turned to her as she came in a face sufficiently terrible verena instantly explained herself related exactly what she had been doing then went on without giving her friend time for question or comment and youyou paid your visit to mrs burrage  yes i went through that  and did she press the question of my coming there  very much indeed  and what did you say  i said very little but she gave me such assurances  that you thought i ought to go  olive was silent a moment then she said she declares they are devoted to the cause and that new york will be at your feet  verena took miss chancellors shoulders in each of her hands and gave her back for an instant her gaze her silence then she broke out with a kind of passion i dont care for her assurancesi dont care for new york i wont go to themi wontdo you understand suddenly her voice changed she passed her arms round her friend and buried her face in her neck olive chancellor take me away take me away she went on in a moment olive felt that she was sobbing and that the question was settled the question she herself had debated in anguish a couple of hours before     book third     xxxv   the august night had gathered by the time basil ransom having finished his supper stepped out upon the piazza of the little hotel it was a very little hotel and of a very slight and loose construction the tread of a tall mississippian made the staircase groan and the windows rattle in their frames he was very hungry when he arrived having not had a moment in boston on his way through to eat even the frugal morsel with which he was accustomed to sustain nature between a breakfast that consisted of a cup of coffee and a dinner that consisted of a cup of tea he had had his cup of tea now and very bad it was brought him by a pale roundbacked young lady with auburn ringlets a fancy belt and an expression of limited tolerance for a gentleman who could not choose quickly between fried fish fried steak and baked beans the train for marmion left boston at four oclock in the afternoon and rambled fitfully toward the southern cape while the shadows grew long in the stony pastures and the slanting light gilded the straggling shabby woods and painted the ponds and marshes with yellow gleams the ripeness of summer lay upon the land and yet there was nothing in the country basil ransom traversed that seemed susceptible of maturity nothing but the apples in the little tough dense orchards which gave a suggestion of sour fruition here and there and the tall bright goldenrod at the bottom of the bare stone dykes there were no fields of yellow grain only here and there a crop of brown hay but there was a kind of soft scrubbiness in the landscape and a sweetness begotten of low horizons of mild air with a possibility of summer haze of unregarded inlets where on august mornings the water must be brightly blue ransom had heard that the cape was the italy so to speak of massachusetts it had been described to him as the drowsy cape the languid cape the cape not of storms but of eternal peace he knew that the bostonians had been drawn thither for the hot weeks by its sedative influence by the conviction that its toneless air would minister to perfect rest in a career in which there was so much nervous excitement as in theirs they had no wish to be wound up when they went out of town they were sufficiently wound up at all times by the sense of all their sex had been through they wanted to live idly to unbend and lie in hammocks and also to keep out of the crowd the rush of the wateringplace ransom could see there was no crowd at marmion as soon as he got there though indeed there was a rush which directed itself to the only vehicle in waiting outside of the small lonely hutlike station so distant from the village that as far as one looked along the sandy sketchy road which was supposed to lead to it one saw only an empty land on either side six or eight men in dusters carrying parcels and handbags projected themselves upon the solitary rickety carryall so that ransom could read his own fate while the ruminating conductor of the vehicle a lean shambling citizen with a long neck and a tuft on his chin guessed that if he wanted to get to the hotel before dusk he would have to strike out his valise was attached in a precarious manner to the rear of the carryall well ill chance it the driver remarked sadly when ransom protested against its insecure position he recognised the southern quality of that picturesque fatalismjudged that miss chancellor and verena tarrant must be pretty thoroughly relaxed if they had given themselves up to the genius of the place this was what he hoped for and counted on as he took his way the sole pedestrian in the group that had quitted the train in the wake of the overladen carryall it helped him to enjoy the first country walk he had had for many months for more than months for years that the reflexion was forced upon him as he went the mild vague scenery just beginning to be dim with twilight suggested it at every step that the two young women who constituted at marmion his whole prefigurement of a social circle must in such a locality as that be taking a regular holiday the sense of all the wrongs they had still to redress must be lighter there than it was in boston the ardent young man had for the hour an ingenuous hope that they had left their opinions in the city he liked the very smell of the soil as he wandered along cool soft whiffs of evening met him at bends of the road which disclosed very little moreunless it might be a band of straightstemmed woodland keeping a little the red glow from the west or as he went further an old house shingled all over grey and slightly collapsing which looked down at him from a steep bank at the top of wooden steps he was already refreshed he had tasted the breath of nature measured his long grind in new york without a vacation with the repetition of the daily movement up and down the long straight maddening city like a bucket in a well or a shuttle in a loom  he lit his cigar in the office of the hotela small room on the right of the door where a register meagrely inscribed led a terribly public life on the little bare desk and got its pages dogseared before they were covered local worthies of a vague identity used to lounge there as ransom perceived the next day by the hour they tipped back their chairs against the wall seldom spoke and might have been supposed with their converging vision to be watching something out of the window if there had been anything at marmion to watch sometimes one of them got up and went to the desk on which he leaned his elbows hunching a pair of sloping shoulders to an uncollared neck for the fiftieth time he perused the flyblown page of the recording volume where the names followed each other with such jumps of date the others watched him while he did soor contemplated in silence some guest of the hostelry when such a personage entered the place with an air of appealing from the general irresponsibility of the establishment and found no one but the villagephilosophers to address himself to it was an establishment conducted by invisible elusive agencies they had a kind of stronghold in the diningroom which was kept locked at all but sacramental hours there was a tradition that a boy exercised some tutelary function as regards the crumpled register but when he was inquired about it was usually elicited from the impartial circle in the office either that he was somewhere round or that he had gone afishing except the haughty waitress who has just been mentioned as giving ransom his supper and who only emerged at mealtimes from her mystic seclusion this impalpable youth was the single person on the premises who represented domestic service anxious ladyboarders wrapped in shawls were seen waiting for him as if he had been the doctor on horsehair rockingchairs in the little public parlour others peered vaguely out of back doors and windows thinking that if he were somewhere round they might see him sometimes people went to the door of the diningroom and tried it shaking it a little timidly to see if it would yield then finding it fast came away looking if they had been observed shy and snubbed at their fellows some of them went so far as to say that they didnt think it was a very good hotel  ransom however didnt much care whether it were good or not he hadnt come to marmion for the love of the hotel now that he had got there however he didnt know exactly what to do his course seemed rather less easy than it had done when suddenly the night before tired sick of the cityair and hungry for a holiday he decided to take the next mornings train to boston and there take another to the shores of buzzards bay the hotel itself offered few resources the inmates were not numerous they moved about a little outside on the small piazza and in the rough yard which interposed between the house and the road and then they dropped off into the unmitigated dusk this element touched only in two or three places by a faraway dim glimmer presented itself to ransom as his sole entertainment though it was pervaded by that curious pure earthy smell which in new england in summer hangs in the nocturnal air ransom bethought himself that the place might be a little dull for persons who had not come to it as he had to take possession of verena tarrant the unfriendly inn which suggested dreadfully to ransom he despised the practice an early bedtime seemed to have no relation to anything not even to itself but a fellowtenant of whom he made an inquiry told him the village was sprinkled round basil presently walked along the road in search of it under the stars smoking one of the good cigars which constituted his only tribute to luxury he reflected that it would hardly do to begin his attack that night he ought to give the bostonians a certain amount of notice of his appearance on the scene he thought it very possible indeed that they might be addicted to the vile habit of retiring with the cocks and hens he was sure that was one of the things olive chancellor would do so long as he should stayon purpose to spite him she would make verena tarrant go to bed at unnatural hours just to deprive him of his evenings he walked some distance without encountering a creature or discerning an habitation but he enjoyed the splendid starlight the stillness the shrill melancholy of the crickets which seemed to make all the vague forms of the country pulsate around him the whole impression was a bath of freshness after the long strain of the preceding two years and his recent sweltering weeks in new york at the end of ten minutes his stroll had been slow a figure drew near him at first indistinct but presently defining itself as that of a woman she was walking apparently without purpose like himself or without other purpose than that of looking at the stars which she paused for an instant throwing back her head to contemplate as he drew nearer to her in a moment he was very close he saw her look at him through the clear gloom as they passed each other she was small and slim he made out her head and face saw that her hair was cropped had an impression of having seen her before he noticed that as she went by she turned as well as himself and that there was a sort of recognition in her movement then he felt sure that he had seen her elsewhere and before she had added to the distance that separated them he stopped short looking after her she noticed his halt paused equally and for a moment they stood there face to face at a certain interval in the darkness  i beg your pardonis it doctor prance he found himself demanding  for a minute there was no answer then came the voice of the little lady  yes sir i am doctor prance any one sick at the hotel  i hope not i dont know ransom said laughing  then he took a few steps mentioned his name recalled his having met her at miss birdseyes ever so long before nearly two years and expressed the hope that she had not forgotten that  she thought it over a littleshe was evidently addicted neither to empty phrases nor to unconsidered assertions i presume you mean that night miss tarrant launched out so  that very night we had a very interesting conversation  well i remember i lost a good deal said doctor prance  well i dont know i have an idea you made it up in other ways ransom returned laughing still  he saw her bright little eyes engage with his own staying apparently in the village she had come out bareheaded for an evening walk and if it had been possible to imagine doctor prance bored and in want of recreation the way she lingered there as if she were quite willing to have another talk might have suggested to basil ransom this condition why dont you consider her career very remarkable  oh yes everything is remarkable nowadays we live in an age of wonders the young man replied much amused to find himself discussing the object of his adoration in this casual way in the dark on a lonely countryroad with a shorthaired female physician it was astonishing how quickly doctor prance and he had made friends again i suppose by the way you know miss tarrant and miss chancellor are staying down here he went on  well yes i suppose i know it i am visiting miss chancellor the dry little woman added  oh indeed i am delighted to hear it ransom exclaimed feeling that he might have a friend in the camp then you can inform me where those ladies have their house  yes i guess i can tell it in the dark i will show you round now if you like  i shall be glad to see it though i am not sure i shall go in immediately i must reconnoitre a little first that makes me so very happy to have met you i think its very wonderfulyour knowing me  doctor prance did not repudiate this compliment but she presently observed you didnt pass out of my mind entirely because i have heard about you since from miss birdseye  ah yes i saw her in the spring i hope she is in health and happiness  she is always in happiness but she cant be said to be in health she is very weak she is failing  i am very sorry for that  she is also visiting miss chancellor doctor prance observed after a pause which was an illustration of an appearance she had of thinking that certain things didnt at all imply some others  why my cousin has got all the distinguished women basil ransom exclaimed  is miss chancellor your cousin there isnt much family resemblance miss birdseye came down for the benefit of the country air and i came down to see if i could help her to get some good from it she wouldnt much if she were left to herself miss birdseye has a very fine character but she hasnt much idea of hygiene doctor prance was evidently more and more disposed to be chatty ransom appreciated this fact and said he hoped she too was getting some good from the countryairhe was afraid she was very much confined to her profession in boston to which she repliedwell i was just taking a little exercise along the road i presume you dont realise what it is to be one of four ladies grouped together in a small framehouse  ransom remembered how he had liked her before and he felt that as the phrase was he was going to like her again he wanted to express his goodwill to her and would greatly have enjoyed being at liberty to offer her a cigar he didnt know what to offer her or what to do unless he should invite her to sit with him on a fence he did realise perfectly what the situation in the small framehouse must be and entered with instant sympathy into the feelings which had led doctor prance to detach herself from the circle and wander forth under the constellations all of which he was sure she knew he asked her permission to accompany her on her walk but she said she was not going much further in that direction she was going to turn round he turned round with her and they went back together to the village in which he at last began to discover a certain consistency signs of habitation houses disposed with a rough resemblance to a plan the road wandered among them with a kind of accommodating sinuosity and there were even crossstreets and an oillamp on a corner and here and there the small sign of a closed shop with an indistinctly countrified lettering there were lights now in the windows of some of the houses and doctor prance mentioned to her companion several of the inhabitants of the little town who appeared all to rejoice in the prefix of captain they were retired shipmasters there was quite a little nest of these worthies two or three of whom might be seen lingering in their dim doorways as if they were conscious of a want of encouragement to sit up and yet remembered the nights in faraway waters when they would not have thought of turning in at all marmion called itself a town but it was a good deal shrunken since the decline in the shipbuilding interest it turned out a good many vessels every year in the palmy days before the war there were shipyards still where you could almost pick up the old shavings the old nails and rivets but they were grassgrown now and the water lapped them without anything to interfere there was a kind of arm of the sea put in it went up some way it wasnt the real sea but very quiet like a river that was more attractive to some doctor prance didnt say the place was picturesque or quaint or weird but he could see that was what she meant when she said it was mouldering away even under the mantle of night he himself gathered the impression that it had had a larger life seen better days doctor prance made no remark designed to elicit from him an account of his motives in coming to marmion she asked him neither when he had arrived nor how long he intended to stay his allusion to his cousinship with miss chancellor might have served to her mind as a reason yet on the other hand it would have been open to her to wonder why if he had come to see the young ladies from charles street he was not in more of a hurry to present himself it was plain doctor prance didnt go into that kind of analysis if ransom had complained to her of a sore throat she would have inquired with precision about his symptoms but she was incapable of asking him any question with a social bearing sociably enough however they continued to wander through the principal street of the little town darkened in places by immense old elms which made a blackness overhead there was a salt smell in the air as if they were nearer the water doctor prance said that olives house was at the other end  i shall take it as a kindness if for this evening you dont mention that you have happened to meet me ransom remarked after a little he had changed his mind about giving notice  well i wouldnt his companion replied as if she didnt need any caution in regard to making vain statements  i want to keep my arrival a little surprise for tomorrow it will be a great pleasure to me to see miss birdseye he went on rather hypocritically as if that at bottom had been to his mind the main attraction of marmion  doctor prance did not reveal her private comment whatever it was on this intimation she only said after some hesitationwell i presume the old lady will take quite an interest in your being here  i have no doubt she is capable even of that degree of philanthropy  well she has charity for all but she doeseven sheprefer her own side she regards you as quite an acquisition  ransom could not but feel flattered at the idea that he had been a subject of conversationas this impliedin the little circle at miss chancellors but he was at a loss for the moment to perceive what he had done up to this time to gratify the senior member of the group i hope she will find me an acquisition after i have been here a few days he said laughing  well she thinks you are one of the most important converts yet doctor prance replied in a colourless way as if she would not have pretended to explain why  a convertme do you mean of miss tarrants it had come over him that miss birdseye in fact when he was parting with her after their meeting in boston had assented to his request for secrecy which at first had struck her as somewhat unholy on the ground that verena would bring him into the fold he wondered whether that young lady had been telling her old friend that she had succeeded with him he thought this improbable but it didnt matter and he said gaily well i can easily let her suppose so  it was evident that it would be no easier for doctor prance to subscribe to a deception than it had been for her venerable patient but she went so far as to reply well i hope you wont let her suppose you are where you were that time i conversed with you i could see where you were then  it was in about the same place you were wasnt it  well said doctor prance with a small sigh i am afraid i have moved back if anything her sigh told him a good deal it seemed a thin selfcontrolled protest against the tone of miss chancellors interior of which it was her present fortune to form a part and the way she hovered round indistinct in the gloom as if she were rather loath to resume her place there completed his impression that the little doctress had a line of her own  that at least must distress miss birdseye he said reproachfully  not much because i am not of importance they think women the equals of men but they are a great deal more pleased when a man joins than when a woman does  ransom complimented doctor prance on the lucidity of her mind and then he said is miss birdseye really sick is her condition very precarious  well she is very old and veryvery gentle doctor prance answered hesitating a moment for her adjective under those circumstances a person may flicker out  we must trim the lamp said ransom i will take my turn with pleasure in watching the sacred flame  it will be a pity if she doesnt live to hear miss tarrants great effort his companion went on  miss tarrants whats that  well its the principal interest in there and doctor prance now vaguely indicated with a movement of her head a small white house much detached from its neighbours which stood on their left with its back to the water at a little distance from the road it exhibited more signs of animation than any of its fellows several windows notably those of the ground floor were open to the warm evening and a large shaft of light was projected upon the grassy wayside in front of it ransom in his determination to be discreet checked the advance of his companion who added presently with a short suppressed laughyou can see it is from that he listened to ascertain what she meant and after an instant a sound came to his eara sound he knew already well which carried the accents of verena tarrant in ample periods and cadences out into the stillness of the august night  murder what a lovely voice he exclaimed involuntarily  doctor prances eye gleamed towards him a moment and she observed humorously she was relaxing immensely perhaps miss birdseye is right then as he made no rejoinder only listening to the vocal inflexions that floated out of the house she went onshes practising her speech  her speech is she going to deliver one here  no as soon as they go back to townat the music hall  ransoms attention was now transferred to his companion is that why you call it her great effort  well so they think it i believe she practises that way every night she reads portions of it aloud to miss chancellor and miss birdseye  and thats the time you choose for your walk ransom said smiling  well its the time my old lady has least need of me shes too absorbed  doctor prance dealt in facts ransom had already discovered that and some of her facts were very interesting  the music hallisnt that your great building he asked  well its the biggest weve got its pretty big but it isnt so big as miss chancellors ideas added doctor prance she has taken it to bring out miss tarrant before the general publicshe has never appeared that way in bostonon a great scale she expects her to make a big sensation it will be a great night and they are preparing for it they consider it her real beginning  and this is the preparation basil ransom said  yes as i say its their principal interest  ransom listened and while he listened he meditated he had thought it possible verenas principles might have been shaken by the profession of faith to which he treated her in new york but this hardly looked like it for some moments doctor prance and he stood together in silence  you dont hear the words the doctor remarked with a smile which in the dark looked mephistophelean  oh i know the words the young man exclaimed with rather a groan as he offered her his hand for goodnight     xxxvi   a certain prudence had determined him to put off his visit till the morning he thought it more probable that at that time he should be able to see verena alone whereas in the evening the two young women would be sure to be sitting together when the morrow dawned however basil ransom felt none of the trepidation of the procrastinator he knew nothing of the reception that awaited him but he took his way to the cottage designated to him overnight by doctor prance with the step of a man much more conscious of his own purpose than of possible obstacles he made the reflexion as he went that to see a place for the first time at night is like reading a foreign author in a translation at the present hourit was getting towards eleven oclockhe felt that he was dealing with the original the little straggling looselyclustered town lay along the edge of a blue inlet on the other side of which was a low wooded shore with a gleam of white sand where it touched the water the narrow bay carried the vision outward to a picture that seemed at once bright and dima shining slumbering summer sea and a faroff circling line of coast which under the august sun was hazy and delicate ransom regarded the place as a town because doctor prance had called it one but it was a town where you smelt the breath of the hay in the streets and you might gather blackberries in the principal square the houses looked at each other across the grasslow rusty crooked distended houses with dry cracked faces and the dim eyes of smallpaned stifflysliding windows their little dooryards bristled with rank oldfashioned flowers mostly yellow and on the quarter that stood back from the sea the fields sloped upward and the woods in which they presently lost themselves looked down over the roofs bolts and bars were not a part of the domestic machinery of marmion and the responsive menial receiving the visitor on the threshold was a creature rather desired than definitely possessed so that basil ransom found miss chancellors housedoor gaping wide as he had seen it the night before and destitute even of a knocker or a bellhandle from where he stood in the porch he could see the whole of the little sittingroom on the left of the hallsee that it stretched straight through to the back windows that it was garnished with photographs of foreign works of art pinned upon the walls and enriched with a piano and other little extemporised embellishments such as ingenious women lavish upon the houses they hire for a few weeks verena told him afterwards that olive had taken her cottage furnished but that the paucity of chairs and tables and bedsteads was such that their little party used almost to sit down to lie down in turn on the other hand they had all george eliots writings and two photographs of the sistine madonna ransom rapped with his stick on the lintel of the door but no one came to receive him so he made his way into the parlour where he observed that his cousin olive had as many german books as ever lying about he dipped into this literature momentarily according to his wont and then remembered that this was not what he had come for and that as he waited at the door he had seen through another door opening at the opposite end of the hall signs of a small verandah attached to the other face of the house thinking the ladies might be assembled there in the shade he pushed aside the muslin curtain of the back window and saw that the advantages of miss chancellors summer residence were in this quarter there was a verandah in fact to which a wide horizontal trellis covered with an ancient vine formed a kind of extension beyond the trellis was a small lonely garden beyond the garden was a large vague woody space where a few piles of old timber were disposed and which he afterwards learned to be a relic of the shipbuilding era described to him by doctor prance and still beyond this again was the charming lakelike estuary he had already admired his eyes did not rest upon the distance they were attracted by a figure seated under the trellis where the chequers of sun in the interstices of the vine leaves fell upon a brightcoloured rug spread out on the ground the floor of the roughlyconstructed verandah was so low that there was virtually no difference in the level it took ransom only a moment to recognise miss birdseye though her back was turned to the house she was alone she sat there motionless she had a newspaper in her lap but her attitude was not that of a reader looking at the shimmering bay she might be asleep that was why ransom moderated the process of his long legs as he came round through the house to join her this precaution represented his only scruple he stepped across the verandah and stood close to her but she did not appear to notice him visibly she was dozing or presumably rather for her head was enveloped in an old faded straw hat which concealed the upper part of her face there were two or three other chairs near her and a table on which were halfadozen books and periodicals together with a glass containing a colourless liquid on the top of which a spoon was laid ransom desired only to respect her repose so he sat down in one of the chairs and waited till she should become aware of his presence he thought miss chancellors backgarden a delightful spot and his jaded senses tasted the breezethe idle wandering summer windthat stirred the vine leaves over his head the hazy shores on the other side of the water which had tints more delicate than the street vistas of new york they seemed powdered with silver a sort of midsummer light suggested to him a land of dreams a country in a picture basil ransom had seen very few pictures there were none in mississippi but he had a vision at times of something that would be more refined than the real world and the situation in which he now found himself pleased him almost as much as if it had been a striking work of art he was unable to see as i have said whether miss birdseye were taking in the prospect through open or only imagination aiding she had plenty of that through closed tired dazzled eyes she appeared to him as the minutes elapsed and he sat beside her the incarnation of wellearned rest of patient submissive superannuation at the end of her long days work she might have been placed there to enjoy this dim prevision of the peaceful river the gleaming shores of the paradise her unselfish life had certainly qualified her to enter and which apparently would so soon be opened to her after a while she said placidly without turning  i suppose its about time i should take my remedy again it does seem as if she had found the right thing dont you think so  do you mean the contents of that tumbler i shall be delighted to give it to you and you must tell me how much you take and basil ransom getting up possessed himself of the glass on the table  at the sound of his voice miss birdseye pushed back her straw hat by a movement that was familiar to her and twisting about her muffled figure a little even in august she felt the cold and had to be much covered up to sit out directed at him a speculative unastonished gaze  one spoonfultwo ransom asked stirring the dose and smiling  well i guess ill take two this time  certainly doctor prance couldnt help finding the right thing ransom said as he administered the medicine while the movement with which she extended her face to take it made her seem doubly childlike  he put down the glass and she relapsed into her position she seemed to be considering its homeopathic she remarked in a moment  oh i have no doubt of that i presume you wouldnt take anything else  well its generally admitted now to be the true system  ransom moved closer to her placed himself where she could see him better its a great thing to have the true system he said bending towards her in a friendly way im sure you have it in everything he was not often hypocritical but when he was he went all lengths  well i dont know that any one has a right to say that i thought you were verena she added in a moment taking him in again with her mild deliberate vision  i have been waiting for you to recognise me of course you didnt know i was herei only arrived last night  well im glad you have come to see olive now  you remember that i wouldnt do that when i met you last  you asked me not to mention to her that i had met you thats what i principally recall  and dont you remember what i told you i wanted to do i wanted to go out to cambridge and see miss tarrant thanks to the information that you were so good as to give me i was able to do so  yes she gave me quite a little description of your visit said miss birdseye with a smile and a vague sound in her throata sort of pensive private reference to the idea of laughterof which ransom never learned the exact significance though he retained for a long time afterwards a kindly memory of the old ladys manner at the moment  i dont know how much she enjoyed it but it was an immense pleasure to me so great a one that as you see i have come to call upon her again  then i presume she has shaken you  she has shaken me tremendously said ransom laughing  well youll be a great addition miss birdseye returned and this time your visit is also for miss chancellor  that depends on whether she will receive me  well if she knows you are shaken that will go a great way said miss birdseye a little musingly as if even to her unsophisticated mind it had been manifested that ones relations with miss chancellor might be ticklish but she cant receive you nowcan shebecause shes out she has gone to the post office for the boston letters and they get so many every day that she had to take verena with her to help her carry them home one of them wanted to stay with me because doctor prance has gone fishing but i said i presumed i could be left alone for about seven minutes i know how they love to be together it seems as if one couldnt go out without the other thats what they came down here for because its quiet and it didnt look as if there was any one else they would be much drawn to so it would be a pity for me to come down after them just to spoil it  i am afraid i shall spoil it miss birdseye  oh well a gentleman murmured the ancient woman  yes what can you expect of a gentleman i certainly shall spoil it if i can  you had better go fishing with doctor prance said miss birdseye with a serenity which showed that she was far from measuring the sinister quality of the announcement he had just made  i shant object to that at all the days here must be very longvery full of hours have you got the doctor with you ransom inquired as if he knew nothing at all about her  yes miss chancellor invited us both she is very thoughtful she is not merely a theoretic philanthropistshe goes into details said miss birdseye presenting her large person in her chair as if she herself were only an item it seems as if we were not so much wanted in boston just in august  and here you sit and enjoy the breeze and admire the view the young man remarked wondering when the two messengers whose seven minutes must long since have expired would return from the post office  yes i enjoy everything in this little oldworld place i didnt suppose i should be satisfied to be so passive its a great contrast to my former exertions but somehow it doesnt seem as if there were any trouble or any wrong round here and if there should be there are miss chancellor and miss tarrant to look after it they seem to think i had better fold my hands besides when helpful generous minds begin to flock in from your part of the country miss birdseye continued looking at him from under the distorted and discoloured canopy of her hat with a benignity which completed the idea in any cheerful sense he chose  he felt by this time that he was committed to rather a dishonest part he was pledged not to give a shock to her optimism this might cost him in the coming days a good deal of dissimulation but he was now saved from any further expenditure of ingenuity by certain warning sounds which admonished him that he must keep his wits about him for a purpose more urgent there were voices in the hall of the house voices he knew which came nearer quickly so that before he had time to rise one of the speakers had come out with the exclamationdear miss birdseye here are seven letters for you the words fell to the ground indeed before they were fairly spoken and when ransom got up turning he saw olive chancellor standing there with the parcel from the post office in her hand she stared at him in sudden horror for the moment her selfpossession completely deserted her there was so little of any greeting in her face save the greeting of dismay that he felt there was nothing for him to say to her nothing that could mitigate the odious fact of his being there he could only let her take it in let her divine that this time he was not to be got rid of in an instantto ease off the situationhe held out his hand for miss birdseyes letters and it was a proof of olives having turned rather faint and weak that she gave them up to him he delivered the packet to the old lady and now verena had appeared in the doorway of the house as soon as she saw him she blushed crimson but she did not like olive stand voiceless  why mr ransom she cried out where in the world were you washed ashore miss birdseye meanwhile taking her letters had no appearance of observing that the encounter between olive and her visitor was a kind of concussion  it was verena who eased off the situation her gay challenge rose to her lips as promptly as if she had had no cause for embarrassment she was not confused even when she blushed and her alertness may perhaps be explained by the habit of public speaking ransom smiled at her while she came forward but he spoke first to olive who had already turned her eyes away from him and gazed at the blue seaview as if she were wondering what was going to happen to her at last  of course you are very much surprised to see me but i hope to be able to induce you to regard me not absolutely in the light of an intruder i found your door open and i walked in and miss birdseye seemed to think i might stay miss birdseye i put myself under your protection i invoke you i appeal to you the young man went on adopt me answer for me cover me with the mantle of your charity  miss birdseye looked up from her letters as if at first she had only faintly heard his appeal she turned her eyes from olive to verena then she said doesnt it seem as if we had room for all when i remember what i have seen in the south mr ransoms being here strikes me as a great triumph  olive evidently failed to understand and verena broke in with eagerness it was by my letter of course that you knew we were here the one i wrote just before we came olive she went on dont you remember i showed it to you  at the mention of this act of submission on her friends part olive started flashing her a strange look then she said to basil that she didnt see why he should explain so much about his coming every one had a right to come it was a very charming place it ought to do any one good but it will have one defect for you she added threequarters of the summer residents are women  this attempted pleasantry on miss chancellors part so unexpected so incongruous uttered with white lips and cold eyes struck ransom to that degree by its oddity that he could not resist exchanging a glance of wonder with verena who if she had had the opportunity could probably have explained to him the phenomenon olive had recovered herself reminded herself that she was safe that her companion in new york had repudiated denounced her pursuer and as a proof to her own sense of her security as well as a touching mark to verena that now after what had passed she had no fear she felt that a certain light mockery would be effective  ah miss olive dont pretend to think i love your sex so little when you know that what you really object to in me is that i love it too much ransom was not brazen he was not impudent he was really a very modest man but he was aware that whatever he said or did he was condemned to seem impudent now and he argued within himself that if he was to have the dishonour of being thought brazen he might as well have the comfort he didnt care a straw in truth how he was judged or how he might offend he had a purpose which swallowed up such inanities as that and he was so full of it that it kept him firm balanced him gave him an assurance that might easily have been confounded with a cold detachment this place will do me good he pursued i havent had a holiday for more than two years i couldnt have gone another day i was finished i would have written to you beforehand that i was coming but i only started at a few hours notice it occurred to me that this would be just what i wanted i remembered what miss tarrant had said in her note that it was a place where people could lie on the ground and wear their old clothes i delight to lie on the ground and all my clothes are old i hope to be able to stay three or four weeks  olive listened till he had done speaking she stood a single moment longer and then without a word a glance she rushed into the house ransom saw that miss birdseye was immersed in her letters so he went straight to verena and stood before her looking far into her eyes he was not smiling now as he had been in speaking to olive will you come somewhere apart where i can speak to you alone  why have you done this it was not right in you to come verena looked still as if she were blushing but ransom perceived he must allow for her having been delicately scorched by the sun  i have come because it is necessarybecause i have something very important to say to you a great number of things  the same things you said in new york i dont want to hear them againthey were horrible  no not the samedifferent ones i want you to come out with me away from here  you always want me to come out we cant go out here we are out as much as we can be verena laughed she tried to turn it offfeeling that something really impended  come down into the garden and out beyond thereto the water where we can speak its what i have come for it was not for what i told miss olive  he had lowered his voice as if miss olive might still hear them and there was something strangely gravealtogether solemn indeedin its tone verena looked around her at the splendid summer day at the muchswathed formless figure of miss birdseye holding her letter inside her hat mr ransom she articulated then simply and as her eyes met his again they showed him a couple of tears  its not to make you suffer i honestly believe i dont want to say anything that will hurt you how can i possibly hurt you when i feel to you as i do he went on with suppressed force  she said no more but all her face entreated him to let her off to spare her and as this look deepened a quick sense of elation and success began to throb in his heart for it told him exactly what he wanted to know it told him that she was afraid of him that she had ceased to trust herself that the way he had read her nature was the right way she was tremendously open to attack she was meant for love she was meant for him and that his arriving at the point at which he wished to arrive was only a question of time this happy consciousness made him extraordinarily tender to her he couldnt put enough reassurance into his smile his low murmur as he said only give me ten minutes dont receive me by turning me away its my holidaymy poor little holiday dont spoil it  three minutes later miss birdseye looking up from her letter saw them move together through the bristling garden and traverse a gap in the old fence which enclosed the further side of it they passed into the ancient shipyard which lay beyond and which was now a mere vague grassgrown approach to the waterside bestrewn with a few remnants of supererogatory timber she saw them stroll forward to the edge of the bay and stand there taking the soft breeze in their faces she watched them a little and it warmed her heart to see the stiffnecked young southerner led captive by a daughter of new england trained in the right school who would impose her opinions in their integrity considering how prejudiced he must have been he was certainly behaving very well even at that distance miss birdseye dimly made out that there was something positively humble in the way he invited verena tarrant to seat herself on a low pile of weatherblackened planks which constituted the principal furniture of the place and something perhaps just a trifle too expressive of righteous triumph in the manner in which the girl put the suggestion by and stood where she liked a little proudly turning a good deal away from him miss birdseye could see as much as this but she couldnt hear so that she didnt know what it was that made verena turn suddenly back to him at something he said if she had known perhaps his observation would have struck her as less singularunder the circumstances in which these two young persons metthan it may appear to the reader  they have accepted one of my articles i think its the best these were the first words that passed basil ransoms lips after the pair had withdrawn as far as it was possible to withdraw in that direction from the house  oh is it printedwhen does it appear verena asked that question instantly it sprang from her lips in a manner that completely belied the air of keeping herself at a distance from him which she had worn a few moments before  he didnt tell her again this time as he had told her when on the occasion of their walk together in new york she expressed an inconsequent hope that his fortune as a rejected contributor would take a turnhe didnt remark to her once more that she was a delightful being he only went on as if her revulsion were a matter of course to explain everything he could so that she might as soon as possible know him better and see how completely she could trust him that was at bottom the reason i came here the essay in question is the most important thing i have done in the way of a literary attempt and i determined to give up the game or to persist according as i should be able to bring it to the light or not the other day i got a letter from the editor of the rational review telling me that he should be very happy to print it that he thought it very remarkable and that he should be glad to hear from me again he shall hear from me againhe neednt be afraid it contained a good many of the opinions i have expressed to you and a good many more besides i really believe it will attract some attention at any rate the simple fact that it is to be published makes an era in my life this will seem pitiful to you no doubt who publish yourself have been before the world these several years and are flushed with every kind of triumph but to me its simply a tremendous affair it makes me believe i may do something it has changed the whole way i look at my future i have been building castles in the air and i have put you in the biggest and fairest of them thats a great change and as i say its really why i came on  verena lost not a word of this gentle conciliatory explicit statement it was full of surprises for her and as soon as ransom had stopped speaking she inquired why didnt you feel satisfied about your future before  her tone made him feel how little she had suspected he could have the weakness of a discouragement how little of a question it must have seemed to her that he would one day triumph on his own erratic line it was the sweetest tribute he had yet received to the idea that he might have ability the letter of the editor of the rational review was nothing to it no i felt very blue it didnt seem to me at all clear that there was a place for me in the world  gracious said verena tarrant  a quarter of an hour later miss birdseye who had returned to her letters she had a correspondent at framingham who usually wrote fifteen pages became aware that verena who was now alone was reentering the house she stopped her on her way and said she hoped she hadnt pushed mr ransom overboard  oh no he has gone offround the other way  well i hope he is going to speak for us soon  verena hesitated a moment he speaks with the pen he has written a very fine articlefor the rational review  miss birdseye gazed at her young friend complacently the sheets of her interminable letter fluttered in the breeze well its delightful to see the way it goes on isnt it  verena scarcely knew what to say then remembering that doctor prance had told her that they might lose their dear old companion any day and confronting it with something basil ransom had just saidthat the rational review was a quarterly and the editor had notified him that his article would appear only in the number after the nextshe reflected that perhaps miss birdseye wouldnt be there so many months later to see how it was her supposed consort had spoken she might therefore be left to believe what she liked to believe without fear of a day of reckoning verena committed herself to nothing more confirmatory than a kiss however which the old ladys displaced headgear enabled her to imprint upon her forehead and which caused miss birdseye to exclaim why verena tarrant how cold your lips are it was not surprising to verena to hear that her lips were cold a mortal chill had crept over her for she knew that this time she should have a tremendous scene with olive  she found her in her room to which she had fled on quitting mr ransoms presence she sat in the window having evidently sunk into a chair the moment she came in a position from which she must have seen verena walk through the garden and down to the water with the intruder she remained as she had collapsed quite prostrate her attitude was the same as that other time verena had found her waiting in new york what olive was likely to say to her first the girl scarcely knew her mind at any rate was full of an intention of her own she went straight to her and fell on her knees before her taking hold of the hands which were clasped together with nervous intensity in miss chancellors lap verena remained a moment looking up at her and then said  there is something i want to tell you now without a moments delay something i didnt tell you at the time it happened nor afterwards mr ransom came out to see me once at cambridge a little while before we went to new york he spent a couple of hours with me we took a walk together and saw the colleges it was after that that he wrote to mewhen i answered his letter as i told you in new york i didnt tell you then of his visit we had a great deal of talk about him and i kept that back i did so on purpose i cant explain why except that i didnt like to tell you and that i thought it better but now i want you to know everything when you know that you will know everything it was only one visitabout two hours i enjoyed it very muchhe seemed so much interested one reason i didnt tell you was that i didnt want you to know that he had come on to boston and called on me in cambridge without going to see you i thought it might affect you disagreeably i suppose you will think i deceived you certainly i left you with a wrong impression but now i want you to know allall  verena spoke with breathless haste and eagerness there was a kind of passion in the way she tried to expiate her former want of candour olive listened staring at first she seemed scarcely to understand but verena perceived that she understood sufficiently when she broke out you deceived meyou deceived me well i must say i like your deceit better than such dreadful revelations and what does anything matter when he has come after you now what does he wantwhat has he come for  he has come to ask me to be his wife  verena said this with the same eagerness with as determined an air of not incurring any reproach this time but as soon as she had spoken she buried her head in olives lap  olive made no attempt to raise it again and returned none of the pressure of her hands she only sat silent for a time during which verena wondered that the idea of the episode at cambridge laid bare only after so many months should not have struck her more deeply presently she saw it was because the horror of what had just happened drew her off from it at last olive asked is that what he told you off there by the water  yesand verena looked uphe wanted me to know it right away he says its only fair to you that he should give notice of his intentions he wants to try and make me like himso he says he wants to see more of me and he wants me to know him better  olive lay back in her chair with dilated eyes and parted lips verena tarrant what is there between you what can i hold on to what can i believe two hours in cambridge before we went to new york the sense that verena had been perfidious thereperfidious in her reticencenow began to roll over her mercy of heaven how you did act  olive it was to spare you  to spare me if you really wished to spare me he wouldnt be here now  miss chancellor flashed this out with a sudden violence a spasm which threw verena off and made her rise to her feet for an instant the two young women stood confronted and a person who had seen them at that moment might have taken them for enemies rather than friends but any such opposition could last but a few seconds verena replied with a tremor in her voice which was not that of passion but of charity do you mean that i expected him that i brought him i never in my life was more surprised at anything than when i saw him there  hasnt he the delicacy of one of his own slavedrivers doesnt he know you loathe him  verena looked at her friend with a degree of majesty which with her was rare i dont loathe himi only dislike his opinions  dislike oh misery and olive turned away to the open window leaning her forehead against the lifted sash  verena hesitated then went to her passing her arm round her dont scold me help mehelp me she murmured  olive gave her a sidelong look then catching her up and facing her againwill you come away now by the next train  flee from him again as i did in new york no no olive chancellor thats not the way verena went on reasoningly as if all the wisdom of the ages were seated on her lips then how can we leave miss birdseye in her state we must stay herewe must fight it out here  why not be honest if you have been falsereally honest not only half so why not tell him plainly that you love him  love him olive why i scarcely know him  youll have a chance if he stays a month  i dont dislike him certainly as you do but how can i love him when he tells me he wants me to give up everything all our work our faith our future never to give another address to open my lips in public how can i consent to that verena went on smiling strangely  he asks you that just that way  no its not that way its very kindly  kindly heaven help you dont grovel doesnt he know its my house olive added in a moment  of course he wont come into it if you forbid him  so that you may meet him in other placeson the shore in the country  i certainly shant avoid him hide away from him said verena proudly i thought i made you believe in new york that i really cared for our aspirations the way for me then is to meet him feeling conscious of my strength what if i do like him what does it matter i like my work in the world i like everything i believe in better  olive listened to this and the memory of how in the house in tenth street verena had rebuked her doubts professed her own faith anew came back to her with a force which made the present situation appear slightly less terrific nevertheless she gave no assent to the girls logic she only replied but you didnt meet him there you hurried away from new york after i was willing you should stay he affected you very much there you were not so calm when you came back to me from your expedition to the park as you pretend to be now to get away from him you gave up all the rest  i know i wasnt so calm but now i have had three months to think about itabout the way he affected me there i take it very quietly  no you dont you are not calm now  verena was silent a moment while olives eyes continued to search her accuse her condemn her its all the more reason you shouldnt give me stab after stab she replied with a gentleness which was infinitely touching  it had an instant effect upon olive she burst into tears threw herself on her friends bosom oh dont desert medont desert me or youll kill me in torture she moaned shuddering  you must help meyou must help me cried verena imploringly too     xxxvii   basil ransom spent nearly a month at marmion in announcing this fact i am very conscious of its extraordinary character poor olive may well have been thrown back into her alarms by his presenting himself there for after her return from new york she took to her soul the conviction that she had really done with him not only did the impulse of revulsion under which verena had demanded that their departure from tenth street should be immediate appear to her a proof that it had been sufficient for her young friend to touch mr ransoms moral texture with her finger as it were in order to draw back for ever but what she had learned from her companion of his own manifestations his apparent disposition to throw up the game added to her feeling of security he had spoken to verena of their little excursion as his last opportunity let her know that he regarded it not as the beginning of a more intimate acquaintance but as the end even of such relations as already existed between them he gave her up for reasons best known to himself if he wanted to frighten olive he judged that he had frightened her enough his southern chivalry suggested to him perhaps that he ought to let her off before he had worried her to death doubtless too he had perceived how vain it was to hope to make verena abjure a faith so solidly founded and though he admired her enough to wish to possess her on his own terms he shrank from the mortification which the future would have in keeping for himthat of finding that after six months of courting and in spite of all her sympathy her desire to do what people expected of her she despised his opinions as much as the first day olive chancellor was able to a certain extent to believe what she wished to believe and that was one reason why she had twisted verenas flight from new york just after she let her friend see how much she should like to drink deeper of the cup into a warrant for living in a fools paradise if she had been less afraid she would have read things more clearly she would have seen that we dont run away from people unless we fear them and that we dont fear them unless we know that we are unarmed verena feared basil ransom now though this time she declined to run but now she had taken up her weapons she had told olive she was exposed she had asked her to be her defence poor olive was stricken as she had never been before but the extremity of her danger gave her a desperate energy the only comfort in her situation was that this time verena had confessed her peril had thrown herself into her hands i like himi cant help iti do like him i dont want to marry him i dont want to embrace his ideas which are unspeakably false and horrible but i like him better than any gentleman i have seen so much as this the girl announced to her friend as soon as the conversation of which i have just given a sketch was resumed as it was very soon you may be sure and very often in the course of the next few days that was her way of saying that a great crisis had arrived in her life and the statement needed very little amplification to stand as a shy avowal that she too had succumbed to the universal passion olive had had her suspicions her terrors before but she perceived now how idle and foolish they had been and that this was a different affair from any of the phases of which she had hitherto anxiously watched the development as i say she felt it to be a considerable mercy that verenas attitude was frank for it gave her something to take hold of she could no longer be put off with sophistries about receiving visits from handsome and unscrupulous young men for the sake of the opportunities it gave one to convert them she took hold accordingly with passion with fury after the shock of ransoms arrival had passed away she determined that he should not find her chilled into dumb submission verena had told her that she wanted her to hold her tight to rescue her and there was no fear that for an instant she should sleep at her post  i like himi like him but i want to hate  you want to hate him olive broke in  no i want to hate my liking i want you to keep before me all the reasons why i shouldmany of them so fearfully important dont let me lose sight of anything dont be afraid i shall not be grateful when you remind me  that was one of the singular speeches that verena made in the course of their constant discussion of the terrible question and it must be confessed that she made a great many the strangest of all was when she protested as she did again and again to olive against the idea of their seeking safety in retreat she said there was a want of dignity in itthat she had been ashamed afterwards of what she had done in rushing away from new york this care for her moral appearance was on verenas part something new inasmuch as though she had struck that note on previous occasionshad insisted on its being her duty to face the accidents and alarms of lifeshe had never erected such a standard in the face of a disaster so sharply possible it was not her habit either to talk or to think about her dignity and when olive found her taking that tone she felt more than ever that the dreadful ominous fatal part of the situation was simply that now for the first time in all the history of their sacred friendship verena was not sincere she was not sincere when she told her that she wanted to be helped against mr ransomwhen she exhorted her that way to keep everything that was salutary and fortifying before her eyes olive did not go so far as to believe that she was playing a part and putting her off with words which glossing over her treachery only made it more cruel she would have admitted that that treachery was as yet unwitting that verena deceived herself first of all thinking she really wished to be saved her phrases about her dignity were insincere as well as her pretext that they must stay to look after miss birdseye as if doctor prance were not abundantly able to discharge that function and would not be enchanted to get them out of the house olive had perfectly divined by this time that doctor prance had no sympathy with their movement no general ideas that she was simply shut up to petty questions of physiological science and of her own professional activity she would never have invited her down if she had realised this in advance so much as the doctors dry detachment from all their discussions their readings and practisings her constant expeditions to fish and botanise subsequently enabled her to do she was very narrow but it did seem as if she knew more about miss birdseyes peculiar physical conditionsthey were very peculiarthan any one else and this was a comfort at a time when that admirable woman seemed to be suffering a loss of vitality  the great point is that it must be met some time and it will be a tremendous relief to have it over he is determined to have it out with me and if the battle doesnt come off today we shall have to fight it tomorrow i dont see why this isnt as good a time as any other my lecture for the music hall is as good as finished and i havent got anything else to do so i can give all my attention to our personal struggle it requires a good deal you would admit if you knew how wonderfully he can talk if we should leave this place tomorrow he would come after us to the very next one he would follow us everywhere a little while ago we could have escaped him because he says that then he had no money he hasnt got much now but he has got enough to pay his way he is so encouraged by the reception of his article by the editor of the rational review that he is sure that in future his pen will be a resource  these remarks were uttered by verena after basil ransom had been three days at marmion and when she reached this point her companion interrupted her with the inquiry is that what he proposes to support you withhis pen  oh yes of course he admits we should be terribly poor  and this vision of a literary career is based entirely upon an article that hasnt yet seen the light i dont see how a man of any refinement can approach a woman with so beggarly an account of his position in life  he says he wouldnthe would have been ashamedthree months ago that was why when we were in new york and he felt even thenwell so he says all he feels now he made up his mind not to persist to let me go but just lately a change has taken place his state of mind altered completely in the course of a week in consequence of the letter that editor wrote him about his contribution and his paying for it right off it was a remarkably flattering letter he says he believes in his future now he has before him a vision of distinction of influence and of fortune not great perhaps but sufficient to make life tolerable he doesnt think life is very delightful in the nature of things but one of the best things a man can do with it is to get hold of some woman of course she must please him very much to make it worth while whom he may draw close to him  and couldnt he get hold of any one but youamong all the exposed millions of our sex poor olive groaned why must he pick you out when everything he knew about you showed you to be exactly the very last  thats just what i have asked him and he only remarks that there is no reasoning about such things he fell in love with me that first evening at miss birdseyes so you see there was some ground for that mystic apprehension of yours it seems as if i pleased him more than any one  olive flung herself over on the couch burying her face in the cushions which she tumbled in her despair and moaning out that he didnt love verena he never had loved her it was only his hatred of their cause that made him pretend it he wanted to do that an injury to do it the worst he could think of he didnt love her he hated her he only wanted to smother her to crush her to kill heras she would infallibly see that he would if she listened to him it was because he knew that her voice had magic in it and from the moment he caught its first note he had determined to destroy it it was not tenderness that moved himit was devilish malignity tenderness would be incapable of requiring the horrible sacrifice that he was not ashamed to ask of requiring her to commit perjury and blasphemy to desert a work an interest with which her very heartstrings were interlaced to give the lie to her whole young past to her purest holiest ambitions olive put forward no claim of her own breathed at first at least not a word of remonstrance in the name of her personal loss of their blighted union she only dwelt upon the unspeakable tragedy of a defection from their standard of a failure on verenas part to carry out what she had undertaken of the horror of seeing her bright career blotted out with darkness and tears of the joy and elation that would fill the breast of all their adversaries at this illustrious consummate proof of the fickleness the futility the predestined servility of women a man had only to whistle for her and she who had pretended most was delighted to come and kneel at his feet olives most passionate protest was summed up in her saying that if verena were to forsake them it would put back the emancipation of women a hundred years she did not during these dreadful days talk continuously she had long periods of pale intensely anxious watchful silence interrupted by outbreaks of passionate argument entreaty invocation it was verena who talked incessantly verena who was in a state entirely new to her and as any one could see in an attitude entirely unnatural and overdone if she was deceiving herself as olive said there was something very affecting in her effort her ingenuity if she tried to appear to olive impartial coldly judicious in her attitude with regard to basil ransom and only anxious to see for the moral satisfaction of the thing how good a case as a lover he might make out for himself and how much he might touch her susceptibilities she endeavoured still more earnestly to practise this fraud upon her own imagination she abounded in every proof that she should be in despair if she should be overborne and she thought of arguments even more convincing if possible than olives why she should hold on to her old faith why she should resist even at the cost of acute temporary suffering she was voluble fluent feverish she was perpetually bringing up the subject as if to encourage her friend to show how she kept possession of her judgement how independent she remained  no stranger situation can be imagined than that of these extraordinary young women at this juncture it was so singular on verenas part in particular that i despair of presenting it to the reader with the air of reality to understand it one must bear in mind her peculiar frankness natural and acquired her habit of discussing questions sentiments moralities her education in the atmosphere of lecturerooms of séances her familiarity with the vocabulary of emotion the mysteries of the spiritual life she had learned to breathe and move in a rarefied air as she would have learned to speak chinese if her success in life had depended upon it but this dazzling trick and all her artlessly artful facilities were not a part of her essence an expression of her innermost preferences what was a part of her essence was the extraordinary generosity with which she could expose herself give herself away turn herself inside out for the satisfaction of a person who made demands of her olive as we know had made the reflexion that no one was naturally less preoccupied with the idea of her dignity and though verena put it forward as an excuse for remaining where they were it must be admitted that in reality she was very deficient in the desire to be consistent with herself olive had contributed with all her zeal to the development of verenas gift but i scarcely venture to think now what she may have said to herself in the secrecy of deep meditation about the consequences of cultivating an abundant eloquence did she say that verena was attempting to smother her now in her own phrases did she view with dismay the fatal effect of trying to have an answer for everything from olives condition during these lamentable weeks there is a certain proprietya delicacy enjoined by the respect for misfortunein averting our head she neither ate nor slept she could scarcely speak without bursting into tears she felt so implacably insidiously baffled she remembered the magnanimity with which she had declined the winter before the last to receive the vow of eternal maidenhood which she had at first demanded and then put by as too crude a test but which verena for a precious hour for ever flown would then have been willing to take she repented of it with bitterness and rage and then she asked herself more desperately still whether even if she held that pledge she should be brave enough to enforce it in the face of actual complications she believed that if it were in her power to say no i wont let you off i have your solemn word and i wont verena would bow to that decree and remain with her but the magic would have passed out of her spirit for ever the sweetness out of their friendship the efficacy out of their work she said to her again and again that she had utterly changed since that hour she came to her in new york after her morning with mr ransom and sobbed out that they must hurry away then she had been wounded outraged sickened and in the interval nothing had happened nothing but that one exchange of letters which she knew about to bring her round to a shameless tolerance shameless verena admitted it to be she assented over and over to this proposition and explained as eagerly each time as if it were the first what it was that had come to pass what it was that had brought her round it had simply come over her that she liked him that this was the true point of view the only one from which one could consider the situation in a way that would lead to what she called a real solutiona permanent rest on this particular point verena never responded in the liberal way i have mentioned without asseverating at the same time that what she desired most in the world was to prove the picture olive had held up from the first that a woman could live on persistently clinging to a great vivifying redemptory idea without the help of a man to testify to the end against the stale superstitionmother of every miserythat those gentry were as indispensable as they had proclaimed themselves on the housetopsthat she passionately protested was as inspiring a thought in the present poignant crisis as it had ever been  the one grain of comfort that olive extracted from the terrors that pressed upon her was that now she knew the worst she knew it since verena had told her after so long and so ominous a reticence of the detestable episode at cambridge that seemed to her the worst because it had been thunder in a clear sky the incident had sprung from a quarter from which months before all symptoms appeared to have vanished though verena had now done all she could to make up for her perfidious silence by repeating everything that passed between them as she sat with mr ransom in monadnoc place or strolled with him through the colleges it imposed itself upon olive that that occasion was the key of all that had happened since that he had then obtained an irremediable hold upon her if verena had spoken at the time she would never have let her go to new york the sole compensation for that hideous mistake was that the girl recognising it to the full evidently deemed now that she couldnt be communicative enough there were certain afternoons in august long beautiful and terrible when one felt that the summer was rounding its curve and the rustle of the fullleaved trees in the slanting golden light in the breeze that ought to be delicious seemed the voice of the coming autumn of the warnings and dangers of lifeportentous insufferable hours when as she sat under the softly swaying vineleaves of the trellis with miss birdseye and tried in order to still her nerves to read something aloud to her guest the sound of her own quavering voice made her think more of that baleful day at cambridge than even of the fact that at that very moment verena was off with mr ransomhad gone to take the little daily walk with him to which it had been arranged that their enjoyment of each others society should be reduced arranged i say but that is not exactly the word to describe the compromise arrived at by a kind of tacit exchange of tearful entreaty and tightened grasp after ransom had made it definite to verena that he was indeed going to stay a month and she had promised that she would not resort to base evasions to flight which would avail her nothing he notified her but would give him a chance would listen to him a few minutes every day he had insisted that the few minutes should be an hour and the way to spend it was obvious they wandered along the waterside to a rocky shrubcovered point which made a walk of just the right duration here all the homely languor of the region the mild fragrant capequality the sweetness of white sands quiet waters low promontories where there were paths among the barberries and tidal pools gleamed in the sunsethere all the spirit of a ripe summer afternoon seemed to hang in the air there were woodwalks too they sometimes followed bosky uplands where accident had grouped the trees with odd effects of style and where in grassy intervals and fragrant nooks of rest they came out upon sudden patches of arcady in such places verena listened to her companion with her watch in her hand and she wondered very sincerely how he could care for a girl who made the conditions of courtship so odious he had recognised of course at the very first that he could not inflict himself again upon miss chancellor and after that awkward morningcall i have described he did not again for the first three weeks of his stay at marmion penetrate into the cottage whose back windows overlooked the deserted shipyard olive as may be imagined made on this occasion no protest for the sake of being ladylike or of preventing him from putting her apparently in the wrong the situation between them was too grim it was war to the knife it was a question of which should pull hardest so verena took a tryst with the young man as if she had been a maidservant and basil ransom a follower they met a little way from the house beyond it outside the village     xxxviii   olive thought she knew the worst as we have perceived but the worst was really something she could not know inasmuch as up to this time verena chose as little to confide to her on that one point as she was careful to expatiate with her on every other the change that had taken place in the object of basil ransoms merciless devotion since the episode in new york was briefly just this changethat the words he had spoken to her there about her genuine vocation as distinguished from the hollow and factitious ideal with which her family and her association with olive chancellor had saddled herthese words the most effective and penetrating he had uttered had sunk into her soul and worked and fermented there she had come at last to believe them and that was the alteration the transformation they had kindled a light in which she saw herself afresh and strange to say liked herself better than in the old exaggerated glamour of the lecturelamps she could not tell olive this yet for it struck at the root of everything and the dreadful delightful sensation filled her with a kind of awe at all that it implied and portended she was to burn everything she had adored she was to adore everything she had burned the extraordinary part of it was that though she felt the situation to be as i say tremendously serious she was not ashamed of the treachery which sheyes decidedly by this time she must admit it to herselfshe meditated it was simply that the truth had changed sides that radiant image began to look at her from basil ransoms expressive eyes she loved she was in loveshe felt it in every throb of her being instead of being constituted by nature for entertaining that sentiment in an exceptionally small degree which had been the implication of her whole crusade the warrant for her offer of old to olive to renounce she was framed apparently to allow it the largest range the highest intensity it was always passion in fact but now the object was other formerly she had been convinced that the fire of her spirit was a kind of double flame one half of which was responsive friendship for a most extraordinary person and the other pity for the sufferings of women in general verena gazed aghast at the colourless dust into which in three short months counting from the episode in new york such a conviction as that could crumble she felt it must be a magical touch that could bring about such a cataclysm why basil ransom had been deputed by fate to exercise this spell was more than she could saypoor verena who up to so lately had flattered herself that she had a wizards wand in her own pocket  when she saw him a little way off about five oclockthe hour she usually went out to meet himwaiting for her at a bend of the road which lost itself after a winding straggling mile or two in the indented insulated point where the wandering bee droned through the hot hours with a vague misguided flight she felt that his tall watching figure with the low horizon behind represented well the importance the towering eminence he had in her mindthe fact that he was just now to her vision the most definite and upright the most incomparable object in the world if he had not been at his post when she expected him she would have had to stop and lean against something for weakness her whole being would have throbbed more painfully than it throbbed at present though finding him there made her nervous enough and who was he what was he she asked herself what did he offer her besides a chance in which there was no compensation of brilliancy or fashion to falsify in a conspicuous manner every hope and pledge she had hitherto given he allowed her certainly no illusion on the subject of the fate she should meet as his wife he flung over it no rosiness of promised ease he let her know that she should be poor withdrawn from view a partner of his struggle of his severe hard unique stoicism when he spoke of such things as these and bent his eyes on her she could not keep the tears from her own she felt that to throw herself into his life bare and arid as for the time it was was the condition of happiness for her and yet that the obstacles were terrible cruel it must not be thought that the revolution which was taking place in her was unaccompanied with suffering she suffered less than olive certainly for her bent was not like her friends in that direction but as the wheel of her experience went round she had the sensation of being ground very small indeed with her light bright texture her complacent responsiveness her genial graceful ornamental cast her desire to keep on pleasing others at the time when a force she had never felt before was pushing her to please herself poor verena lived in these days in a state of moral tensionwith a sense of being strained and achingwhich she didnt betray more only because it was absolutely not in her power to look desperate an immense pity for olive sat in her heart and she asked herself how far it was necessary to go in the path of selfsacrifice nothing was wanting to make the wrong she should do her complete she had deceived her up to the very last only three months earlier she had reasserted her vows given her word with every show of fidelity and enthusiasm there were hours when it seemed to verena that she must really push her inquiry no further but content herself with the conclusion that she loved as deeply as a woman could love and that it didnt make any difference she felt olives grasp too clinching too terrible she said to herself that she should never dare that she might as well give up early as late that the scene at the end would be something she couldnt face that she had no right to blast the poor creatures whole future she had a vision of those dreadful years she knew that olive would never get over the disappointment it would touch her in the point where she felt everything most keenly she would be incurably lonely and eternally humiliated it was a very peculiar thing their friendship it had elements which made it probably as complete as any between women that had ever existed of course it had been more on olives side than on hers she had always known that but that again didnt make any difference it was of no use for her to tell herself that olive had begun it entirely and she had only responded out of a kind of charmed politeness at first to a tremendous appeal she had lent herself given herself utterly and she ought to have known better if she didnt mean to abide by it at the end of three weeks she felt that her inquiry was complete but that after all nothing was gained except an immense interest in basil ransoms views and the prospect of an eternal heartache he had told her he wanted her to know him and now she knew him pretty thoroughly she knew him and she adored him but it didnt make any difference to give him up or to give olive upthis effort would be the greater of the two  if basil ransom had the advantage as far back as that day in new york of having struck a note which was to reverberate it may easily be imagined that he did not fail to follow it up if he had projected a new light into verenas mind and made the idea of giving herself to a man more agreeable to her than that of giving herself to a movement he found means to deepen this illumination to drag her former standard in the dust he was in a very odd situation indeed carrying on his siege with his hands tied as he had to do everything in an hour a day he perceived that he must confine himself to the essential the essential was to show her how much he loved her and then to press to press always to press his hovering about miss chancellors habitation without going in was a strange regimen to be subjected to and he was sorry not to see more of miss birdseye besides often not knowing what to do with himself in the mornings and evenings fortunately he had brought plenty of books volumes of rusty aspect picked up at new york bookstalls and in such an affair as this he could take the less when the more was forbidden him for the mornings sometimes he had the resource of doctor prance with whom he made a great many excursions on the water she was devoted to boating and an ardent fisherwoman and they used to pull out into the bay together cast their lines and talk a prodigious amount of heresy she met him as verena met him in the environs but in a different spirit he was immensely amused at her attitude and saw that nothing in the world could as he expressed it make her wink she would never blench nor show surprise she had an air of taking everything abnormal for granted betrayed no consciousness of the oddity of ransoms situation said nothing to indicate she had noticed that miss chancellor was in a frenzy or that verena had a daily appointment you might have supposed from her manner that it was as natural for ransom to sit on a fence half a mile off as in one of the red rockingchairs of the socalled shaker species which adorned miss chancellors back verandah the only thing our young man didnt like about doctor prance was the impression she gave him out of the crevices of her reticence he hardly knew how it leaked that she thought verena rather slim she took an ironical view of almost any kind of courtship and he could see she didnt wonder women were such featherheads so long as whatever brittle follies they cultivated they could get men to come and sit on fences for them doctor prance told him miss birdseye noticed nothing she had sunk within a few days into a kind of transfigured torpor she didnt seem to know whether mr ransom were anywhere round or not she guessed she thought he had just come down for a day and gone off again she probably supposed he just wanted to get toned up a little by miss tarrant sometimes out in the boat when she looked at him in vague sociable silence while she waited for a bite she delighted in a bite she had an expression of diabolical shrewdness when ransom was not scorching there beside her he didnt mind the sun of massachusetts he lounged about in the pastoral land which hung at a very moderate elevation above the shore he always had a book in his pocket and he lay under whispering trees and kicked his heels and made up his mind on what side he should take verena the next time at the end of a fortnight he had succeeded so he believed at least far better than he had hoped in this sense that the girl had now the air of making much more light of her gift he was indeed quite appalled at the facility with which she threw it over gave up the idea that it was useful and precious that had been what he wanted her to do and the fact of the sacrifice once she had fairly looked at it costing her so little only proved his contention only made it clear that it was not necessary to her happiness to spend half her life ranting no matter how prettily in public all the same he said to himself that to make up for the loss of whatever was sweet in the reputation of the thing he should have to be tremendously nice to her in all the coming years during the first week he was at marmion she made of him an inquiry which touched on this point  well if its all a mere delusion why should this facility have been given mewhy should i have been saddled with a superfluous talent i dont care much about iti dont mind telling you that but i confess i should like to know what is to become of all that part of me if i retire into private life and live as you say simply to be charming for you i shall be like a singer with a beautiful voice you have told me yourself my voice is beautiful who has accepted some decree of never raising a note isnt that a great waste a great violation of nature were not our talents given us to use and have we any right to smother them and deprive our fellowcreatures of such pleasure as they may confer in the arrangement you propose that was verenas way of speaking of the question of their marriage i dont see what provision is made for the poor faithful dismissed servant it is all very well to be charming to you but there are people who have told me that once i get on a platform i am charming to all the world there is no harm in my speaking of that because you have told me so yourself perhaps you intend to have a platform erected in our front parlour where i can address you every evening and put you to sleep after your work i say our front parlour as if it were certain we should have two it doesnt look as if our means would permit thatand we must have some place to dine if there is to be a platform in our sittingroom  my dear young woman it will be easy to solve the difficulty the diningtable itself shall be our platform and you shall mount on top of that this was basil ransoms sportive reply to his companions very natural appeal for light and the reader will remark that if it led her to push her investigation no further she was very easily satisfied there was more reason however as well as more appreciation of a very considerable mystery in what he went on to say charming to me charming to all the world what will become of your charmis that what you want to know it will be about five thousand times greater than it is now thats what will become of it we shall find plenty of room for your facility it will lubricate our whole existence believe me miss tarrant these things will take care of themselves you wont sing in the music hall but you will sing to me you will sing to every one who knows you and approaches you your gift is indestructible dont talk as if i either wanted to wipe it out or should be able to make it a particle less divine i want to give it another direction certainly but i dont want to stop your activity your gift is the gift of expression and there is nothing i can do for you that will make you less expressive it wont gush out at a fixed hour and on a fixed day but it will irrigate it will fertilise it will brilliantly adorn your conversation think how delightful it will be when your influence becomes really social your facility as you call it will simply make you in conversation the most charming woman in america  it is to be feared indeed that verena was easily satisfied convinced i mean not that she ought to succumb to him but that there were lovely neglected almost unsuspected truths on his side and there is further evidence on the same head in the fact that after the first once or twice she found nothing to say to him much as she was always saying to herself about the cruel effect her apostasy would have upon olive she forbore to plead that reason after she had seen how angry it made him and with how almost savage a contempt he denounced so flimsy a pretext he wanted to know since when it was more becoming to take up with a morbid old maid than with an honourable young man and when verena pronounced the sacred name of friendship he inquired what fanatical sophistry excluded him from a similar privilege she had told him in a moment of expansion verena believed she was immensely on her guard but her guard was very apt to be lowered that his visits to marmion cast in olives view a remarkable light upon his chivalry she chose to regard his resolute pursuit of verena as a covert persecution of herself verena repented as soon as she had spoken of having given further currency to this taunt but she perceived the next moment no harm was done basil ransom taking in perfectly good part miss chancellors reflexions on his delicacy and making them the subject of much free laughter she could not know for in the midst of his hilarity the young man did not compose himself to tell her that he had made up his mind on this question before he left new yorkas long ago as when he wrote her the note subsequent to her departure from that city to which allusion has already been made and which was simply the fellow of the letter addressed to her after his visit to cambridge a friendly respectful yet rather pregnant sign that decidedly on second thoughts separation didnt imply for him the intention of silence we know a little about his second thoughts as much as is essential and especially how the occasion of their springing up had been the windfall of an editors encouragement the importance of that encouragement to basils imagination was doubtless much augmented by his desire for an excuse to take up again a line of behaviour which he had forsworn small as had as yet been his opportunity to indulge in it very much less than he supposed still it worked an appreciable revolution in his view of his case and made him ask himself what amount of consideration he should from the most refined southern point of view owe miss chancellor in the event of his deciding to go after verena tarrant in earnest he was not slow to decide that he owed her none chivalry had to do with ones relations with people one hated not with those one loved he didnt hate poor miss olive though she might make him yet and even if he did any chivalry was all moonshine which should require him to give up the girl he adored in order that his third cousin should see he could be gallant chivalry was forbearance and generosity with regard to the weak and there was nothing weak about miss olive she was a fighting woman and she would fight him to the death giving him not an inch of odds he felt that she was fighting there all day long in her cottage fortress her resistance was in the air he breathed and verena came out to him sometimes quite limp and pale from the tussle  it was in the same jocose spirit with which he regarded olives view of the sort of standard a mississippian should live up to that he talked to verena about the lecture she was preparing for her great exhibition at the music hall he learned from her that she was to take the field in the manner of mrs farrinder for a winter campaign carrying with her a tremendous big gun her engagements were all made her route was marked out she expected to repeat her lecture in about fifty different places it was to be called a womans reason and both olive and miss birdseye thought it so far as they could tell in advance her most promising effort she wasnt going to trust to inspiration this time she didnt want to meet a big boston audience without knowing where she was inspiration moreover seemed rather to have faded away in consequence of olives influence she had read and studied so much that it seemed now as if everything must take form beforehand olive was a splendid critic whether he liked her or not and she had made her go over every word of her lecture twenty times there wasnt an intonation she hadnt made her practise it was very different from the old system when her father had worked her up if basil considered women superficial it was a pity he couldnt see what olives standard of preparation was or be present at their rehearsals in the evening in their little parlour ransoms state of mind in regard to the affair at the music hall was simply thisthat he was determined to circumvent it if he could he covered it with ridicule in talking of it to verena and the shafts he levelled at it went so far that he could see she thought he exaggerated his dislike to it in point of fact he could not have overstated that so odious did the idea seem to him that she was soon to be launched in a more infatuated career he vowed to himself that she should never take that fresh start which would commit her irretrievably if she should succeed and she would succeedhe had not the slightest doubt of her power to produce a sensation in the music hall to the acclamations of the newspapers he didnt care for her engagements her campaigns or all the expectancy of her friends to squelch all that at a stroke was the dearest wish of his heart it would represent to him his own success it would symbolise his victory it became a fixed idea with him and he warned her again and again when she laughed and said she didnt see how he could stop her unless he kidnapped her he really pitied her for not perceiving beneath his ominous pleasantries the firmness of his resolution he felt almost capable of kidnapping her it was palpably in the air that she would become widely popular and that idea simply sickened him he felt as differently as possible about it from mr matthias pardon  one afternoon as he returned with verena from a walk which had been accomplished completely within the prescribed conditions he saw from a distance doctor prance who had emerged bareheaded from the cottage and shading her eyes from the red declining sun was looking up and down the road it was part of the regulation that ransom should separate from verena before reaching the house and they had just paused to exchange their last words which every day promoted the situation more than any others when doctor prance began to beckon to them with much animation they hurried forward verena pressing her hand to her heart for she had instantly guessed that something terrible had happened to oliveshe had given out fainted away perhaps fallen dead with the cruelty of the strain doctor prance watched them come with a curious look in her face it was not a smile but a kind of exaggerated intimation that she noticed nothing in an instant she had told them what was the matter miss birdseye had had a sudden weakness she had remarked abruptly that she was dying and her pulse sure enough had fallen to nothing she was down on the piazza with miss chancellor and herself and they had tried to get her up to bed but she wouldnt let them move her she was passing away and she wanted to pass away just there in such a pleasant place in her customary chair looking at the sunset she asked for miss tarrant and miss chancellor told her she was outwalking with mr ransom then she wanted to know if mr ransom was still thereshe supposed he had gone basil knew by verena apart from this that his name had not been mentioned to the old lady since the morning he saw her she expressed a wish to see himshe had something to say to him and miss chancellor told her that he would be back soon with verena and that they would bring him in miss birdseye said she hoped they wouldnt be long because she was sinking and doctor prance now added like a person who knew what she was talking about that it was in fact the end she had darted out two or three times to look for them and they must step right in verena had scarcely given her time to tell her story she had already rushed into the house ransom followed with doctor prance conscious that for him the occasion was doubly solemn inasmuch as if he was to see poor miss birdseye yield up her philanthropic soul he was on the other hand doubtless to receive from miss chancellor a reminder that she had no intention of quitting the game  by the time he had made this reflexion he stood in the presence of his kinswoman and her venerable guest who was sitting just as he had seen her before muffled and bonneted on the back piazza of the cottage olive chancellor was on one side of her holding one of her hands and on the other was verena who had dropped on her knees close to her bending over those of the old lady did you ask for medid you want me the girl said tenderly i will never leave you again  oh i wont keep you long i only wanted to see you once more miss birdseyes voice was very low like that of a person breathing with difficulty but it had no painful nor querulous noteit expressed only the cheerful weariness which had marked all this last period of her life and which seemed to make it now as blissful as it was suitable that she should pass away her head was thrown back against the top of the chair the ribbon which confined her ancient hat hung loose and the late afternoon light covered her octogenarian face and gave it a kind of fairness a double placidity there was to ransom something almost august in the trustful renunciation of her countenance something in it seemed to say that she had been ready long before but as the time was not ripe she had waited with her usual faith that all was for the best only at present since the right conditions met she couldnt help feeling that it was quite a luxury the greatest she had ever tasted ransom knew why it was that verena had tears in her eyes as she looked up at her patient old friend she had spoken to him often during the last three weeks of the stories miss birdseye had told her of the great work of her life her mission repeated year after year among the southern blacks she had gone among them with every precaution to teach them to read and write she had carried them bibles and told them of the friends they had in the north who prayed for their deliverance ransom knew that verena didnt reproduce these legends with a view to making him ashamed of his southern origin his connexion with people who in a past not yet remote had made that kind of apostleship necessary he knew this because she had heard what he thought of all that chapter himself he had given her a kind of historical summary of the slavery question which left her no room to say that he was more tender to that particular example of human imbecility than he was to any other but she had told him that this was what she would have liked to doto wander alone with her life in her hand on an errand of mercy through a country in which society was arrayed against her she would have liked it much better than simply talking about the right from the gaslighted vantage of the new england platform ransom had replied simply balderdash it being his theory as we have perceived that he knew much more about verenas native bent than the young lady herself this did not however as he was perfectly aware prevent her feeling that she had come too late for the heroic age of new england life and regarding miss birdseye as a battered immemorial monument of it ransom could share such an admiration as that especially at this moment he had said to verena more than once that he wished he might have met the old lady in carolina or georgia before the warshown her round among the negroes and talked over new england ideas with her there were a good many he didnt care much about now but at that time they would have been tremendously refreshing miss birdseye had given herself away so lavishly all her life that it was rather odd there was anything left of her for the supreme surrender when he looked at olive he saw that she meant to ignore him and during the few minutes he remained on the spot his kinswoman never met his eye she turned away indeed as soon as doctor prance said leaning over miss birdseye i have brought mr ransom to you dont you remember you asked for him  i am very glad to see you again ransom remarked it was very good of you to think of me at the sound of his voice olive rose and left her place she sank into a chair at the other end of the piazza turning round to rest her arms on the back and bury her head in them  miss birdseye looked at the young man still more dimly than she had ever done before i thought you were gone you never came back  he spends all his time in long walks he enjoys the country so much verena said  well its very beautiful what i see from here i havent been strong enough to move round since the first days but i am going to move now she smiled when ransom made a gesture as if to help her and added oh i dont mean i am going to move out of my chair  mr ransom has been out in a boat with me several times i have been showing him how to cast a line said doctor prance who appeared to deprecate a sentimental tendency  oh well then you have been one of our party there seems to be every reason why you should feel that you belong to us miss birdseye looked at the visitor with a sort of misty earnestness as if she wished to communicate with him further then her glance turned slightly aside she tried to see what had become of olive she perceived that miss chancellor had withdrawn herself and closing her eyes she mused ineffectually on the mystery she had not grasped the peculiarity of basil ransoms relations with her hostess she was visibly too weak to concern herself with it very actively she only felt now that she seemed really to be going a desire to reconcile and harmonise but she presently exhaled a low soft sigha kind of confession that it was too mixed that she gave it up ransom had feared for a moment that she was about to indulge in some appeal to olive some attempt to make him join hands with that young lady as a supreme satisfaction to herself but he saw that her strength failed her and that besides things were getting less clear to her to his considerable relief inasmuch as though he would not have objected to joining hands the expression of miss chancellors figure and her averted face with their desperate collapse showed him well enough how she would have met such a proposal what miss birdseye clung to with benignant perversity was the idea that in spite of his exclusion from the house which was perhaps only the result of a certain highstrung jealousy on olives part of her friends other personal ties verena had drawn him in had made him sympathise with the great reform and desire to work for it ransom saw no reason why such an illusion should be dear to miss birdseye his contact with her in the past had been so momentary that he could not account for her taking an interest in his views in his throwing his weight into the right scale it was part of the general desire for justice that fermented within her the passion for progress and it was also in some degree her interest in verenaa suspicion innocent and idyllic as any such suspicion on miss birdseyes part must be that there was something between them that the closest of all unions as miss birdseye at least supposed it was was preparing itself then his being a southerner gave a point to the whole thing to bring round a southerner would be a real encouragement for one who had seen even at a time when she was already an old woman what was the tone of opinion in the cotton states ransom had no wish to discourage her and he bore well in mind the caution doctor prance had given him about destroying her last theory he only bowed his head very humbly not knowing what he had done to earn the honour of being the subject of it his eyes met verenas as she looked up at him from her place at miss birdseyes feet and he saw she was following his thought throwing herself into it and trying to communicate to him a wish the wish touched him immensely she was dreadfully afraid he would betray her to miss birdseyelet her know how she had cooled off verena was ashamed of that now and trembled at the danger of exposure her eyes adjured him to be careful of what he said her tremor made him glow a little in return for it seemed to him the fullest confession of his influence she had yet made  we have been a very happy little party she said to the old lady it is delightful that you should have been able to be with us all these weeks  it has been a great rest i am very tired i cant speak much it has been a lovely time i have done so muchso many things  i guess i wouldnt talk much miss birdseye said doctor prance who had now knelt down on the other side of her we know how much you have done dont you suppose every one knows your life  it isnt muchonly i tried to take hold when i look back from here from where weve sat i can measure the progress thats what i wanted to say to you and mr ransombecause im going fast hold on to me thats right but you cant keep me i dont want to stay now i presume i shall join some of the others that we lost long ago their faces come back to me now quite fresh it seems as if they might be waiting as if they were all there as if they wanted to hear you mustnt think theres no progress because you dont see it all right off thats what i wanted to say it isnt till you have gone a long way that you can feel whats been done thats what i see when i look back from here i see that the community wasnt half waked up when i was young  it is you that have waked it up more than any one else and its for that we honour you miss birdseye verena cried with a sudden violence of emotion if you were to live for a thousand years you would think only of othersyou would think only of helping on humanity you are our heroine you are our saint and there has never been any one like you verena had no glance for ransom now and there was neither deprecation nor entreaty in her face a wave of contrition of shame had swept over hera quick desire to atone for her secret swerving by a renewed recognition of the nobleness of such a life as miss birdseyes  oh i havent effected very much i have only cared and hoped you will do more than i have ever doneyou and olive chancellor because you are young and bright brighter than i ever was and besides everything has got started  well youve got started miss birdseye doctor prance remarked with raised eyebrows protesting dryly but kindly and putting forward with an air as if after all it didnt matter much an authority that had been superseded the manner in which this competent little woman indulged her patient showed sufficiently that the good lady was sinking fast  we will think of you always and your name will be sacred to us and that will teach us singleness and devotion verena went on in the same tone still not meeting ransoms eyes again and speaking as if she were trying now to stop herself to tie herself by a vow  well its the thing you and olive have given your lives to that has absorbed me most of late years i did want to see justice doneto us i havent seen it but you will and olive will where is shewhy isnt she near me to bid me farewell and mr ransom willand he will be proud to have helped  oh mercy mercy cried verena burying her head in miss birdseyes lap  you are not mistaken if you think i desire above all things that your weakness your generosity should be protected ransom said rather ambiguously but with pointed respectfulness i shall remember you as an example of what women are capable of he added and he had no subsequent compunctions for the speech for he thought poor miss birdseye for all her absence of profile essentially feminine  a kind of frantic moan from olive chancellor responded to these words which had evidently struck her as an insolent sarcasm and at the same moment doctor prance sent ransom a glance which was an adjuration to depart  goodbye olive chancellor miss birdseye murmured i dont want to stay though i should like to see what you will see  i shall see nothing but shame and ruin olive shrieked rushing across to her old friend while ransom discreetly quitted the scene     xxxix   he met doctor prance in the village the next morning and as soon as he looked at her he saw that the event which had been impending at miss chancellors had taken place it was not that her aspect was funereal but it contained somehow an announcement that she had for the present no more thought to give to casting a line miss birdseye had quietly passed away in the evening an hour or two after ransoms visit they had wheeled her chair into the house there had been nothing to do but wait for complete extinction miss chancellor and miss tarrant had sat by her there without moving each of her hands in theirs and she had just melted away towards eight oclock it was a lovely death doctor prance intimated that she had never seen any that she thought more seasonable she added that she was a good womanone of the old sort and that was the only funeral oration that basil ransom was destined to hear pronounced upon miss birdseye the impression of the simplicity and humility of her end remained with him and he reflected more than once during the days that followed that the absence of pomp and circumstance which had marked her career marked also the consecration of her memory she had been almost celebrated she had been active earnest ubiquitous beyond any one else she had given herself utterly to charities and creeds and causes and yet the only persons apparently to whom her death made a real difference were three young women in a small framehouse on cape cod ransom learned from doctor prance that her mortal remains were to be committed to their rest in the little cemetery at marmion in sight of the pretty seaview she loved to gaze at among old mossy headstones of mariners and fisherfolk she had seen the place when she first came down when she was able to drive out a little and she had said she thought it must be pleasant to lie there it was not an injunction a definite request it had not occurred to miss birdseye at the end of her days to take an exacting line or to make for the first time in eighty years a personal claim but olive chancellor and verena had put their construction on her appreciation of the quietest corner of the striving suffering world so weary a pilgrim of philanthropy had ever beheld  in the course of the day ransom received a note of five lines from verena the purport of which was to tell him that he must not expect to see her again for the present she wished to be very quiet and think things over she added the recommendation that he should leave the neighbourhood for three or four days there were plenty of strange old places to see in that part of the country ransom meditated deeply on this missive and perceived that he should be guilty of very bad taste in not immediately absenting himself he knew that to olive chancellors vision his conduct already wore that stain and it was useless therefore for him to consider how he could displease her either less or more but he wished to convey to verena the impression that he would do anything in the wide world to gratify her except give her up and as he packed his valise he had an idea that he was both behaving beautifully and showing the finest diplomatic sense to go away proved to himself how secure he felt what a conviction he had that however she might turn and twist in his grasp he held her fast the emotion she had expressed as he stood there before poor miss birdseye was only one of her instinctive contortions he had taken due note of thatsaid to himself that a good many more would probably occur before she would be quiet a woman that listens is lost the old proverb says and what had verena done for the last three weeks but listennot very long each day but with a degree of attention of which her not withdrawing from marmion was the measure she had not told him that olive wanted to whisk her away but he had not needed this confidence to know that if she stayed on the field it was because she preferred to she probably had an idea she was fighting but if she should fight no harder than she had fought up to now he should continue to take the same view of his success she meant her request that he should go away for a few days as something combative but decidedly he scarcely felt the blow he liked to think that he had great tact with women and he was sure verena would be struck with this quality in reading in the note he presently addressed her in reply to her own that he had determined to take a little run to provincetown as there was no one under the rather ineffectual roof which sheltered him to whose hand he could entrust the billetat the marmion hotel one had to be ones own messengerhe walked to the village postoffice to request that his note should be put into miss chancellors box here he met doctor prance for a second time that day she had come to deposit the letters by which olive notified a few of miss birdseyes friends of the time and place of her obsequies this young lady was shut up with verena and doctor prance was transacting all their business for them ransom felt that he made no admission that would impugn his estimate of the sex to which she in a manner belonged in reflecting that she would acquit herself of these delegated duties with the greatest rapidity and accuracy he told her he was going to absent himself for a few days and expressed a friendly hope that he should find her at marmion on his return  her keen eye gauged him a moment to see if he were joking then she said well i presume you think i can do as i like but i cant  you mean you have got to go back to work  well yes my place is empty in the city  so is every other place you had better remain till the end of the season  its all one season to me i want to see my officeslate i wouldnt have stayed so long for any one but her  well then goodbye ransom said i shall always remember our little expeditions and i wish you every professional distinction  thats why i want to go back doctor prance replied with her flat limited manner he kept her a moment he wanted to ask her about verena while he was hesitating how to form his question she remarked evidently wishing to leave him a little memento of her sympathy well i hope you will be able to follow up your views  my views miss prance i am sure i have never mentioned them to you then ransom added how is miss tarrant today is she more calm  oh no she isnt calm at all doctor prance answered very definitely  do you mean shes excited emotional  well she doesnt talk shes perfectly still and so is miss chancellor theyre as still as two watchersthey dont speak but you can hear the silence vibrate  vibrate  well they are very nervous  ransom was confident as i say yet the effort that he made to extract a good omen from this characterisation of the two ladies at the cottage was not altogether successful he would have liked to ask doctor prance whether she didnt think he might count on verena in the end but he was too shy for this the subject of his relations with miss tarrant never yet having been touched upon between them and besides he didnt care to hear himself put a question which was more or less an implication of a doubt so he compromised with a sort of oblique and general inquiry about olive that might draw some light what do you think of miss chancellorhow does she strike you  doctor prance reflected a little with an apparent consciousness that he meant more than he asked well shes losing flesh she presently replied and ransom turned away not encouraged and feeling that no doubt the little doctress had better go back to her officeslate  he did the thing handsomely remained at provincetown a week inhaling the delicious air smoking innumerable cigars and lounging among the ancient wharves where the grass grew thick and the impression of fallen greatness was still stronger than at marmion like his friends the bostonians he was very nervous there were days when he felt he must rush back to the margin of that mild inlet the voices of the air whispered to him that in his absence he was being outwitted nevertheless he stayed the time he had determined to stay quieting himself with the reflexion that there was nothing they could do to elude him unless perhaps they should start again for europe which they were not likely to do if miss olive tried to hide verena away in the united states he would undertake to find herthough he was obliged to confess that a flight to europe would baffle him owing to his want of cash for pursuit nothing however was less probable than that they would cross the atlantic on the eve of verenas projected début at the music hall before he went back to marmion he wrote to this young lady to announce his reappearance there and let her know that he expected she would come out to meet him the morning after this conveyed the assurance that he intended to take as much of the day as he could get he had had enough of the system of dragging through all the hours till a mere fraction of time was left before night and he couldnt wait so long at any rate the day after his return it was the afternoon train that had brought him back from provincetown and in the evening he ascertained that the bostonians had not deserted the field there were lights in the windows of the house under the elms and he stood where he had stood that evening with doctor prance and listened to the waves of verenas voice as she rehearsed her lecture there were no waves this time no sounds and no sign of life but the lamps the place had apparently not ceased to be given over to the conscious silence described by doctor prance ransom felt that he gave an immense proof of chivalry in not calling upon verena to grant him an interview on the spot she had not answered his last note but the next day she kept the tryst at the hour he had proposed he saw her advance along the road in a white dress under a big parasol and again he found himself liking immensely the way she walked he was dismayed however at her face and what it portended pale with red eyes graver than she had ever been before she appeared to have spent the period of his absence in violent weeping yet that it was not for him she had been crying was proved by the very first word she spoke  i only came out to tell you definitely its impossible i have thought over everything taking plenty of timeover and over and that is my answer finally positively you must take ityou shall have no other  basil ransom gazed frowning fearfully and why not pray  because i cant i cant i cant i cant she repeated passionately with her altered distorted face  damnation murmured the young man he seized her hand drew it into his arm forcing her to walk with him along the road  that afternoon olive chancellor came out of her house and wandered for a long time upon the shore she looked up and down the bay at the sails that gleamed on the blue water shifting in the breeze and the light they were a source of interest to her that they had never been before it was a day she was destined never to forget she felt it to be the saddest the most wounding of her life unrest and haunting fear had not possession of her now as they had held her in new york when basil ransom carried off verena to mark her for his own in the park but an immeasurable load of misery seemed to sit upon her soul she ached with the bitterness of her melancholy she was dumb and cold with despair she had spent the violence of her terror the eagerness of her grief and now she was too weary to struggle with fate she appeared to herself almost to have accepted it as she wandered forth in the beautiful afternoon with the knowledge that the ten minutes which verena had told her she meant to devote to mr ransom that morning had developed suddenly into an embarkation for the day they had gone out in a boat together one of the village worthies from whom small craft were to be hired had at verenas request sent his little son to miss chancellors cottage with that information she had not understood whether they had taken the boatman with them even when the information came and it came at a moment of considerable reassurance olives nerves were not ploughed up by it as they had been for instance by the other expedition in new york and she could measure the distance she had traversed since then it had not driven her away on the instant to pace the shore in frenzy to challenge every boat that passed and beg that the young lady who was sailing somewhere in the bay with a dark gentleman with long hair should be entreated immediately to return on the contrary after the first quiver of pain inflicted by the news she had been able to occupy herself to look after her house to write her mornings letters to go into her accounts which she had had some time on her mind she had wanted to put off thinking for she knew to what hideous recognitions that would bring her round again these were summed up in the fact that verena was now not to be trusted for an hour she had sworn to her the night before with a face like a lacerated angels that her choice was made that their union and their work were more to her than any other life could ever be and that she deeply believed that should she forswear these holy things she would simply waste away in the end with remorse and shame she would see mr ransom just once more for ten minutes to utter one or two supreme truths to him and then they would take up their old happy active fruitful days again would throw themselves more than ever into their splendid effort olive had seen how verena was moved by miss birdseyes death how at the sight of that unique womans majestically simple withdrawal from a scene in which she had held every vulgar aspiration every worldly standard and lure so cheap the girl had been touched again with the spirit of their most confident hours had flamed up with the faith that no narrow personal joy could compare in sweetness with the idea of doing something for those who had always suffered and who waited still this helped olive to believe that she might begin to count upon her again conscious as she was at the same time that verena had been strangely weakened and strained by her odious ordeal oh olive knew that she loved himknew what the passion was with which the wretched girl had to struggle and she did her the justice to believe that her professions were sincere her effort was real harassed and embittered as she was olive chancellor still proposed to herself to be rigidly just and that is why she pitied verena now with an unspeakable pity regarded her as the victim of an atrocious spell and reserved all her execration and contempt for the author of their common misery if verena had stepped into a boat with him half an hour after declaring that she would give him his dismissal in twenty words that was because he had ways known to himself and other men of creating situations without an issue of forcing her to do things she could do only with sharp repugnance under the menace of pain that would be sharper still but all the same what actually stared her in the face was that verena was not to be trusted even after rallying again as passionately as she had done during the days that followed miss birdseyes death olive would have liked to know the pang of penance that she would have been afraid in her place to incur to see the locked door which she would not have managed to force open  this inexpressibly mournful sense that after all verena in her exquisite delicacy and generosity was appointed only to show how women had from the beginning of time been the sport of mens selfishness and avidity this dismal conviction accompanied olive on her walk which lasted all the afternoon and in which she found a kind of tragic relief she went very far keeping in the lonely places unveiling her face to the splendid light which seemed to make a mock of the darkness and bitterness of her spirit there were little sandy coves where the rocks were clean where she made long stations sinking down in them as if she hoped she should never rise again it was the first time she had been out since miss birdseyes death except the hour when with the dozen sympathisers who came from boston she stood by the tired old womans grave since then for three days she had been writing letters narrating describing to those who hadnt come there were some she thought who might have managed to do so instead of despatching her pages of diffuse reminiscence and asking her for all particulars in return selah tarrant and his wife had come obtrusively as she thought for they never had had very much intercourse with miss birdseye and if it was for verenas sake verena was there to pay every tribute herself mrs tarrant had evidently hoped miss chancellor would ask her to stay on at marmion but olive felt how little she was in a state for such heroics of hospitality it was precisely in order that she should not have to do that sort of thing that she had given selah such considerable sums on two occasions at a years interval if the tarrants wanted a change of air they could travel all over the countrytheir present means permitted it they could go to saratoga or newport if they liked their appearance showed that they could put their hands into their pockets or into hers at least mrs tarrants did selah still sported on a hot day in august his immemorial waterproof but his wife rustled over the low tombstones at marmion in garments of which little as she was versed in such inquiries olive could see that the cost had been large besides after doctor prance had gone when all was over she felt what a relief it was that verena and she could be just togethertogether with the monstrous wedge of a question that had come up between them that was company enough great heaven and she had not got rid of such an inmate as doctor prance only to put mrs tarrant in her place  did verenas strange aberration on this particular day suggest to olive that it was no use striving that the world was all a great trap or trick of which women were ever the punctual dupes so that it was the worst of the curse that rested upon them that they must most humiliate those who had most their cause at heart did she say to herself that their weakness was not only lamentable but hideoushideous their predestined subjection to mans larger and grosser insistence did she ask herself why she should give up her life to save a sex which after all didnt wish to be saved and which rejected the truth even after it had bathed them with its auroral light and they had pretended to be fed and fortified these are mysteries into which i shall not attempt to enter speculations with which i have no concern it is sufficient for us to know that all human effort had never seemed to her so barren and thankless as on that fatal afternoon her eyes rested on the boats she saw in the distance and she wondered if in one of them verena were floating to her fate but so far from straining forward to beckon her home she almost wished that she might glide away for ever that she might never see her again never undergo the horrible details of a more deliberate separation olive lived over in her miserable musings her life for the last two years she knew again how noble and beautiful her scheme had been but how it had all rested on an illusion of which the very thought made her feel faint and sick what was before her now was the reality with the beautiful indifferent sky pouring down its complacent rays upon it the reality was simply that verena had been more to her than she ever was to verena and that with her exquisite natural art the girl had cared for their cause only because for the time no interest no fascination was greater her talent the talent which was to achieve such wonders was nothing to her it was too easy she could leave it alone as she might close her piano for months it was only to olive that it was everything verena had submitted she had responded she had lent herself to olives incitement and exhortation because she was sympathetic and young and abundant and fanciful but it had been a kind of hothouse loyalty the mere contagion of example and a sentiment springing up from within had easily breathed a chill upon it did olive ask herself whether for so many months her companion had been only the most unconscious and most successful of humbugs here again i must plead a certain incompetence to give an answer positive it is that she spared herself none of the inductions of a reverie that seemed to dry up the mists and ambiguities of life these hours of backward clearness come to all men and women once at least when they read the past in the light of the present with the reasons of things like unobserved fingerposts protruding where they never saw them before the journey behind them is mapped out and figured with its false steps its wrong observations all its infatuated deluded geography they understand as olive understood but it is probable that they rarely suffer as she suffered the sense of regret for her baffled calculations burned within her like a fire and the splendour of the vision over which the curtain of mourning now was dropped brought to her eyes slow still tears tears that came one by one neither easing her nerves nor lightening her load of pain she thought of her innumerable talks with verena of the pledges they had exchanged of their earnest studies their faithful work their certain reward the winter nights under the lamp when they thrilled with previsions as just and a passion as high as had ever found shelter in a pair of human hearts the pity of it the misery of such a fall after such a flight could express itself only as the poor girl prolonged the vague pauses of her unnoticed ramble in a low inarticulate murmur of anguish  the afternoon waned bringing with it the slight chill which at the summers end begins to mark the shortening days she turned her face homeward and by this time became conscious that if verenas companion had not yet brought her back there might be ground for uneasiness as to what had happened to them it seemed to her that no sailboat could have put into the town without passing more or less before her eyes and showing her whom it carried she had seen a dozen freighted only with the figures of men an accident was perfectly possible what could ransom with his plantation habits know about the management of a sail and once that danger loomed before herthe signal loveliness of the weather had prevented its striking her beforeolives imagination hurried with a bound to the worst she saw the boat overturned and drifting out to sea and after a week of nameless horror the body of an unknown young woman defaced beyond recognition but with long auburn hair and in a white dress washed up in some faraway cove an hour before her mind had rested with a sort of relief on the idea that verena should sink for ever beneath the horizon so that their tremendous trouble might never be but now with the lateness of the hour a sharp immediate anxiety took the place of that intended resignation and she quickened her step with a heart that galloped too as she went then it was above all that she felt how she had understood friendship and how never again to see the face of the creature she had taken to her soul would be for her as the stroke of blindness the twilight had become thick by the time she reached marmion and paused for an instant in front of her house over which the elms that stood on the grassy wayside appeared to her to hang a blacker curtain than ever before  there was no candle in any window and when she pushed in and stood in the hall listening a moment her step awakened no answering sound her heart failed her verenas staying out in a boat from ten oclock in the morning till nightfall was too unnatural and she gave a cry as she rushed into the low dim parlour darkened on one side at that hour by the widearmed foliage and on the other by the veranda and trellis which expressed only a wild personal passion a desire to take her friend in her arms again on any terms even the most cruel to herself the next moment she started back with another and a different exclamation for verena was in the room motionless in a cornerthe first place in which she had seated herself on reentering the houselooking at her with a silent face which seemed strange unnatural in the dusk olive stopped short and for a minute the two women remained as they were gazing at each other in the dimness after that too olive still said nothing she only went to verena and sat down beside her she didnt know what to make of her manner she had never been like that before she was unwilling to speak she seemed crushed and humbled this was almost the worstif anything could be worse than what had gone before and olive took her hand with an irresistible impulse of compassion and assurance from the way it lay in her own she guessed her whole feelingsaw it was a kind of shame shame for her weakness her swift surrender her insane gyration in the morning verena expressed it by no protest and no explanation she appeared not even to wish to hear the sound of her own voice her silence itself was an appealan appeal to olive to ask no questions she could trust her to inflict no spoken reproach only to wait till she could lift up her head again olive understood or thought she understood and the woefulness of it all only seemed the deeper she would just sit there and hold her hand that was all she could do they were beyond each others help in any other way now verena leaned her head back and closed her eyes and for an hour as nightfall settled in the room neither of the young women spoke distinctly it was a kind of shame after a while the parlourmaid very casual in the manner of the servants at marmion appeared on the threshold with a lamp but olive motioned her frantically away she wished to keep the darkness it was a kind of shame  the next morning basil ransom rapped loudly with his walkingstick on the lintel of miss chancellors housedoor which as usual on fine days stood open there was no need he should wait till the servant had answered his summons for olive who had reason to believe he would come and who had been lurking in the sittingroom for a purpose of her own stepped forth into the little hall  i am sorry to disturb you i had the hope thatfor a momenti might see miss tarrant that was the speech with which and a measured salutation he greeted his advancing kinswoman she faced him an instant and her strange green eyes caught the light  its impossible you may believe that when i say it  why is it impossible he asked smiling in spite of an inward displeasure and as olive gave him no answer only gazing at him with a cold audacity which he had not hitherto observed in her he added a little explanation it is simply to have seen her before i goto have said five words to her i want her to know that i have made up my mindsince yesterdayto leave this place i shall take the train at noon  it was not to gratify olive chancellor that he had determined to go away or even that he told her this yet he was surprised that his words brought no expression of pleasure to her face i dont think it is of much importance whether you go away or not miss tarrant herself has gone away  miss tarrantgone away this announcement was so much at variance with verenas apparent intentions the night before that his ejaculation expressed chagrin as well as surprise and in doing so it gave olive a momentary advantage it was the only one she had ever had and the poor girl may be excused for having enjoyed itso far as enjoyment was possible to her basil ransoms visible discomfiture was more agreeable to her than anything had been for a long time  i went with her myself to the early train and i saw it leave the station and olive kept her eyes unaverted for the satisfaction of seeing how he took it  it must be confessed that he took it rather ill he had decided it was best he should retire but verenas retiring was another matter and where is she gone he asked with a frown  i dont think i am obliged to tell you  of course not excuse my asking it is much better that i should find it out for myself because if i owed the information to you i should perhaps feel a certain delicacy as regards profiting by it  gracious heaven cried miss chancellor at the idea of ransoms delicacy then she added more deliberately you will not find out for yourself  you think not  i am sure of it and her enjoyment of the situation becoming acute there broke from her lips a shrill unfamiliar troubled sound which performed the office of a laugh a laugh of triumph but which at a distance might have passed almost as well for a wail of despair it rang in ransoms ears as he quickly turned away     xl   it was mrs luna who received him as she had received him on the occasion of his first visit to charles street by which i do not mean quite in the same way she had known very little about him then but she knew too much for her happiness today and she had with him now a little invidious contemptuous manner as if everything he should say or do could be a proof only of abominable duplicity and perversity she had a theory that he had treated her shamefully and he knew iti do not mean the fact but the theory which led him to reflect that her resentments were as shallow as her opinions inasmuch as if she really believed in her grievance or if it had had any dignity she would not have consented to see him he had not presented himself at miss chancellors door without a very good reason and having done so he could not turn away so long as there was any one in the house of whom he might have speech he had sent up his name to mrs luna after being told that she was staying there on the mere chance that she would see him for he thought a refusal a very possible sequel to the letters she had written him during the past four or five monthsletters he had scarcely read full of allusions of the most cutting sort to proceedings of his in the past of which he had no recollection whatever they bored him for he had quite other matters in his mind  i dont wonder you have the bad taste the crudity she said as soon as he came into the room looking at him more sternly than he would have believed possible to her  he saw that this was an allusion to his not having been to see her since the period of her sisters visit to new york he having conceived for her the evening of mrs burrages party a sentiment of aversion which put an end to such attentions he didnt laugh he was too worried and preoccupied but he replied in a tone which apparently annoyed her as much as any indecent mirth i thought it very possible you wouldnt see me  why shouldnt i see you if i should take it into my head do you suppose i care whether i see you or not  i supposed you wanted to from your letters  then why did you think i would refuse  because thats the sort of thing women do  womenwomen you know much about them  i am learning something every day  you havent learned yet apparently to answer their letters its rather a surprise to me that you dont pretend not to have received mine  ransom could smile now the opportunity to vent the exasperation that had been consuming him almost restored his good humour what could i say you overwhelmed me besides i did answer one of them  one of them you speak as if i had written you a dozen mrs luna cried  i thought that was your contentionthat you had done me the honour to address me so many they were crushing and when a mans crushed its all over  yes you look as if you were in very small pieces i am glad that i shall never see you again  i can see now why you received meto tell me that ransom said  it is a kind of pleasure i am going back to europe  really for newtons education  ah i wonder you can have the face to speak of thatafter the way you deserted him  let us abandon the subject then and i will tell you what i want  i dont in the least care what you want mrs luna remarked and you havent even the grace to ask me where i am goingover there  what difference does that make to meonce you leave these shores  mrs luna rose to her feet ah chivalry chivalry she exclaimed and she walked away to the windowone of the windows from which ransom had first enjoyed at olives solicitation the view of the back bay mrs luna looked forth at it with little of the air of a person who was sorry to be about to lose it i am determined you shall know where i am going she said in a moment i am going to florence  dont be afraid he replied i shall go to rome  and youll carry there more impertinence than has been seen there since the old emperors  were the emperors impertinent in addition to their other vices i am determined on my side that you shall know what i have come for ransom said i wouldnt ask you if i could ask any one else but i am very hard pressed and i dont know who can help me  mrs luna turned on him a face of the frankest derision help you do you remember the last time i asked you to help me  that evening at mrs burrages surely i wasnt wanting then i remember urging on your acceptance a chair so that you might stand on it to see and to hear  to see and to hear what please your disgusting infatuation  its just about that i want to speak to you ransom pursued as you already know all about it you have no new shock to receive and i therefore venture to ask you  where tickets for her lecture tonight can be obtained is it possible she hasnt sent you one  i assure you i didnt come to boston to hear it said ransom with a sadness which mrs luna evidently regarded as a refinement of outrage what i should like to ascertain is where miss tarrant may be found at the present moment  and do you think thats a delicate inquiry to make of me  i dont see why it shouldnt be but i know you dont think it is and that is why as i say i mention the matter to you only because i can imagine absolutely no one else who is in a position to assist me i have been to the house of miss tarrants parents in cambridge but it is closed and empty destitute of any sign of life i went there first on arriving this morning and rang at this door only when my journey to monadnoc place had proved fruitless your sisters servant told me that miss tarrant was not staying here but she added that mrs luna was no doubt you wont be pleased at having been spoken of as a sort of equivalent and i didnt say to myselfor to the servantthat you would do as well i only reflected that i could at least try you i didnt even ask for miss chancellor as i am sure she would give me no information whatever  mrs luna listened to this candid account of the young mans proceedings with her head turned a little over her shoulder at him and her eyes fixed as unsympathetically as possible upon his own what you propose then as i understand it she said in a moment is that i should betray my sister to you  worse than that i propose that you should betray miss tarrant herself  what do i care about miss tarrant i dont know what you are talking about  havent you really any idea where she is living havent you seen her here are miss olive and she not constantly together  mrs luna at this turned full round upon him and with folded arms and her head tossed back exclaimed look here basil ransom i never thought you were a fool but it strikes me that since we last met you have lost your wits  there is no doubt of that ransom answered smiling  do you mean to tell me you dont know everything about miss tarrant that can be known  i have neither seen her nor heard of her for the last ten weeks miss chancellor has hidden her away  hidden her away with all the walls and fences of boston flaming today with her name  oh yes i have noticed that and i have no doubt that by waiting till this evening i shall be able to see her but i dont want to wait till this evening i want to see her now and not in publicin private  do you indeedhow interesting cried mrs luna with rippling laughter and pray what do you want to do with her  ransom hesitated a little i think i would rather not tell you  your charming frankness then has its limits my poor cousin you are really too naïf do you suppose it matters a straw to me  ransom made no answer to this appeal but after an instant he broke out honestly mrs luna can you give me no clue  lord what terrible eyes you make and what terrible words you use honestly quoth he do you think i am so fond of the creature that i want to keep her all to myself  i dont know i dont understand said ransom slowly and softly but still with his terrible eyes  and do you think i understand any better you are not a very edifying young man mrs luna went on but i really think you have deserved a better fate than to be jilted and thrown over by a girl of that class  i havent been jilted i like her very much but she never encouraged me  at this mrs luna broke again into articulate scoffing it is very odd that at your age you should be so little a man of the world  ransom made her no other answer than to remark thoughtfully and rather absently your sister is really very clever  by which you mean i suppose that i am not mrs luna suddenly changed her tone and said with the greatest sweetness and humility god knows i have never pretended to be  ransom looked at her a moment and guessed the meaning of this altered note it had suddenly come over her that with her portrait in half the shopfronts her advertisement on all the fences and the great occasion on which she was to reveal herself to the country at large close at hand verena had become so conscious of high destinies that her dear friends southern kinsman really appeared to her very small game and she might therefore be regarded as having cast him off if this were the case it would perhaps be well for mrs luna still to hold on basils induction was very rapid but it gave him time to decide that the best thing to say to his interlocutress was on what day do you sail for europe  perhaps i shall not sail at all mrs luna replied looking out of the window  and in that casepoor newtons education  i should try to content myself with a country which has given you yours  dont you want him then to be a man of the world  ah the world the world she murmured while she watched in the deepening dusk the lights of the town begin to reflect themselves in the back bay has it been such a source of happiness to me that i belong to it  perhaps after all i shall be able to go to florence said ransom laughing  she faced him once more this time slowly and declared that she had never known anything so strange as his state of mindshe would be so glad to have an explanation of it with the opinions he professed it was for them she had liked himshe didnt like his character why on earth should he be running after a little fifthrate poseuse and in such a frenzy to get hold of her he might say it was none of her business and of course she would have no answer to that therefore she admitted that she asked simply out of intellectual curiosity and because one always was tormented at the sight of a painful contradiction with the things she had heard him say about his convictions and theories his view of life and the great questions of the future she should have thought he would find miss tarrants attitudinising absolutely nauseous were not her views the same as olives and hadnt olive and he signally failed to hit it off together mrs luna only asked because she was really quite puzzled dont you know that some minds when they see a mystery cant rest till they clear it up  you cant be more puzzled than i am said ransom apparently the explanation is to be found in a sort of reversal of the formula you were so good just now as to apply to me you like my opinions but you entertain a different sentiment for my character i deplore miss tarrants opinions but her characterwell her character pleases me  mrs luna stared as if she were waiting the explanation surely not being complete but as much as that she inquired  as much as what said ransom smiling then he added your sister has beaten me  i thought she had beaten some one of late she has seemed so gay and happy i didnt suppose it was all because i was going away  has she seemed very gay ransom inquired with a sinking of the heart he wore such a long face as he asked this question that mrs luna was again moved to audible mirth after which she explained  of course i mean gay for her everything is relative with her impatience for this lecture of her friends tonight shes in an unspeakable state she cant sit still for three minutes she goes out fifteen times a day and there has been enough arranging and interviewing and discussing and telegraphing and advertising enough wirepulling and rushing about to put an army in the field what is it they are always doing to the armies in europemobilising them well verena has been mobilised and this has been headquarters  and shall you go to the music hall tonight  for what do you take me i have no desire to be shrieked at for an hour  no doubt no doubt miss olive must be in a state ransom went on rather absently then he said with abruptness in a different tone if this house has been as you say headquarters how comes it you havent seen her  seen olive i have seen nothing else  i mean miss tarrant she must be somewherein the placeif shes to speak tonight  should you like me to go out and look for her il ne manquerait plus que cela cried mrs luna whats the matter with you basil ransom and what are you after she demanded with considerable sharpness she had tried haughtiness and she had tried humility but they brought her equally face to face with a competitor whom she couldnt take seriously yet who was none the less objectionable for all that  i know not whether ransom would have attempted to answer her question had an obstacle not presented itself at any rate at the moment she spoke the curtain in the doorway was pushed aside and a visitor crossed the threshold mercy how provoking mrs luna exclaimed audibly enough and without moving from her place she bent an uncharitable eye upon the invader a gentleman whom ransom had the sense of having met before he was a young man with a fresh face and abundant locks prematurely white he stood smiling at mrs luna quite undaunted by the absence of any demonstration in his favour she looked as if she didnt know him while ransom prepared to depart leaving them to settle it together  im afraid you dont remember me though i have seen you before said the young man very amiably i was here a week ago and miss chancellor presented me to you  oh yes shes not at home now mrs luna returned vaguely  so i was toldbut i didnt let that prevent me and the young man included basil ransom in the smile with which he made himself more welcome than mrs luna appeared disposed to make him and by which he seemed to call attention to his superiority there is a matter on which i want very much to obtain some information and i have no doubt you will be so good as to give it to me  it comes back to meyou have something to do with the newspapers said mrs luna and ransom too by this time had placed the young man among his reminiscences he had been at miss birdseyes famous party and doctor prance had there described him as a brilliant journalist  it was quite with the air of such a personage that he accepted mrs lunas definition and he continued to radiate towards ransom as if in return he remembered his face while he dropped confidentially the word that expressed everythingthe vesper dont you know then he went on now mrs luna i dont care im not going to let you off we want the last news about miss verena and it has got to come out of this house  oh murder ransom muttered beneath his breath taking up his hat  miss chancellor has hidden her away i have been scouring the city in search of her and her own father hasnt seen her for a week we have got his ideas they are very easy to get but that isnt what we want  and what do you want ransom was now impelled to inquire as mr pardon even the name at present came back to him appeared sufficiently to have introduced himself  we want to know how she feels about tonight what report she makes of her nerves her anticipations how she looked what she had on up to six oclock gracious if i could see her i should know what i wanted and so would she i guess mr pardon exclaimed you must know something mrs luna it isnt natural you shouldnt i wont inquire any further where she is because that might seem a little pushing if she does wish to withdraw herselfthough i am bound to say i think she makes a mistake we could work up these last hours for her but cant you tell me any little personal itemsthe sort of thing the people like what is she going to have for supper or is she going to speakawithout previous nourishment  really sir i dont know and i dont in the least care i have nothing to do with the business mrs luna cried angrily  the reporter stared then eagerly you have nothing to do with ityou take an unfavourable view you protest and he was already feeling in a sidepocket for his notebook  mercy on us are you going to put that in the paper mrs luna exclaimed and in spite of the sense detestable to him that everything he wished most to avert was fast closing over the girl ransom broke into cynical laughter  ah but do protest madam let us at least have that fragment mr pardon went on a protest from this house would be a charming note we must have itweve got nothing else the public are almost as much interested in your sister as they are in miss verena they know to what extent she has backed her and i should be so delighted i see the heading from here so attractive just to take down what miss chancellors family think about it  mrs luna sank into the nearest chair with a groan covering her face with her hands heaven help me i am glad i am going to europe  that is another little itemeverything counts said matthias pardon making a rapid entry in his tablets may i inquire whether you are going to europe in consequence of your disapproval of your sisters views  mrs luna sprang up again almost snatching the memoranda out of his hand if you have the impertinence to publish a word about me or to mention my name in print i will come to your office and make such a scene  dearest lady that would be a godsend mr pardon cried enthusiastically but he put his notebook back into his pocket  have you made an exhaustive search for miss tarrant basil ransom asked of him mr pardon at this inquiry eyed him with a sudden familiar archness expressive of the idea of competition so that ransom added you neednt be afraid im not a reporter  i didnt know but what you had come on from new york  so i havebut not as the representative of a newspaper  fancy his taking you mrs luna murmured with indignation  well i have been everywhere i could think of mr pardon remarked i have been hunting round after your sisters agent but i havent been able to catch up with him i suppose he has been hunting on his side miss chancellor told memrs luna may remember itthat she shouldnt be here at all during the week and that she preferred not to tell me either where or how she was to spend her time until the momentous evening of course i let her know that i should find out if i could and you may remember he said to mrs luna the conversation we had on the subject i remarked candidly that if they didnt look out they would overdo the quietness doctor tarrant has felt very low about it however i have done what i could with the material at my command and the vesper has let the public know that her whereabouts was the biggest mystery of the season its difficult to get round the vesper  i am almost afraid to open my lips in your presence mrs luna broke in but i must say that i think my sister was strangely communicative she told you ever so much that i wouldnt have breathed  i should like to try you with something you know matthias pardon returned imperturbably this isnt a fair trial because you dont know miss chancellor came roundcame round considerably theres no doubt of that because a year or two ago she was terribly unapproachable if i have mollified her madam why shouldnt i mollify you she realises that i can help her now and as i aint rancorous i am willing to help her all shell let me the trouble is she wont let me enough yet it seems as if she couldnt believe it of me at any rate he pursued addressing himself more particularly to ransom half an hour ago at the hall they knew nothing whatever about miss tarrant beyond the fact that about a month ago she came there with miss chancellor to try her voice which rang all over the place like silver and that miss chancellor guaranteed her absolute punctuality tonight  well thats all that is required said ransom at hazard and he put out his hand in farewell to mrs luna  do you desert me already she demanded giving him a glance which would have embarrassed any spectator but a reporter of the vesper  i have fifty things to do you must excuse me he was nervous restless his heart was beating much faster than usual he couldnt stand still and he had no compunction whatever about leaving her to get rid by herself of mr pardon  this gentleman continued to mix in the conversation possibly from the hope that if he should linger either miss tarrant or miss chancellor would make her appearance every seat in the hall is sold the crowd is expected to be immense when our boston public does take an idea mr pardon exclaimed  ransom only wanted to get away and in order to facilitate his release by implying that in such a case he should see her again he said to mrs luna rather hypocritically from the threshold you had really better come tonight  i am not like the boston publici dont take an idea she replied  do you mean to say you are not going cried mr pardon with widely open eyes clapping his hand again to his pocket dont you regard her as a wonderful genius  mrs luna was sorely tried and the vexation of seeing ransom slip away from her with his thoughts visibly on verena leaving her face to face with the odious newspaper man whose presence made passionate protest impossiblethe annoyance of seeing everything and every one mock at her and fail to compensate her was such that she lost her head while rashness leaped to her lips and jerked out the answerno indeed i think her a vulgar idiot  ah madam i should never permit myself to print that ransom heard mr pardon rejoin reproachfully as he dropped the portière of the drawingroom     xli   he walked about for the next two hours walked all over boston heedless of his course and conscious only of an unwillingness to return to his hotel and an inability to eat his dinner or rest his weary legs he had been roaming in very much the same desperate fashion at once eager and purposeless for many days before he left new york and he knew that his agitation and suspense must wear themselves out at present they pressed him more than ever they had become tremendously acute the early dusk of the last half of november had gathered thick but the evening was fine and the lighted streets had the animation and variety of a winter that had begun with brilliancy the shopfronts glowed through frosty panes the passers bustled on the pavement the bells of the streetcars jangled in the cold air the newsboys hawked the evening papers the vestibules of the theatres illuminated and flanked with coloured posters and the photographs of actresses exhibited seductively their swinging doors of red leather or baize spotted with little brass nails behind great plates of glass the interior of the hotels became visible with marblepaved lobbies white with electric lamps and columns and westerners on divans stretching their legs while behind a counter set apart and covered with an array of periodicals and novels in paper covers little boys with the faces of old men showing plans of the playhouses and offering librettos sold orchestrachairs at a premium when from time to time ransom paused at a corner hesitating which way to drift he looked up and saw the stars sharp and near scintillating over the town boston seemed to him big and full of nocturnal life very much awake and preparing for an evening of pleasure  he passed and repassed the music hall saw verena immensely advertised gazed down the vista the approach for pedestrians which leads out of school street and thought it looked expectant and ominous people had not begun to enter yet but the place was ready lighted and open and the interval would be only too short so it appeared to ransom while at the same time he wished immensely the crisis were over everything that surrounded him referred itself to the idea with which his mind was palpitating the question whether he might not still intervene as against the girls jump into the abyss he believed that all boston was going to hear her or that at least every one was whom he saw in the streets and there was a kind of incentive and inspiration in this thought the vision of wresting her from the mighty multitude set him off again to stride through the population that would fight for her it was not too late for he felt strong it would not be too late even if she should already stand there before thousands of converging eyes he had had his ticket since the morning and now the time was going on he went back to his hotel at last for ten minutes and refreshed himself by dressing a little and by drinking a glass of wine then he took his way once more to the music hall and saw that people were beginning to go inthe first drops of the great stream among whom there were many women since seven oclock the minutes had moved fastbefore that they had draggedand now there was only half an hour ransom passed in with the others he knew just where his seat was he had chosen it on reaching boston from the few that were left with what he believed to be care but now as he stood beneath the faraway panelled roof stretching above the line of little tongues of flame which marked its junction with the walls he felt that this didnt matter much since he certainly was not going to subside into his place he was not one of the audience he was apart unique and had come on a business altogether special it wouldnt have mattered if in advance he had got no place at all and had just left himself to pay for standingroom at the last the people came pouring in and in a very short time there would only be standingroom left ransom had no definite plan he had mainly wanted to get inside of the building so that on a view of the field he might make up his mind he had never been in the music hall before and its lofty vaults and rows of overhanging balconies made it to his imagination immense and impressive there were two or three moments during which he felt as he could imagine a young man to feel who waiting in a public place has made up his mind for reasons of his own to discharge a pistol at the king or the president  the place struck him with a kind of roman vastness the doors which opened out of the upper balconies high aloft and which were constantly swinging to and fro with the passage of spectators and ushers reminded him of the vomitoria that he had read about in descriptions of the colosseum the huge organ the background of the stagea stage occupied with tiers of seats for choruses and civic worthieslifted to the dome its shining pipes and sculptured pinnacles and some genius of music or oratory erected himself in monumental bronze at the base the hall was so capacious and serious and the audience increased so rapidly without filling it giving ransom a sense of the numbers it would contain when it was packed that the courage of the two young women face to face with so tremendous an ordeal hovered before him as really sublime especially the conscious tension of poor olive who would have been spared none of the anxieties and tremors none of the previsions of accident or calculations of failure in the front of the stage was a slim high desk like a musicstand with a cover of red velvet and near it was a light ornamental chair on which he was sure verena would not seat herself though he could fancy her leaning at moments on the back behind this was a kind of semicircle of a dozen armchairs which had evidently been arranged for the friends of the speaker her sponsors and patrons the hall was more and more full of premonitory sounds people making a noise as they unfolded on hinges their seats and itinerant boys whose voices as they cried out photographs of miss tarrantsketch of her life or portraits of the speakerstory of her career sounded small and piping in the general immensity before ransom was aware of it several of the armchairs in the row behind the lecturers desk were occupied with gaps and in a moment he recognised even across the interval three of the persons who had appeared the straightfeatured woman with bands of glossy hair and eyebrows that told at a distance could only be mrs farrinder just as the gentleman beside her in a white overcoat with an umbrella and a vague face was probably her husband amariah at the opposite end of the row were another pair whom ransom unacquainted with certain chapters of verenas history perceived without surprise to be mrs burrage and her insinuating son apparently their interest in miss tarrant was more than a momentary fad sincelike himselfthey had made the journey from new york to hear her there were other figures unknown to our young man here and there in the semicircle but several places were still empty one of which was of course reserved for olive and it occurred to ransom even in his preoccupation that one of them ought to remain soought to be left to symbolise the presence in the spirit of miss birdseye  he bought one of the photographs of verena and thought it shockingly bad and bought also the sketch of her life which many people seemed to be reading but crumpled it up in his pocket for future consideration verena was not in the least present to him in connexion with this exhibition of enterprise and puffery what he saw was olive struggling and yielding making every sacrifice of taste for the sake of the largest hearing and conforming herself to a great popular system whether she had struggled or not there was a catchpenny effect about the whole thing which added to the fever in his cheek and made him wish he had money to buy up the stock of the vociferous little boys suddenly the notes of the organ rolled out into the hall and he became aware that the overture or prelude had begun this too seemed to him a piece of claptrap but he didnt wait to think of it he instantly edged out of his place which he had chosen near the end of a row and reached one of the numerous doors if he had had no definite plan he now had at least an irresistible impulse and he felt the prick of shame at having faltered for a moment it had been his tacit calculation that verena still enshrined in mystery by her companion would not have reached the scene of her performance till within a few minutes of the time at which she was to come forth so that he had lost nothing by waiting up to this moment before the platform but now he must overtake his opportunity before passing out of the hall into the lobby he paused and with his back to the stage gave a look at the gathered auditory it had become densely numerous and suffused with the evenly distributed gaslight which fell from a great elevation and the thick atmosphere that hangs for ever in such places it appeared to pile itself high and to look dimly expectant and formidable he had a throb of uneasiness at his private purpose of balking it of its entertainment its victima glimpse of the ferocity that lurks in a disappointed mob but the thought of that danger only made him pass more quickly through the ugly corridors he felt that his plan was definite enough now and he found that he had no need even of asking the way to a certain small door one or more of them which he meant to push open in taking his place in the morning he had assured himself as to the side of the house on which with its approach to the platform the withdrawing room of singers and speakers was situated he had chosen his seat in that quarter and he now had not far to go before he reached it no one heeded or challenged him miss tarrants auditors were still pouring in the occasion was evidently to have been an unprecedented success of curiosity and had all the attention of the ushers ransom opened a door at the end of the passage and it admitted him into a sort of vestibule quite bare save that at a second door opposite to him stood a figure at the sight of which he paused for a moment in his advance  the figure was simply that of a robust policeman in his helmet and brass buttonsa policeman who was expecting himransom could see that in a twinkling he judged in the same space of time that olive chancellor had heard of his having arrived and had applied for the protection of this functionary who was now simply guarding the ingress and was prepared to defend it against all comers there was a slight element of surprise in this as he had reasoned that his nervous kinswoman was absent from her house for the dayhad been spending it all in verenas retreat wherever that was the surprise was not great enough however to interrupt his course for more than an instant and he crossed the room and stood before the belted sentinel for a moment neither spoke they looked at each other very hard in the eyes and ransom heard the organ beyond partitions launching its waves of sound through the hall they seemed to be very near it and the whole place vibrated the policeman was a tall leanfaced sallow man with a stoop of the shoulders a small steady eye and something in his mouth which made a protuberance in his cheek ransom could see that he was very strong but he believed that he himself was not materially less so however he had not come there to show physical fighta public tussle about verena was not an attractive idea except perhaps after all if he should get the worst of it from the point of view of olives new system of advertising and moreover it would not be in the least necessary still he said nothing and still the policeman remained dumb and there was something in the way the moments elapsed and in our young mans consciousness that verena was separated from him only by a couple of thin planks which made him feel that she too expected him but in another sense that she had nothing to do with this parade of resistance that she would know in a moment by quick intuition that he was there and that she was only praying to be rescued to be saved face to face with olive she hadnt the courage but she would have it with her hand in his it came to him that there was no one in the world less sure of her business just at that moment than olive chancellor it was as if he could see through the door the terrible way her eyes were fixed on verena while she held her watch in her hand and verena looked away from her olive would have been so thankful that she should begin before the hour but of course that was impossible ransom asked no questionsthat seemed a waste of time he only said after a minute to the policeman  i should like very much to see miss tarrant if you will be so good as to take in my card  the guardian of order well planted just between him and the handle of the door took from ransom the morsel of pasteboard which he held out to him read slowly the name inscribed on it turned it over and looked at the back then returned it to his interlocutor well i guess it aint much use he remarked  how can you know that you have no business to decline my request  well i guess i have about as much business as you have to make it then he added you are just the very man she wants to keep out  i dont think miss tarrant wants to keep me out ransom returned  i dont know much about her she hasnt hired the hall its the other onemiss chancellor its her that runs this lecture  and she has asked you to keep me out how absurd exclaimed ransom ingeniously  she tells me youre none too fit to be round alone you have got this thing on the brain i guess youd better be quiet said the policeman  quiet is it possible to be more quiet than i am  well ive seen crazy folks that were a good deal like you if you want to see the speaker why dont you go and set round in the hall with the rest of the public and the policeman waited in an immovable ruminating reasonable manner for an answer to this inquiry  ransom had one on the instant at his service because i dont want simply to see her i want also to speak to herin private  yesits always intensely private said the policeman now i wouldnt lose the lecture if i was you i guess it will do you good  the lecture ransom repeated laughing it wont take place  yes it willas quick as the organ stops then the policeman added as to himself why the devil dont it  because miss tarrant has sent up to the organist to tell him to keep on  who has she sent do you spose and ransoms new acquaintance entered into his humour i guess miss chancellor isnt her nigger  she has sent her father or perhaps even her mother they are in there too  how do you know that asked the policeman consideringly  oh i know everything ransom answered smiling  well i guess they didnt come here to listen to that organ well hear something else before long if he doesnt stop  you will hear a good deal very soon ransom remarked  the serenity of his selfconfidence appeared at last to make an impression on his antagonist who lowered his head a little like some butting animal and looked at the young man from beneath bushy eyebrows well i have heard a good deal since ive been in boston  oh bostons a great place ransom rejoined inattentively he was not listening to the policeman or to the organ now for the sound of voices had reached him from the other side of the door the policeman took no further notice of it than to lean back against the panels with folded arms and there was another pause between them during which the playing of the organ ceased  i will just wait here with your permission said ransom and presently i shall be called  who do you spose will call you  well miss tarrant i hope  shell have to square the other one first  ransom took out his watch which he had adapted on purpose several hours before to boston time and saw that the minutes had sped with increasing velocity during this interview and that it now marked five minutes past eight miss chancellor will have to square the public he said in a moment and the words were far from being an empty profession of security for the conviction already in possession of him that a drama in which he though cut off was an actor had been going on for some time in the apartment he was prevented from entering that the situation was extraordinarily strained there and that it could not come to an end without an appeal to himthis transcendental assumption acquired an infinitely greater force the instant he perceived that verena was even now keeping her audience waiting why didnt she go on why except that she knew he was there and was gaining time  well i guess she has shown herself said the doorkeeper whose discussion with ransom now appeared to have passed on his own part and without the slightest prejudice to his firmness into a sociable gossiping phase  if she had shown herself we should hear the reception the applause  well there they air they are going to give it to her the policeman announced  he had an odious appearance of being in the right for there indeed they seemed to bethey were giving it to her a general hubbub rose from the floor and the galleries of the hallthe sound of several thousand people stamping with their feet and rapping with their umbrellas and sticks ransom felt faint and for a little while he stood with his gaze interlocked with that of the policeman then suddenly a wave of coolness seemed to break over him and he exclaimed my dear fellow that isnt applauseits impatience it isnt a reception its a call  the policeman neither assented to this proposition nor denied it he only transferred the protuberance in his cheek to the other side and observed  i guess shes sick  oh i hope not said ransom very gently the stamping and rapping swelled and swelled for a minute and then it subsided but before it had done so ransoms definition of it had plainly become the true one the tone of the manifestation was goodhumoured but it was not gratulatory he looked at his watch again and saw that five minutes more had elapsed and he remembered what the newspaperman in charles street had said about olives guaranteeing verenas punctuality oddly enough at the moment the image of this gentleman recurred to him the gentleman himself burst through the other door in a state of the liveliest agitation  why in the name of goodness dont she go on if she wants to make them call her theyve done it about enough mr pardon turned pressingly from ransom to the policeman and back again and in his preoccupation gave no sign of having met the mississippian before  i guess shes sick said the policeman  the publicll be sick cried the distressed reporter if shes sick why doesnt she send for a doctor all boston is packed into this house and she has got to talk to it i want to go in and see  you cant go in said the policeman drily  why cant i go in i should like to know i want to go in for the vesper  you cant go in for anything im keeping this man out too the policeman added genially as if to make mr pardons exclusion appear less invidious  why theyd ought to let you in said matthias staring a moment at ransom  may be theyd ought but they wont the policeman remarked  gracious me panted mr pardon i knew from the first miss chancellor would make a mess of it wheres mr filer he went on eagerly addressing himself apparently to either of the others or to both  i guess hes at the door counting the money said the policeman  well hell have to give it back if he dont look out  maybe he will ill let him in if he comes but hes the only one she is on now the policeman added without emotion  his ear had caught the first faint murmur of another explosion of sound this time unmistakably it was applausethe clapping of multitudinous hands mingled with the noise of many throats the demonstration however though considerable was not what might have been expected and it died away quickly mr pardon stood listening with an expression of some alarm merciful fathers cant they give her more than that he cried ill just fly round and see  when he had hurried away again ransom said to the policemanwho is mr filer  oh hes an old friend of mine hes the man that runs miss chancellor  that runs her  just the same as she runs miss tarrant he runs the pair as you might say hes in the lecturebusiness  then he had better talk to the public himself  oh he cant talk he can only boss  the opposite door at this moment was pushed open again and a large heatedlooking man with a little stiff beard on the end of his chin and his overcoat flying behind him strode forward with an imprecation what the h are they doing in the parlour this sort of things about played out  aint she up there now the policeman asked  its not miss tarrant ransom said as if he knew all about it he perceived in a moment that this was mr filer olive chancellors agent an inference instantly followed by the reflexion that such a personage would have been warned against him by his kinswoman and would doubtless attempt to hold him or his influence accountable for verenas unexpected delay mr filer only glanced at him however and to ransoms surprise appeared to have no theory of his identity a fact implying that miss chancellor had considered that the greater discretion was except to the policeman to hold her tongue about him altogether  up there its her jackass of a father thats up there cried mr filer with his hand on the latch of the door which the policeman had allowed him to approach  is he asking for a doctor the latter inquired dispassionately  youre the sort of doctor hell want if he doesnt produce the girl you dont mean to say theyve locked themselves in what the plague are they after  theyve got the key on that side said the policeman while mr filer discharged at the door a volley of sharp knocks at the same time violently shaking the handle  if the door was locked what was the good of your standing before it ransom inquired  so as you couldnt do that and the policeman nodded at mr filer  you see your interference has done very little good  i dunno she has got to come out yet  mr filer meanwhile had continued to thump and shake demanding instant admission and inquiring if they were going to let the audience pull the house down another round of applause had broken out directed perceptibly to some apology some solemn circumlocution of selah tarrants this covered the sound of the agents voice as well as that of a confused and divided response proceeding from the parlour for a minute nothing definite was audible the door remained closed and matthias pardon reappeared in the vestibule  he says shes just a little faintfrom nervousness shell be all ready in about three minutes this announcement was mr pardons contribution to the crisis and he added that the crowd was a lovely crowd it was a real boston crowd it was perfectly goodhumoured  theres a lovely crowd and a real boston one too i guess in here cried mr filer now banging very hard ive handled prima donnas and ive handled natural curiosities but ive never seen anything up to this mind what i say ladies if you dont let me in ill smash down the door  dont seem as if you could make it much worse does it the policeman observed to ransom strolling aside a little with the air of being superseded     xlii   ransom made no reply he was watching the door which at that moment gave way from within verena stood thereit was she evidently who had opened itand her eyes went straight to his she was dressed in white and her face was whiter than her garment above it her hair seemed to shine like fire she took a step forward but before she could take another he had come down to her on the threshold of the room her face was full of suffering and he did not attemptbefore all those eyesto take her hand he only said in a low tone i have been waiting for youa long time  i know iti saw you in your seati want to speak to you  well miss tarrant dont you think youd better be on the platform cried mr filer making with both his arms a movement as if to sweep her before him through the waitingroom up into the presence of the public  in a moment i shall be ready my father is making that all right and to ransoms surprise she smiled with all her sweetness at the irrepressible agent appeared to wish genuinely to reassure him  the three had moved together into the waitingroom and there at the farther end of it beyond the vulgar perfunctory chairs and tables under the flaring gas he saw mrs tarrant sitting upright on a sofa with immense rigidity and a large flushed visage full of suppressed distortion and beside her prostrate fallen over her head buried in the lap of verenas mother the tragic figure of olive chancellor ransom could scarcely know how much olives having flung herself upon mrs tarrants bosom testified to the convulsive scene that had just taken place behind the locked door he closed it again sharply in the face of the reporter and the policeman and at the same moment selah tarrant descended through the aperture leading to the platform from his brief communion with the public on seeing ransom he stopped short and gathering his waterproof about him measured the young man from head to foot  well sir perhaps you would like to go and explain our hitch he remarked indulging in a smile so comprehensive that the corners of his mouth seemed almost to meet behind i presume that you better than any one else can give them an insight into our difficulties  father be still father it will come out all right in a moment cried verena below her breath panting like an emergent diver  theres one thing i want to know are we going to spend half an hour talking over our domestic affairs mr filer demanded wiping his indignant countenance is miss tarrant going to lecture or aint she going to lecture if she aint shell please to show cause why is she aware that every quarter of a second at the present instant is worth about five hundred dollars  i know thati know that mr filer i will begin in a moment verena went on i only want to speak to mr ransomjust three words they are perfectly quietdont you see how quiet they are they trust me they trust me dont they father i only want to speak to mr ransom  who the devil is mr ransom cried the exasperated bewildered filer  verena spoke to the others but she looked at her lover and the expression of her eyes was ineffably touching and beseeching she trembled with nervous passion there were sobs and supplications in her voice and ransom felt himself flushing with pure pity for her painher inevitable agony but at the same moment he had another perception which brushed aside remorse he saw that he could do what he wanted that she begged him with all her being to spare her but that so long as he should protest she was submissive helpless what he wanted in this light flamed before him and challenged all his manhood tossing his determination to a height from which not only doctor tarrant and mr filer and olive over there in her sightless soundless shame but the great expectant hall as well and the mighty multitude in suspense keeping quiet from minute to minute and holding the breath of its angerfrom which all these things looked small surmountable and of the moment only he didnt quite understand as yet however he saw that verena had not refused but temporised that the spell upon herthanks to which he should still be able to rescue herhad been the knowledge that he was near  come away come away he murmured quickly putting out his two hands to her  she took one of them as if to plead not to consent oh let me off let me offfor her for the others its too terrible its impossible  what i want to know is why mr ransom isnt in the hands of the police wailed mrs tarrant from her sofa  i have been madam for the last quarter of an hour ransom felt more and more that he could manage it if he only kept cool he bent over verena with a tenderness in which he was careless now of observation dearest i told you i warned you i left you alone for ten weeks but could that make you doubt it was coming not for worlds not for millions shall you give yourself to that roaring crowd dont ask me to care for them or for any one what do they care for you but to gape and grin and babble you are mine you are not theirs  what under the sun is the man talking about with the most magnificent audience ever brought together the city of boston is under this roof mr filer gaspingly interposed  the city of boston be damned said ransom  mr ransom is very much interested in my daughter he doesnt approve of our views selah tarrant explained  its the most horrible wicked immoral selfishness i ever heard in my life roared mrs tarrant  selfishness mrs tarrant do you suppose i pretend not to be selfish  do you want us all murdered by the mob then  they can have their moneycant you give them back their money cried verena turning frantically round the circle  verena tarrant you dont mean to say you are going to back down her mother shrieked  good god that i should make her suffer like this said ransom to himself and to put an end to the odious scene he would have seized verena in his arms and broken away into the outer world if olive who at mrs tarrants last loud challenge had sprung to her feet had not at the same time thrown herself between them with a force which made the girl relinquish her grasp of ransoms hand to his astonishment the eyes that looked at him out of her scared haggard face were like verenas eyes of tremendous entreaty there was a moment during which she would have been ready to go down on her knees to him in order that the lecture should go on  if you dont agree with her take her up on the platform and have it out there the public would like that firstrate mr filer said to ransom as if he thought this suggestion practical  she had prepared a lovely address selah remarked mournfully as if to the company in general  no one appeared to heed the observation but his wife broke out again verena tarrant i should like to slap you do you call such a man as that a gentleman i dont know where your fathers spirit is to let him stay  olive meanwhile was literally praying to her kinsman let her appear this once just this once not to ruin not to shame havent you any pity do you want me to be hooted its only for an hour havent you any soul  her face and voice were terrible to ransom she had flung herself upon verena and was holding her close and he could see that her friends suffering was faint in comparison to her own why for an hour when its all false and damnable an hour is as bad as ten years shes mine or she isnt and if shes mine shes all mine  yours yours verena think think what youre doing olive moaned bending over her  mr filer was now pouring forth his nature in objurgations and oaths and brandishing before the culpritsverena and ransomthe extreme penalty of the law mrs tarrant had burst into violent hysterics while selah revolved vaguely about the room and declared that it seemed as if the better day was going to be put off for quite a while dont you see how good how sweet they aregiving us all this time dont you think that when they behave like thatwithout a sound for five minutesthey ought to be rewarded verena asked smiling divinely at ransom nothing could have been more tender more exquisite than the way she put her appeal upon the ground of simple charity kindness to the great goodnatured childish public  miss chancellor may reward them in any way she likes give them back their money and a little present to each  money and presents i should like to shoot you sir yelled mr filer the audience had really been very patient and up to this point deserved verenas praise but it was now long past eight oclock and symptoms of irritationcries and groans and hissesbegan again to proceed from the hall mr filer launched himself into the passage leading to the stage and selah rushed after him mrs tarrant extended herself sobbing on the sofa and olive quivering in the storm inquired of ransom what he wanted her to do what humiliation what degradation what sacrifice he imposed  ill do anythingill be abjectill be vileill go down in the dust  i ask nothing of you and i have nothing to do with you ransom said that is i ask at the most that you shouldnt expect that wishing to make verena my wife i should say to her oh yes you can take an hour or two out of it verena he went on all this is out of itdreadfully odiouslyand its a great deal too much come come as far away from here as possible and well settle the rest  the combined effort of mr filer and selah tarrant to pacify the public had not apparently the success it deserved the house continued in uproar and the volume of sound increased leave us alone leave us alone for a single minute cried verena just let me speak to him and it will be all right she rushed over to her mother drew her dragged her from the sofa led her to the door of the room mrs tarrant on the way reunited herself with olive the horror of the situation had at least that compensation for her and clinging and staggering together the distracted women pushed by verena passed into the vestibule now as ransom saw deserted by the policeman and the reporter who had rushed round to where the battle was thickest  oh why did you comewhy why and verena turning back threw herself upon him with a protest which was all and more than all a surrender she had never yet given herself to him so much as in that movement of reproach  didnt you expect me and werent you sure he asked smiling at her and standing there till she arrived  i didnt knowit was terribleits awful i saw you in your place in the house when you came as soon as we got here i went out to those steps that go up to the stage and i looked out with my fatherfrom behind himand saw you in a minute then i felt too nervous to speak i could never never if you were there my father didnt know you and i said nothing but olive guessed as soon as i came back she rushed at me and she looked at meoh how she looked and she guessed she didnt need to go out to see for herself and when she saw how i was trembling she began to tremble herself to believe as i believed we were lost listen to them listen to them in the house now i want you to go awayi will see you tomorrow as long as you wish thats all i want now if you will only go away its not too late and everything will be all right  preoccupied as ransom was with the simple purpose of getting her bodily out of the place he could yet notice her strange touching tone and her air of believing that she might really persuade him she had evidently given up everything nowevery pretence of a different conviction and of loyalty to her cause all this had fallen from her as soon as she felt him near and she asked him to go away just as any plighted maiden might have asked any favour of her lover but it was the poor girls misfortune that whatever she did or said or left unsaid only had the effect of making her dearer to him and making the people who were clamouring for her seem more and more a raving rabble  he indulged not in the smallest recognition of her request and simply said surely olive must have believed must have known i would come  she would have been sure if you hadnt become so unexpectedly quiet after i left marmion you seemed to concur to be willing to wait  so i was for a few weeks but they ended yesterday i was furious that morning when i learned your flight and during the week that followed i made two or three attempts to find you then i stoppedi thought it better i saw you were very well hidden i determined not even to write i felt i could waitwith that last day at marmion to think of besides to leave you with her awhile for the last seemed more decent perhaps youll tell me now where you were  i was with father and mother she sent me to them that morning with a letter i dont know what was in it perhaps there was money said verena who evidently now would tell him everything  and where did they take you  i dont knowto places i was in boston once for a day but only in a carriage they were as frightened as olive they were bound to save me  they shouldnt have brought you here tonight then how could you possibly doubt of my coming  i dont know what i thought and i didnt know till i saw you that all the strength i had hoped for would leave me in a flash and that if i attempted to speakwith you sitting therei should make the most shameful failure we had a sickening scene herei begged for delay for time to recover we waited and waited and when i heard you at the door talking to the policeman it seemed to me everything was gone but it will still come back if you will leave me they are quiet againfather must be interesting them  i hope he is ransom exclaimed if miss chancellor ordered the policeman she must have expected me  that was only after she knew you were in the house she flew out into the lobby with father and they seized him and posted him there she locked the door she seemed to think they would break it down i didnt wait for that but from the moment i knew you were on the other side of it i couldnt go oni was paralysed it has made me feel better to talk to youand now i could appear verena added  my darling child havent you a shawl or a mantle ransom returned for all answer looking about him he perceived tossed upon a chair a long furred cloak which he caught up and before she could resist threw over her she even let him arrange it and standing there draped from head to foot in it contented herself with saying after a moment  i dont understandwhere shall we go where will you take me  we shall catch the nighttrain for new york and the first thing in the morning we shall be married  verena remained gazing at him with swimming eyes and what will the people do listen listen  your father is ceasing to interest them theyll howl and thump according to their nature  ah their natures fine verena pleaded  dearest thats one of the fallacies i shall have to woo you from hear them the senseless brutes the storm was now raging in the hall and it deepened to such a point that verena turned to him in a supreme appeal  i could soothe them with a word  keep your soothing words for meyou will have need of them all in our coming time ransom said laughing he pulled open the door again which led into the lobby but he was driven back with verena by a furious onset from mrs tarrant seeing her daughter fairly arrayed for departure she hurled herself upon her half in indignation half in a blind impulse to cling and with an outpouring of tears reproaches prayers strange scraps of argument and iterations of farewell closed her about with an embrace which was partly a supreme caress partly the salutary castigation she had three minutes before expressed the wish to administer and altogether for the moment a check upon the girls flight  mother dearest its all for the best i cant help it i love you just the same let me go let me go verena stammered kissing her again struggling to free herself and holding out her hand to ransom he saw now that she only wanted to get away to leave everything behind her olive was close at hand on the threshold of the room and as soon as ransom looked at her he became aware that the weakness she had just shown had passed away she had straightened herself again and she was upright in her desolation the expression of her face was a thing to remain with him for ever it was impossible to imagine a more vivid presentment of blighted hope and wounded pride dry desperate rigid she yet wavered and seemed uncertain her pale glittering eyes straining forward as if they were looking for death ransom had a vision even at that crowded moment that if she could have met it there and then bristling with steel or lurid with fire she would have rushed on it without a tremor like the heroine that she was all this while the great agitation in the hall rose and fell in waves and surges as if selah tarrant and the agent were talking to the multitude trying to calm them succeeding for the moment and then letting them loose again whirled down by one of the fitful gusts a lady and a gentleman issued from the passage and ransom glancing at them recognised mrs farrinder and her husband  well miss chancellor said that more successful woman with considerable asperity if this is the way youre going to reinstate our sex she passed rapidly through the room followed by amariah who remarked in his transit that it seemed as if there had been a want of organisation and the two retreated expeditiously without the ladys having taken the smallest notice of verena whose conflict with her mother prolonged itself ransom striving with all needful consideration for mrs tarrant to separate these two addressed not a word to olive it was the last of her for him and he neither saw how her livid face suddenly glowed as if mrs farrinders words had been a lash nor how as if with a sudden inspiration she rushed to the approach to the platform if he had observed her it might have seemed to him that she hoped to find the fierce expiation she sought for in exposure to the thousands she had disappointed and deceived in offering herself to be trampled to death and torn to pieces she might have suggested to him some feminine firebrand of paris revolutions erect on a barricade or even the sacrificial figure of hypatia whirled through the furious mob of alexandria she was arrested an instant by the arrival of mrs burrage and her son who had quitted the stage on observing the withdrawal of the farrinders and who swept into the room in the manner of people seeking shelter from a thunderstorm the mothers face expressed the wellbred surprise of a person who should have been asked out to dinner and seen the cloth pulled off the table the young man who supported her on his arm instantly lost himself in the spectacle of verena disengaging herself from mrs tarrant only to be again overwhelmed and in the unexpected presence of the mississippian his handsome blue eyes turned from one to the other and he looked infinitely annoyed and bewildered it even seemed to occur to him that he might perhaps interpose with effect and he evidently would have liked to say that without really bragging he would at least have kept the affair from turning into a row but verena muffled and escaping was deaf to him and ransom didnt look the right person to address such a remark as that to mrs burrage and olive as the latter shot past exchanged a glance which represented quick irony on one side and indiscriminating defiance on the other  oh are you going to speak the lady from new york inquired with her cursory laugh  olive had already disappeared but ransom heard her answer flung behind her into the room i am going to be hissed and hooted and insulted  olive olive verena suddenly shrieked and her piercing cry might have reached the front but ransom had already by muscular force wrenched her away and was hurrying her out leaving mrs tarrant to heave herself into the arms of mrs burrage who he was sure would within a minute loom upon her attractively through her tears and supply her with a reminiscence destined to be valuable of aristocratic support and clever composure in the outer labyrinth hasty groups a little scared were leaving the hall giving up the game ransom as he went thrust the hood of verenas long cloak over her head to conceal her face and her identity it quite prevented recognition and as they mingled in the issuing crowd he perceived the quick complete tremendous silence which in the hall had greeted olive chancellors rush to the front every sound instantly dropped the hush was respectful the great public waited and whatever she should say to them and he thought she might indeed be rather embarrassed it was not apparent that they were likely to hurl the benches at her ransom palpitating with his victory felt now a little sorry for her and was relieved to know that even when exasperated a boston audience is not ungenerous ah now i am glad said verena when they reached the street but though she was glad he presently discovered that beneath her hood she was in tears it is to be feared that with the union so far from brilliant into which she was about to enter these were not the last she was destined to shed  the end
