71636410	eight cousins  by louisa m alcott     preface  the author is quite aware of the defects of this little story many of which were unavoidable as it first appeared serially but as uncle alecs experiment was intended to amuse the young folks rather than suggest educational improvements for the consideration of the elders she trusts that these shortcomings will be overlooked by the friends of the eight cousins and she will try to make amends in a second volume which shall attempt to show the rose in bloom  lma     chapter 1two girls  rose sat all alone in the big best parlor with her little handkerchief laid ready to catch the first tear for she was thinking of her troubles and a shower was expected she had retired to this room as a good place in which to be miserable for it was dark and still full of ancient furniture sombre curtains and hung all around with portraits of solemn old gentlemen in wigs severenosed ladies in topheavy caps and staring children in little bobtailed coats or shortwaisted frocks it was an excellent place for woe and the fitful spring rain that pattered on the windowpane seemed to sob cry away im with you  rose really did have some cause to be sad for she had no mother and had lately lost her father also which left her no home but this with her greataunts she had been with them only a week and though the dear old ladies had tried their best to make her happy they had not succeeded very well for she was unlike any child they had ever seen and they felt very much as if they had the care of a lowspirited butterfly  they had given her the freedom of the house and for a day or two she had amused herself roaming all over it for it was a capital old mansion and was full of all manner of odd nooks charming rooms and mysterious passages windows broke out in unexpected places little balconies overhung the garden most romantically and there was a long upper hall full of curiosities from all parts of the world for the campbells had been seacaptains for generations  aunt plenty had even allowed rose to rummage in her great china closet a spicy retreat rich in all the goodies that children love but rose seemed to care little for these toothsome temptations and when that hope failed aunt plenty gave up in despair  gentle aunt peace had tried all sorts of pretty needlework and planned a dolls wardrobe that would have won the heart of even an older child but rose took little interest in pink satin hats and tiny hose though she sewed dutifully till her aunt caught her wiping tears away with the train of a weddingdress and that discovery put an end to the sewing society  then both old ladies put their heads together and picked out the model child of the neighbourhood to come and play with their niece but ariadne blish was the worst failure of all for rose could not bear the sight of her and said she was so like a wax doll she longed to give her a pinch and see if she would squeak so prim little ariadne was sent home and the exhausted aunties left rose to her own devices for a day or two  bad weather and a cold kept her indoors and she spent most of her time in the library where her fathers books were stored here she read a great deal cried a little and dreamed many of the innocent bright dreams in which imaginative children find such comfort and delight this suited her better than anything else but it was not good for her and she grew pale heavyeyed and listless though aunt plenty gave her iron enough to make a cookingstove and aunt peace petted her like a poodle  seeing this the poor aunties racked their brains for a new amusement and determined to venture a bold stroke though not very hopeful of its success they said nothing to rose about their plan for this saturday afternoon but let her alone till the time came for the grand surprise little dreaming that the odd child would find pleasure for herself in a most unexpected quarter  before she had time to squeeze out a single tear a sound broke the stillness making her prick up her ears it was only the soft twitter of a bird but it seemed to be a peculiarly gifted bird for while she listened the soft twitter changed to a lively whistle then a trill a coo a chirp and ended in a musical mixture of all the notes as if the bird burst out laughing rose laughed also and forgetting her woes jumped up saying eagerly  it is a mockingbird where is it  running down the long hall she peeped out at both doors but saw nothing feathered except a draggletailed chicken under a burdock leaf she listened again and the sound seemed to be in the house away she went much excited by the chase and following the changeful song it led her to the chinacloset door  in there how funny she said but when she entered not a bird appeared except the everlastingly kissing swallows on the canton china that lined the shelves all of a sudden roses face brightened and softly opening the slide she peered into the kitchen but the music had stopped and all she saw was a girl in a blue apron scrubbing the hearth rose stared about her for a minute and then asked abruptly  did you hear that mockingbird  i should call it a phebebird answered the girl looking up with a twinkle in her black eyes  where did it go  it is here still  where  in my throat do you want to hear it  oh yes ill come in and rose crept through the slide to the wide shelf on the other side being too hurried and puzzled to go round by the door  the girl wiped her hands crossed her feet on the little island of carpet where she was stranded in a sea of soapsuds and then sure enough out of her slender throat came the swallows twitter the robins whistle the bluejays call the thrushs song the wooddoves coo and many another familiar note all ending as before with the musical ecstacy of a bobolink singing and swinging among the meadow grass on a bright june day  rose was so astonished that she nearly fell off her perch and when the little concert was over clapped her hands delightedly  oh it was lovely who taught you  the birds answered the girl with a smile as she fell to work again  it is very wonderful i can sing but nothing half so fine as that what is your name please  phebe moore  ive heard of phebebirds but i dont believe the real ones could do that laughed rose adding as she watched with interest the scattering of dabs of soft soap over the bricks may i stay and see you work it is very lonely in the parlor  yes indeed if you want to answered phebe wringing out her cloth in a capable sort of way that impressed rose very much  it must be fun to swash the water round and dig out the soap id love to do it only aunt wouldnt like it i suppose said rose quite taken with the new employment  youd soon get tired so youd better keep tidy and look on  i suppose you help your mother a good deal  i havent got any folks  why where do you live then  im going to live here i hope debby wants some one to help round and ive come to try for a week  i hope you will stay for it is very dull said rose who had taken a sudden fancy to this girl who sung like a bird and worked like a woman  hope i shall for im fifteen now and old enough to earn my own living you have come to stay a spell havent you asked phebe looking up at her guest and wondering how life could be dull to a girl who wore a silk frock a daintily frilled apron a pretty locket and had her hair tied up with a velvet snood  yes i shall stay till my uncle comes he is my guardian now and i dont know what he will do with me have you a guardian  my sakes no i was left on the poorhouse steps a little mite of a baby and miss rogers took a liking to me so ive been there ever since but she is dead now and i take care of myself  how interesting it is like arabella montgomery in the gypsys child did you ever read that sweet story asked rose who was fond of tales of foundlings and had read many  i dont have any books to read and all the spare time i get i run off into the woods that rests me better than stories answered phebe as she finished one job and began on another  rose watched her as she got out a great pan of beans to look over and wondered how it would seem to have life all work and no play presently phebe seemed to think it was her turn to ask questions and said wistfully  youve had lots of schooling i suppose  oh dear me yes ive been at boarding school nearly a year and im almost dead with lessons the more i got the more miss power gave me and i was so miserable that i most cried my eyes out papa never gave me hard things to do and he always taught me so pleasantly i loved to study oh we were so happy and so fond of one another but now he is gone and i am left all alone  the tear that would not come when rose sat waiting for it came now of its own accord two of them in fact and rolled down her cheeks telling the tale of love and sorrow better than any words could do it  for a minute there was no sound in the kitchen but the little daughters sobbing and the sympathetic patter of the rain phebe stopped rattling her beans from one pan to another and her eyes were full of pity as they rested on the curly head bent down on roses knee for she saw that the heart under the pretty locket ached with its loss and the dainty apron was used to dry sadder tears than any she had ever shed  somehow she felt more contented with her brown calico gown and bluechecked pinafore envy changed to compassion and if she had dared she would have gone and hugged her afflicted guest  fearing that might not be considered proper she said in her cheery voice  im sure you aint all alone with such a lot of folks belonging to you and all so rich and clever youll be petted to pieces debby says because you are the only girl in the family  phebes last words made rose smile in spite of her tears and she looked out from behind her apron with an april face saying in a tone of comic distress  thats one of my troubles ive got six aunts and they all want me and i dont know any of them very well papa named this place the aunthill and now i see why  phebe laughed with her as she said encouragingly  everyone calls it so and its a real good name for all the mrs campbells live handy by and keep coming up to see the old ladies  i could stand the aunts but there are dozens of cousins dreadful boys all of them and i detest boys some of them came to see me last wednesday but i was lying down and when auntie came to call me i went under the quilt and pretended to be asleep i shall have to see them some time but i do dread it so and rose gave a shudder for having lived alone with her invalid father she knew nothing of boys and considered them a species of wild animal  oh i guess youll like em ive seen em flying round when they come over from the point sometimes in their boats and sometimes on horseback if you like boats and horses youll enjoy yourself firstrate  but i dont im afraid of horses and boats make me ill and i hate boys and poor rose wrung her hands at the awful prospect before her one of these horrors alone she could have borne but all together were too much for her and she began to think of a speedy return to the detested school  phebe laughed at her woe till the beans danced in the pan but tried to comfort her by suggesting a means of relief  perhaps your uncle will take you away where there aint any boys debby says he is a real kind man and always bring heaps of nice things when he comes  yes but you see that is another trouble for i dont know uncle alec at all he hardly ever came to see us though he sent me pretty things very often now i belong to him and shall have to mind him till i am eighteen i may not like him a bit and i fret about it all the time  well i wouldnt borrow trouble but have a real good time im sure i should think i was in clover if i had folks and money and nothing to do but enjoy myself began phebe but got no further for a sudden rush and tumble outside made them both jump  its thunder said phebe  its a circus cried rose who from her elevated perch had caught glimpses of a gay cart of some sort and several ponies with flying manes and tails  the sound died away and the girls were about to continue their confidences when old debby appeared looking rather cross and sleepy after her nap  you are wanted in the parlor miss rose  has anybody come  little girls shouldnt ask questions but do as they are bid was all debby would answer  i do hope it isnt aunt myra she always scares me out of my wits asking how my cough is and groaning over me as if i was going to die said rose preparing to retire the way she came for the slide being cut for the admission of bouncing christmas turkeys and puddings was plenty large enough for a slender girl  guess youll wish it was aunt myra when you see who has come dont never let me catch you coming into my kitchen that way again or ill shut you up in the big biler growled debby who thought it her duty to snub children on all occasions    chapter 2the clan  rose scrambled into the chinacloset as rapidly as possible and there refreshed herself by making faces at debby while she settled her plumage and screwed up her courage then she crept softly down the hall and peeped into the parlor no one appeared and all was so still she felt sure the company was upstairs so she skipped boldly through the halfopen foldingdoors to behold on the other side a sight that nearly took her breath away  seven boys stood in a row all ages all sizes all yellowhaired and blueeyed all in full scotch costume and all smiling nodding and saying as with one voice how are you cousin  rose gave a little gasp and looked wildly about her as if ready to fly for fear magnified the seven and the room seemed full of boys before she could run however the tallest lad stepped out of the line saying pleasantly  dont be frightened this is the clan come to welcome you and im the chief archie at your service  he held out his hand as he spoke and rose timidly put her own into a brown paw which closed over the white morsel and held it as the chief continued his introductions  we came in full rig for we always turn out in style on grand occasions hope you like it now ill tell you who these chaps are and then we shall be all right this big one is prince charlie aunt claras boy she has but one so he is an extra good one this old fellow is mac the bookworm called worm for short this sweet creature is steve the dandy look at his gloves and topknot if you please they are aunt janes lads and a precious pair youd better believe these are the brats my brothers geordie and will and jamie the baby now my men step out and show your manners  at this command to roses great dismay six more hands were offered and it was evident that she was expected to shake them all it was a trying moment to the bashful child but remembering that they were her kinsmen come to welcome her she tried her best to return the greeting cordially  this impressive ceremony being over the clan broke ranks and both rooms instantly appeared to be pervaded with boys rose hastily retired to the shelter of a big chair and sat there watching the invaders and wondering when her aunt would come and rescue her  as if bound to do their duty manfully yet rather oppressed by it each lad paused beside her chair in his wanderings made a brief remark received a still briefer answer and then sheered off with a relieved expression  archie came first and leaning over the chairback observed in a paternal tone  im glad youve come cousin and i hope youll find the aunthill pretty jolly  i think i shall  mac shook his hair out of his eyes stumbled over a stool and asked abruptly  did you bring any books with you  four boxes full they are in the library  mac vanished from the room and steve striking an attitude which displayed his costume effectively said with an affable smile  we were sorry not to see you last wednesday i hope your cold is better  yes thank you and a smile began to dimple about roses mouth as she remembered her retreat under the bedcover  feeling that he had been received with distinguished marks of attention steve strolled away with his topknot higher than ever and prince charlie pranced across the room saying in a free and easy tone  mamma sent her love and hopes you will be well enough to come over for a day next week it must be desperately dull here for a little thing like you  im thirteen and a half though i do look small cried rose forgetting her shyness in indignation at this insult to her newly acquired teens  beg pardon maam never should have guessed it and charlie went off with a laugh glad to have struck a spark out of his meek cousin  geordie and will came together two sturdy eleven and twelve year olders and fixing their round blue eyes on rose fired off a question apiece as if it was a shooting match and she the target  did you bring your monkey  no he is dead  are you going to have a boat  i hope not  here the two with a rightaboutface movement abruptly marched away and little jamie demanded with childish frankness  did you bring me anything nice  yes lots of candy answered rose whereupon jamie ascended into her lap with a sounding kiss and the announcement that he liked her very much  this proceeding rather startled rose for the other lads looked and laughed and in her confusion she said hastily to the young usurper  did you see the circus go by  when where cried all the boys in great excitement at once  just before you came at least i thought it was a circus for i saw a red and black sort of cart and ever so many little ponies and  she got no farther for a general shout made her pause suddenly as archie explained the joke by saying in the middle of his laugh  it was our new dogcart and the shetland ponies youll never hear the last of your circus cousin  but there were so many and they went so fast and the cart was so very red began rose trying to explain her mistake  come and see them all cried the prince and before she knew what was happening she was borne away to the barn and tumultuously introduced to three shaggy ponies and the gay new dogcart  she had never visited these regions before and had her doubts as to the propriety of her being there now but when she suggested that auntie might not like it there was a general cry of  she told us to amuse you and we can do it ever so much better out here than poking round in the house  im afraid i shall get cold without my sacque began rose who wanted to stay but felt rather out of her element  no you wont well fix you cried the lads as one clapped his cap on her head another tied a rough jacket round her neck by the sleeves a third neatly smothered her in a carriage blanket and a fourth threw open the door of the old barouche that stood there saying with a flourish  step in maam and make yourself comfortable while we show you some fun  so rose sat in state enjoying herself very much for the lads proceeded to dance a highland fling with a spirit and skill that made her clap her hands and laugh as she had not done for weeks  how is that my lassie asked the prince coming up all flushed and breathless when the ballet was over  it was splendid i never went to the theatre but once and the dancing was not half so pretty as this what clever boys you must be said rose smiling upon her kinsmen like a little queen upon her subjects  ah were a fine lot and that is only the beginning of our larks we havent got the pipes here or wed      sing for you play for you      a dulcy melody  answered charlie looking much elated at her praise  i did not know we were scotch papa never said anything about it or seemed to care about scotland except to have me sing the old ballads said rose beginning to feel as if she had left america behind her somewhere  neither did we till lately weve been reading scotts novels and all of a sudden we remembered that our grandfather was a scotchman so we hunted up the old stories got a bagpipe put on our plaids and went in heart and soul for the glory of the clan weve been at it some time now and its great fun our people like it and i think we are a pretty canny set  archie said this from the other coachstep where he had perched while the rest climbed up before and behind to join in the chat as they rested  im fitzjames and hes roderick dhu and well give you the broadsword combat some day its a great thing youd better believe added the prince  yes and you should hear steve play the pipes he makes em skirl like a good one cried will from the box eager to air the accomplishments of his race  macs the fellow to hunt up the old stories and tell us how to dress right and pick out rousing bits for us to speak and sing put in geordie saying a good word for the absent worm  and what do you and will do asked rose of jamie who sat beside her as if bound to keep her in sight till the promised gift had been handed over  oh im the little footpage and do errands and will and geordie are the troops when we march and the stags when we hunt and the traitors when we want to cut any heads off  they are very obliging im sure said rose whereat the utility men beamed with modest pride and resolved to enact wallace and montrose as soon as possible for their cousins special benefit  lets have a game of tag cried the prince swinging himself up to a beam with a sounding slap on stevies shoulder  regardless of his gloves dandy tore after him and the rest swarmed in every direction as if bent on breaking their necks and dislocating their joints as rapidly as possible  it was a new and astonishing spectacle to rose fresh from a prim boardingschool and she watched the active lads with breathless interest thinking their antics far superior to those of mops the dear departed monkey  will had just covered himself with glory by pitching off a high loft head first and coming up all right when phebe appeared with a cloak hood and rubbers also a message from aunt plenty that miss rose was to come in directly  all right well bring her answered archie issuing some mysterious order which was so promptly obeyed that before rose could get out of the carriage the boys had caught hold of the pole and rattled her out of the barn round the oval and up to the front door with a cheer that brought two caps to an upper window and caused debby to cry aloud from the back porch  them harumscarum boys will certainly be the death of that delicate little creter  but the delicate little creter seemed all the better for her trip and ran up the steps looking rosy gay and dishevelled to be received with lamentation by aunt plenty who begged her to go and lie down at once  oh please dont we have come to tea with our cousin and well be as good as gold if youll let us stay auntie clamoured the boys who not only approved of our cousin but had no mind to lose their tea for aunt plentys name but feebly expressed her bountiful nature  well dears you can only be quiet and let rose go and take her iron and be made tidy and then we will see what we can find for supper said the old lady as she trotted away followed by a volley of directions for the approaching feast  marmalade for me auntie  plenty of plumcake please  tell debby to trot out the baked pears  im your man for lemonpie maam  do have fritters rose will like em  shed rather have tarts i know  when rose came down fifteen minutes later with every curl smoothed and her most beruffled apron on she found the boys loafing about the long hall and paused on the halfway landing to take an observation for till now she had not really examined her newfound cousins  there was a strong family resemblance among them though some of the yellow heads were darker than others some of the cheeks brown instead of rosy and the ages varied all the way from sixteenyearold archie to jamie who was ten years younger none of them were especially comely but the prince yet all were hearty happylooking lads and rose decided that boys were not as dreadful as she had expected to find them  they were all so characteristically employed that she could not help smiling as she looked archie and charlie evidently great cronies were pacing up and down shoulder to shoulder whistling bonnie dundee mac was reading in a corner with his book close to his nearsighted eyes dandy was arranging his hair before the oval glass in the hatstand geordie and will investigating the internal economy of the moonfaced clock and jamie lay kicking up his heels on the mat at the foot of the stairs bent on demanding his sweeties the instant rose appeared  she guessed his intention and forestalled his demand by dropping a handful of sugarplums down upon him  at his cry of rapture the other lads looked up and smiled involuntarily for the little kinswoman standing there above was a winsome sight with her shy soft eyes bright hair and laughing face the black frock reminded them of her loss and filled the boyish hearts with a kindly desire to be good to our cousin who had no longer any home but this  there she is as fine as you please cried steve kissing his hand to her  come on missy tea is ready added the prince encouragingly  i shall take her in and archie offered his arm with great dignity an honour that made rose turn as red as a cherry and long to run upstairs again  it was a merry supper and the two elder boys added much to the fun by tormenting the rest with dark hints of some interesting event which was about to occur something uncommonly fine they declared it was but enveloped in the deepest mystery for the present  did i ever see it asked jamie  not to remember it but mac and steve have and liked it immensely answered archie thereby causing the two mentioned to neglect debbys delectable fritters for several minutes while they cudgelled their brains  who will have it first asked will with his mouth full of marmalade  aunt plenty i guess  when will she have it demanded geordie bouncing in his seat with impatience  sometime on monday  heart alive what is the boy talking about cried the old lady from behind the tall urn which left little to be seen but the topmost bow of her cap  doesnt auntie know asked a chorus of voices  no and thats the best of the joke for she is desperately fond of it  what colour is it asked rose joining in the fun  blue and brown  is it good to eat asked jamie  some people think so but i shouldnt like to try it answered charlie laughing so he split his tea  who does it belong to put in steve  archie and the prince stared at one another rather blankly for a minute then archie answered with a twinkle of the eye that made charlie explode again  to grandfather campbell  this was a poser and they gave up the puzzle though jamie confided to rose that he did not think he could live till monday without knowing what this remarkable thing was  soon after tea the clan departed singing all the blue bonnets are over the border at the tops of their voices  well dear how do you like your cousins asked aunt plenty as the last pony frisked round the corner and the din died away  pretty well maam but i like phebe better an answer which caused aunt plenty to hold up her hands in despair and trot away to tell sister peace that she never should understand that child and it was a mercy alec was coming soon to take the responsibility off their hands  fatigued by the unusual exertions of the afternoon rose curled herself up in the sofa corner to rest and think about the great mystery little guessing that she was to know it first of all  right in the middle of her meditations she fell asleep and dreamed she was at home again in her own little bed she seemed to wake and see her father bending over her to hear him say my little rose to answer yes papa and then to feel him take her in his arms and kiss her tenderly so sweet so real was the dream that she started up with a cry of joy to find herself in the arms of a brown bearded man who held her close and whispered in a voice so like her fathers that she clung to him involuntarily  this is my little girl and i am uncle alec    chapter 3uncles  when rose woke next morning she was not sure whether she had dreamed what occurred the night before or it had actually happened so she hopped up and dressed although it was an hour earlier than she usually rose for she could not sleep any more being possessed with a strong desire to slip down and see if the big portmanteau and packing cases were really in the hall she seemed to remember tumbling over them when she went to bed for the aunts had sent her off very punctually because they wanted their pet nephew all to themselves  the sun was shining and rose opened her window to let in the soft may air fresh from the sea as she leaned over her little balcony watching an early bird get the worm and wondering how she should like uncle alec she saw a man leap the garden wall and come whistling up the path at first she thought it was some trespasser but a second look showed her that it was her uncle returning from an early dip into the sea she had hardly dared to look at him the night before because whenever she tried to do so she always found a pair of keen blue eyes looking at her now she could take a good stare at him as he lingered along looking about him as if glad to see the old place again  a brown breezy man in a blue jacket with no hat on the curly head which he shook now and then like a water dog broadshouldered alert in his motions and with a general air of strength and stability about him which pleased rose though she could not explain the feeling of comfort it gave her she had just said to herself with a sense of relief i guess i shall like him though he looks as if he made people mind when he lifted his eyes to examine the budding horsechestnut overhead and saw the eager face peering down at him he waved his hand to her nodded and called out in a bluff cheery voice  you are on deck early little niece  i got up to see if you had really come uncle  did you well come down here and make sure of it  im not allowed to go out before breakfast sir  oh indeed with a shrug then ill come aboard and salute he added and to roses great amazement uncle alec went up one of the pillars of the back piazza hand over hand stepped across the roof and swung himself into her balcony saying as he landed on the wide balustrade have you any doubts about me now maam  rose was so taken aback she could only answer with a smile as she went to meet him  how does my girl do this morning he asked taking the little cold hand she gave him in both his big warm ones  pretty well thank you sir  ah but it should be very well why isnt it  i always wake up with a headache and feel tired  dont you sleep well  i lie awake a long time and then i dream and my sleep does not seem to rest me much  what do you do all day  oh i read and sew a little and take naps and sit with auntie  no running about out of doors or housework or riding hey  aunt plenty says im not strong enough for much exercise i drive out with her sometimes but i dont care for it  im not surprised at that said uncle alec half to himself adding in his quick way who have you had to play with  no one but ariadne blish and she was such a goose i couldnt bear her the boys came yesterday and seemed rather nice but of course i couldnt play with them  why not  im too old to play with boys  not a bit of it thats just what you need for youve been mollycoddled too much they are good lads and youll be mixed up with them more or less for years to come so you may as well be friends and playmates at once i will look you up some girls also if i can find a sensible one who is not spoilt by her nonsensical education  phebe is sensible im sure and i like her though i only saw her yesterday cried rose waking up suddenly  and who is phebe if you please  rose eagerly told all she knew and uncle alec listened with an odd smile lurking about his mouth though his eyes were quite sober as he watched the face before him  im glad to see that you are not aristocratic in your tastes but i dont quite make out why you like this young lady from the poorhouse  you may laugh at me but i do i cant tell why only she seems so happy and busy and sings so beautifully and is strong enough to scrub and sweep and hasnt any troubles to plague her said rose making a funny jumble of reasons in her efforts to explain  how do you know that  oh i was telling her about mine and asked if she had any and she said no only id like to go to school and i mean to some day  so she doesnt call desertion poverty and hard work troubles shes a brave little girl and i shall be proud to know her and uncle alec gave an approving nod that made rose wish she had been the one to earn it  but what are these troubles of yours child he asked after a minute of silence  please dont ask me uncle  cant you tell them to me as well as to phebe  something in his tone made rose feel that it would be better to speak out and be done with it so she answered with sudden colour and averted eyes  the greatest one was losing dear papa  as she said that uncle alecs arm came gently round her and he drew her to him saying in the voice so like papas  that is a trouble which i cannot cure my child but i shall try to make you feel it less what else dear  i am so tired and poorly all the time i cant do anything i want to and it makes me cross sighed rose rubbing the aching head like a fretful child  that we can cure and we will said her uncle with a decided nod that made the curls bob on his head to that rose saw the gray ones underneath the brown  aunt myra says i have no constitution and never shall be strong observed rose in a pensive tone as if it was rather a nice thing to be an invalid  aunt myra is a ahem an excellent woman but it is her hobby to believe that everyone is tottering on the brink of the grave and upon my life i believe she is offended if people dont fall into it we will show her how to make constitutions and turn palefaced little ghosts into rosy hearty girls thats my business you know he added more quietly for his sudden outburst had rather startled rose  i had forgotten you were a doctor im glad of it for i do want to be well only i hope you wont give me much medicine for ive taken quarts already and it does me no good  as she spoke rose pointed to a little table just inside the window on which appeared a regiment of bottles  ah ha now well see what mischief these blessed women have been at and making a long arm dr alec set the bottles on the wide railing before him examined each carefully smiled over some frowned over others and said as he put down the last now ill show you the best way to take these messes and as quick as a flash he sent one after another smashing down into the posybeds below  but aunt plenty wont like it and aunt myra will be angry for she sent most of them cried rose half frightened and half pleased at such energetic measures  you are my patient now and ill take the responsibility my way of giving physic is evidently the best for you look better already he said laughing so infectiously that rose followed suit saying saucily  if i dont like your medicines any better than those i shall throw them into the garden and then what will you do  when i prescribe such rubbish ill give you leave to pitch it overboard as soon as you like now what is the next trouble  i hoped you would forget to ask  but how can i help you if i dont know them come let us have no 3  it is very wrong i suppose but i do sometimes wish i had not quite so many aunts they are all very good to me and i want to please them but they are so different i feel sort of pulled to pieces among them said rose trying to express the emotions of a stray chicken with six hens all clucking over it at once  uncle alec threw back his head and laughed like a boy for he could entirely understand how the good ladies had each put in her oar and tried to paddle her own way to the great disturbance of the waters and the entire bewilderment of poor rose  i intend to try a course of uncles now and see how that suits your constitution im going to have you all to myself and no one is to give a word of advice unless i ask it there is no other way to keep order aboard and i am captain of this little craft for a time at least what comes next  but rose stuck there and grew so red her uncle guessed what that trouble was  i dont think i can tell this one it wouldnt be polite and i feel pretty sure that it isnt going to be a trouble any more  as she blushed and stammered over these words dr alec turned his eyes away to the distant sea and said so seriously so tenderly that she felt every word and long remembered them  my child i dont expect you to love and trust me all at once but i do want you to believe that i shall give my whole heart to this new duty and if i make mistakes as i probably shall no one will grieve over them more bitterly than i it is my fault that i am a stranger to you when i want to be your best friend that is one of my mistakes and i never repented it more deeply than i do now your father and i had a trouble once and i thought i could never forgive him so i kept away for years thank god we made it all up the last time i saw him and he told me then that if he was forced to leave her he should bequeath his little girl to me as a token of his love i cant fill his place but i shall try to be a father to her and if she learns to love me half as well as she did the good one she has lost i shall be a proud and happy man will she believe this and try  something in uncle alecs face touched rose to the heart and when he held out his hand with that anxious troubled look in his eyes she was moved to put up her innocent lips and seal the contract with a confiding kiss the strong arm held her close a minute and she felt the broad chest heave once as if with a great sigh of relief but not a word was spoken till a tap at the door made both start  rose popped her head through the window to say come in while dr alec hastily rubbed the sleeve of his jacket across his eyes and began to whistle again  phebe appeared with a cup of coffee  debby told me to bring this and help you get up she said opening her black eyes wide as if she wondered how on earth the sailor man got there  im all dressed so i dont need any help i hope that is good and strong added rose eyeing the steaming cup with an eager look  but she did not get it for a brown hand took possession of it as her uncle said quickly  hold hard my lass and let me overhaul that dose before you take it do you drink all this strong coffee every morning rose  yes sir and i like it auntie says it tones me up and i always feel better after it  this accounts for the sleepless nights the flutter your heart gets into at the least start and this is why that cheek of yours is pale yellow instead of rosy red no more coffee for you my dear and by and by youll see that i am right any new milk downstairs phebe  yes sir plenty right in from the barn  thats the drink for my patient go bring me a pitcherful and another cup i want a draught myself this wont hurt the honeysuckles for they have no nerves to speak of and to roses great discomfort the coffee went after the medicine  dr alec saw the injured look she put on but took no notice and presently banished it by saying pleasantly  ive got a capital little cup among my traps and ill give it to you to drink your milk in as it is made of wood that is supposed to improve whatever is put into it something like a quassia cup that reminds me one of the boxes phebe wanted to lug upstairs last night is for you knowing that i was coming home to find a readymade daughter i picked up all sorts of odd and pretty trifles along the way hoping she would be able to find something she liked among them all early tomorrow well have a grand rummage heres our milk i propose the health of miss rose campbell and drink it with all my heart  it was impossible for rose to pout with the prospect of a delightful boxful of gifts dancing before her eyes so in spite of herself she smiled as she drank her own health and found that fresh milk was not a hard dose to take  now i must be off before i am caught again with my wig in a toss said dr alec preparing to descend the way he came  do you always go in and out like a cat uncle asked rose much amused at his odd ways  i used to sneak out of my window when i was a boy so i need not disturb the aunts and now i rather like it for its the shortest road and it keeps me limber when i have no rigging to climb goodbye till breakfast and away he went down the waterspout over the roof and vanished among the budding honeysuckles below  aint he a funny guardeen exclaimed phebe as she went off with the cups  he is a very kind one i think answered rose following to prowl round the big boxes and try to guess which was hers  when her uncle appeared at sound of the bell he found her surveying with an anxious face a new dish that smoked upon the table  got a fresh trouble rosy he asked stroking her smooth head  uncle are you going to make me eat oatmeal asked rose in a tragic tone  dont you like it  i detest it answered rose with all the emphasis which a turnedup nose a shudder and a groan could give to the three words  you are not a true scotchwoman if you dont like the parritch its a pity for i made it myself and thought wed have such a good time with all that cream to float it in well never mind and he sat down with a disappointed air  rose had made up her mind to be obstinate about it because she did heartily detest the dish but as uncle alec did not attempt to make her obey she suddenly changed her mind and thought she would  ill try to eat it to please you uncle but people are always saying how wholesome it is and that makes me hate it she said halfashamed at her silly excuse  i do want you to like it because i wish my girl to be as well and strong as jessies boys who are brought up on this in the good old fashion no hot bread and fried stuff for them and they are the biggest and bonniest lads of the lot bless you auntie and good morning  dr alec turned to greet the old lady and with a firm resolve to eat or die in the attempt rose sat down  in five minutes she forgot what she was eating so interested was she in the chat that went on it amused her very much to hear aunt plenty call her fortyyearold nephew my dear boy and uncle alec was so full of lively gossip about all creation in general and the aunthill in particular that the detested porridge vanished without a murmur  you will go to church with us i hope alec if you are not too tired said the old lady when breakfast was over  i came all the way from calcutta for that express purpose maam only i must send the sisters word of my arrival for they dont expect me till tomorrow you know and there will be a row in church if those boys see me without warning  ill send ben up the hill and you can step over to myras yourself it will please her and you will have plenty of time  dr alec was off at once and they saw no more of him till the old barouche was at the door and aunt plenty just rustling downstairs in her sunday best with rose like a little black shadow behind her  away they drove in state and all the way uncle alecs hat was more off his head than on for everyone they met smiled and bowed and gave him as blithe a greeting as the day permitted  it was evident that the warning had been a wise one for in spite of time and place the lads were in such a ferment that their elders sat in momentary dread of an unseemly outbreak somewhere it was simply impossible to keep those fourteen eyes off uncle alec and the dreadful things that were done during sermontime will hardly be believed  rose dared not look up after a while for these bad boys vented their emotions upon her till she was ready to laugh and cry with mingled amusement and vexation charlie winked rapturously at her behind his mothers fan mac openly pointed to the tall figure beside her jamie stared fixedly over the back of his pew till rose thought his round eyes would drop out of his head george fell over a stool and dropped three books in his excitement will drew sailors and chinamen on his clean cuffs and displayed them to roses great tribulation steve nearly upset the whole party by burning his nose with salts as he pretended to be overcome by his joy even dignified archie disgraced himself by writing in his hymn book isnt he blue and brown and passing it politely to rose  her only salvation was trying to fix her attention upon uncle mac a portly placid gentleman who seemed entirely unconscious of the iniquities of the clan and dozed peacefully in his pew corner this was the only uncle rose had met for years for uncle jem and uncle steve the husbands of aunt jessie and aunt clara were at sea and aunt myra was a widow uncle mac was a merchant very rich and busy and as quiet as a mouse at home for he was in such a minority among the women folk he dared not open his lips and let his wife rule undisturbed  rose liked the big kindly silent man who came to her when papa died was always sending her splendid boxes of goodies at school and often invited her into his great warehouse full of teas and spices wines and all sorts of foreign fruits there to eat and carry away whatever she liked she had secretly regretted that he was not to be her guardian but since she had seen uncle alec she felt better about it for she did not particularly admire aunt jane  when church was over dr alec got into the porch as quickly as possible and there the young bears had a hug all round while the sisters shook hands and welcomed him with bright faces and glad hearts rose was nearly crushed flat behind a door in that dangerous passage from pew to porch but uncle mac rescued her and put her into the carriage for safe keeping  now girls i want you to come and dine with alec mac also of course but i cannot ask the boys for we did not expect this dear fellow till tomorrow you know so i made no preparations send the lads home and let them wait till monday for really i was shocked at their behaviour in church said aunt plenty as she followed rose  in any other place the defrauded boys would have set up a howl as it was they growled and protested till dr alec settled the matter by saying  never mind old chaps ill make it up to you tomorrow if you sheer off quietly if you dont not a blessed thing shall you have out of my big boxes    chapter 4aunts  all dinnertime rose felt that she was going to be talked about and afterward she was sure of it for aunt plenty whispered to her as they went into the parlour  run up and sit awhile with sister peace my dear she likes to have you read while she rests and we are going to be busy  rose obeyed and the quiet rooms above were so like a church that she soon composed her ruffled feelings and was unconsciously a little minister of happiness to the sweet old lady who for years had sat there patiently waiting to be set free from pain  rose knew the sad romance of her life and it gave a certain tender charm to this greataunt of hers whom she already loved when peace was twenty she was about to be married all was done the wedding dress lay ready the flowers were waiting to be put on the happy hour at hand when word came that the lover was dead they thought that gentle peace would die too but she bore it bravely put away her bridal gear took up her life afresh and lived on a beautiful meek woman with hair as white as snow and cheeks that never bloomed again she wore no black but soft pale colours as if always ready for the marriage that had never come  for thirty years she had lived on fading slowly but cheerful busy and full of interest in all that went on in the family especially the joys and sorrows of the young girls growing up about her and to them she was adviser confidante and friend in all their tender trials and delights a truly beautiful old maiden with her silvery hair tranquil face and an atmosphere of repose about her that soothed whoever came to her  aunt plenty was utterly dissimilar being a stout brisk old lady with a sharp eye a lively tongue and a face like a winterapple always trotting chatting and bustling she was a regular martha cumbered with the cares of this world and quite happy in them  rose was right and while she softly read psalms to aunt peace the other ladies were talking about her little self in the frankest manner  well alec how do you like your ward began aunt jane as they all settled down and uncle mac deposited himself in a corner to finish his doze  i should like her better if i could have begun at the beginning and so got a fair start poor george led such a solitary life that the child has suffered in many ways and since he died she has been going on worse than ever judging from the state i find her in  my dear boy we did what we thought best while waiting for you to wind up your affairs and get home i always told george he was wrong to bring her up as he did but he never took my advice and now here we are with this poor dear child upon our hands i for one freely confess that i dont know what to do with her any more than if she was one of those strange outlandish birds you used to bring home from foreign parts and aunt plenty gave a perplexed shake of the head which caused great commotion among the stiff loops of purple ribbon that bristled all over the cap like crocus buds  if my advice had been taken she would have remained at the excellent school where i placed her but our aunt thought best to remove her because she complained and she has been dawdling about ever since she came a most ruinous state of things for a morbid spoilt girl like rose said mrs jane severely  she had never forgiven the old ladies for yielding to roses pathetic petition that she might wait her guardians arrival before beginning another term at the school which was a regular blimber hotbed and turned out many a feminine toots  i never thought it the proper school for a child in good circumstances an heiress in fact as rose is it is all very well for girls who are to get their own living by teaching and that sort of thing but all she needs is a year or two at a fashionable finishing school so that at eighteen she can come out with eclat put in aunt clara who had been a beauty and a belle and was still a handsome woman  dear dear how shortsighted you all are to be discussing education and plans for the future when this unhappy child is so plainly marked for the tomb sighed aunt myra with a lugubrious sniff and a solemn wag of the funereal bonnet which she refused to remove being afflicted with a chronic catarrh  now it is my opinion that the dear thing only wants freedom rest and care there is look in her eyes that goes to my heart for it shows that she feels the need of what none of us can give her a mother said aunt jessie with tears in her own bright eyes at the thought of her boys being left as rose was to the care of others  uncle alec who had listened silently as each spoke turned quickly towards the last sister and said with a decided nod of approval  youve got it jessie and with you to help me i hope to make the child feel that she is not quite fatherless and motherless  ill do my best alec and i think you will need me for wise as you are you cannot understand a tender timid little creature like rose as a woman can said mrs jessie smiling back at him with a heart full of motherly goodwill  i cannot help feeling that i who have had a daughter of my own can best bring up a girl and i am very much surprised that george did not entrust her to me observed aunt myra with an air of melancholy importance for she was the only one who had given a daughter to the family and she felt that she had distinguished herself though illnatured people said that she had dosed her darling to death  i never blamed him in the least when i remember the perilous experiments you tried with poor carrie began mrs jane in her hard voice  jane campbell i will not hear a word my sainted caroline is a sacred object cried aunt myra rising as if to leave the room  dr alec detained her feeling that he must define his position at once and maintain it manfully if he hoped to have any success in his new undertaking  now my dear souls dont let us quarrel and make rose a bone of contention though upon my word she is almost a bone poor little lass you have had her among you for a year and done what you liked i cannot say that your success is great but that is owing to too many fingers in the pie now i intend to try my way for a year and if at the end of it she is not in better trim than now ill give up the case and hand her over to someone else thats fair i think  she will not be here a year hence poor darling so no one need dread future responsibility said aunt myra folding her black gloves as if all ready for the funeral  by jupiter myra you are enough to damp the ardour of a saint cried dr alec with a sudden spark in his eyes your croaking will worry that child out of her wits for she is an imaginative puss and will fret and fancy untold horrors you have put it into her head that she has no constitution and she rather likes the idea if she had not had a pretty good one she would have been marked for the tomb by this time at the rate you have been going on with her i will not have any interference please understand that so just wash your hands of her and let me manage till i want help then ill ask for it  hear hear came from the corner where uncle mac was apparently wrapt in slumber  you were appointed guardian so we can do nothing but i predict that the girl will be spoilt utterly spoilt answered mrs jane grimly  thank you sister i have an idea that if a woman can bring up two boys as perfectly as you do yours a man if he devotes his whole mind to it may at least attempt as much with one girl replied dr alec with a humorous look that tickled the others immensely for it was a wellknown fact in the family that janes boys were more indulged than all the other lads put together  i am quite easy for i really do think that alec will improve the childs health and by the time his year is out it will be quite soon enough for her to go to madame roccabellas and be finished off said aunt clara settling her rings and thinking with languid satisfaction of the time when she could bring out a pretty and accomplished niece  i suppose you will stay here in the old place unless you think of marrying and its high time you did put in mrs jane much nettled at her brothers last hit  no thank you come and have a cigar mac said dr alec abruptly  dont marry women enough in the family already muttered uncle mac and then the gentlemen hastily fled  aunt peace would like to see you all she says was the message rose brought before the ladies could begin again  hectic hectic dear me dear me murmured aunt myra as the shadow of her gloomy bonnet fell upon rose and the stiff tips of a black glove touched the cheek where the colour deepened under so many eyes  i am glad these pretty curls are natural they will be invaluable by and by said aunt clara taking an observation with her head on one side  now that your uncle has come i no longer expect you to review the studies of the past year i trust your time will not be entirely wasted in frivolous sports however added aunt jane sailing out of the room with the air of a martyr  aunt jessie said not a word but kissed her little niece with a look of tender sympathy that made rose cling to her a minute and follow her with grateful eyes as the door closed behind her  after everybody had gone home dr alec paced up and down the lower hall in the twilight for an hour thinking so intently that sometimes he frowned sometimes he smiled and more than once he stood still in a brown study all of a sudden he said half aloud as if he had made up his mind  i might as well begin at once and give the child something new to think about for myras dismals and janes lectures have made her as blue as a little indigo bag  diving into one of the trunks that stood in a corner he brought up after a brisk rummage a silken cushion prettily embroidered and a quaint cup of dark carved wood  this will do for a start he said as he plumped up the cushion and dusted the cup it wont do to begin too energetically or rose will be frightened i must beguile her gently and pleasantly along till ive won her confidence and then she will be ready for anything  just then phebe came out of the diningroom with a plate of brown bread for rose had been allowed no hot biscuit for tea  ill relieve you of some of that said dr alec and helping himself to a generous slice he retired to the study leaving phebe to wonder at his appetite  she would have wondered still more if she had seen him making that brown bread into neat little pills which he packed into an attractive ivory box out of which he emptied his own bits of lovage  there if they insist on medicine ill order these and no harm will be done i will have my own way but ill keep the peace if possible and confess the joke when my experiment has succeeded he said to himself looking very much like a mischievous boy as he went on with his innocent prescriptions  rose was playing softly on the small organ that stood in the upper hall so that aunt peace could enjoy it and all the while he talked with the old ladies uncle alec was listening to the fitful music of the child and thinking of another rose who used to play for him  as the clock struck eight he called out  time for my girl to be abed else she wont be up early and im full of jolly plans for tomorrow come and see what ive found for you to begin upon  rose ran in and listened with bright attentive face while dr alec said impressively  in my wanderings over the face of the earth i have picked up some excellent remedies and as they are rather agreeable ones i think you and i will try them this is a herbpillow given to me by a wise old woman when i was ill in india it is filled with saffron poppies and other soothing plants so lay your little head on it tonight sleep sweetly without a dream and wake tomorrow without a pain  shall i really how nice it smells and rose willingly received the pretty pillow and stood enjoying its faint sweet odour as she listened to the doctors next remedy  this is the cup i told you of its virtue depends they say on the drinker filling it himself so you must learn to milk ill teach you  im afraid i never can said rose but she surveyed the cup with favour for a funny little imp danced on the handle as if all ready to take a header into the white sea below  dont you think she ought to have something more strengthening than milk alec i really shall feel anxious if she does not have a tonic of some sort said aunt plenty eyeing the new remedies suspiciously for she had more faith in her oldfashioned doses than all the magic cups and poppy pillows of the east  well maam im willing to give her a pill if you think best it is a very simple one and very large quantities may be taken without harm you know hasheesh is the extract of hemp well this is a preparation of corn and rye much used in old times and i hope it will be again  dear me how singular said aunt plenty bringing her spectacles to bear upon the pills with a face so full of respectful interest that it was almost too much for dr alecs gravity  take one in the morning and a goodnight to you my dear he said dismissing his patient with a hearty kiss  then as she vanished he put both hands into his hair exclaiming with a comical mixture of anxiety and amusement  when i think what i have undertaken i declare to you aunt i feel like running away and not coming back till rose is eighteen    chapter 5a belt and a box  when rose came out of her chamber cup in hand next morning the first person she saw was uncle alec standing on the threshold of the room opposite which he appeared to be examining with care when he heard her step he turned about and began to sing  where are you going my pretty maid  im going amilking sir she said answered rose waving the cup and then they finished the verse together in fine style  before either spoke a head in a nightcap so large and beruffled that it looked like a cabbage popped out of a room farther down the hall and an astonished voice exclaimed  what in the world are you doing about so early  clearing our pipes for the day maam look here auntie can i have this room said dr alec making her a sailors bow  any room you like except sisters  thanks and may i go rummaging round in the garrets and gloryholes to furnish it as i like  my dear boy you may turn the house upside down if you will only stay in it  thats a handsome offer im sure ill stay maam heres my little anchor so you will get more than you want of me this time  thats impossible put on your jacket rose dont tire her out with antics alec yes sister im coming and the cabbage vanished suddenly  the first milking lesson was a droll one but after several scares and many vain attempts rose at last managed to fill her cup while ben held clovers tail so that it could not flap and dr alec kept her from turning to stare at the new milkmaid who objected to both these proceedings very much  you look chilly in spite of all this laughing take a smart run round the garden and get up a glow said the doctor as they left the barn  im too old for running uncle miss power said it was not ladylike for girls in their teens answered rose primly  i take the liberty of differing from madame prunes and prisms and as your physician i order you to run off with you said uncle alec with a look and a gesture that made rose scurry away as fast as she could go  anxious to please him she raced round the beds till she came back to the porch where he stood and dropping down upon the steps she sat panting with cheeks as rosy as the rigolette on her shoulders  very well done child i see you have not lost the use of your limbs though you are in your teens that belt is too tight unfasten it then you can take a long breath without panting so  it isnt tight sir i can breathe perfectly well began rose trying to compose herself  her uncles only answer was to lift her up and unhook the new belt of which she was so proud the moment the clasp was open the belt flew apart several inches for it was impossible to restrain the involuntary sigh of relief that flatly contradicted her words  why i didnt know it was tight it didnt feel so a bit of course it would open if i puff like this but i never do because i hardly ever run explained rose rather discomfited by this discovery  i see you dont half fill your lungs and so you can wear this absurd thing without feeling it the idea of cramping a tender little waist in a stiff band of leather and steel just when it ought to be growing said dr alec surveying the belt with great disfavour as he put the clasp forward several holes to roses secret dismay for she was proud of her slender figure and daily rejoiced that she wasnt as stout as luly miller a former schoolmate who vainly tried to repress her plumpness  it will fall off if it is so loose she said anxiously as she stood watching him pull her precious belt about  not if you keep taking long breaths to hold it on that is what i want you to do and when you have filled this out we will go on enlarging it till your waist is more like that of hebe goddess of health and less like that of a fashionplate the ugliest thing imaginable  how it does look and rose gave a glance of scorn at the loose belt hanging round her trim little waist it will be lost and then i shall feel badly for it cost ever so much and is real steel and russia leather just smell how nice  if it is lost ill give you a better one a soft silken sash is much fitter for a pretty child like you than a plated harness like this and ive got no end of italian scarfs and turkish sashes among my traps ah that makes you feel better doesnt it and he pinched the cheek that had suddenly dimpled with a smile  it is very silly of me but i cant help liking to know that here she stopped and blushed and held down her head ashamed to add you think i am pretty  dr alecs eyed twinkled but he said very soberly  rose are you vain  im afraid i am answered a very meek voice from behind the veil of hair that hid the red face  that is a sad fault and he sighed as if grieved at the confession  i know it is and i try not to be but people praise me and i cant help liking it for i really dont think i am repulsive  the last word and the funny tone in which it was uttered were too much for dr alec and he laughed in spite of himself to roses great relief  i quite agree with you and in order that you may be still less repulsive i want you to grow as fine a girl as phebe  phebe and rose looked so amazed that her uncle nearly went off again  yes phebe for she has what you need health if you dear little girls would only learn what real beauty is and not pinch and starve and bleach yourselves out so youd save an immense deal of time and money and pain a happy soul in a healthy body makes the best sort of beauty for man or woman do you understand that my dear  yes sir answered rose much taken down by this comparison with the girl from the poorhouse it nettled her sadly and she showed that it did by saying quickly  i suppose you would like to have me sweep and scrub and wear an old brown dress and go round with my sleeves rolled up as phebe does  i should very much if you could work as well as she does and show as strong a pair of arms as she can i havent seen a prettier picture for some time than she made of herself this morning up to the elbows in suds singing like a blackbird whilst she scrubbed on the back stoop  well i do think you are the queerest man that ever lived was all rose could find to say after this display of bad taste  i havent begun to show you my oddities yet so you must make up your mind to worse shocks than this he said with such a whimsical look that she was glad the sound of a bell prevented her showing more plainly what a blow her little vanities had already received  you will find your box all open up in aunties parlor and there you can amuse her and yourself by rummaging to your hearts content ive got to be cruising round all the morning getting my room to rights said dr alec as they rose from breakfast  cant i help you uncle asked rose quite burning to be useful  no thank you im going to borrow phebe for a while if aunt plenty can spare her  anybody anything alec you will want me i know so ill give orders about dinner and be all ready to lend a hand and the old lady bustled away full of interest and goodwill  uncle will find that i can do some things that phebe cant so now thought rose with a toss of the head as she flew to aunt peace and the longdesired box  every little girl can easily imagine what an extra good time she had diving into a sea of treasures and fishing up one pretty thing after another till the air was full of the mingled odours of musk and sandalwood the room gay with bright colours and rose in a rapture of delight she began to forgive dr alec for the oatmeal diet when she saw a lovely ivory workbox became resigned to the state of her belt when she found a pile of rainbowcoloured sashes and when she came to some distractingly pretty bottles of attar of rose she felt that they almost atoned for the great sin of thinking phebe the finer girl of the two  dr alec meanwhile had apparently taken aunt plenty at her word and was turning the house upside down a general revolution was evidently going on in the greenroom for the dark damask curtains were seen bundling away in phebes arms the airtight stove retiring to the cellar on bens shoulder and the great bedstead going up garret in a fragmentary state escorted by three bearers aunt plenty was constantly on the trot among her storerooms camphorchests and linenclosets looking as if the new order of things both amazed and amused her  half the peculiar performances of dr alec cannot be revealed but as rose glanced up from her box now and then she caught glimpses of him striding by bearing a bamboo chair a pair of ancient andirons a queer japanese screen a rug or two and finally a large bathingpan upon his head  what a curious room it will be she said as she sat resting and refreshing herself with lumps of delight all the way from cairo  i fancy you will like it deary answered aunt peace looking up with a smile from some pretty trifle she was making with blue silk and white muslin  rose did not see the smile for just at that moment her uncle paused at the door and she sprang up to dance before him saying with a face full of childish happiness  look at me look at me im splendid i dont know myself i havent put these things on right i dare say but i do like them so much  you look as gay as a parrot in your fez and cabaja and it does my heart good to see the little black shadow turned into a rainbow said uncle alec surveying the bright figure before him with great approbation  he did not say it but he thought she made a much prettier picture than phebe at the washtub for she had stuck a purple fez on her blonde head tied several brilliant scarfs about her waist and put on a truly gorgeous scarlet jacket with a golden sun embroidered on the back a silver moon on the front and stars of all sizes on the sleeves a pair of turkish slippers adorned her feet and necklaces of amber coral and filigree hung about her neck while one hand held a smellingbottle and the other the spicy box of oriental sweetmeats  i feel like a girl in the arabian nights and expect to find a magic carpet or a wonderful talisman somewhere only i dont see how i ever can thank you for all these lovely things she said stopping her dance as if suddenly oppressed with gratitude  ill tell you how by leaving off the black clothes that never should have been kept so long on such a child and wearing the gay ones ive brought it will do your spirits good and cheer up this sober old house wont it auntie  i think you are right alec and it is fortunate that we have not begun on her spring clothes yet for myra thought she ought not to wear anything brighter than violet and she is too pale for that  you just let me direct miss hemming how to make some of these things you will be surprised to see how much i know about piping hems and gathering armholes and shirring biases began dr alec patting a pile of muslin cloth and silk with a knowing air  aunt peace and rose laughed so that he could not display his knowledge any farther till they stopped when he said goodnaturedly  that will go a great way toward filling out the belt so laugh away morgiana and ill go back to my work or i never shall be done  i couldnt help it shirred biases were so very funny rose said as she turned to her box after the splendid laugh but really auntie she added soberly i feel as if i ought not to have so many nice things i suppose it wouldnt do to give phebe some of them uncle might not like it  he would not mind but they are not suitable for phebe some of the dresses you are done with would be more useful if they can be made over to fit her answered aunt peace in the prudent moderate tone which is so trying to our feelings when we indulge in little fits of charitable enthusiasm  id rather give her new ones for i think she is a little bit proud and might not like old things if she was my sister it would do because sisters dont mind but she isnt and that makes it bad you see i know how i can manage beautifully ill adopt her and rose looked quite radiant with this new idea  im afraid you could not do it legally till you are older but you might see if she likes the plan and at any rate you can be very kind to her for in one sense we are all sisters and should help one another  the sweet old face looked at her so kindly that rose was fired with a desire to settle the matter at once and rushed away to the kitchen just as she was phebe was there polishing up the antique andirons so busily that she started when a voice cried out smell that taste this and look at me  phebe sniffed attar of rose crunched the lump of delight tucked into her mouth and stared with all her eyes at little morgiana prancing about the room like a brilliant paroquet  my stars aint you splendid was all she could say holding up two dusty hands  ive got heaps of lovely things upstairs and ill show them all to you and id go halves only auntie thinks they wouldnt be useful so i shall give you something else and you wont mind will you because i want to adopt you as arabella was in the story wont that be nice  why miss rose have you lost your wits  no wonder phebe asked for rose talked very fast and looked so odd in her new costume and was so eager she could not stop to explain seeing phebes bewilderment she quieted down and said with a pretty air of earnestness  it isnt fair that i should have so much and you so little and i want to be as good to you as if you were my sister for aunt peace says we are all sisters really i thought if i adopted you as much as i can now it would be nicer will you let me please  to roses great surprise phebe sat down on the floor and hid her face in her apron for a minute without answering a word  oh dear now shes offended and i dont know what to do thought rose much discouraged by this reception of her offer  please forgive me i didnt mean to hurt your feelings and hope you wont think she faltered presently feeling that she must undo the mischief if possible  but phebe gave her another surprise by dropping the apron and showing a face all smiles in spite of tears in the eyes as she put both arms round rose and said with a laugh and sob  i think you are the dearest girl in the world and ill let you do anything you like with me  then you do like the plan you didnt cry because i seemed to be kind of patronising i truly didnt mean to be cried rose delighted  i guess i do like it and cried because no one was ever so good to me before and i couldnt help it as for patronising you may walk on me if you want to and i wont mind said phebe in a burst of gratitude for the words we are sisters went straight to her lonely heart and nestled there  well now we can play im a good sprite out of the box or what is better a fairy godmother come down the chimney and you are cinderella and must say what you want said rose trying to put the question delicately  phebe understood that for she had a good deal of natural refinement though she did come from the poorhouse  i dont feel as if i wanted anything now miss rose but to find some way of thanking you for all youve done she said rubbing off a tear that went rolling down the bridge of her nose in the most unromantic way  why i havent done anything but given you a bit of candy here have some more and eat em while you work and think what i can do i must go and clear up so goodbye and dont forget ive adopted you  youve given me sweeter things than candy and im not likely to forget it and carefully wiping off the brickdust phebe pressed the little hand rose offered warmly in both her hard ones while the black eyes followed the departing visitor with a grateful look that made them very soft and bright    chapter 6uncle alecs room  soon after dinner and before she had got acquainted with half her new possessions dr alec proposed a drive to carry round the first instalment of gifts to the aunts and cousins rose was quite ready to go being anxious to try a certain soft burnous from the box which not only possessed a most engaging little hood but had funny tassels bobbing in all directions  the big carriage was full of parcels and even bens seat was loaded with indian war clubs a chinese kite of immense size and a pair of polished oxhorns from africa uncle alec very blue as to his clothes and very brown as to his face sat bolt upright surveying well known places with interest while rose feeling unusually elegant and comfortable leaned back folded in her soft mantle and played she was an eastern princess making a royal progress among her subjects  at three of the places their calls were brief for aunt myras catarrh was unusually bad aunt clara had a room full of company and aunt jane showed such a tendency to discuss the population productions and politics of europe asia and africa that even dr alec was dismayed and got away as soon as possible  now we will have a good time i do hope the boys will be at home said rose with a sigh of relief as they wound yet higher up the hill to aunt jessies  i left this for the last call so that we might find the lads just in from school yes there is jamie on the gate watching for us now youll see the clan gather they are always swarming about together  the instant jamie saw the approaching guests he gave a shrill whistle which was answered by echoes from meadow house and barn as the cousins came running from all directions shouting hooray for uncle alec they went at the carriage like highwaymen robbed it of every parcel took the occupants prisoners and marched them into the house with great exultation  little mum little mum here they are with lots of goodies come down and see the fun right away quick bawled will and geordie amidst a general ripping off of papers and a reckless cutting of strings that soon turned the tidy room into a chaos  down came aunt jessie with her pretty cap half on but such a beaming face below it that one rather thought the flyaway headgear an improvement than otherwise she had hardly time to greet rose and the doctor before the boys were about her each clamouring for her to see his gift and rejoice over it with him for little mum went halves in everything the great horns skirmished about her as if to toss her to the ceiling the war clubs hurtled over her head as if to annihilate her an amazing medley from the four quarters of the globe filled her lap and seven excited boys all talked to her at once  but she liked it oh dear yes and sat smiling admiring and explaining quite untroubled by the din which made rose cover up her ears and dr alec threaten instant flight if the riot was not quelled that threat produced a lull and while the uncle received thanks in one corner the aunt had some little confidences made to her in the other  well dear and how are things going with you now better i hope than they were a week ago  aunt jessie i think im going to be very happy now uncle has come he does the queerest things but he is so good to me i cant help loving him and nestling closer to little mum rose told all that had happened ending with a rapturous account of the splendid box  i am very glad dear but rose i must warn you of one thing dont let uncle spoil you  but i like to be spoilt auntie  i dont doubt it but if you turn out badly when the year is over he will be blamed and his experiment prove a failure that would be a pity wouldnt it when he wants to do so much for you and can do it if his kind heart does not get in the way of his good judgment  i never thought of that and ill try not to be spoilt but how can i help it asked rose anxiously  by not complaining of the wholesome things he wants you to do by giving him cheerful obedience as well as love and even making some small sacrifices for his sake  i will i truly will and when i get in a worry about things may i come to you uncle told me to and i feel as if i shouldnt be afraid  you may darling this is the place where little troubles are best cured and this is what mothers are for i fancy and aunt jessie drew the curly head to her shoulder with a tender look that proved how well she knew what medicine the child most needed  it was so sweet and comfortable that rose sat still enjoying it till a little voice said  mamma dont you think pokey would like some of my shells rose gave phebe some of her nice things and it was very good of her can i  who is pokey asked rose popping up her head attracted by the odd name  my dolly do you want to see her asked jamie who had been much impressed by the tale of adoption he had overheard  yes im fond of dollies only dont tell the boys or they will laugh at me  they dont laugh at me and they play with my dolly a great deal but she likes me best and jamie ran away to produce his pet  i brought my old doll but i keep her hidden because i am too big to play with her and yet i cant bear to throw her away im so fond of her said rose continuing her confidences in a whisper  you can come and play with jamies whenever you like for we believe in dollies up here began aunt jessie smiling to herself as if something amused her  just then jamie came back and rose understood the smile for his dolly proved to be a pretty fouryearold little girl who trotted in as fast as her fat legs would carry her and making straight for the shells scrambled up an armful saying with a laugh that showed her little white teeth  all for dimmy and me for dimmy and me  thats my dolly isnt she a nice one asked jamie proudly surveying his pet with his hands behind him and his short legs rather far apart a manly attitude copied from his brothers  she is a dear dolly but why call her pokey asked rose charmed with the new plaything  she is such an inquisitive little body she is always poking that mite of a nose into everything and as paul pry did not suit the boys fell to calling her pokey not a pretty name but very expressive  it certainly was for having examined the shells the busy tot laid hold of everything she could find and continued her researches till archie caught her sucking his carved ivory chessmen to see if they were not barley sugar rice paper pictures were also discovered crumpled up in her tiny pocket and she nearly smashed wills ostrich egg by trying to sit upon it  here jim take her away shes worse than the puppies and we cant have her round commanded the elder brother picking her up and handing her over to the little fellow who received her with open arms and the warning remark  youd better mind what you do for im going to dopt pokey like rose did phebe and then youll have to be very good to her you big fellows  dopt away baby and ill give you a cage to keep her in or you wont have her long for she is getting worse than a monkey and archie went back to his mates while aunt jessie foreseeing a crisis proposed that jamie should take his dolly home as she was borrowed and it was time her visit ended  my dolly is better than yours isnt she cause she can walk and talk and sing and dance and yours cant do anything can she asked jamie with pride as he regarded his pokey who just then had been moved to execute a funny little jig and warble the wellknown couplet      pusstat pusstat where you been      i been lunnin to saw a tween  after which superb display she retired escorted by jamie both making a fearful din blowing on conch shells  we must tear ourselves away rose because i want to get you home before sunset will you come for a drive jessie said dr alec as the music died away in the distance  no thank you but i see the boys want a scamper so if you dont mind they may escort you home but not go in that is only allowed on holidays  the words were hardly out of aunt jessies mouth when archie said in a tone of command  pass the word lads boot and saddle and be quick about it  all right and in a moment not a vestige of boy remained but the litter on the floor  the cavalcade went down the hill at a pace that made rose cling to her uncles arm for the fat old horses got excited by the antics of the ponies careering all about them and went as fast as they could pelt with the gay dogcart rattling in front for archie and charlie scorned shelties since this magnificent equipage had been set up ben enjoyed the fun and the lads cut up capers till rose declared that circus was the proper name for them after all  when they reached the house they dismounted and stood three on each side the steps in martial attitudes while her ladyship was handed out with great elegance by uncle alec then the clan saluted mounted at word of command and with a wild whoop tore down the avenue in what they considered the true arab style  that was splendid now it is safely ended said rose skipping up the steps with her head over her shoulder to watch the dear tassels bob about  i shall get you a pony as soon as you are a little stronger said dr alec watching her with a smile  oh i couldnt ride one of those horrid frisky little beasts they roll their eyes and bounce about so i should die of fright cried rose clasping her hands tragically  are you a coward  about horses i am  never mind then come and see my new room and he led the way upstairs without another word  as rose followed she remembered her promise to aunt jessie and was sorry she had objected so decidedly she was a great deal more sorry five minutes later and well she might be  now take a good look and tell me what you think of it said dr alec opening the door and letting her enter before him while phebe was seen whisking down the backstairs with a dustpan  rose walked to the middle of the room stood still and gazed about her with eyes that brightened as they looked for all was changed  this chamber had been built out over the library to suit some fancy and had been unused for years except at christmas times when the old house overflowed it had three windows one to the east that overlooked the bay one to the south where the horsechestnuts waved their green fans and one to the west towards the hill and the evening sky a ruddy sunset burned there now filling the room with an enchanted glow the soft murmur of the sea was heard and a robin chirped goodnight among the budding trees  rose saw and heard these things first and felt their beauty with a childs quick instinct then her eye took in the altered aspect of the room once so shrouded still and solitary now so full of light and warmth and simple luxury  india matting covered the floor with a gay rug here and there the antique andirons shone on the wide hearth where a cheery blaze dispelled the dampness of the longclosed room bamboo lounges and chairs stood about and quaint little tables in cosy corners one bearing a pretty basket one a desk and on a third lay several familiarlooking books in a recess stood a narrow white bed with a lovely madonna hanging over it the japanese screen halffolded back showed a delicate toilet service of blue and white set forth on a marble slab and near by was the great bathpan with turkish towels and a sponge as big as roses head  uncle must love cold water like a duck she thought with a shiver  then her eye went on to the tall cabinet where a halfopen door revealed a tempting array of the drawers shelves and cubby holes which so delight the hearts of children  what a grand place for my new things she thought wondering what her uncle kept in that cedar retreat  oh me what a sweet toilet table was her next mental exclamation as she approached this inviting spot  a round oldfashioned mirror hung over it with a gilt eagle atop holding in his beak the knot of blue ribbon that tied up a curtain of muslin falling on either side of the table where appeared little ivoryhandled brushes two slender silver candlesticks a porcelain matchbox several pretty trays for small matters and most imposing of all a plump blue silk cushion coquettishly trimmed with lace and pink rosebuds at the corners  that cushion rather astonished rose in fact the whole table did and she was just thinking with a sly smile  uncle is a dandy but i never should have guessed it when he opened the door of a large closet saying with a careless wave of the hand  men like plenty of room for their rattletraps dont you think that ought to satisfy me  rose peeped in and gave a start though all she saw was what one usually finds in closets clothes and boots boxes and bags ah but you see these clothes were small black and white frocks the row of little boots that stood below had never been on dr alecs feet the green bandbox had a gray veil straying out of it and yes the bag hanging on the door was certainly her own piecebag with a hole in one corner she gave a quick look round the room and understood now why it had seemed too dainty for a man why her testament and prayer book were on the table by the bed and what those rosebuds meant on the blue cushion it came upon her in one delicious burst that this little paradise was all for her and not knowing how else to express her gratitude she caught dr alec round the neck saying impetuously  o uncle you are too good to me ill do anything you ask me ride wild horses and take freezing baths and eat badtasting messes and let my clothes hang on me to show how much i thank you for this dear sweet lovely room  you like it then but why do you think it is yours my lass asked dr alec as he sat down looking well pleased and drew his excited little niece to his knee  i dont think i know it is for me i see it in your face and i feel as if i didnt half deserve it aunt jessie said you would spoil me and i must not let you im afraid this looks like it and perhaps oh me perhaps i ought not to have this beautiful room after all and rose tried to look as if she could be heroic enough to give it up if it was best  i owe mrs jessie one for that said dr alec trying to frown though in his secret soul he felt that she was quite right then he smiled that cordial smile which was like sunshine on his brown face as he said  this is part of the cure rose and i put you here that you might take my three great remedies in the best and easiest way plenty of sun fresh air and cold water also cheerful surroundings and some work for phebe is to show you how to take care of this room and be your little maid as well as friend and teacher does that sound hard and disagreeable to you dear  no sir very very pleasant and ill do my best to be a good patient but i really dont think anyone could be sick in this delightful room she said with a long sigh of happiness as her eye went from one pleasant object to another  then you like my sort of medicine better than aunt myras and dont want to throw it out of the window hey    chapter 7a trip to china  come little girl ive got another dose for you i fancy you wont take it as well as you did the last but you will like it better after a while said dr alec about a week after the grand surprise  rose was sitting in her pretty room where she would gladly have spent all her time if it had been allowed but she looked up with a smile for she had ceased to fear her uncles remedies and was always ready to try a new one the last had been a set of light gardening tools with which she had helped him put the flowerbeds in order learning all sorts of new and pleasant things about the plants as she worked for though she had studied botany at school it seemed very dry stuff compared with uncle alecs lively lesson  what is it now she asked shutting her workbox without a murmur  saltwater  how must i take it  put on the new suit miss hemming sent home yesterday and come down to the beach then ill show you  yes sir answered rose obediently adding to herself with a shiver as he went off it is too early for bathing so i know it is something to do with a dreadful boat  putting on the new suit of blue flannel prettily trimmed with white and the little sailorhat with long streamers diverted her mind from the approaching trial till a shrill whistle reminded her that her uncle was waiting away she ran through the garden down the sandy path out upon the strip of beach that belonged to the house and here she found dr alec busy with a slender red and white boat that lay rocking on the rising tide  that is a dear little boat and bonnie belle is a pretty name she said trying not to show how nervous she felt  it is for you so sit in the stern and learn to steer till you are ready to learn to row  do all boats wiggle about in that way she asked lingering as if to tie her hat more firmly  oh yes pitch about like nutshells when the sea is a bit rough answered her sailor uncle never guessing her secret woe  is it rough today  not very it looks a trifle squally to the eastward but we are all right till the wind changes come  can you swim uncle asked rose clutching at his arm as he took her hand  like a fish now then  oh please hold me very tight till i get there why do you have the stern so far away and stifling several squeaks of alarm in her passage rose crept to the distant seat and sat there holding on with both hands and looking as if she expected every wave to bring a sudden shipwreck  uncle alec took no notice of her fear but patiently instructed her in the art of steering till she was so absorbed in remembering which was starboard and which larboard that she forgot to say ow every time a big wave slapped against the boat  now where shall we go she asked as the wind blew freshly in her face and a few long swift strokes sent them half across the little bay  suppose we go to china  isnt that rather a long voyage  not as i go steer round the point into the harbour and ill give you a glimpse of china in twenty minutes or so  i should like that and rose sat wondering what he meant while she enjoyed the new sights all about her  behind them the green aunthill sloped gently upward to the grove at the top and all along the seaward side stood familiar houses stately cosy or picturesque as they rounded the point the great bay opened before them full of shipping and the city lay beyond its spires rising above the tall masts with their gay streamers  are we going there she asked for she had never seen this aspect of the rich and busy old city before  yes uncle mac has a ship just in from hong kong and i thought you would like to go and see it  oh i should i love dearly to go poking about in the warehouses with uncle mac everything is so curious and new to me and im specially interested in china because you have been there  ill show you two genuine chinamen who have just arrived you will like to welcome whang lo and fun see im sure  dont ask me to speak to them uncle i shall be sure to laugh at the odd names and the pigtails and the slanting eyes please let me just trot round after you i like that best  very well now steer toward the wharf where the big ship with the queer flag is thats the rajah and we will go aboard if we can  in among the ships they went by the wharves where the water was green and still and queer barnacles grew on the slippery piles odd smells saluted her nose and odd sights met her eyes but rose liked it all and played she was really landing in hong kong when they glided up to the steps in the shadow of the tall rajah boxes and bales were rising out of the hold and being carried into the warehouse by stout porters who tugged and bawled and clattered about with small trucks or worked cranes with iron claws that came down and clutched heavy weights whisking them aloft to where wide doors like mouths swallowed them up  dr alec took her aboard the ship and she had the satisfaction of poking her inquisitive little nose into every available corner at the risk of being crushed lost or drowned  well child how would you like to take a voyage round the world with me in a jolly old craft like this asked her uncle as they rested a minute in the captains cabin  i should like to see the world but not in such a small untidy smelly place as this we would go in a yacht all clean and comfortable charlie says that is the proper way answered rose surveying the close quarters with little favour  you are not a true campbell if you dont like the smell of tar and saltwater nor charlie either with his luxurious yacht now come ashore and chinchin with the celestials  after a delightful progress through the great warehouse peeping and picking as they went they found uncle mac and the yellow gentlemen in his private room where samples gifts curiosities and newly arrived treasures of all sorts were piled up in pleasing profusion and confusion  as soon as possible rose retired to a corner with a porcelain god on one side a green dragon on the other and what was still more embarrassing fun see sat on a teachest in front and stared at her with his beady black eyes till she did not know where to look  mr whang lo was an elderly gentleman in american costume with his pigtail neatly wound round his head he spoke english and was talking busily with uncle mac in the most commonplace way so rose considered him a failure but fun see was delightfully chinese from his junklike shoes to the button on his pagoda hat for he had got himself up in style and was a mass of silk jackets and slouchy trousers he was short and fat and waddled comically his eyes were very slanting as rose said his queue was long so were his nails his yellow face was plump and shiny and he was altogether a highly satisfactory chinaman  uncle alec told her that fun see had come out to be educated and could only speak a little pigeon english so she must be kind to the poor fellow for he was only a lad though he looked nearly as old as mr whang lo rose said she would be kind but had not the least idea how to entertain the queer guest who looked as if he had walked out of one of the ricepaper landscapes on the wall and sat nodding at her so like a toy mandarin that she could hardly keep sober  in the midst of her polite perplexity uncle mac saw the two young people gazing wistfully at one another and seemed to enjoy the joke of this making acquaintance under difficulties taking a box from his table he gave it to fun see with an order that seemed to please him very much  descending from his perch he fell to unpacking it with great neatness and despatch while rose watched him wondering what was going to happen presently out from the wrappings came a teapot which caused her to clasp her hands with delight for it was made in the likeness of a plump little chinaman his hat was the cover his queue the handle and his pipe the nose it stood upon feet in shoes turned up at the toes and the smile on the fat sleepy face was so like that on funs when he displayed the teapot that rose couldnt help laughing which pleased him much  two pretty cups with covers and a fine scarlet tray completed the set and made one long to have a dish of tea even in chinese style without cream or sugar  when he had arranged them on a little table before her fun signified in pantomime that they were hers from her uncle she returned her thanks in the same way whereupon he returned to his teachest and having no other means of communication they sat smiling and nodding at one another in an absurd sort of way till a new idea seemed to strike fun tumbling off his seat he waddled away as fast as his petticoats permitted leaving rose hoping that he had not gone to get a roasted rat a stewed puppy or any other foreign mess which civility would oblige her to eat  while she waited for her funny new friend she improved her mind in a way that would have charmed aunt jane the gentlemen were talking over all sorts of things and she listened attentively storing up much of what she heard for she had an excellent memory and longed to distinguish herself by being able to produce some useful information when reproached with her ignorance  she was just trying to impress upon her mind that amoy was two hundred and eighty miles from hong kong when fun came scuffling back bearing what she thought was a small sword till he unfurled an immense fan and presented it with a string of chinese compliments the meaning of which would have amused her even more than the sound if she could have understood it  she had never seen such an astonishing fan and at once became absorbed in examining it of course there was no perspective whatever which only gave it a peculiar charm to rose for in one place a lovely lady with blue knittingneedles in her hair sat directly upon the spire of a stately pagoda in another charming view a brook appeared to flow in at the front door of a stout gentlemans house and out at his chimney in a third a zigzag wall went up into the sky like a flash of lightning and a bird with two tails was apparently brooding over a fisherman whose boat was just going aground upon the moon  it was altogether a fascinating thing and she would have sat wafting it to and fro all the afternoon to funs great satisfaction if dr alecs attention had not suddenly been called to her by a breeze from the big fan that blew his hair into his eyes and reminded him that they must go so the pretty china was repacked rose furled her fan and with several parcels of choice teas for the old ladies stowed away in dr alecs pockets they took their leave after fun had saluted them with the three bendings and the nine knockings as they salute the emperor or son of heaven at home  i feel as if i had really been to china and im sure i look so said rose as they glided out of the shadow of the rajah  she certainly did for mr whang lo had given her a chinese umbrella uncle alec had got some lanterns to light up her balcony the great fan lay in her lap and the teaset reposed at her feet  this is not a bad way to study geography is it asked her uncle who had observed her attention to the talk  it is a very pleasant way and i really think i have learned more about china today than in all the lessons i had at school though i used to rattle off the answers as fast as i could go no one explained anything to us so all i remember is that tea and silk come from there and the women have little bits of feet i saw fun looking at mine and he must have thought them perfectly immense answered rose surveying her stout boots with sudden contempt  we will have out the maps and the globe and ill show you some of my journeys telling stories as we go that will be next best to doing it actually  you are so fond of travelling i should think it would be very dull for you here uncle do you know aunt plenty says she is sure you will be off in a year or two  very likely  oh me what shall i do then sighed rose in a tone of despair that made uncle alecs face brighten with a look of genuine pleasure as he said significantly  next time i go i shall take my little anchor with me how will that suit  really uncle  really niece  rose gave a little bounce of rapture which caused the boat to wiggle in a way that speedily quieted her down but she sat beaming joyfully and trying to think which of some hundred questions she would ask first when dr alec said pointing to a boat that was coming up behind them in great style  how well those fellows row look at them and take notes for your own use by and by  the stormy petrel was manned by half a dozen jaunty looking sailors who made a fine display of blue shirts and shiny hats with stars and anchors in every direction  how beautifully they go and they are only boys why i do believe they are our boys yes i see charlie laughing over his shoulder row uncle row oh please do and not let them catch up with us cried rose in such a state of excitement that the new umbrella nearly went overboard  all right here we go and away they did go with a long steady sweep of the oars that carried the bonnie belle through the water with a rush  the lads pulled their prettiest but dr alec would have reached the point first if rose in her flurry had not retarded him by jerking the rudder ropes in a most unseamanlike way and just as she got right again her hat blew off that put an end to the race and while they were still fishing for the hat the other boat came alongside with all the oars in the air and the jolly young tars ready for a frolic  did you catch a crab uncle  no a bluefish he answered as the dripping hat was landed on a seat to dry  what have you been doing  seeing fun  good for you rose i know what you mean we are going to have him up to show us how to fly the big kite for we cant get the hang of it isnt he great fun though  no little fun  come stop joking and show us what youve got  youd better hoist that fan for a sail  lend dandy your umbrella he hates to burn his pretty nose  i say uncle are you going to have a feast of lanterns  no im going to have a feast of bread and butter for its teatime if that black cloud doesnt lie we shall have a gust before long so you had better get home as soon as you can or your mother will be anxious archie  ay ay skipper goodnight rose come out often and well teach you all there is to know about rowing was charlies modest invitation  then the boats parted company and across the water from the petrels crew came a verse from one of the nonsense songs in which the boys delighted      oh timballoo how happy we are      we live in a sieve and a crockery jar      and all night long in the starlight pale      we sail away with a peagreen sail      and whistle and warble a moony song      to the echoing sound of a coppery gong      far and few far and few      are the lands where the jumblies live      their heads are green and their hands are blue      and they went to sea in a sieve    chapter 8and what came of it  uncle could you lend me a ninepence ill return it as soon as i get my pocketmoney said rose coming into the library in a great hurry that evening  i think i could and i wont charge any interest for it so you need not be in any hurry to repay me come back here and help me settle these books if you have nothing pleasanter to do answered dr alec handing out the money with that readiness which is so delightful when we ask small loans  ill come in a minute ive been longing to fix my books but didnt dare to touch them because you always shake your head when i read  i shall shake my head when you write if you dont do it better than you did in making out this catalogue  i know its bad but i was in a hurry when i did it and i am in one now and away went rose glad to escape a lecture  but she got it when she came back for uncle alec was still knitting his brows over the list of books and sternly demanded pointing to a tipsylooking title staggering down the page  is that meant for pulverized bones maam  no sir its paradise lost  well im glad to know it for i began to think you were planning to study surgery or farming and what is this if you please babies aprons is all i can make of it  rose looked hard at the scrawl and presently announced with an air of superior wisdom  oh thats bacons essays  miss power did not teach anything so oldfashioned as writing i see now look at this memorandum aunt plenty gave me and see what a handsome plain hand that is she went to a dameschool and learnt a few useful things well that is better than a smattering of half a dozen socalled higher branches i take the liberty of thinking  well im sure i was considered a bright girl at school and learned everything i was taught luly and me were the first in all our classes and specially praised for our french and music and those sort of things said rose rather offended at uncle alecs criticism  i dare say but if your french grammar was no better than your english i think the praise was not deserved my dear  why uncle we did study english grammar and i could parse beautifully miss power used to have us up to show off when people came i dont see but i talk as right as most girls  i dare say you do but we are all too careless about our english now think a minute and tell me if these expressions are correct luly and me those sort of things and as right as most girls  rose pulled her pet curl and put up her lip but had to own that she was wrong and said meekly after a pause which threatened to be sulky  i suppose i should have said luly and i in that case and that sort of things and rightly though correctly would have been a better word i guess  thank you and if you will kindly drop i guess i shall like my little yankee all the better now see here rosy i dont pretend to set myself up for a model in anything and you may come down on my grammar manners or morals as often as you think im wrong and ill thank you ive been knocking about the world for years and have got careless but i want my girl to be what i call welleducated even if she studies nothing but the three rs for a year to come let us be thorough no matter how slowly we go  he spoke so earnestly and looked so sorry to have ruffled her that rose went and sat on the arm of his chair saying with a pretty air of penitence  im sorry i was cross uncle when i ought to thank you for taking so much interest in me i guess no i think you are right about being thorough for i used to understand a great deal better when papa taught me a few lessons than when miss power hurried me through so many i declare my head used to be such a jumble of french and german history and arithmetic grammar and music i used to feel sometimes as if it would split im sure i dont wonder it ached and she held on to it as if the mere memory of the jumble made it swim  yet that is considered an excellent school i find and i dare say it would be if the benighted lady did not think it necessary to cram her pupils like thanksgiving turkeys instead of feeding them in a natural and wholesome way it is the fault with most american schools and the poor little heads will go on aching till we learn better  this was one of dr alecs hobbies and rose was afraid he was off for a gallop but he reined himself in and gave her thoughts a new turn by saying suddenly as he pulled out a fat pocketbook  uncle mac has put all your affairs into my hands now and here is your months pocket money you keep your own little accounts i suppose  thank you yes uncle mac gave me an account book when i went to school and i used to put down my expenses but i couldnt make them go very well for figures are the one thing i am not at all clever about said rose rummaging in her desk for a dilapidated little book which she was ashamed to show when she found it  well as figures are rather important things to most of us and you may have a good many accounts to keep some day wouldnt it be wise to begin at once and learn to manage your pennies before the pounds come to perplex you  i thought you would do all that fussy part and take care of the pounds as you call them need i worry about it i do hate sums so  i shall take care of things till you are of age but i mean that you shall know how your property is managed and do as much of it as you can by and by then you wont be dependent on the honesty of other people  gracious me as if i wouldnt trust you with millions of billions if i had them cried rose scandalised at the mere suggestion  ah but i might be tempted guardians are sometimes so youd better keep your eye on me and in order to do that you must learn all about these affairs answered dr alec as he made an entry in his own very neat accountbook  rose peeped over his shoulder at it and then turned to the arithmetical puzzle in her hand with a sigh of despair  uncle when you add up your expenses do you ever find you have got more money than you had in the beginning  no i usually find that i have a good deal less than i had in the beginning are you troubled in the peculiar way you mention  yes it is very curious but i never can make things come out square  perhaps i can help you began uncle alec in the most respectful tone  i think you had better for if i have got to keep accounts i may as well begin in the right way but please dont laugh i know im very stupid and my book is a disgrace but i never could get it straight and with great trepidation rose gave up her funny little accounts  it really was good in dr alec not to laugh and rose felt deeply grateful when he said in a mildly suggestive tone  the dollars and cents seem to be rather mixed perhaps if i just straightened them out a bit we should find things all right  please do and then show me on a fresh leaf how to make mine look nice and shipshape as yours do  as rose stood by him watching the ease with which he quickly brought order out of chaos she privately resolved to hunt up her old arithmetic and perfect herself in the four first rules with a good tug at fractions before she read any more fairy tales  am i a rich girl uncle she asked suddenly as he was copying a column of figures  rather a poor one i should say since you had to borrow a ninepence  that was your fault because you forgot my pocketmoney but really shall i be rich by and by  i am afraid you will  why afraid uncle  too much money is a bad thing  but i can give it away you know that is always the pleasantest part of having it i think  im glad you feel so for you can do much good with your fortune if you know how to use it well  you shall teach me and when i am a woman we will set up a school where nothing but the three rs shall be taught and all the children live on oatmeal and the girls have waists a yard round said rose with a sudden saucy smile dimpling her cheeks  you are an impertinent little baggage to turn on me in that way right in the midst of my first attempt at teaching never mind ill have an extra bitter dose for you next time miss  i knew you wanted to laugh so i gave you a chance now i will be good master and do my lesson nicely  so dr alec had his laugh and then rose sat down and took a lesson in accounts which she never forgot  now come and read aloud to me my eyes are tired and it is pleasant to sit here by the fire while the rain pours outside and aunt jane lectures upstairs said uncle alec when last months accounts had been put in good order and a fresh page neatly begun  rose liked to read aloud and gladly gave him the chapter in nicholas nickleby where the miss kenwigses take their french lesson she did her very best feeling that she was being criticised and hoping that she might not be found wanting in this as in other things  shall i go on sir she asked very meekly when the chapter ended  if you are not tired dear it is a pleasure to hear you for you read remarkably well was the answer that filled her heart with pride and pleasure  do you really think so uncle im so glad papa taught me and i read for hours to him but i thought perhaps he liked it because he was fond of me  so am i but you really do read unusually well and im very glad of it for it is a rare accomplishment and one i value highly come here in this cosy low chair the light is better and i can pull these curls if you go too fast i see you are going to be a great comfort as well as a great credit to your old uncle rosy and dr alec drew her close beside him with such a fatherly look and tone that she felt it would be very easy to love and obey him since he knew how to mix praise and blame so pleasantly together  another chapter was just finished when the sound of a carriage warned them that aunt jane was about to depart before they could go to meet her however she appeared in the doorway looking like an unusually tall mummy in her waterproof with her glasses shining like cats eyes from the depths of the hood  just as i thought petting that child to death and letting her sit up late reading trash i do hope you feel the weight of the responsibility you have taken upon yourself alec she said with a certain grim sort of satisfaction at seeing things go wrong  i think i have a very realising sense of it sister jane answered dr alec with a comical shrug of the shoulders and a glance at roses bright face  it is sad to see a great girl wasting these precious hours so now my boys have studied all day and mac is still at his books ive no doubt while you have not had a lesson since you came i suspect  ive had five today maam was roses very unexpected answer  im glad to hear it and what were they pray rose looked very demure as she replied  navigation geography grammar arithmetic and keeping my temper  queer lessons i fancy and what have you learned from this remarkable mixture i should like to know  a naughty sparkle came into roses eyes as she answered with a droll look at her uncle  i cant tell you all maam but i have collected some useful information about china which you may like especially the teas the best are lapsing souchong assam pekoe rare ankoe flowery pekoe howquas mixture scented caper padral tea black congou and green twankey shanghai is on the woosung river hong kong means island of sweet waters singapore is lions town chops are the boats they live in and they drink tea out of little saucers principal productions are porcelain tea cinnamon shawls tin tamarinds and opium they have beautiful temples and queer gods and in canton is the dwelling of the holy pigs fourteen of them very big and all blind  the effect of this remarkable burst was immense especially the fact last mentioned it entirely took the wind out of aunt janes sails it was so sudden so varied and unexpected that she had not a word to say the glasses remained fixed full upon rose for a moment and then with a hasty oh indeed the excellent lady bundled into her carriage and drove away somewhat bewildered and very much disturbed  she would have been more so if she had seen her reprehensible brotherinlaw dancing a triumphal polka down the hall with rose in honour of having silenced the enemys battery for once    chapter 9phebes secret  why do you keep smiling to yourself phebe asked rose as they were working together one morning for dr alec considered housework the best sort of gymnastics for girls so rose took lessons of phebe in sweeping dusting and bedmaking  i was thinking about a nice little secret i know and couldnt help smiling  shall i know it sometime  guess you will  shall i like it  oh wont you though  will it happen soon  sometime this week  i know what it is the boys are going to have fireworks on the fourth and have got some surprise for me havent they  thats telling  well i can wait only tell me one thing is uncle in it  of course he is theres never any fun without him  then its all right and sure to be nice  rose went out on the balcony to shake the rugs and having given them a vigorous beating hung them on the balustrade to air while she took a look at her plants several tall vases and jars stood there and a month of june sun and rain had worked wonders with the seeds and slips she had planted morningglories and nasturtiums ran all over the bars making haste to bloom scarlet beans and honeysuckles were climbing up from below to meet their pretty neighbours and the woodbine was hanging its green festoons wherever it could cling  the waters of the bay were dancing in the sunshine a fresh wind stirred the chestnuttrees with a pleasant sound and the garden below was full of roses butterflies and bees a great chirping and twittering went on among the birds busy with their summer housekeeping and far away the whitewinged gulls were dipping and diving in the sea where ships like larger birds went sailing to and fro  oh phebe its such a lovely day i do wish your fine secret was going to happen right away i feel just like having a good time dont you said rose waving her arms as if she was going to fly  i often feel that way but i have to wait for my good times and dont stop working to wish for em there now you can finish as soon as the dust settles i must go do my stairs and phebe trudged away with the broom singing as she went  rose leaned where she was and fell to thinking how many good times she had had lately for the gardening had prospered finely and she was learning to swim and row and there were drives and walks and quiet hours of reading and talk with uncle alec and best of all the old pain and ennui seldom troubled her now she could work and play all day sleep sweetly all night and enjoy life with the zest of a healthy happy child she was far from being as strong and hearty as phebe but she was getting on the once pale cheeks had colour in them now the hands were growing plump and brown and the belt was not much too loose no one talked to her about her health and she forgot that she had no constitution she took no medicine but dr alecs three great remedies and they seemed to suit her excellently aunt plenty said it was the pills but as no second batch had ever followed the first i think the old lady was mistaken  rose looked worthy of her name as she stood smiling to herself over a happier secret than any phebe had a secret which she did not know herself till she found out some years later the magic of good health      look only said the brownie      at the pretty gown of blue      at the kerchief pinned about her head      and at her little shoe  said a voice from below as a great cabbagerose came flying against her cheek  what is the princess dreaming about up there in her hanginggarden added dr alec as she flung back a morningglory  i was wishing i could do something pleasant this fine day something very new and interesting for the wind makes me feel frisky and gay  suppose we take a pull over to the island i intended to go this afternoon but if you feel more like it now we can be off at once  i do i do ill come in fifteen minutes uncle i must just scrabble my room to rights for phebe has got a great deal to do  rose caught up the rugs and vanished as she spoke while dr alec went in saying to himself with an indulgent smile  it may upset things a trifle but half a childs pleasure consists in having their fun when they want it  never did duster flap more briskly than the one rose used that day and never was a room scrabbled to rights in such haste as hers tables and chairs flew into their places as if alive curtains shook as if a gale was blowing china rattled and small articles tumbled about as if a young earthquake was playing with them the boating suit went on in a twinkling and rose was off with a hop and a skip little dreaming how many hours it would be before she saw her pretty room again  uncle alec was putting a large basket into the boat when she arrived and before they were off phebe came running down with a queer knobby bundle done up in a waterproof  we cant eat half that luncheon and i know we shall not need so many wraps i wouldnt lumber the boat up so said rose who still had secret scares when on the water  couldnt you make a smaller parcel phebe asked dr alec eyeing the bundle suspiciously  no sir not in such a hurry and phebe laughed as she gave a particularly large knob a good poke  well it will do for ballast dont forget the note to mrs jessie i beg of you  no sir ill send it right off and phebe ran up the bank as if she had wings to her feet  well take a look at the lighthouse first for you have not been there yet and it is worth seeing by the time we have done that it will be pretty warm and we will have lunch under the trees on the island  rose was ready for anything and enjoyed her visit to the lighthouse on the point very much especially climbing up the narrow stairs and going inside the great lantern they made a long stay for dr alec seemed in no hurry to go and kept looking through his spyglass as if he expected to discover something remarkable on sea or land it was past twelve before they reached the island and rose was ready for her lunch long before she got it  now this is lovely i do wish the boys were here wont it be nice to have them with us all their vacation why it begins today doesnt it oh i wish id remembered it sooner and perhaps they would have come with us she said as they lay luxuriously eating sandwiches under the old appletree  so we might next time we wont be in such a hurry i expect the lads will take our heads off when they find us out answered dr alec placidly drinking cold tea  uncle i smell a frying sort of a smell rose said pausing suddenly as she was putting away the remains of the lunch half an hour later  so do i it is fish i think  for a moment they both sat with their noses in the air sniffing like hounds then dr alec sprang up saying with great decision  now this wont do no one is permitted on this island without asking leave i must see who dares to fry fish on my private property  taking the basket on one arm and the bundle on the other he strode away towards the traitorous smell looking as fierce as a lion while rose marched behind under her umbrella  we are robinson crusoe and his man friday going to see if the savages have come she said presently for her fancy was full of the dear old stories that all children love so well  and there they are two tents and two boats as i live these rascals mean to enjoy themselves thats evident  there ought to be more boats and no tents i wonder where the prisoners are  there are traces of them and dr alec pointed to the heads and tails of fishes strewn on the grass  and there are more said rose laughing as she pointed to a scarlet heap of what looked like lobsters  the savages are probably eating their victims now dont you hear the knives rattle in that tent  we ought to creep up and peep crusoe was cautious you know and friday scared out of his wits added rose still keeping up the joke  but this crusoe is going to pounce upon them regardless of consequences if i am killed and eaten you seize the basket and run for the boat there are provisions enough for your voyage home  with that uncle alec slipped round to the front of the tent and casting in the big bundle like a bombshell roared out in a voice of thunder  pirates surrender  a crash a shout a laugh and out came the savages brandishing knives and forks chicken bones and tin mugs and all fell upon the intruder pommelling him unmercifully as they cried  you came too soon we are not half ready youve spoilt it all where is rose  here i am answered a halfstifled voice and rose was discovered sitting on the pile of red flannel bathing clothes which she had mistaken for lobsters and where she had fallen in a fit of merriment when she discovered that the cannibals were her merry cousins  you goodfornothing boys you are always bursting out upon me in some ridiculous way and i always get taken in because im not used to such pranks uncle is as bad as the rest and its great fun she said as the lads came round her half scolding half welcoming and wholly enjoying the double surprise  you were not to come till afternoon and mamma was to be here to receive you everything is in a mess now except your tent we got that in order the first thing and you can sit there and see us work said archie doing the honours as usual  rose felt it in her bones as dolly says that something was in the wind and wanted to be off at once so i let her come and should have kept her away an hour longer if your fish had not betrayed you explained uncle alec subsiding from a ferocious crusoe into his goodnatured self again  as this seat is rather damp i think ill rise said rose as the excitement lessened a little  several fishy hands helped her up and charlie said as he scattered the scarlet garments over the grass with an oar  we had a jolly good swim before dinner and i told the brats to spread these to dry hope you brought your things rose for you belong to the lobsters you know and we can have no end of fun teaching you to dive and float and tread water  i didnt bring anything began rose but was interrupted by the brats otherwise will and geordie who appeared bearing the big bundle so much demoralised by its fall that a red flannel tunic trailed out at one end and a little blue dressinggown at the other while the knobs proved to be a toiletcase rubbers and a silver mug  oh that sly phebe this was the secret and she bundled up those things after i went down to the boat cried rose with sparkling eyes  guess something is smashed inside for a bit of glass fell out observed will as they deposited the bundle at her feet  catch a girl going anywhere without a lookingglass we havent got one among the whole lot of us added mac with masculine scorn  dandy has i caught him touching up his wig behind the trees after our swim cut in geordie wagging a derisive finger at steve who promptly silenced him by a smart rap on the head with the drumstick he had just polished off  come come you lazy lubbers fall to work or we shall not be ready for mamma take roses things to her tent and tell her all about it prince mac and steve you cut away and bring up the rest of the straw and you small chaps clear off the table if you have stuffed all you can please uncle id like your advice about the boundary lines and the best place for the kitchen  everyone obeyed the chief and rose was escorted to her tent by charlie who devoted himself to her service she was charmed with her quarters and still more so with the programme which he unfolded before her as they worked  we always camp out somewhere in vacation and this year we thought wed try the island it is handy and our fireworks will show off well from here  shall we stay over the fourth three whole days oh me what a frolic it will be  bless your heart we often camp for a week we big fellows but this year the small chaps wanted to come so we let them we have great larks as youll see for we have a cave and play captain kidd and have shipwrecks and races and all sorts of games arch and i are rather past that kind of thing now but we do it to please the children added charlie with a sudden recollection of his sixteen years  i had no idea boys had such good times their plays never seemed a bit interesting before but i suppose that was because i never knew any boys very well or perhaps you are unusually nice ones observed rose with an artless air of appreciation that was very flattering  we are a pretty clever set i fancy but we have a good many advantages you see there are a tribe of us to begin with then our family has been here for ages and we have plenty of spondulics so we can rather lord it over the other fellows and do as we like there maam you can hang your smashed glass on that nail and do up your back hair as fine as you please you can have a blue blanket or a red one and a straw pillow or an air cushion for your head whichever you like you can trim up to any extent and be as free and easy as squaws in a wigwam for this corner is set apart for you ladies and we never cross the line uncle is drawing until we ask leave anything more i can do for you cousin  no thank you i think ill leave the rest till auntie comes and go and help you somewhere else if i may  yes indeed come on and see to the kitchen can you cook asked charlie as he led the way to the rocky nook where archie was putting up a sailcloth awning  i can make tea and toast bread  well well shew you how to fry fish and make chowder now you just set these pots and pans round tastefully and sort of tidy up a bit for aunt jessie insists on doing some of the work and i want it to be decent here  by four oclock the camp was in order and the weary workers settled down on lookout rock to watch for mrs jessie and jamie who was never far from mammas apron string they looked like a flock of bluebirds all being in sailor rig with blue ribbon enough flying from the seven hats to have set up a milliner very tuneful bluebirds they were too for all the lads sang and the echo of their happy voices reached mrs jessie long before she saw them  the moment the boat hove in sight up went the island flag and the bluejackets cheered lustily as they did on every possible occasion like true young americans this welcome was answered by the flapping of a handkerchief and the shrill rah rah rah of the one small tar who stood in the stern waving his hat manfully while a maternal hand clutched him firmly in the rear  cleopatra landing from her golden galley never received a heartier greeting than little mum as she was borne to her tent by the young folk for love of whom she smilingly resigned herself to three days of discomfort while jamie immediately attached himself to rose assuring her of his protection from the manifold perils which might assail them  taught by long experience that boys are always hungry aunt jessie soon proposed supper and proceeded to get it enveloped in an immense apron with an old hat of archies stuck atop of her cap rose helped and tried to be as handy as phebe though the peculiar style of table she had to set made it no easy task it was accomplished at last and a very happy party lay about under the trees eating and drinking out of anyones plate and cup and quite untroubled by the frequent appearance of ants and spiders in places which these interesting insects are not expected to adorn  i never thought i should like to wash dishes but i do said rose as she sat in a boat after supper lazily rinsing plates in the sea and rocking luxuriously as she wiped them  mum is mighty particular we just give em a scrub with sand and dust em off with a bit of paper its much the best way i think replied geordie who reposed in another boat alongside  how phebe would like this i wonder uncle did not have her come  i believe he tried to but dolly was as cross as two sticks and said she couldnt spare her im sorry for we all like the phebe bird and shed chirp like a good one out here wouldnt she  she ought to have a holiday like the rest of us its too bad to leave her out  this thought came back to rose several times that evening for phebe would have added much to the little concert they had in the moonlight would have enjoyed the stories told been quick at guessing the conundrums and laughed with all her heart at the fun the merry going to bed would have been the best of all for rose wanted someone to cuddle under the blue blanket with her there to whisper and giggle and tell secrets as girls delight to do  long after the rest were asleep rose lay wide awake excited by the novelty of all about her and a thought that had come into her mind far away she heard a city clock strike twelve a large star like a mild eye peeped in at the opening of the tent and the soft plash of the waves seemed calling her to come out aunt jessie lay fast asleep with jamie rolled up like a kitten at her feet and neither stirred as rose in her wrapper crept out to see how the world looked at midnight  she found it very lovely and sat down on a cracker keg to enjoy it with a heart full of the innocent sentiment of her years fortunately dr alec saw her before she had time to catch cold for coming out to tie back the doorflap of his tent for more air he beheld the small figure perched in the moonlight having no fear of ghosts he quietly approached and seeing that she was wide awake said with a hand on her shining hair  what is my girl doing here  having a good time answered rose not at all startled  i wonder what she was thinking about with such a sober look  the story you told of the brave sailor who gave up his place on the raft to the woman and the last drop of water to the poor baby people who make sacrifices are very much loved and admired arent they she asked earnestly  if the sacrifice is a true one but many of the bravest never are known and get no praise that does not lessen their beauty though perhaps it makes them harder for we all like sympathy and dr alec sighed a patient sort of sigh  i suppose you have made a great many would you mind telling me one of them asked rose arrested by the sigh  my last was to give up smoking was the very unromantic answer to her pensive question  why did you  bad example for the boys  that was very good of you uncle was it hard  im ashamed to say it was but as a wise old fellow once said it is necessary to do right it is not necessary to be happy  rose pondered over the saying as if it pleased her and then said with a clear bright look  a real sacrifice is giving up something you want or enjoy very much isnt it  yes  doing it ones own self because one loves another person very much and wants her to be happy  yes  and doing it pleasantly and being glad about it and not minding the praise if it doesnt come  yes dear that is the true spirit of selfsacrifice you seem to understand it and i dare say you will have many chances in your life to try the real thing i hope they wont be very hard ones  i think they will began rose and there stopped short  well make one now and go to sleep or my girl will be ill tomorrow and then the aunts will say camping out was bad for her  ill go good night and throwing him a kiss the little ghost vanished leaving uncle alec to pace the shore and think about some of the unsuspected sacrifices that had made him what he was    chapter 10roses sacrifice  there certainly were larks on campbells island next day as charlie had foretold and rose took her part in them like one intent on enjoying every minute to the utmost there was a merry breakfast a successful fishing expedition and then the lobsters came out in full force for even aunt jessie appeared in red flannel there was nothing uncle alec could not do in the water and the boys tried their best to equal him in strength and skill so there was a great diving and ducking for every one was bent on distinguishing himself  rose swam out far beyond her depth with uncle to float her back aunt jessie splashed placidly in the shallow pools with jamie paddling near by like a little whale beside its mother while the lads careered about looking like a flock of distracted flamingoes and acting like the famous dancing party in alices adventures in wonderland  nothing but chowder would have lured them from their gambols in the briny deep that timehonoured dish demanded the concentrated action of several mighty minds so the water babies came ashore and fell to cooking  it is unnecessary to say that when done it was the most remarkable chowder ever cooked and the quantity eaten would have amazed the world if the secret had been divulged after this exertion a siesta was considered the thing and people lay about in tents or out as they pleased the boys looking like warriors slumbering where they fell  the elders had just settled to a comfortable nap when the youngsters rose refreshed and ready for further exploits a hint sent them all off to the cave and there were discovered bows and arrows battle clubs old swords and various relics of an interesting nature perched upon a commanding rock with jamie to splain things to her rose beheld a series of stirring scenes enacted with great vigour and historical accuracy by her gifted relatives  captain cook was murdered by the natives of owhyhee in the most thrilling manner captain kidd buried untold wealth in the chowder kettle at the dead of night and shot both the trusting villains who shared the secret of the hiding place sinbad came ashore there and had manifold adventures and numberless wrecks bestrewed the sands  rose considered them by far the most exciting dramas she had ever witnessed and when the performance closed with a grand ballet of feejee islanders whose barbaric yells alarmed the gulls she had no words in which to express her gratification  another swim at sunset another merry evening on the rocks watching the lighted steamers pass seaward and the pleasureboats come into port ended the second day of the camping out and sent everyone to bed early that they might be ready for the festivities of the morrow  archie didnt i hear uncle ask you to row home in the morning for fresh milk and things  yes why  please may i go too i have something of great importance to arrange you know i was carried off in a hurry rose said in a confidential whisper as she was bidding her cousins good night  im willing and i guess charlie wont mind  thank you be sure you stand by me when i ask leave in the morning and dont say anything till then except to charlie promise urged rose so eagerly that archie struck an attitude and cried dramatically  by yonder moon i swear  hush its all right go along and rose departed as if satisfied  shes a queer little thing isnt she prince  rather a nice little thing i think im quite fond of her  roses quick ears caught both remarks and she retired to her tent saying to herself with sleepy dignity  little thing indeed those boys talk as if i was a baby they will treat me with more respect after tomorrow i guess  archie did stand by her in the morning and her request was readily granted as the lads were coming directly back off they went and rose waved her hand to the islanders with a somewhat pensive air for an heroic purpose glowed within her and the spirit of selfsacrifice was about to be illustrated in a new and touching manner  while the boys got the milk rose ran to phebe ordered her to leave her dishes to put on her hat and take a note back to uncle alec which would explain this somewhat mysterious performance phebe obeyed and when she went to the boat rose accompanied her telling the boys she was not ready to go yet but they could some of them come for her when she hung a white signal on her balcony  but why not come now what are you about miss uncle wont like it protested charlie in great amazement  just do as i tell you little boy uncle will understand and explain obey as phebe does and ask no questions i can have secrets as well as other people and rose walked off with an air of lofty independence that impressed her friends immensely  its some plot between uncle and herself so we wont meddle all right phebe pull away prince and off they went to be received with much surprise by the islanders  this was the note phebe bore  dear uncle i am going to take phebes place today and let her have all the fun she can please dont mind what she says but keep her and tell the boys to be very good to her for my sake dont think it is easy to do this it is very hard to give up the best day of all but i feel so selfish to have all the pleasure and phebe none that i wish to make this sacrifice do let me and dont laugh at it i truly do not wish to be praised and i truly want to do it love to all from  rose  bless the little dear what a generous heart she has shall we go after her jessie or let her have her way said dr alec after the first mingled amusement and astonishment had subsided  let her alone and dont spoil her little sacrifice she means it i know and the best way in which we can show our respect for her effort is to give phebe a pleasant day im sure she has earned it and mrs jessie made a sign to the boys to suppress their disappointment and exert themselves to please roses guest  phebe was with difficulty kept from going straight home and declared that she should not enjoy herself one bit without miss rose  she wont hold out all day and we shall see her paddling back before noon ill wager anything said charlie and the rest so strongly inclined to his opinion that they resigned themselves to the loss of the little queen of the revels sure that it would be only a temporary one  but hour after hour passed and no signal appeared on the balcony though phebe watched it hopefully no passing boat brought the truant back though more than one pair of eyes looked out for the bright hair under the round hat and sunset came bringing no rose but the lovely colour in the western sky  i really did not think the child had it in her i fancied it was a bit of sentiment but i see she was in earnest and means that her sacrifice shall be a true one dear little soul ill make it up to her a thousand times over and beg her pardon for thinking it might be done for effect dr alec said remorsefully as he strained his eyes through the dusk fancying he saw a small figure sitting in the garden as it had sat on the keg the night before laying the generous little plot that had cost more than he could guess  well she cant help seeing the fireworks any way unless she is goose enough to think she must hide in a dark closet and not look said archie who was rather disgusted at roses seeming ingratitude  she will see ours capitally but miss the big ones on the hill unless papa has forgotten all about them added steve cutting short the harangue mac had begun upon the festivals of the ancients  im sure the sight of her will be better than the finest fireworks that ever went off said phebe meditating an elopement with one of the boats if she could get a chance  let things work if she resists a brilliant invitation we give her she will be a heroine added uncle alec secretly hoping that she would not  meanwhile rose had spent a quiet busy day helping dolly waiting on aunt peace and steadily resisting aunt plentys attempts to send her back to the happy island it had been hard in the morning to come in from the bright world outside with flags flying cannon booming crackers popping and everyone making ready for a holiday and go to washing cups while dolly grumbled and the aunts lamented it was very hard to see the day go by knowing how gay each hour must have been across the water and how a word from her would take her where she longed to be with all her heart but it was hardest of all when evening came and aunt peace was asleep aunt plenty seeing a gossip in the parlor dolly established in the porch to enjoy the show and nothing left for the little maid to do but sit alone in her balcony and watch the gay rockets whizz up from island hill and city while bands played and boats laden with happy people went to and fro in the fitful light  then it must be confessed that a tear or two dimmed the blue eyes and once when a very brilliant display illuminated the island for a moment and she fancied she saw the tents the curly head went down on the railing and a wideawake nasturtium heard a little whisper  i hope someone wishes i was there  the tears were all gone however and she was watching the hill and island answer each other with what jamie called whizzers whirligigs and busters and smiling as she thought how hard the boys must be working to keep up such a steady fire when uncle mac came walking in upon her saying hurriedly  come child put on your tippet pelisse or whatever you call it and run off with me i came to get phebe but aunt says she is gone so i want you ive got fun down in the boat and i want you to go with us and see my fireworks got them up for you and you mustnt miss them or i shall be disappointed  but uncle began rose feeling as if she ought to refuse even a glimpse of bliss perhaps  i know my dear i know aunt told me but no one needs you now so much as i do and i insist on your coming said uncle mac who seemed in a great hurry to be off yet was unusually kind  so rose went and found the little chinaman with a funny lantern waiting to help her in and convulse her with laughter trying to express his emotions in pigeon english the city clocks were striking nine as they got out into the bay and the island fireworks seemed to be over for no rocket answered the last roman candle that shone on the aunthill  ours are done i see but they are going up all round the city and how pretty they are said rose folding her mantle about her and surveying the scene with pensive interest  hope my fellows have not got into trouble up there muttered uncle mac adding with a satisfied chuckle as a spark shone out no there it goes look rosy and see how you like this one it was ordered especially in honour of your coming  rose looked with all her eyes and saw the spark grow into the likeness of a golden vase then green leaves came out and then a crimson flower glowing on the darkness with a splendid lustre  is it a rose uncle she asked clasping her hands with delight as she recognised the handsome flower  of course it is look again and guess what those are answered uncle mac chuckling and enjoying it all like a boy  a wreath of what looked at first like purple brooms appeared below the vase but rose guessed what they were meant for and stood straight up holding by his shoulder and crying excitedly  thistles uncle scotch thistles there are seven of them one for each boy oh what a joke and she laughed so that she plumped into the bottom of the boat and stayed there till the brilliant spectacle was quite gone  that was rather a neat thing i flatter myself said uncle mac in high glee at the success of his illumination now shall i leave you on the island or take you home again my good little girl he added lifting her up with such a tone of approbation in his voice that rose kissed him on the spot  home please uncle and i thank you very very much for the beautiful firework you got up for me im so glad i saw it and i know i shall dream about it answered rose steadily though a wistful glance went toward the island now so near that she could smell powder and see shadowy figures flitting about  home they went and rose fell asleep saying to herself it was harder than i thought but im glad i did it and i truly dont want any reward but phebes pleasure    chapter 11poor mac  roses sacrifice was a failure in one respect for though the elders loved her the better for it and showed that they did the boys were not inspired with the sudden respect which she had hoped for in fact her feelings were much hurt by overhearing archie say that he couldnt see any sense in it and the prince added another blow by pronouncing her the queerest chicken ever seen  it is apt to be so and it is hard to bear for though we do not want trumpets blown we do like to have our little virtues appreciated and cannot help feeling disappointed if they are not  a time soon came however when rose quite unconsciously won not only the respect of her cousins but their gratitude and affection likewise  soon after the island episode mac had a sunstroke and was very ill for some time it was so sudden that everyone was startled and for some days the boys life was in danger he pulled through however and then just as the family were rejoicing a new trouble appeared which cast a gloom over them all  poor macs eyes gave out and well they might for he had abused them and never being very strong they suffered doubly now  no one dared to tell him the dark predictions of the great oculist who came to look at them and the boy tried to be patient thinking that a few weeks of rest would repair the overwork of several years  he was forbidden to look at a book and as that was the one thing he most delighted in it was a terrible affliction to the worm everyone was very ready to read to him and at first the lads contended for this honour but as week after week went by and mac was still condemned to idleness and a darkened room their zeal abated and one after the other fell off it was hard for the active fellows right in the midst of their vacation and nobody blamed them when they contented themselves with brief calls running of errands and warm expressions of sympathy  the elders did their best but uncle mac was a busy man aunt janes reading was of a funereal sort impossible to listen to long and the other aunties were all absorbed in their own cares though they supplied the boy with every delicacy they could invent  uncle alec was a host in himself but he could not give all his time to the invalid and if it had not been for rose the afflicted worm would have fared ill her pleasant voice suited him her patience was unfailing her time of no apparent value and her eager goodwill was very comforting  the womanly power of selfdevotion was strong in the child and she remained faithfully at her post when all the rest dropped away hour after hour she sat in the dusky room with one ray of light on her book reading to the boy who lay with shaded eyes silently enjoying the only pleasure that lightened the weary days sometimes he was peevish and hard to please sometimes he growled because his reader could not manage the dry books he wished to hear and sometimes he was so despondent that her heart ached to see him through all these trials rose persevered using all her little arts to please him when he fretted she was patient when he growled she ploughed bravely through the hard pages not dry to her in one sense for quiet tears dropped on them now and then and when mac fell into a despairing mood she comforted him with every hopeful word she dared to offer  he said little but she knew he was grateful for she suited him better than anyone else if she was late he was impatient when she had to go he seemed forlorn and when the tired head ached worst she could always soothe him to sleep crooning the old songs her father used to love  i dont know what i should do without that child aunt jane often said  shes worth all those racketing fellows put together mac would add fumbling about to discover if the little chair was ready for her coming  that was the sort of reward rose liked the thanks that cheered her and whenever she grew very tired one look at the green shade the curly head so restless on the pillow and the poor groping hands touched her tender heart and put new spirit into the weary voice  she did not know how much she was learning both from the books she read and the daily sacrifices she made stories and poetry were her delight but mac did not care for them and since his favourite greeks and romans were forbidden he satisfied himself with travels biographies and the history of great inventions or discoveries rose despised this taste at first but soon got interested in livingstones adventures hobsons stirring life in india and the brave trials and triumphs of watt and arkwright fulton and palissy the potter the true strong books helped the dreamy girl her faithful service and sweet patience touched and won the boy and long afterward both learned to see how useful those seemingly hard and weary hours had been to them  one bright morning as rose sat down to begin a fat volume entitled history of the french revolution expecting to come to great grief over the long names mac who was lumbering about the room like a blind bear stopped her by asking abruptly  what day of the month is it  the seventh of august i believe  more than half my vacation gone and ive only had a week of it i call that hard and he groaned dismally  so it is but there is more to come and you may be able to enjoy that  may be able i will be able does that old noodle think im going to stay stived up here much longer  i guess he does unless your eyes get on faster than they have yet  has he said anything more lately  i havent seen him you know shall i begin this looks rather nice  read away its all one to me and mac cast himself down upon the old lounge where his heavy head felt easiest  rose began with great spirit and kept on gallantly for a couple of chapters getting over the unpronounceable names with unexpected success she thought for her listener did not correct her once and lay so still she fancied he was deeply interested all of a sudden she was arrested in the middle of a fine paragraph by mac who sat bolt upright brought both feet down with a thump and said in a rough excited tone  stop i dont hear a word and you may as well save your breath to answer my question  what is it asked rose looking uneasy for she had something on her mind and feared that he suspected what it was his next words proved that she was right  now look here i want to know something and youve got to tell me  please dont began rose beseechingly  you must or ill pull off this shade and stare at the sun as hard as ever i can stare come now and he half rose as if ready to execute the threat  i will oh i will tell if i know but dont be reckless and do anything so crazy as that cried rose in great distress  very well then listen and dont dodge as everyone else does didnt the doctor think my eyes worse the last time he came mother wont say but you shall  i believe he did faltered rose  i thought so did he say i should be able to go to school when it begins  no mac very low  ah  that was all but rose saw her cousin set his lips together and take a long breath as if she had hit him hard he bore the disappointment bravely however and asked quite steadily in a minute  how soon does he think i can study again  it was so hard to answer that yet rose knew she must for aunt jane had declared she could not do it and uncle mac had begged her to break the truth to the poor lad  not for a good many months  how many he asked with a pathetic sort of gruffness  a year perhaps  a whole year why i expected to be ready for college by that time and pushing up the shade mac stared at her with startled eyes that soon blinked and fell before the one ray of light  plenty of time for that you must be patient now and get them thoroughly well or they will trouble you again when it will be harder to spare them she said with tears in her own eyes  i wont do it i will study and get through somehow its all humbug about taking care so long these doctors like to keep hold of a fellow if they can but i wont stand it i vow i wont and he banged his fist down on the unoffending pillow as if he were pommelling the hardhearted doctor  now mac listen to me rose said very earnestly though her voice shook a little and her heart ached you know you have hurt your eyes reading by firelight and in the dusk and sitting up late and now youll have to pay for it the doctor said so you must be careful and do as he tells you or you will be blind  no  yes it is true and he wanted us to tell you that nothing but entire rest would cure you i know its dreadfully hard but well all help you ill read all day long and lead you and wait upon you and try to make it easier  she stopped there for it was evident that he did not hear a sound the word blind seemed to have knocked him down for he had buried his face in the pillow and lay so still that rose was frightened she sat motionless for many minutes longing to comfort him but not knowing how and wishing uncle alec would come for he had promised to tell mac  presently a sort of choking sound came out of the pillow and went straight to her heart the most pathetic sob she ever heard for though it was the most natural means of relief the poor fellow must not indulge in it because of the afflicted eyes the french revolution tumbled out of her lap and running to the sofa she knelt down by it saying with the motherly sort of tenderness girls feel for any sorrowing creature  oh my dear you mustnt cry it is so bad for your poor eyes take your head out of that hot pillow and let me cool it i dont wonder you feel so but please dont cry ill cry for you it wont hurt me  as she spoke she pulled away the cushion with gentle force and saw the green shade all crushed and stained with the few hot tears that told how bitter the disappointment had been mac felt her sympathy but being a boy did not thank her for it only sat up with a jerk saying as he tried to rub away the telltale drops with the sleeve of his jacket dont bother weak eyes always water im all right  but rose cried out and caught his arm dont touch them with that rough woollen stuff lie down and let me bathe them theres a dear boy then there will be no harm done  they do smart confoundedly i say dont you tell the other fellows that i made a baby of myself will you he added yielding with a sigh to the orders of his nurse who had flown for the eyewash and linen cambric handkerchief  of course i wont but anyone would be upset at the idea of being well troubled in this way im sure you bear it splendidly and you know it isnt half so bad when you get used to it besides it is only for a time and you can do lots of pleasant things if you cant study youll have to wear blue goggles perhaps wont that be funny  and while she was pouring out all the comfortable words she could think of rose was softly bathing the eyes and dabbing the hot forehead with lavenderwater as her patient lay quiet with a look on his face that grieved her sadly  homer was blind and so was milton and they did something to be remembered by in spite of it he said as if to himself in a solemn tone for even the blue goggles did not bring a smile  papa had a picture of milton and his daughters writing for him it was a very sweet picture i thought observed rose in a serious voice trying to meet the sufferer on his own ground  perhaps i could study if someone read and did the eye part do you suppose i could by and by he asked with a sudden ray of hope  i dare say if your head is strong enough this sunstroke you know is what upset you and your brain needs rest the doctor says  ill have a talk with the old fellow next time he comes and find out just what i may do then i shall know where i am what a fool i was that day to be stewing my brains and letting the sun glare on my book till the letters danced before me i see em now when i shut my eyes black balls bobbing round and stars and all sorts of queer things wonder if all blind people do  dont think about them ill go on reading shall i we shall come to the exciting part soon and then youll forget all this suggested rose  no i never shall forget hang the old revolution i dont want to hear another word of it my head aches and im hot oh wouldnt i like to go for a pull in the stormy petrel and poor mac tossed about as if he did not know what to do with himself  let me sing and perhaps youll drop off then the day will seem shorter said rose taking up a fan and sitting down beside him  perhaps i shall i didnt sleep much last night and when i did i dreamed like fun see here you tell the people that i know and its all right and i dont want them to talk about it or howl over me thats all now drone away and ill try to sleep wish i could for a year and wake up cured  oh i wish i wish you could  rose said it so fervently that mac was moved to grope for her apron and hold on to a corner of it as if it was comfortable to feel her near him but all he said was  you are a good little soul rosy give us the birks that is a drowsy one that always sends me off  quite contented with this small return for all her sympathy rose waved her fan and sang in a dreamy tone the pretty scotch air the burden of which is      bonny lassie will ye gang will ye gang      to the birks of aberfeldie  whether the lassie went or not i cannot say but the laddie was off to the land of nod in about ten minutes quite worn out with hearing the bad tidings and the effort to bear them manfully    chapter 12the other fellows  rose did tell the people what had passed and no one howled over mac or said a word to trouble him he had his talk with the doctor and got very little comfort out of it for he found that just what he might do was nothing at all though the prospect of some study by and by if all went well gave him courage to bear the woes of the present having made up his mind to this he behaved so well that everyone was astonished never having suspected so much manliness in the quiet worm  the boys were much impressed both by the greatness of the affliction which hung over him and by his way of bearing it they were very good to him but not always particularly wise in their attempts to cheer and amuse and rose often found him much downcast after a visit of condolence from the clan she still kept her place as headnurse and chiefreader though the boys did their best in an irregular sort of way they were rather taken aback sometimes at finding roses services preferred to theirs and privately confided to one another that old mac was getting fond of being mollycoddled but they could not help seeing how useful she was and owning that she alone had remained faithful a fact which caused some of them much secret compunction now and then  rose felt that she ruled in that room if nowhere else for aunt jane left a great deal to her finding that her experience with her invalid father fitted her for a nurse and in a case like this her youth was an advantage rather than a drawback mac soon came to think that no one could take care of him so well as rose and rose soon grew fond of her patient though at first she had considered this cousin the least attractive of the seven he was not polite and sensible like archie nor gay and handsome like prince charlie nor neat and obliging like steve nor amusing like the brats nor confiding and affectionate like little jamie he was rough absentminded careless and awkward rather priggish and not at all agreeable to a dainty beautyloving girl like rose  but when his trouble came upon him she discovered many good things in this cousin of hers and learned not only to pity but to respect and love the poor worm who tried to be patient brave and cheerful and found it a harder task than anyone guessed except the little nurse who saw him in his gloomiest moods she soon came to think that his friends did not appreciate him and upon one occasion was moved to free her mind in a way that made a deep impression on the boys  vacation was almost over and the time drawing near when mac would be left outside the happy schoolworld which he so much enjoyed this made him rather low in his mind and his cousins exerted themselves to cheer him up especially one afternoon when a spasm of devotion seemed to seize them all jamie trudged down the hill with a basket of blackberries which he had picked all his ownself as his scratched fingers and stained lips plainly testified will and geordie brought their puppies to beguile the weary hours and the three elder lads called to discuss baseball cricket and kindred subjects eminently fitted to remind the invalid of his privations  rose had gone to drive with uncle alec who declared she was getting as pale as a potato sprout living so much in a dark room but her thoughts were with her boy all the while and she ran up to him the moment she returned to find things in a fine state of confusion  with the best intentions in life the lads had done more harm than good and the spectacle that met nurse roses eye was a trying one the puppies were yelping the small boys romping and the big boys all talking at once the curtains were up the room close berries scattered freely about macs shade half off his cheeks flushed his temper ruffled and his voice loudest of all as he disputed hotly with steve about lending certain treasured books which he could no longer use  now rose considered this her special kingdom and came down upon the invaders with an energy which amazed them and quelled the riot at once they had never seen her roused before and the effect was tremendous also comical for she drove the whole flock of boys out of the room like an indignant little hen defending her brood they all went as meekly as sheep the small lads fled from the house precipitately but the three elder ones only retired to the next room and remained there hoping for a chance to explain and apologise and so appease the irate young lady who had suddenly turned the tables and clattered them about their ears  as they waited they observed her proceedings through the halfopen door and commented upon them briefly but expressively feeling quite bowed down with remorse at the harm they had innocently done  shes put the room to rights in a jiffey what jacks we were to let those dogs in and kick up such a row observed steve after a prolonged peep  the poor old worm turns as if she was treading on him instead of cuddling him like a pussy cat isnt he cross though added charlie as mac was heard growling about his confounded head  she will manage him but its mean in us to rumple him up and then leave her to smooth him down id go and help but i dont know how said archie looking much depressed for he was a conscientious fellow and blamed himself for his want of thought  no more do i odd isnt it what a knack women have for taking care of sick folks and charlie fell amusing over this undeniable fact  she has been ever so good to mac began steve in a selfreproachful tone  better than his own brother hey cut in archie finding relief for his own regret in the delinquencies of another  well you neednt preach you didnt any of you do any more and you might have for mac likes you better than he does me i always fret him he says and it isnt my fault if i am a quiddle protested steve in selfdefence  we have all been selfish and neglected him so we wont fight about it but try and do better said archie generously taking more than his share of blame for he had been less inattentive than either of the others  rose has stood by him like a good one and its no wonder he likes to have her round best i should myself if i was down on my luck as he is put in charlie feeling that he really had not done the little thing justice  ill tell you what it is boys we havent been half good enough to rose and weve got to make it up to her somehow said archie who had a very manly sense of honour about paying his debts even to a girl  im awfully sorry i made fun of her doll when jamie lugged it out and i called her baby bunting when she cried over the dead kitten girls are such geese sometimes i cant help it said steve confessing his transgressions handsomely and feeling quite ready to atone for them if he only knew how  ill go down on my knees and beg her pardon for treating her as if she was a child dont it make her mad though come to think of it shes only two years or so younger than i am but she is so small and pretty she always seems like a dolly to me and the prince looked down from his lofty height of five feet five as if rose was indeed a pygmy beside him  that dolly has got a real good little heart and a bright mind of her own youd better believe mac says she understands some things quicker than he can and mother thinks she is an uncommonly nice girl though she dont know all creation you neednt put on airs charlie though you are a tall one for rose likes archie better than you she said she did because he treated her respectfully  steve looks as fierce as a gamecock but dont you get excited my son for it wont do a bit of good of course everybody likes the chief best they ought to and ill punch their heads if they dont so calm yourself dandy and mend your own manners before you come down on other peoples  thus the prince with great dignity and perfect good nature while archie looked modestly gratified with the flattering opinions of his kinsfolk and steve subsided feeling he had done his duty as a cousin and a brother a pause ensued during which aunt jane appeared in the other room accompanied by a teatray sumptuously spread and prepared to feed her big nestling as that was a task she allowed no one to share with her  if you have a minute to spare before you go child i wish youd just make mac a fresh shade this has got a berry stain on it and he must be tidy for he is to go out tomorrow if it is a cloudy day said mrs jane spreading toast in a stately manner while mac slopped his tea about without receiving a word of reproof  yes aunt answered rose so meekly that the boys could hardly believe it could be the same voice which had issued the stern command out of this room every one of you not very long ago  they had not time to retire without unseemly haste before she walked into the parlour and sat down at the worktable without a word it was funny to see the look the three tall lads cast at the little person sedately threading a needle with green silk they all wanted to say something expressive of repentance but no one knew how to begin and it was evident from the prim expression of roses face that she intended to stand upon her dignity till they had properly abased themselves the pause was becoming very awkward when charlie who possessed all the persuasive arts of a born scapegrace went slowly down upon his knees before her beat his breast and said in a heartbroken tone  please forgive me this time and ill never do so any more  it was very hard to keep sober but rose managed it and answered gravely  it is macs pardon you should ask not mine for you havent hurt me and i shouldnt wonder if you had him a great deal with all that light and racket and talk about things that only worry him  do you really think weve hurt him cousin asked archie with a troubled look while charlie settled down in a remorseful heap among the table legs  yes i do for he has got a raging headache and his eyes are as red as as this emery bag answered rose solemnly plunging her needle into a fat flannel strawberry  steve tore his hair metaphorically speaking for he clutched his cherished topknot and wildly dishevelled it as if that was the heaviest penance he could inflict upon himself at such short notice charlie laid himself out flat melodramatically begging someone to take him away and hang him but archie who felt worst of all said nothing except to vow within himself that he would read to mac till his own eyes were as red as a dozen emery bags combined  seeing the wholesome effects of her treatment upon these culprits rose felt that she might relent and allow them a gleam of hope she found it impossible to help trampling upon the prostrate prince a little in words at least for he had hurt her feelings oftener than he knew so she gave him a thimblepie on the top of his head and said with an air of an infinitely superior being  dont be silly but get up and ill tell you something much better to do than sprawling on the floor and getting all over lint  charlie obediently sat himself upon a hassock at her feet the other sinners drew near to catch the words of wisdom about to fall from her lips and rose softened by this gratifying humility addressed them in her most maternal tone  now boys if you really want to be good to mac you can do it in this way dont keep talking about things he cant do or go and tell what fun you have had batting your ridiculous balls about get some nice book and read quietly cheer him up about school and offer to help him study by and by you can do that better than i because im only a girl and dont learn greek and latin and all sorts of headachy stuff  yes but you can do heaps of things better than we can youve proved that said archie with an approving look that delighted rose though she could not resist giving charlie one more rebuke by saying with a little bridling of the head and a curl of the lip that wanted to smile instead  im glad you think so though i am a queer chicken  this scathing remark caused the prince to hide his face for shame and steve to erect his head in the proud consciousness that this shot was not meant for him archie laughed and rose seeing a merry blue eye winking at her from behind two brown hands gave charlies ear a friendly tweak and extended the olivebranch of peace  now well all be good and plan nice things for poor mac she said smiling so graciously that the boys felt as if the sun had suddenly burst out from behind a heavy cloud and was shining with great brilliancy  the storm had cleared the air and quite a heavenly calm succeeded during which plans of a most varied and surprising sort were laid for everyone burned to make noble sacrifices upon the shrine of poor mac and rose was the guiding star to whom the others looked with most gratifying submission of course this elevated state of things could not endure long but it was very nice while it lasted and left an excellent effect upon the minds of all when the first ardour had subsided  there thats ready for tomorrow and i do hope it will be cloudy said rose as she finished off the new shade the progress of which the boys had watched with interest  id bespoken an extra sunny day but ill tell the clerk of the weather to change it hes an obliging fellow and hell attend to it so make yourself easy said charlie who had become quite perky again  it is very easy for you to joke but how would you like to wear a blinder like that for weeks and weeks sir and rose quenched his rising spirits by slipping the shade over his eyes as he still sat on the cushion at her feet  its horrid take it off take it off i dont wonder the poor old boy has the blues with a thing like that on and charlie sat looking at what seemed to him an instrument of torture with such a sober face that rose took it gently away and went in to bid mac goodnight  i shall go home with her for it is getting darkish and she is rather timid said archie forgetting that he had often laughed at this very timidity  i think i might for shes taking care of my brother put in steve asserting his rights  lets all go that will please her proposed charlie with a burst of gallantry which electrified his mates  we will they said with one voice and they did to roses great surprise and secret contentment though archie had all the care of her for the other two were leaping fences running races and having wrestling matches all the way down  they composed themselves on reaching the door however shook hands cordially all round made their best bows and retired with great elegance and dignity leaving rose to say to herself with girlish satisfaction as she went in  now that is the way i like to be treated    chapter 13cosey corner  vacation was over the boys went back to school and poor mac was left lamenting he was out of the darkened room now and promoted to blue goggles through which he took a gloomy view of life as might have been expected for there was nothing he could do but wander about and try to amuse himself without using his eyes anyone who has ever been condemned to that sort of idleness knows how irksome it is and can understand the state of mind which caused mac to say to rose in a desperate tone one day  look here if you dont invent some new employment or amusement for me i shall knock myself on the head as sure as you live  rose flew to uncle alec for advice and he ordered both patient and nurse to the mountains for a month with aunt jessie and jamie as escort pokey and her mother joined the party and one bright september morning six very happylooking people were aboard the express train for portland two smiling mammas laden with luncheon baskets and wraps a pretty young girl with a bag of books on her arm a tall thin lad with his hat over his eyes and two small children who sat with their short legs straight out before them and their chubby faces beaming with the first speechless delight of truly travelling  an especially splendid sunset seemed to have been prepared to welcome them when after a long days journey they drove into a wide green dooryard where a white colt a red cow two cats four kittens many hens and a dozen people old and young were gaily disporting themselves everyone nodded and smiled in the friendliest manner and a lively old lady kissed the newcomers all round as she said heartily  well now im proper glad to see you come right in and rest and well have tea in less than no time for you must be tired lizzie you show the folks upstairs kitty you fly round and help father in with the trunks and jenny and i will have the table all ready by the time you come down bless the dears they want to go see the pussies and so they shall  the three pretty daughters did fly round and everyone felt at home at once all were so hospitable and kind aunt jessie had raptures over the homemade carpets quilts and quaint furniture rose could not keep away from the windows for each framed a lovely picture and the little folks made friends at once with the other children who filled their arms with chickens and kittens and did the honours handsomely  the toot of a horn called all to supper and a goodly party including six children besides the campbells assembled in the long diningroom armed with mountain appetites and the gayest spirits it was impossible for anyone to be shy or sober for such gales of merriment arose they blew the starch out of the stiffest and made the saddest jolly mother atkinson as all called their hostess was the merriest there and the busiest for she kept flying up to wait on the children to bring out some new dish or to banish the live stock who were of such a social turn that the colt came into the entry and demanded sugar the cats sat about in peoples laps winking suggestively at the food and speckled hens cleared the kitchen floor of crumbs as they joined in the chat with a cheerful clucking  everybody turned out after tea to watch the sunset till all the lovely red was gone and mosquitoes wound their shrill horns to sound the retreat the music of an organ surprised the newcomers and in the parlor they found father atkinson playing sweetly on the little instrument made by himself all the children gathered about him and led by the tuneful sisters sang prettily till pokey fell asleep behind the door and jamie gaped audibly right in the middle of his favourite      coo said the little doves coo said she     all in the top of the old pinetree  the older travellers being tired went to bye low at the same time and slept like tops in homespun sheets on husk mattresses made by mother atkinson who seemed to have put some soothing powder among them so deep and sweet was the slumber that came  next day began the wholesome outofdoor life which works such wonders with tired minds and feeble bodies the weather was perfect and the mountain air made the children as frisky as young lambs while the elders went about smiling at one another and saying isnt it splendid even mac the slow coach was seen to leap over a fence as if he really could not help it and when rose ran after him with his broadbrimmed hat he made the spirited proposal to go into the woods and hunt for a catamount  jamie and pokey were at once enrolled in the cosey corner light infantry a truly superb company composed entirely of officers all wearing cocked hats carrying flags waving swords or beating drums it was a spectacle to stir the dullest soul when this gallant band marched out of the yard in full regimentals with captain dove a solemn bigheaded boy of eleven issuing his orders with the gravity of a general and his falstaffian regiment obeying them with more docility than skill the little snow children did very well and lieutenant jack dove was fine to see so was drummer frank the errandboy of the house as he rubadubdubbed with all his heart and drumsticks jamie had trained before and was made a colonel at once but pokey was the best of all and called forth a spontaneous burst of applause from the spectators as she brought up the rear her cocked hat all over one eye her flag trailing over her shoulder and her wooden sword straight up in the air her face beaming and every curl bobbing with delight as her fat legs tottered in the vain attempt to keep step manfully  mac and rose were picking blackberries in the bushes beside the road when the soldiers passed without seeing them and they witnessed a sight that was both pretty and comical a little farther on was one of the family burial spots so common in those parts and just this side of it captain fred dove ordered his company to halt explaining his reason for so doing in the following words  thats a graveyard and its proper to muffle the drums and lower the flags as we go by and wed better take off our hats too its more respectable i think  isnt that cunning of the dears whispered rose as the little troop marched slowly by to the muffled roll of the drums every flag and sword held low all the little heads uncovered and the childish faces very sober as the leafy shadows flickered over them  lets follow and see what they are after proposed mac who found sitting on the wall and being fed with blackberries luxurious but tiresome  so they followed and heard the music grow lively saw the banners wave in the breeze again when the graveyard was passed and watched the company file into the dilapidated old church that stood at the corner of three woodland roads presently the sound of singing made the outsiders quicken their steps and stealing up they peeped in at one of the broken windows  captain dove was up in the old wooden pulpit gazing solemnly down upon his company who having stacked their arms in the porch now sat in the bare pews singing a sundayschool hymn with great vigour and relish  let us pray said captain dove with as much reverence as an army chaplain and folding his hands he repeated a prayer which he thought all would know an excellent little prayer but not exactly appropriate to the morning for it was      now i lay me down to sleep  everyone joined in saying it and it was a pretty sight to see the little creatures bowing their curly heads and lisping out the words they knew so well tears came into roses eyes as she looked mac took his hat off involuntarily and then clapped it on again as if ashamed of showing any feeling  now i shall preach you a short sermon and my text is little children love one another i asked mamma to give me one and she thought that would be good so you all sit still and ill preach it you mustnt whisper marion but hear me it means that we should be good to each other and play fair and not quarrel as we did this very day about the wagon jack cant always drive and neednt be mad because i like to go with frank annette ought to be horse sometimes and not always driver and willie may as well make up his mind to let marion build her house by his for she will do it and he neednt fuss about it jamie seems to be a good boy but i shall preach to him if he isnt no pokey people dont kiss in church or put their hats on now you must all remember what i tell you because i am the captain and you should mind me  here lieutenant jack spoke right out in meeting with the rebellious remark  dont care if you are youd better mind yourself and tell how you took away my strap and kept the biggest doughnut and didnt draw fair when we had the truck  yes and you slapped frank i saw you bawled willie snow bobbing up in his pew  and you took my book away and hid it cause i wouldnt go and swing when you wanted me to added annette the oldest of the snow trio  i shant build my house by willies if he dont want me to so now put in little marion joining the mutiny  i will tiss dimmy and i tored up my hat tause a pin picked me shouted pokey regardless of jamies efforts to restrain her  captain dove looked rather taken aback at this outbreak in the ranks but being a dignified and calm personage he quelled the rising rebellion with great tact and skill by saying briefly  well sing the last hymn sweet sweet goodby you all know that so do it nicely and then we will go and have luncheon  peace was instantly restored and a burst of melody drowned the suppressed giggles of rose and mac who found it impossible to keep sober during the latter part of this somewhat remarkable service fifteen minutes of repose rendered it a physical impossibility for the company to march out as quietly as they had marched in i grieve to state that the entire troop raced home as hard as they could pelt and were soon skirmishing briskly over their lunch utterly oblivious of what jamie who had been much impressed by the sermon called the captains beautiful teck  it was astonishing how much they all found to do at cosey corner and mac instead of lying in a hammock and being read to as he had expected was busiest of all he was invited to survey and lay out skeeterville a town which the children were getting up in a huckleberry pasture and he found much amusement in planning little roads staking off houselots attending to the waterworks and consulting with the selectmen about the best sites for public buildings for mac was a boy still in spite of his fifteen years and his love of books  then he went fishing with a certain jovial gentleman from the west and though they seldom caught anything but colds they had great fun and exercise chasing the phantom trout they were bound to have mac also developed a geological mania and went tapping about at rocks and stones discoursing wisely of strata periods and fossil remains while rose picked up leaves and lichens and gave him lessons in botany in return for his lectures on geology  they led a very merry life for the atkinson girls kept up a sort of perpetual picnic and did it so capitally that one was never tired of it so their visitors throve finely and long before the month was out it was evident that dr alec had prescribed the right medicine for his patients    chapter 14a happy birthday  the twelfth of october was roses birthday but no one seemed to remember that interesting fact and she felt delicate about mentioning it so fell asleep the night before wondering if she would have any presents that question was settled early the next morning for she was awakened by a soft tap on her face and opening her eyes she beheld a little black and white figure sitting on her pillow staring at her with a pair of round eyes very like blueberries while one downy paw patted her nose to attract her notice it was kitty comet the prettiest of all the pussies and comet evidently had a mission to perform for a pink bow adorned her neck and a bit of paper was pinned to it bearing the words for miss rose from frank  that pleased her extremely and that was only the beginning of the fun for surprises and presents kept popping out in the most delightful manner all through the day the atkinson girls being famous jokers and rose a favourite but the best gift of all came on the way to mount windytop where it was decided to picnic in honour of the great occasion three jolly loads set off soon after breakfast for everybody went and everybody seemed bound to have an extra good time especially mother atkinson who wore a hat as broadbrimmed as an umbrella and took the dinnerhorn to keep her flock from straying away  im going to drive auntie and a lot of the babies so you must ride the pony and please stay behind us a good bit when we go to the station for a parcel is coming and you are not to see it till dinnertime you wont mind will you said mac in a confidential aside during the wild flurry of the start  not a bit answered rose it hurts my feelings very much to be told to keep out of the way at any other time but birthdays and christmas it is part of the fun to be blind and stupid and poked into corners ill be ready as soon as you are giglamps  stop under the big maple till i call then you cant possibly see anything added mac as he mounted her on the pony his father had sent up for his use barkis was so gentle and so willin however that rose was ashamed to be afraid to ride him so she had learned that she might surprise dr alec when she got home meantime she had many a fine canter over the hills and far away with mac who preferred mr atkinsons old sorrel  away they went and coming to the red maple rose obediently paused but could not help stealing a glance in the forbidden direction before the call came yes there was a hamper going under the seat and then she caught sight of a tall man whom mac seemed to be hustling into the carriage in a great hurry one look was enough and with a cry of delight rose was off down the road as fast as barkis could go  now ill astonish uncle she thought ill dash up in grand style and show him that i am not a coward after all  fired by this ambition she startled barkis by a sharp cut and still more bewildered him by leaving him to his own guidance down the steep stony road the approach would have been a fine success if just as rose was about to pull up and salute two or three distracted hens had not scuttled across the road with a great squawking which caused barkis to shy and stop so suddenly that his careless rider landed in an ignominious heap just under old sorrels astonished nose  rose was up again before dr alec was out of the carryall and threw two dusty arms about his neck crying with a breathless voice  o uncle im so glad to see you it is better than a cartload of goodies and so dear of you to come  but arent you hurt child that was a rough tumble and im afraid you must be damaged somewhere answered the doctor full of fond anxiety as he surveyed his girl with pride  my feelings are hurt but my bones are all safe its too bad i was going to do it so nicely and those stupid hens spoilt it all said rose quite crestfallen as well as much shaken  i couldnt believe my eyes when i asked where is rose and mac pointed to the little amazon pelting down the hill at such a rate you couldnt have done anything that would please me more and im delighted to see how well you ride now will you mount again or shall we turn mac out and take you in asked dr alec as aunt jessie proposed a start for the others were beckoning them to follow  pride goeth before a fall better not try to show off again maam said mac who would have been more than mortal if he had refrained from teasing when so good a chance offered  pride does go before a fall but i wonder if a sprained ankle always comes after it thought rose bravely concealing her pain as she answered with great dignity  i prefer to ride come on and see who will catch up first  she was up and away as she spoke doing her best to efface the memory of her downfall by sitting very erect elbows down head well up and taking the motion of the pony as barkis cantered along as easily as a rockingchair  you ought to see her go over a fence and race when we ride together she can scud too like a deer when we play follow the leader and skip stones and bat balls almost as well as i can said mac in reply to his uncles praise of his pupil  im afraid you will think her a sad tomboy alec but really she seems so well and happy i have not the heart to check her she has broken out in the most unexpected way and frisks like a colt for she says she feels so full of spirits she must run and shout whether it is proper or not added mrs jessie who had been a pretty hoyden years ago herself  good good thats the best news you could tell me and dr alec rubbed his hands heartily let the girl run and shout as much as she will it is a sure sign of health and as natural to a happy child as frisking is to any young animal full of life tomboys make strong women usually and i had far rather find rose playing football with mac than puttering over beadwork like that affected midget ariadne blish  but she cannot go on playing football very long and we must not forget that she has a womans work to do by and by began mrs jessie  neither will mac play football much longer but he will be all the better fitted for business because of the health it gives him polish is easily added if the foundations are strong but no amount of gilding will be of use if your timber is not sound im sure im right jessie and if i can do as well by my girl during the next six months as i have the last my experiment will succeed  it certainly will for when i contrast that bright blooming face with the pale listless one that made my heart ache a while ago i can believe in almost any miracle said mrs jessie as rose looked round to point out a lovely view with cheeks like the ruddy apples in the orchard near by eyes clear as the autumn sky overhead and vigour in every line of her girlish figure  a general scramble among the rocks was followed by a regular gypsy lunch which the young folks had the rapture of helping to prepare mother atkinson put on her apron turned up her sleeves and fell to work as gaily as if in her own kitchen boiling the kettle slung on three sticks over a fire of cones and fir boughs while the girls spread the mossy table with a feast of country goodies and the children tumbled about in everyones way till the toot of the horn made them settle down like a flock of hungry birds  as soon as the merry meal and a brief interval of repose were over it was unanimously voted to have some charades a smooth green spot between two stately pines was chosen for the stage shawls hung up properties collected audience and actors separated and a word quickly chosen  the first scene discovered mac in a despondent attitude and shabby dress evidently much troubled in mind to him entered a remarkable creature with a brown paper bag over its head a little pink nose peeped through one hole in the middle white teeth through another and above two eyes glared fiercely spires of grass stuck in each side of the mouth seemed meant to represent whiskers the upper corners of the bag were twisted like ears and no one could doubt for a moment that the black scarf pinned on behind was a tail  this singular animal seemed in pantomime to be comforting his master and offering advice which was finally acted upon for mac pulled off his boots helped the little beast into them and gave him a bag then kissing his paw with a hopeful gesture the creature retired purring so successfully that there was a general cry of cat puss boots  cat is the word replied a voice and the curtain fell  the next scene was a puzzler for in came another animal on allfours this time with a new sort of tail and long ears a gray shawl concealed its face but an inquisitive sunbeam betrayed the glitter as of goggles under the fringe on its back rode a small gentleman in eastern costume who appeared to find some difficulty in keeping his seat as his steed jogged along suddenly a spirit appeared all in white with long newspaper wings upon its back and golden locks about its face singularly enough the beast beheld this apparition and backed instantly but the rider evidently saw nothing and whipped up unmercifully also unsuccessfully for the spirit stood directly in the path and the amiable beast would not budge a foot a lively skirmish followed which ended in the eastern gentleman being upset into a sweetfern bush while the better bred animal abased itself before the shining one  the children were all in the dark till mother atkinson said in an inquiring tone  if that isnt balaam and the ass id like to know what it is rose makes a sweet angel doesnt she  ass was evidently the word and the angel retired smiling with mundane satisfaction over the compliment that reached her ears  the next was a pretty little scene from the immortal story of babes in the wood jamie and pokey came trotting in hand in hand and having been through the parts many times before acted with great ease and much fluency audibly directing each other from time to time as they went along the berries were picked the way lost tears shed baby consolation administered and then the little pair lay down among the brakes and died with their eyes wide open and the toes of their four little boots turned up to the daisies in the most pathetic manner  now the wobins tum you be twite dead dimmy and ill peep in and see em one defunct innocent was heard to say  i hope theyll be quick for im lying on a stone and ants are walking up my leg like fury murmured the other  here the robins came flapping in with red scarves over their breasts and leaves in their mouths which they carefully laid upon the babes wherever they would show best a prickly blackberry leaf placed directly over pokeys nose caused her to sneeze so violently that her little legs flew into the air jamie gave a startled ow and the pitying fowls fled giggling  after some discussion it was decided that the syllable must be strew or strow and then they waited to see if it was a good guess  this scene discovered annette snow in bed evidently very ill miss jenny was her anxious mamma and her merry conversation amused the audience till mac came in as a physician and made great fun with his big watch pompous manner and absurd questions he prescribed one pellet with an unpronounceable name and left after demanding twenty dollars for his brief visit  the pellet was administered and such awful agonies immediately set in that the distracted mamma bade a sympathetic neighbour run for mother knowall the neighbour ran and in came a brisk little old lady in cap and specs with a bundle of herbs under her arm which she at once applied in all sorts of funny ways explaining their virtues as she clapped a plantain poultice here put a pounded catnip plaster there or tied a couple of mullein leaves round the sufferers throat instant relief ensued the dying child sat up and demanded baked beans the grateful parent offered fifty dollars but mother knowall indignantly refused it and went smiling away declaring that a neighbourly turn needed no reward and a doctors fee was all a humbug  the audience were in fits of laughter over this scene for rose imitated mrs atkinson capitally and the herb cure was a good hit at the excellent ladys belief that yarbs would save mankind if properly applied no one enjoyed it more than herself and the saucy children prepared for the grand finale in high feather  this closing scene was brief but striking for two trains of cars whizzed in from opposite sides met with a terrible collision in the middle of the stage and a general smashup completed the word catastrophe  now let us act a proverb ive got one all ready said rose who was dying to distinguish herself in some way before uncle alec  so everyone but mac the gay westerner and rose took their places on the rocky seats and discussed the late beautiful and varied charade in which pokey frankly pronounced her own scene the bestest of all  in five minutes the curtain was lifted nothing appeared but a very large sheet of brown paper pinned to a tree and on it was drawn a clockface the hands pointing to four a small note below informed the public that 4 am was the time hardly had the audience grasped this important fact when a long waterproof serpent was seen uncoiling itself from behind a stump an inchworm perhaps would be a better description for it travelled in the same humpy way as that pleasing reptile suddenly a very wideawake and active fowl advanced pecking chirping and scratching vigorously a tuft of green leaves waved upon his crest a larger tuft of brakes made an umbrageous tail and a shawl of many colours formed his flapping wings a truly noble bird whose legs had the genuine strut whose eyes shone watchfully and whose voice had a ring that evidently struck terror into the catterpillars soul if it was a catterpillar he squirmed he wriggled he humped as fast as he could trying to escape but all in vain the tufted bird espied him gave one warbling sort of crow pounced upon him and flapped triumphantly away  that early bird got such a big worm he could hardly carry him off laughed aunt jessie as the children shouted over the joke suggested by macs nickname  that is one of uncles favourite proverbs so i got it up for his especial benefit said rose coming up with the twolegged worm beside her  very clever what next asked dr alec as she sat down beside him  the dove boys are going to give us an incident in the life of napoleon as they call it the children think it very splendid and the little fellows do it rather nicely answered mac with condescension  a tent appeared and pacing to and fro before it was a little sentinel who in a brief soliloquy informed the observers that the elements were in a great state of confusion that he had marched some hundred miles or so that day and that he was dying for want of sleep then he paused leaned upon his gun and seemed to doze dropped slowly down overpowered with slumber and finally lay flat with his gun beside him a faithless little sentinel enter napoleon cocked hat gray coat high boots folded arms grim mouth and a melodramatic stride freddy dove always covered himself with glory in this part and took the stage with a napoleonic attitude that brought down the house for the bigheaded boy with solemn dark eyes and square brow was the very moral of that rascal boneyparty mother atkinson said  some great scheme was evidently brewing in his mighty mind a trip across the alps a bonfire at moscow or a little skirmish at waterloo perhaps for he marched in silent majesty till suddenly a gentle snore disturbed the imperial reverie he saw the sleeping soldier and glared upon him saying in an awful tone  ha asleep at his post death is the penalty he must die  picking up the musket he is about to execute summary justice as emperors are in the habit of doing when something in the face of the weary sentinel appears to touch him and well it might for a most engaging little warrior was jack as he lay with his shako half off his childish face trying to keep sober and a great black moustache over his rosy mouth it would have softened the heart of any napoleon and the little corporal proved himself a man by relenting and saying with a lofty gesture of forgiveness  brave fellow he is worn out i will let him sleep and mount guard in his place  then shouldering the gun this noble being strode to and fro with a dignity which thrilled the younger spectators the sentinel awakes sees what has happened and gives himself up for lost but the emperor restores his weapon and with that smile which won all hearts says pointing to a high rock whereon a crow happens to be sitting be brave be vigilant and remember that from yonder pyramid generations are beholding you and with these memorable words he vanishes leaving the grateful soldier bolt upright with his hand at his temple and deathless devotion stamped upon his youthful countenance  the applause which followed this superb piece had hardly subsided when a sudden splash and a shrill cry caused a general rush toward the waterfall that went gambolling down the rocks singing sweetly as it ran pokey had tried to gambol also and had tumbled into a shallow pool whither jamie had gallantly followed in a vain attempt to fish her out and both were paddling about half frightened half pleased with the unexpected bath  this mishap made it necessary to get the dripping infants home as soon as possible so the wagons were loaded up and away they went as merry as if the mountain air had really been oxygenated sweets not bitters as dr alec suggested when mac said he felt as jolly as if he had been drinking champagne instead of the current wine that came with a great frosted cake wreathed with sugar roses in aunt plentys hamper of goodies  rose took part in all the fun and never betrayed by look or word the twinges of pain she suffered in her ankle she excused herself from the games in the evening however and sat talking to uncle alec in a lively way that both amazed and delighted him for she confided to him that she played horse with the children drilled with the light infantry climbed trees and did other dreadful things that would have caused the aunts to cry aloud if they knew of them  i dont care a pin what they say if you dont mind uncle she answered when he pictured the dismay of the good ladies  ah its all very well to defy them but you are getting so rampant im afraid you will defy me next and then where are we  no i wont i shouldnt dare because you are my guardian and can put me in a straitjacket if you like and rose laughed in his face even while she nestled closer with a confiding gesture pleasant to see  upon my word rosy i begin to feel like the man who bought an elephant and then didnt know what to do with him i thought i had got a pet and plaything for years to come but here you are growing up like a beanstalk and i shall find ive got a strongminded little woman on my hands before i can turn round theres predicament for a man and an uncle  dr alecs comic distress was mercifully relieved for the time being by a dance of goblins on the lawn where the children with pumpkin lanterns on their heads frisked about like willothewisps as a parting surprise  when rose went to bed she found that uncle alec had not forgotten her for on the table stood a delicate little easel holding two miniatures set in velvet she knew them both and stood looking at them till her eyes brimmed over with tears that were both sweet and sad for they were the faces of her father and mother beautifully copied from portraits fast fading away  presently she knelt down and putting her arms round the little shrine kissed one after the other saying with an earnest voice ill truly try to make them glad to see me by and by  and that was roses little prayer on the night of her fourteenth birthday  two days later the campbells went home a larger party than when they came for dr alec was escort and kitty comet was borne in state in a basket with a bottle of milk some tiny sandwiches and a dolls dish to drink out of as well as a bit of carpet to lie on in her palace car out of which she kept popping her head in the most fascinating manner  there was a great kissing and cuddling waving of handkerchiefs and last goodbyes as they went and when they had started mother atkinson came running after them to tuck in some little pies hot from the oven for the dears who might get tired of bread and butter during that long days travel  another start and another halt for the snow children came shrieking up to demand the three kittens that pokey was cooly carrying off in a travelling bag the unhappy kits were rescued half smothered and restored to their lawful owners amid dire lamentation from the little kidnapper who declared that she only tooked um cause theyd want to go wid their sister tomit  start number three and stoppage number three as frank hailed them with the luncheon basket which had been forgotten after everyone had protested that it was safely in  all went well after that and the long journey was pleasantly beguiled by pokey and pussy who played together so prettily that they were considered public benefactors  rose doesnt want to go home for she knows the aunts wont let her rampage as she did up at cosey corner said mac as they approached the old house  i cant rampage if i want to for a time at least and ill tell you why i sprained my ankle when i tumbled off of barkis and it gets worse and worse though ive done all i know to cure it and hide it so it shouldnt trouble anyone whispered rose knitting her brows with pain as she prepared to descend wishing her uncle would take her instead of her bundles  how he did it she never knew but mac had her up the steps and on the parlour sofa before she could put her foot to the ground  there you are right side up with care and mind now if your ankle bothers you and you are laid up with it i am to be your footman its only fair you know for i dont forget how good you have been to me and mac went to call phebe so full of gratitude and goodwill that his very goggles shone    chapter 15earrings  roses sprain proved to be a serious one owing to neglect and dr alec ordered her to lie on the sofa for a fortnight at least whereat she groaned dismally but dared not openly complain lest the boys turn upon her with some of the wise little sermons on patience which she had delivered for their benefit  it was macs turn now and honourably did he repay his debt for as school was still forbidden he had plenty of leisure and devoted most of it to rose he took many steps for her and even allowed her to teach him to knit after assuring himself that many a brave scotchman knew how to click the pricks she was obliged to take a solemn vow of secrecy however before he would consent for though he did not mind being called giglamps granny was more than his boyish soul could bear and at the approach of any of the clan his knitting vanished as if by magic which frequent chucking out of sight did not improve the stripe he was doing for roses new afghan  she was busy with this pretty work one bright october afternoon all nicely established on her sofa in the upper hall while jamie and pokey lent for her amusement were keeping house in a corner with comet and roses old doll for their childerns  presently phebe appeared with a card rose read it made a grimace then laughed and said  ill see miss blish and immediately put on her company face pulled out her locket and settled her curls  you dear thing how do you do ive been trying to call every day since you got back but i have so many engagements i really couldnt manage it till today so glad you are alone for mamma said i could sit awhile and i brought my lacework to show you for its perfectly lovely cried miss blish greeting rose with a kiss which was not very warmly returned though rose politely thanked her for coming and bid phebe roll up the easy chair  how nice to have a maid said ariadne as she settled herself with much commotion still dear you must be very lonely and feel the need of a bosom friend  i have my cousins began rose with dignity for her visitors patronising manner ruffled her temper  gracious child you dont make friends of those great boys do you mamma says she really doesnt think its proper for you to be with them so much  they are like brothers and my aunts do think its proper replied rose rather sharply for it struck her that this was none of miss blishs business  i was merely going to say i should be glad to have you for my bosom friend for hatty mason and i have had an awful quarrel and dont speak she is too mean to live so i gave her up just think she never paid back one of the caramels ive given her and never invited me to her party i could have forgiven the caramels but to be left out in that rude way was more than i could bear and i told her never to look at me again as long as she lived  you are very kind but i dont think i want a bosom friend thank you said rose as ariadne stopped to bridle and shake her flaxen head over the delinquent hatty mason  now in her heart miss blish thought rose a stuckup puss but the other girls wanted to know her and couldnt the old house was a charming place to visit the lads were considered fine fellows and the campbells are one of our first families mamma said so ariadne concealed her vexation at roses coolness and changed the subject as fast as possible  studying french i see who is your teacher she asked flitting over the leaves of paul and virginia that lay on the table  i dont study it for i read french as well as english and uncle and i often speak it for hours he talks like a native and says i have a remarkably good accent  rose really could not help this small display of superiority for french was one of her strong points and she was vain of it though she usually managed to hide this weakness she felt that ariadne would be the better for a little crushing and could not resist the temptation to patronise in her turn  oh indeed said miss blish rather blankly for french was not her strong point by any means  i am to go abroad with uncle in a year or two and he knows how important it is to understand the languages half the girls who leave school cant speak decent french and when they go abroad they are so mortified i shall be very glad to help you if you like for of course you have no one to talk with at home  now ariadne though she looked like a wax doll had feelings within her instead of sawdust and these feelings were hurt by roses lofty tone she thought her more stuck up than ever but did not know how to bring her down yet longed to do it for she felt as if she had received a box on the ear and involuntarily put her hand up to it the touch of an earring consoled her and suggested a way of returning tit for tat in a telling manner  thank you dear i dont need any help for our teacher is from paris and of course he speaks better french than your uncle then she added with a gesture of her head that set the little bells on her ears to tingling how do you like my new earrings papa gave them to me last week and everyone says they are lovely  rose came down from her high horse with a rapidity that was comical for ariadne had the upper hand now rose adored pretty things longed to wear them and the desire of her girlish soul was to have her ears bored only dr alec thought it foolish so she never had done it she would gladly have given all the french she could jabber for a pair of golden bells with pearltipped tongues like those ariadne wore and clasping her hands she answered in a tone that went to the hearers heart  they are too sweet for anything if uncle would only let me wear some i should be perfectly happy  i wouldnt mind what he says papa laughed at me at first but he likes them now and says i shall have diamond solitaires when i am eighteen said ariadne quite satisfied with her shot  ive got a pair now that were mammas and a beautiful little pair of pearl and turquoise ones that i am dying to wear sighed rose  then do it ill pierce your ears and you must wear a bit of silk in them till they are well your curls will hide them nicely then some day slip in your smallest earrings and see if your uncle dont like them  i asked him if it wouldnt do my eyes good once when they were red and he only laughed people do cure weak eyes that way dont they  yes indeed and yours are sort of red let me see yes i really think you ought to do it before they get worse said ariadne peering into the large clear eye offered for inspection  does it hurt much asked rose wavering  oh dear no just a prick and a pull and its all over ive done lots of ears and know just how come push up your hair and get a big needle  i dont quite like to do it without asking uncles leave faltered rose when all was ready for the operation  did he ever forbid it demanded ariadne hovering over her prey like a vampire  no never  then do it unless you are afraid cried miss blish bent on accomplishing the deed  that last word settled the matter and closing her eyes rose said punch in the tone of one giving the fatal order fire  ariadne punched and the victim bore it in heroic silence though she turned pale and her eyes were full of tears of anguish  there now pull the bits of silk often and coldcream your ears every night and youll soon be ready for the rings said ariadne well pleased with her job for the girl who spoke french with a fine accent lay flat upon the sofa looking as exhausted as if she had had both ears cut off  it does hurt dreadfully and i know uncle wont like it sighed rose as remorse began to gnaw promise not to tell or i shall be teased to death she added anxiously entirely forgetting the two little pitchers gifted with eyes as well as ears who had been watching the whole performance from afar  never mercy me whats that and ariadne started as a sudden sound of steps and voices came up from below  its the boys hide the needle do my ears show dont breathe a word whispered rose scrambling about to conceal all traces of their iniquity from the sharp eyes of the clan  up they came all in good order laden with the proceeds of a nutting expedition for they always reported to rose and paid tribute to their queen in the handsomest manner  how many and how big well have a grand roasting frolic after tea wont we said rose plunging both hands into a bag of glossy brown nuts while the clan stood at ease and nodded to ariadne  that lot was picked especially for you rosy i got every one myself and they are extra whackers said mac presenting a bushel or so  you should have seen giglamps when he was after them he pitched out of the tree and would have broken his blessed old neck if arch had not caught him observed steve as he lounged gracefully in the window seat  you neednt talk dandy when you didnt know a chestnut from a beech and kept on thrashing till i told you of it retorted mac festooning himself over the back of the sofa being a privileged boy  i dont make mistakes when i thrash you old worm so youd better mind what you are about answered steve without a ray of proper respect for his elder brother  it is getting dark and i must go or mamma will be alarmed said ariadne rising in sudden haste though she hoped to be asked to remain to the nutparty  no one invited her and all the while she was putting on her things and chatting to rose the boys were telegraphing to one another the sad fact that someone ought to escort the young lady home not a boy felt heroic enough to cast himself into the breach however even polite archie shirked the duty saying to charlie as they quietly slipped into an adjoining room  im not going to do all the gallivanting let steve take that chit home and show his manners  ill be hanged if i do answered prince who disliked miss blish because she tried to be coquettish with him  then i will and to the dismay of both recreant lads dr alec walked out of the room to offer his services to the chit  he was too late however for mac obeying a look from rose had already made a victim of himself and trudged meekly away wishing the gentle ariadne at the bottom of the red sea  then i will take this lady down to tea as the other one has found a gentleman to go home with her i see the lamps are lighted below and i smell a smell which tells me that auntie has something extra nice for us tonight  as he spoke dr alec was preparing to carry rose downstairs as usual but archie and prince rushed forward begging with penitent eagerness for the honour of carrying her in an armchair rose consented fearing that her uncles keen eye would discover the fatal bits of silk so the boys crossed hands and taking a good grip of each curly pate she was borne down in state while the others followed by way of the banisters  tea was ordered earlier than usual so that jamie and his dolly could have a taste at least of the holiday fun for they were to stay till seven and be allowed twelve roasted chestnuts apiece which they were under bonds not to eat till next day  tea was despatched rapidly therefore and the party gathered round the wide hearth in the diningroom where the nuts were soon dancing gaily on hot shovels or bouncing out among the company thereby causing delightful panics among the little ones  come rosy tell us a story while we work for you cant help much and must amuse us as your share proposed mac who sat in the shade pricking nuts and who knew by experience what a capital little scheherazade his cousin was  yes we poor monkeys cant burn our paws for nothing so tell away pussy added charlie as he threw several hot nuts into her lap and shook his fingers afterwards  well i happen to have a little story with a moral to it in my mind and i will tell it though it is intended for younger children than you answered rose who was rather fond of telling instructive tales  fire away said geordie and she obeyed little thinking what a disastrous story it would prove to herself  well once upon a time a little girl went to see a young lady who was very fond of her now the young lady happened to be lame and had to have her foot bandaged up every day so she kept a basketful of bandages all nicely rolled and ready the little girl liked to play with this basket and one day when she thought no one saw her she took one of the rolls without asking leave and put it in her pocket  here pokey who had been peering lovingly down at the five warm nuts that lay at the bottom of her tiny pocket suddenly looked up and said oh in a startled tone as if the moral tale had become intensely interesting all at once  rose heard and saw the innocent betrayal of the small sinner and went on in a most impressive manner while the boys nudged one another and winked as they caught the joke  but an eye did see this naughty little girl and whose eye do you think it was  eye of dod murmured consciencestricken pokey spreading two chubby little hands before the round face which they were not half big enough to hide  rose was rather taken aback by this reply but feeling that she was producing a good effect she added seriously  yes god saw her and so did the young lady but she did not say anything she waited to see what the little girl would do about it she had been very happy before she took the bandage but when it was in her pocket she seemed troubled and pretty soon stopped playing and sat down in a corner looking very sober she thought a few minutes and then went and put back the roll very softly and her face cleared up and she was a happy child again the young lady was glad to see that and wondered what made the little girl put it back  tonscience picked her murmured a contrite voice from behind the small hands pressed tightly over pokeys red face  and why did she take it do you suppose asked rose in a schoolmarmish tone feeling that all the listeners were interested in her tale and its unexpected application  it was so nice and wound and she wanted it deffly answered the little voice  well im glad she had such a good conscience the moral is that people who steal dont enjoy what they take and are not happy till they put it back what makes that little girl hide her face asked rose as she concluded  mes so shamed of pokey sobbed the small culprit quite overcome by remorse and confusion at this awful disclosure  come rose its too bad to tell her little tricks before everyone and preach at her in that way you wouldnt like it yourself began dr alec taking the weeper on his knee and administering consolation in the shape of kisses and nuts  before rose could express her regret jamie who had been reddening and ruffling like a little turkeycock for several minutes burst out indignantly bent on avenging the wound given to his beloved dolly  i know something bad that you did and im going to tell right out you thought we didnt see you but we did and you said uncle wouldnt like it and the boys would tease and you made ariadne promise not to tell and she punched holes in your ears to put earrings in so now and thats much badder than to take an old piece of rag and i hate you for making my pokey cry  jamies somewhat incoherent explosion produced such an effect that pokeys small sin was instantly forgotten and rose felt that her hour had come  what what what cried the boys in a chorus dropping their shovels and knives to gather round rose for a guilty clutching at her ears betrayed her and with a feeble cry of ariadne made me she hid her head among the pillows like an absurd little ostrich  now shell go prancing round with bird cages and baskets and carts and pigs for all i know in her ears as the other girls do and wont she look like a goose asked one tormentor tweaking a curl that strayed out from the cushions  i didnt think shed be so silly said mac in a tone of disappointment that told rose she had sunk in the esteem of her wise cousin  that blish girl is a nuisance and ought not to be allowed to come here with her nonsensical notions said the prince feeling a strong desire to shake that young person as an angry dog might shake a mischievous kitten  how do you like it uncle asked archie who being the head of a family himself believed in preserving discipline at all costs  i am very much surprised but i see she is a girl after all and must have her vanities like all the rest of them answered dr alec with a sigh as if he had expected to find rose a sort of angel above all earthly temptations  what shall you do about it sir inquired geordie wondering what punishment would be inflicted on a feminine culprit  as she is fond of ornaments perhaps we had better give her a nosering also i have one somewhere that a fiji belle once wore ill look it up and leaving pokey to jamies care dr alec rose as if to carry out his suggestion in earnest  good good well do it right away heres a gimlet so you hold her boys while i get her dear little nose all ready cried charlie whisking away the pillow as the other boys danced about the sofa in true fiji style  it was a dreadful moment for rose could not run away she could only grasp her precious nose with one hand and extend the other crying distractedly  o uncle save me save me  of course he saved her and when she was securely barricaded by his strong arm she confessed her folly in such humiliation of spirit that the lads after a good laugh at her decided to forgive her and lay all the blame on the tempter ariadne even dr alec relented so far as to propose two gold rings for the ears instead of one copper one for the nose a proceeding which proved that if rose had all the weakness of her sex for jewellery he had all the inconsistency of his in giving a pretty penitent exactly what she wanted spite of his better judgment    chapter 16bread and buttonholes  what in the world is my girl thinking about all alone here with such a solemn face asked dr alec coming into the study one november day to find rose sitting there with folded hands and a very thoughtful aspect  uncle i want to have some serious conversation with you if you have time she said coming out of a brown study as if she had not heard his question  im entirely at your service and most happy to listen he answered in his politest manner for when rose put on her womanly little airs he always treated her with a playful sort of respect that pleased her very much  now as he sat down beside her she said very soberly  ive been trying to decide what trade i would learn and i want you to advise me  trade my dear and dr alec looked so astonished that she hastened to explain  i forgot that you didnt hear the talk about it up at cosey corner you see we used to sit under the pines and sew and talk a great deal all the ladies i mean and i liked it very much mother atkinson thought that everyone should have a trade or something to make a living out of for rich people may grow poor you know and poor people have to work her girls were very clever and could do ever so many things and aunt jessie thought the old lady was right so when i saw how happy and independent those young ladies were i wanted to have a trade and then it wouldnt matter about money though i like to have it well enough  dr alec listened to this explanation with a curious mixture of surprise pleasure and amusement in his face and looked at his little niece as if she had suddenly changed into a young woman she had grown a good deal in the last six months and an amount of thinking had gone on in that young head which would have astonished him greatly could he have known it all for rose was one of the children who observe and meditate much and now and then nonplus their friends by a wise or curious remark  i quite agree with the ladies and shall be glad to help you decide on something if i can said the doctor seriously what do you incline to a natural taste or talent is a great help in choosing you know  i havent any talent or any especial taste that i can see and that is why i cant decide uncle so i think it would be a good plan to pick out some very useful business and learn it because i dont do it for pleasure you see but as a part of my education and to be ready in case im ever poor answered rose looking as if she rather longed for a little poverty so that her useful gift might be exercised  well now there is one very excellent necessary and womanly accomplishment that no girl should be without for it is a help to rich and poor and the comfort of families depends upon it this fine talent is neglected nowadays and considered oldfashioned which is a sad mistake and one that i dont mean to make in bringing up my girl it should be a part of every girls education and i know of a most accomplished lady who will teach you in the best and pleasantest manner  oh what is it cried rose eagerly charmed to be met in this helpful and cordial way  housekeeping answered dr alec  is that an accomplishment asked rose while her face fell for she had indulged in all sorts of vague delightful dreams  yes it is one of the most beautiful as well as useful of all the arts a woman can learn not so romantic perhaps as singing painting writing or teaching even but one that makes many happy and comfortable and home the sweetest place in the world yes you may open your big eyes but it is a fact that i had rather see you a good housekeeper than the greatest belle in the city it need not interfere with any talent you may possess but it is a necessary part of your training and i hope that you will set about it at once now that you are well and strong  who is the lady asked rose rather impressed by her uncles earnest speech  aunt plenty  is she accomplished began rose in a wondering tone for this greataunt of hers had seemed the least cultivated of them all  in the good oldfashioned way she is very accomplished and has made this house a happy home to us all ever since we can remember she is not elegant but genuinely good and so beloved and respected that there will be universal mourning for her when her place is empty no one can fill it for the solid homely virtues of the dear soul have gone out of fashion as i say and nothing new can be half so satisfactory to me at least  i should like to have people feel so about me can she teach me to do what she does and to grow as good asked rose with a little prick of remorse for even thinking that aunt plenty was a commonplace old lady  yes if you dont despise such simple lessons as she can give i know it would fill her dear old heart with pride and pleasure to feel that anyone cared to learn of her for she fancies her day gone by let her teach you how to be what she has been a skilful frugal cheerful housewife the maker and the keeper of a happy home and by and by you will see what a valuable lesson it is  i will uncle but how shall i begin  ill speak to her about it and she will make it all right with dolly for cooking is one of the main things you know  so it is i dont mind that a bit for i like to mess and used to try at home but i had no one to tell me so i never did much but spoil my aprons pies are great fun only dolly is so cross i dont believe she will ever let me do a thing in the kitchen  then well cook in the parlour i fancy aunt plenty will manage her so dont be troubled only mind this id rather you learned how to make good bread than the best pies ever baked when you bring me a handsome wholesome loaf entirely made by yourself i shall be more pleased than if you offered me a pair of slippers embroidered in the very latest style i dont wish to bribe you but ill give you my heartiest kiss and promise to eat every crumb of the loaf myself  its a bargain its a bargain come and tell aunty all about it for im in a hurry to begin cried rose dancing before him toward the parlor where miss plenty sat alone knitting contentedly yet ready to run at the first call for help of any sort from any quarter  no need to tell how surprised and gratified she was at the invitation she received to teach the child the domestic arts which were her only accomplishments nor to relate how energetically she set about her pleasant task dolly dared not grumble for miss plenty was the one person whom she obeyed and phebe openly rejoiced for these new lessons brought rose nearer to her and glorified the kitchen in the good girls eyes  to tell the truth the elder aunts had sometimes felt that they did not have quite their share of the little niece who had won their hearts long ago and was the sunshine of the house they talked it over together sometimes but always ended by saying that as alec had all the responsibility he should have the larger share of the dear girls love and time and they would be contented with such crumbs of comfort as they could get  dr alec had found out this little secret and after reproaching himself for being blind and selfish was trying to devise some way of mending matters without troubling anyone when roses new whim suggested an excellent method of weaning her a little from himself he did not know how fond he was of her till he gave her up to the new teacher and often could not resist peeping in at the door to see how she got on or stealing sly looks through the slide when she was deep in dough or listening intently to some impressive lecture from aunt plenty they caught him at it now and then and ordered him off the premises at the point of the rollingpin or if unusually successful and therefore in a milder mood they lured him away with bribes of gingerbread a stray pickle or a tart that was not quite symmetrical enough to suit their critical eyes  of course he made a point of partaking copiously of all the delectable messes that now appeared at table for both the cooks were on their mettle and he fared sumptuously every day but an especial relish was given to any dish when in reply to his honest praise of it rose coloured up with innocent pride and said modestly  i made that uncle and im glad you like it  it was some time before the perfect loaf appeared for breadmaking is an art not easily learned and aunt plenty was very thorough in her teaching so rose studied yeast first and through various stages of cake and biscuit came at last to the crowning glory of the handsome wholesome loaf it appeared at teatime on a silver salver proudly borne in by phebe who could not refrain from whispering with a beaming face as she set it down before dr alec  aint it just lovely sir  it is a regularly splendid loaf did my girl make it all herself he asked surveying the shapely sweetsmelling object with real interest and pleasure  every particle herself and never asked a bit of help or advice from anyone answered aunt plenty folding her hands with an air of unmitigated satisfaction for her pupil certainly did her great credit  ive had so many failures and troubles that i really thought i never should be able to do it alone dolly let one splendid batch burn up because i forgot it she was there and smelt it but never did a thing for she said when i undertook to bake bread i must give my whole mind to it wasnt it hard she might have called me at least said rose recollecting with a sigh the anguish of that moment  she meant you should learn by experience as rosamond did in that little affair of the purple jar you remember  i always thought it very unfair in her mother not to warn the poor thing a little bit and she was regularly mean when rosamond asked for a bowl to put the purple stuff in and she said in such a provoking way i did not agree to lend you a bowl but i will my dear ugh i always want to shake that hateful woman though she was a moral mamma  never mind her now but tell me all about my loaf said dr alec much amused at roses burst of indignation  theres nothing to tell uncle except that i did my best gave my mind to it and sat watching over it all the while it was in the oven till i was quite baked myself everything went right this time and it came out a nice round crusty loaf as you see now taste it and tell me if it is good as well as handsome  must i cut it cant i put it under a glass cover and keep it in the parlor as they do wax flowers and fine works of that sort  what an idea uncle it would mould and be spoilt besides people would laugh at us and make fun of my oldfashioned accomplishment you promised to eat it and you must not all at once but as soon as you can so i can make you some more  dr alec solemnly cut off his favourite crusty slice and solemnly ate it then wiped his lips and brushing back roses hair solemnly kissed her on the forehead saying heartily  my dear it is perfect bread and you are an honour to your teacher when we have our model school i shall offer a prize for the best bread and you will get it  ive got it already and im quite satisfied said rose slipping into her seat and trying to hide her right hand which had a burn on it  but dr alec saw it guessed how it came there and after tea insisted on easing the pain which she would hardly confess  aunt clara says i am spoiling my hands but i dont care for ive had such good times with aunt plenty and i think she has enjoyed it as much as i have only one thing troubles me uncle and i want to ask you about it said rose as they paced up and down the hall in the twilight the bandaged hand very carefully laid on dr alecs arm  more little confidences i like them immensely so tell away my dear  well you see i feel as if aunt peace would like to do something for me and ive found out what it can be you know she cant go about like aunty plen and we are so busy nowadays that she is rather lonely im afraid so i want to take lessons in sewing of her she works so beautifully and it is a useful thing you know and i ought to be a good needlewoman as well as housekeeper oughtnt i  bless your kind little heart that is what i was thinking of the other day when aunt peace said she saw you very seldom now you were so busy i wanted to speak of it but fancied you had as much on your hands as you could manage it would delight the dear woman to teach you all her delicate handicraft especially buttonholes for i believe that is where young ladies fail at least ive heard them say so so do you devote your mind to buttonholes make em all over my clothes if you want something to practice on ill wear any quantity  rose laughed at this reckless offer but promised to attend to that important branch though she confessed that darning was her weak point whereupon uncle alec engaged to supply her with socks in all stages of dilapidation and to have a new set at once so that she could run the heels for him as a pleasant beginning  then they went up to make their request in due form to the great delight of gentle aunt peace who got quite excited with the fun that went on while they would yarn looked up darning needles and fitted out a nice little mending basket for her pupil  very busy and very happy were roses days now for in the morning she went about the house with aunt plenty attending to linenclosets and storerooms pickling and preserving exploring garret and cellar to see that all was right and learning in the good oldfashioned manner to look well after the ways of the household  in the afternoon after her walk or drive she sat with aunt peace plying her needle while aunt plenty whose eyes were failing knitted and chatted briskly telling many a pleasant story of old times till the three were moved to laugh and cry together for the busy needles were embroidering all sorts of bright patterns on the lives of the workers though they seemed to be only stitching cotton and darning hose  it was a pretty sight to see the rosyfaced little maid sitting between the two old ladies listening dutifully to their instructions and cheering the lessons with her lively chatter and blithe laugh if the kitchen had proved attractive to dr alec when rose was there at work the sewingroom was quite irresistible and he made himself so agreeable that no one had the heart to drive him away especially when he read aloud or spun yarns  there ive made you a new set of warm nightgowns with four buttonholes in each see if they are not neatly done said rose one day some weeks after the new lessons began  even to a thread and nice little bars across the end so i cant tear them when i twitch the buttons out most superior work maam and im deeply grateful so much so that ill sew on these buttons myself and save those tired fingers from another prick  you sew them on cried rose with her eyes wide open in amazement  wait a bit till i get my sewing tackle and then you shall see what i can do  can he really asked rose of aunt peace as uncle alec marched off with a comical air of importance  oh yes i taught him years ago before he went to sea and i suppose he has had to do things for himself more or less ever since so he has kept his hand in  he evidently had for he was soon back with a funny little workbag out of which he produced a thimble without a top and having threaded his needle he proceeded to sew on the buttons so handily that rose was much impressed and amused  i wonder if there is anything in the world that you cannot do she said in a tone of respectful admiration  there are one or two things that i am not up to yet he answered with a laugh in the corner of his eye as he waxed his thread with a flourish  i should like to know what  bread and buttonholes maam    chapter 17good bargains  it was a rainy sunday afternoon and four boys were trying to spend it quietly in the liberry as jamie called the room devoted to books and boys at aunt jessies will and geordie were sprawling on the sofa deep in the adventures of the scapegraces and ragamuffins whose histories are now the fashion archie lounged in the easy chair surrounded by newspapers charlie stood upon the rug in an englishmans favourite attitude and i regret to say both were smoking cigars  it is my opinion that this day will never come to an end said prince with a yawn that nearly rent him asunder  read and improve your mind my son answered archie peering solemnly over the paper behind which he had been dozing  dont you preach parson but put on your boots and come out for a tramp instead of mulling over the fire like a granny  no thank you tramps in an easterly storm dont strike me as amusing there archie stopped and held up his hand for a pleasant voice was heard saying outside  are the boys in the library auntie  yes dear and longing for sunshine so run in and make it for them answered mrs jessie  its rose and archie threw his cigar into the fire  whats that for asked charlie  gentlemen dont smoke before ladies  true but im not going to waste my weed and prince poked his into the empty inkstand that served them for an ash tray  a gentle tap at the door was answered by a chorus of come in and rose appeared looking blooming and breezy with the chilly air  if i disturb you say so and ill go away she began pausing on the threshold with modest hesitation for something in the elder boys faces excited her curiosity  you never disturb us cousin said the smokers while the readers tore themselves from the heroes of the barroom and gutter long enough to nod affably to their guest  as rose bent to warm her hands one end of archies cigar stuck out of the ashes smoking furiously and smelling strongly  oh you bad boys how could you do it today of all days she said reproachfully  wheres the harm asked archie  you know as well as i do your mother doesnt like it and its a bad habit for it wastes money and does you no good  fiddlesticks every man smokes even uncle alec whom you think so perfect began charlie in his teasing way  no he doesnt he has given it up and i know why cried rose eagerly  now i think of it i havent seen the old meerschaum since he came home did he stop it on our account asked archie  yes and rose told the little scene on the seashore in the campingout time  archie seemed much impressed and said manfully he wont have done that in vain so far as im concerned i dont care a pin about smoking so can give it up as easy as not and i promise you i will i only do it now and then for fun  you too and rose looked up at the bonny prince who never looked less bonny than at that moment for he had resumed his cigar just to torment her  now charlie cared as little as archie about smoking but it would not do to yield too soon so he shook his head gave a great puff and said loftily  you women are always asking us to give up harmless little things just because you dont approve of them how would you like it if we did the same by you miss  if i did harmful or silly things id thank you for telling me of them and id try to mend my ways answered rose heartily  well now well see if you mean what you say ill give up smoking to please you if you will give up something to please me said prince seeing a good chance to lord it over the weaker vessel at small cost to himself  ill agree if it is as foolish as cigars  oh its ever so much sillier  then i promise what is it and rose quite trembled with anxiety to know which of her pet habits or possessions she must lose  give up your earrings and charlie laughed wickedly sure that she would never hold to that bargain  rose uttered a cry and clapped both hands to her ears where the gold rings hung  oh charlie wouldnt anything else do as well ive been through so much teasing and trouble i do want to enjoy my pretty earrings for i can wear them now  wear as many as you like and ill smoke in peace returned this bad boy  will nothing else satisfy you imploringly  nothing sternly  rose stood silent for a minute thinking of something aunt jessie once said you have more influence over the boys than you know use it for their good and i shall thank you all my life here was a chance to do some good by sacrificing a little vanity of her own she felt it was right to do it yet found it very hard and asked wistfully  do you mean never wear them charlie  never unless you want me to smoke  i never do  then clinch the bargain  he had no idea she would do it and was much surprised when she took the dear rings from her ears with a quick gesture and held them out to him saying in a tone that made the colour come up to his brown cheek it was so full of sweet good will  i care more for my cousins than for my earrings so i promise and ill keep my word  for shame prince let her wear her little danglers if she likes and dont bargain about doing what you know is right cried archie coming out of his grove of newspapers with an indignant bounce  but rose was bent on showing her aunt that she could use her influence for the boys good and said steadily  it is fair and i want it to be so then you will believe im in earnest here each of you wear one of these on your watchguard to remind you i shall not forget because very soon i cannot wear earrings if i want to  as she spoke rose offered a little ring to each cousin and the boys seeing how sincere she was obeyed her when the pledges were safe rose stretched a hand to each and the lads gave hers a hearty grip half pleased and half ashamed of their part in the compact  just at that moment dr alec and mrs jessie came in  whats this dancing ladies triumph on sunday exclaimed uncle alec surveying the trio with surprise  no sir it is the antitobacco league will you join said charlie while rose slipped away to her aunt and archie buried both cigars behind the back log  when the mystery was explained the elders were well pleased and rose received a vote of thanks which made her feel as if she had done a service to her country as she had for every boy who grows up free from bad habits bids fair to make a good citizen  i wish rose would drive a bargain with will and geordie also for i think these books are as bad for the small boys as cigars for the large ones said mrs jessie sitting down on the sofa between the readers who politely curled up their legs to make room for her  i thought they were all the fashion answered dr alec settling in the big chair with rose  so is smoking but it is harmful the writers of these popular stories intend to do good i have no doubt but it seems to me they fail because their motto is be smart and you will be rich instead of be honest and you will be happy i do not judge hastily alec for i have read a dozen at least of these stories and with much that is attractive to boys i find a great deal to condemn in them and other parents say the same when i ask them  now mum thats too bad i like em tiptop this one is a regular screamer cried will  theyre bully books and id like to know wheres the harm added geordie  you have just shown us one of the chief evils and that is slang answered their mother quickly  must have it maam if these chaps talked all right thered be no fun in em protested will  a bootblack mustnt use good grammar and a newsboy must swear a little or he wouldnt be natural explained geordie both boys ready to fight gallantly for their favourites  but my sons are neither bootblacks nor newsboys and i object to hearing them use such words as screamer bully and buster in fact i fail to see the advantage of writing books about such people unless it is done in a very different way i cannot think they will help to refine the ragamuffins if they read them and im sure they can do no good to the better class of boys who through these books are introduced to police courts counterfeiters dens gambling houses drinking saloons and all sorts of low life  some of them are about firstrate boys mother and they go to sea and study and sail round the world having great larks all the way  i have read about them geordie and though they are better than the others i am not satisfied with these optical delusions as i call them now i put it to you boys is it natural for lads from fifteen to eighteen to command ships defeat pirates outwit smugglers and so cover themselves with glory that admiral farragut invites them to dinner saying noble boy you are an honour to your country or if the hero is in the army he has hairbreadth escapes and adventures enough in one small volume to turn his hair white and in the end he goes to washington at the express desire of the president or commanderinchief to be promoted to no end of stars and bars even if the hero is merely an honest boy trying to get his living he is not permitted to do so in a natural way by hard work and years of patient effort but is suddenly adopted by a millionaire whose pocketbook he has returned or a rich uncle appears from sea just in the nick of time or the remarkable boy earns a few dollars speculates in peanuts or neckties and grows rich so rapidly that sinbad in the diamond valley is a pauper compared to him isnt it so boys  well the fellows in these books are mighty lucky and very smart i must say answered will surveying an illustration on the open page before him where a small but virtuous youth is upsetting a tipsy giant in a barroom and under it the elegant inscription dick dauntless punches the head of sam soaker  it gives boys such wrong ideas of life and business shows them so much evil and vulgarity that they need not know about and makes the one success worth having a fortune a lords daughter or some worldly honour often not worth the time it takes to win it does seem to me that some one might write stories that should be lively natural and helpful tales in which the english should be good the morals pure and the characters such as we can love in spite of the faults that all may have i cant bear to see such crowds of eager little fellows at the libraries reading such trash weak when it is not wicked and totally unfit to feed the hungry minds that feast on it for want of something better there my lecture is done now i should like to hear what you gentlemen have to say and aunt jessie subsided with a pretty flush on the face that was full of motherly anxiety for her boys  tom brown just suits mother and me too so i wish mr hughes would write another story as good said archie  you dont find things of this sort in tom brown yet these books are all in the sundayschool libraries and mrs jessie read the following paragraph from the book she had taken from wills hand  in this place we saw a tooth of john the baptist ben said he could see locust and wild honey sticking to it i couldnt perhaps john used a piece of the true cross for a toothpick  a larky sort of a boy says that mum and we skip the parts where they describe what they saw in the different countries cried will  and those descriptions taken mostly from guidebooks i fancy are the only parts of any real worth the scrapes of the bad boys make up the rest of the story and it is for those you read these books i think answered his mother stroking back the hair off the honest little face that looked rather abashed at this true statement of the case  anyway mother the ship part is useful for we learn how to sail her and by and by that will all come handy when we go to sea put in geordie  indeed then you can explain this manoeuvre to me of course and mrs jessie read from another page the following nautical paragraph  the wind is southsouthwest and we can have her up four points closer to the wind and still be six points off the wind as she luffs up we shall man the fore and main sheets slack on the weather and haul on the lee braces  i guess i could if i wasnt afraid of uncle he knows so much more than i do hed laugh began geordie evidently puzzled by the question  ho you know you cant so why make believe we dont understand half of the sea lingo mum and i dare say its all wrong cried will suddenly going over to the enemy to geordies great disgust  i do wish the boys wouldnt talk to me as if i was a ship said rose bringing forward a private grievance coming home from church this morning the wind blew me about and will called out right in the street brail up the foresail and take in the flyingjib that will ease her  the boys shouted at the plaintive tone in which rose repeated the words that offended her and will vainly endeavoured to explain that he only meant to tell her to wrap her cloak closer and tie a veil over the tempesttossed feathers in her hat  to tell the truth if the boys must have slang i can bear the sea lingo as will calls it better than the other it afflicts me less to hear my sons talk about brailing up the foresail than doing as they darn please and cut your cable is decidedly preferable to let her rip i once made a rule that i would have no slang in the house i give it up now for i cannot keep it but i will not have rubbishy books so archie please send these two after your cigars  mrs jessie held both the small boys fast with an arm round each neck and when she took this base advantage of them they could only squirm with dismay yes right behind the back log she continued energetically there my hearties you like sea slang so ill give you a bit now i want you to promise not to read any more stuff for a month and ill agree to supply you with wholesome fare  oh mother not a single one cried will  couldnt we just finish those pleaded geordie  the boys threw away halfsmoked cigars and your books must go after them surely you would not be outdone by the old fellows as you call them or be less obedient to little mum than they were to rose  course not come on geordie and will took the vow like a hero his brother sighed and obeyed but privately resolved to finish his story the minute the month was over  you have laid out a hard task for yourself jessie in trying to provide good reading for boys who have been living on sensation stories it will be like going from raspberry tarts to plain bread and butter but you will probably save them from a bilious fever said dr alec much amused at the proceedings  i remember hearing grandpa say that a love for good books was one of the best safeguards a man could have began archie staring thoughtfully at the fine library before him  yes but theres no time to read nowadays a fellow has to keep scratching round to make money or hes nobody cut in charlie trying to look worldlywise  this love of money is the curse of america and for the sake of it men will sell honour and honesty till we dont know whom to trust and it is only a genius like agassiz who dares to say i cannot waste my time in getting rich said mrs jessie sadly  do you want us to be poor mother asked archie wondering  no dear and you never need be while you can use your hands but i am afraid of this thirst for wealth and the temptations it brings o my boys i tremble for the time when i must let you go because i think it would break my heart to have you fail as so many fail it would be far easier to see you dead if it could be said of you as of sumner no man dared offer him a bribe  mrs jessie was so earnest in her motherly anxiety that her voice faltered over the last words and she hugged the yellow heads closer in her arms as if she feared to let them leave that safe harbour for the great sea where so many little boats go down the younger lads nestled closer to her and archie said in his quiet resolute way  i cannot promise to be an agassiz or a sumner mother but i do promise to be an honest man please god  then im satisfied and holding fast the hand he gave her she sealed his promise with a kiss that had all a mothers hope and faith in it  i dont see how they ever can be bad she is so fond and proud of them whispered rose quite touched by the little scene  you must help her make them what they should be you have begun already and when i see those rings where they are my girl is prettier in my sight than if the biggest diamonds that ever twinkled shone in her ears answered dr alec looking at her with approving eyes  im so glad you think i can do anything for i perfectly ache to be useful everyone is so good to me especially aunt jessie  i think you are in a fair way to pay your debts rosy for when girls give up their little vanities and boys their small vices and try to strengthen each other in welldoing matters are going as they ought work away my dear and help their mother keep these sons fit friends for an innocent creature like yourself they will be the manlier men for it i can assure you    chapter 18fashion and physiology  please sir i guess youd better step up right away or it will be too late for i heard miss rose say she knew you wouldnt like it and shed never dare to let you see her  phebe said this as she popped her head into the study where dr alec sat reading a new book  they are at it are they he said looking up quickly and giving himself a shake as if ready for a battle of some sort  yes sir as hard as they can talk and miss rose dont seem to know what to do for the things are ever so stylish and she looks elegant in em though i like her best in the old ones answered phebe  you are a girl of sense ill settle matters for rosy and youll lend a hand is everything ready in her room and are you sure you understand how they go  oh yes sir but they are so funny i know miss rose will think its a joke and phebe laughed as if something tickled her immensely  never mind what she thinks so long as she obeys tell her to do it for my sake and she will find it the best joke she ever saw i expect to have a tough time of it but well win yet said the doctor as he marched upstairs with the book in his hand and an odd smile on his face  there was such a clatter of tongues in the sewingroom that no one heard his tap at the door so he pushed it open and took an observation aunt plenty aunt clara and aunt jessie were all absorbed in gazing at rose who slowly revolved between them and the great mirror in a full winter costume of the latest fashion  bless my heart worse even than i expected thought the doctor with an inward groan for to his benighted eyes the girl looked like a trussed fowl and the fine new dress had neither grace beauty nor fitness to recommend it  the suit was of two peculiar shades of blue so arranged that patches of light and dark distracted the eye the upper skirt was tied so lightly back that it was impossible to take a long step and the under one was so loaded with plaited frills that it wobbled no other word will express it ungracefully both fore and aft a bunch of folds was gathered up just below the waist behind and a great bow rode atop a small jacket of the same material was adorned with a high ruff at the back and laid well open over the breast to display some lace and a locket heavy fringes bows puffs ruffles and revers finished off the dress making ones head ache to think of the amount of work wasted for not a single graceful line struck the eye and the beauty of the material was quite lost in the profusion of ornament  a high velvet hat audaciously turned up in front with a bunch of pink roses and a sweeping plume was cocked over one ear and with her curls braided into a club at the back of her neck roses head looked more like that of a dashing young cavalier than a modest little girls highheeled boots tilted her well forward a tiny muff pinioned her arms and a spotted veil tied so closely over her face that her eyelashes were rumpled by it gave the last touch of absurdity to her appearance  now she looks like other girls and as i like to see her mrs clara was saying with an air of great satisfaction  she does look like a fashionable young lady but somehow i miss my little rose for children dressed like children in my day answered aunt plenty peering through her glasses with a troubled look for she could not imagine the creature before her ever sitting in her lap running to wait upon her or making the house gay with a childs blithe presence  things have changed since your day aunt and it takes time to get used to new ways but you jessie surely like this costume better than the dowdy things rose has been wearing all summer now be honest and own you do said mrs clara bent on being praised for her work  well dear to be quite honest then i think it is frightful answered mrs jessie with a candour that caused revolving rose to stop in dismay  hear hear cried a deep voice and with a general start the ladies became aware that the enemy was among them  rose blushed up to her hat brim and stood looking as she felt like a fool while mrs clara hastened to explain  of course i dont expect you to like it alec but i dont consider you a judge of what is proper and becoming for a young lady therefore i have taken the liberty of providing a pretty street suit for rose she need not wear it if you object for i know we promised to let you do what you liked with the poor dear for a year  it is a street costume is it asked the doctor mildly do you know i never should have guessed that it was meant for winter weather and brisk locomotion take a turn rosy and let me see all its beauties and advantages  rose tried to walk off with her usual free tread but the underskirt got in her way the overskirt was so tight she could not take a long step and her boots made it impossible to carry herself perfectly erect  i havent got used to it yet she said petulantly kicking at her train as she turned to toddle back again  suppose a mad dog or a runaway horse was after you could you get out of the way without upsetting colonel asked the doctor with a twinkle in the eyes that were fixed on the rakish hat  dont think i could but ill try and rose made a rush across the room her bootheels caught on a rug several strings broke her hat tipped over her eyes and she plunged promiscuously into a chair where she sat laughing so infectiously that all but mrs clara joined in her mirth  i should say that a walking suit in which one could not walk and a winter suit which exposes the throat head and feet to cold and damp was rather a failure clara especially as it has no beauty to reconcile one to its utter unfitness said dr alec as he helped rose undo her veil adding in a low tone nice thing for the eyes youll soon see spots when its off as well as when its on and by and by be a case for an oculist  no beauty cried mrs clara warmly now that is just a mans blindness this is the best of silk and camels hair real ostrich feathers and an expensive ermine muff what could be in better taste or more proper for a young girl  ill shew you if rose will go to her room and oblige me by putting on what she finds there answered the doctor with unexpected readiness  alec if it is a bloomer i shall protest ive been expecting it but i know i cannot bear to see that pretty child sacrificed to your wild ideas of health tell me it isnt a bloomer and mrs clara clasped her hands imploringly  it is not  thank heaven and she resigned herself with a sigh of relief adding plaintively i did hope youd accept my suit for poor rose has been afflicted with frightful clothes long enough to spoil the taste of any girl  you talk of my afflicting the child and then make a helpless guy like that of her answered the doctor pointing to the little fashion plate that was scuttling out of sight as fast as it could go  he closed the door with a shrug but before anyone could speak his quick eye fell upon an object which caused him to frown and demand in an indignant tone  after all i have said were you really going to tempt my girl with those abominable things  i thought we put them away when she wouldnt wear them murmured mrs clara whisking a little pair of corsets out of sight with guilty haste i only brought them to try for rose is growing stout and will have no figure if it is not attended to soon she added with an air of calm conviction that roused the doctor still more for this was one of his especial abominations  growing stout yes thank heaven she is and shall continue to do it for nature knows how to mould a woman better than any corsetmaker and i wont have her interfered with my dear clara have you lost your senses that you can for a moment dream of putting a growing girl into an instrument of torture like this and with a sudden gesture he plucked forth the offending corsets from under the sofa cushion and held them out with the expression one would wear on beholding the thumbscrews or the rack of ancient times  dont be absurd alec there is no torture about it for tight lacing is out of fashion and we have nice sensible things nowadays everyone wears them even babies have stiffened waists to support their weak little backs began mrs clara rushing to the defence of the pet delusion of most women  i know it and so the poor little souls have weak backs all their days as their mothers had before them it is vain to argue the matter and i wont try but i wish to state once for all that if i ever see a pair of corsets near rose ill put them in the fire and you may send the bill to me  as he spoke the corsets were on their way to destruction but mrs jessie caught his arm exclaiming merrily dont burn them for mercy sake alec they are full of whalebones and will make a dreadful odour give them to me ill see that they do no harm  whalebones indeed a regular fence of them and metal gateposts in front as if our own bones were not enough if wed give them a chance to do their duty growled the doctor yielding up the bone of contention with a last shake of contempt then his face cleared suddenly and he held up his finger saying with a smile hear those girls laugh cramped lungs could not make hearty music like that  peals of laughter issued from roses room and smiles involuntarily touched the lips of those who listened to the happy sound  some new prank of yours alec asked aunt plenty indulgently for she had come to believe in most of her nephews odd notions because they seemed to work so well  yes maam my last and i hope you will like it i discovered what clara was at and got my rival suit ready for today im not going to afflict rose but let her choose and if im not entirely mistaken she will like my rig best while we wait ill explain and then you will appreciate the general effect better i got hold of this little book and was struck with its good sense and good taste for it suggests a way to clothe women both healthfully and handsomely and that is a great point it begins at the foundations as you will see if you will look at these pictures and i should think women would rejoice at this lightening of their burdens  as he spoke the doctor laid the book before aunt plenty who obediently brought her spectacles to bear upon the illustrations and after a long look exclaimed with a scandalised face  mercy on us these things are like the nightdrawers jamie wears you dont mean to say you want rose to come out in this costume its not proper and i wont consent to it  i do mean it and im sure my sensible aunt will consent when she understands that these well ill call them by an indian name and say pajamas are for underwear and rose can have as pretty frocks as she likes outside these two suits of flannel each in one piece from head to foot with a skirt or so hung on this easilyfitting waist will keep the child warm without burdening her with belts and gathers and buckles and bunches round the waist and leave free the muscles that need plenty of room to work in she shall never have the backache if i can help it nor the long list of ills you dear women think you cannot escape  i dont consider it modest and im sure rose will be shocked at it began mrs clara but stopped suddenly as rose appeared in the doorway not looking shocked a bit  come on my hygienic model and let us see you said her uncle with an approving glance as she walked in looking so mischievously merry that it was evident she enjoyed the joke  well i dont see anything remarkable that is a neat plain suit the materials are good and its not unbecoming if you want her to look like a little schoolgirl but it has not a particle of style and no one would ever give it a second glance said mrs clara feeling that her last remark condemned the whole thing  exactly what i want answered the provoking doctor rubbing his hands with a satisfied air rosy looks now like what she is a modest little girl who does not want to be stared at i think she would get a glance of approval though from people who like sense and simplicity rather than fuss and feathers revolve my hebe and let me refresh my eyes by the sight of you  there was very little to see however only a pretty gabrielle dress of a soft warm shade of brown coming to the tops of a trim pair of boots with low heels a sealskin sack cap and mittens with a glimpse of scarlet at the throat and the pretty curls tied up with a bright velvet of the same colour completed the external adornment making her look like a robin redbreast wintry yet warm  how do you like it rosy asked the doctor feeling that her opinion was more important to the success of his new idea than that of all the aunts on the hill  i feel very odd and light but im warm as a toast and nothing seems to be in my way answered rose with a skip which displayed shapely gaiters on legs that now might be as free and active as a boys under the modest skirts of the girl  you can run away from the mad dogs and walk off at a smart pace without tumbling on your nose now i fancy  yes uncle suppose the dog coming i just hop over a wall so and when i walk of a cold day i go like this  entering fully into the spirit of the thing rose swung herself over the high back of the sofa as easily as one of her cousins and then went down the long hall as if her stout boots were related to the famous sevenleaguers  there you see how it will be dress her in that boyish way and she will act like a boy i do hate all these inventions of strongminded women exclaimed mrs clara as rose came back at a run  ah but you see some of these sensible inventions come from the brain of a fashionable modiste who will make you more lovely or what you value more stylish outside and comfortable within mrs van tassel has been to madame stone and is wearing a full suit of this sort van himself told me when i asked how she was that she had given up lying on the sofa and was going about in a most astonishing way considering her feeble health  you dont say so let me see that book a moment and aunt clara examined the new patterns with a more respectful air for if the elegant mrs van tassel wore these dreadful things it would never do to be left behind in spite of her prejudices  dr alec looked at mrs jessie and both smiled for little mum had been in the secret and enjoyed it mightily  i thought that would settle it he said with a nod  i didnt wait for mrs van to lead the way and for once in my life i have adopted a new fashion before clara my freedom suit is ordered and you may see me playing tag with rose and the boys before long answered mrs jessie nodding back at him  meantime aunt plenty was examining roses costume for the hat and sack were off and the girl was eagerly explaining the new undergarments  see auntie all nice scarlet flannel and a gay little petticoat and long stockings oh so warm phebe and i nearly died laughing when i put this rig on but i like it ever so much the dress is so comfortable and doesnt need any belt or sash and i can sit without rumpling any trimming thats such a comfort i like to be tidy and so when i wear fussedup things im thinking of my clothes all the time and thats tiresome do say you like it i resolved i would just to please uncle for he does know more about health than anyone else im sure and id wear a bag if he asked me to do it  i dont ask that rose but i wish youd weigh and compare the two suits and then choose which seems best i leave it to your own commonsense answered dr alec feeling pretty sure he had won  why i take this one of course uncle the other is fashionable and yes i must say i think its pretty but its very heavy and i should have to go round like a walking doll if i wore it im much obliged to auntie but ill keep this please  rose spoke gently but decidedly though there was a look of regret when her eye fell on the other suit which phebe had brought in and it was very natural to like to look as other girls did aunt clara sighed uncle alec smiled and said heartily  thank you dear now read this book and you will understand why i ask it of you then if you like ill give you a new lesson you asked for one yesterday and this is more necessary than french or housekeeping  oh what and rose caught up the book which mrs clara had thrown down with a disgusted look  though dr alec was forty the boyish love of teasing was not yet dead in him and being much elated at his victory he could not resist the temptation of shocking mrs clara by suggesting dreadful possibilities so he answered half in earnest half in jest physiology rose wouldnt you like to be a little medical student with uncle doctor for teacher and be ready to take up his practice when he has to stop if you agree ill hunt up my old skeleton tomorrow  that was too much for aunt clara and she hastily departed with her mind in a sad state of perturbation about mrs van tassels new costume and roses new study    chapter 19brother bones  rose accepted her uncles offer as aunt myra discovered two or three days later coming in for an early call and hearing voices in the study she opened the door gave a cry and shut it quickly looking a good deal startled the doctor appeared in a moment and begged to know what the matter was  how can you ask when that long box looks so like a coffin i thought it was one and that dreadful thing stared me in the face as i opened the door answered mrs myra pointing to the skeleton that hung from the chandelier cheerfully grinning at all beholders  this is a medical college where women are freely admitted so walk in madam and join the class if youll do me the honour said the doctor waving her forward with his politest bow  do auntie its perfectly splendid cried roses voice and roses blooming face was seen behind the ribs of the skeleton smiling and nodding in the gayest possible manner  what are you doing child demanded aunt myra dropping into a chair and staring about her  oh im learning bones today and i like it so much there are twelve ribs you know and the two lower ones are called floating ribs because they are not fastened to the breastbone thats why they go in so easily if you lace tight and squeeze the lungs and heart in the let me see what was that big word oh i know thoracic cavity and rose beamed with pride as she aired her little bit of knowledge  do you think that is a good sort of thing for her to be poking over she is a nervous child and im afraid it will be bad for her said aunt myra watching rose as she counted vertebrae and waggled a hipjoint in its socket with an inquiring expression  an excellent study for she enjoys it and i mean to teach her how to manage her nerves so that they wont be a curse to her as many a womans become through ignorance or want of thought to make a mystery or terror of these things is a mistake and i mean rose shall understand and respect her body so well that she wont dare to trifle with it as most women do  and she really likes it  very much auntie its all so wonderful and so nicely planned you can hardly believe what you see just think there are 600000000 air cells in one pair of lungs and 2000 pores to a square inch of surface so you see what quantities of air we must have and what care we should take of our skin so all the little doors will open and shut right and brains auntie youve no idea how curious they are i havent got to them yet but i long to and uncle is going to show me a manikin that you can take to pieces just think how nice it will be to see all the organs in their places i only wish they could be made to work as ours do  it was funny to see aunt myras face as rose stood before her talking rapidly with one hand laid in the friendliest manner on the skeletons shoulder every word both the doctor and rose uttered hit the good lady in her weakest spot and as she looked and listened a long array of bottles and pillboxes rose up before her reproaching her with the ignorance and want of thought that made her what she was a nervous dyspeptic unhappy old woman  well i dont know but you may be right alec only i wouldnt carry it too far women dont need much of this sort of knowledge and are not fit for it i couldnt bear to touch that ugly thing and it gives me the creeps to hear about organs said aunt myra with a sigh and her hand on her side  wouldnt it be a comfort to know that your liver was on the right side auntie and not on the left asked rose with a naughty laugh in her eyes for she had lately learnt that aunt myras liver complaint was not in the proper place  its a dying world child and it dont much matter where the pain is for sooner or later we all drop off and are seen no more was aunt myras cheerful reply  well i intend to know what kills me if i can and meantime im going to enjoy myself in spite of a dying world i wish youd do so too and come and study with uncle it would do you good im sure and rose went back to counting vertebrae with such a happy face that aunt myra had not the heart to say a word to dampen her ardour  perhaps its as well to let her do what she likes the little while she is with us but pray be careful of her alec and not allow her to overwork she whispered as she went out  thats exactly what im trying to do maam and rather a hard job i find it he added as he shut the door for the dear aunts were dreadfully in his way sometimes  half an hour later came another interruption in the shape of mac who announced his arrival by the brief but elegant remark  hullo what new game is this  rose explained mac gave a long whistle of surprise and then took a promenade round the skeleton observing gravely  brother bones looks very jolly but i cant say much for his beauty  you mustnt make fun of him for hes a good old fellow and youd be just as ugly if your flesh was off said rose defending her new friend with warmth  i dare say so ill keep my flesh on thank you you are so busy you cant read to a fellow i suppose asked mac whose eyes were better but still too weak for books  dont you want to come and join my class uncle explains it all to us and you can take a look at the plates as they come along well give up bones today and have eyes instead that will be more interesting to you added rose seeing no ardent thirst for physiological information in his face  rose we must not fly about from one thing to another in this way began dr alec but she whispered quickly with a nod towards mac whose goggles were turned wistfully in the direction of the forbidden books  hes blue today and we must amuse him give a little lecture on eyes and it will do him good no matter about me uncle  very well the class will please be seated and the doctor gave a sounding rap on the table  come sit by me dear then we can both see the pictures and if your head gets tired you can lie down said rose generously opening her little college to a brother and kindly providing for the weaknesses that all humanity is subject to  side by side they sat and listened to a very simple explanation of the mechanism of the eye finding it as wonderful as a fairy tale for fine plates illustrated it and a very willing teacher did his best to make the lesson pleasant  jove if id known what mischief i was doing to that mighty delicate machine of mine you wouldnt have caught me reading by firelight or studying with a glare of sunshine on my book said mac peering solemnly at a magnified eyeball then pushing it away he added indignantly why isnt a fellow taught all about his works and how to manage em and not left to go blundering into all sorts of worries telling him after hes down isnt much use for then hes found it out himself and wont thank you  ah mac thats just what i keep lecturing about and people wont listen you lads need that sort of knowledge so much and fathers and mothers ought to be able to give it to you few of them are able and so we all go blundering as you say less greek and latin and more knowledge of the laws of health for my boys if i had them mathematics are all very well but morals are better and i wish how i wish that i could help teachers and parents to feel it as they ought  some do aunt jessie and her boys have capital talks and i wish we could but mothers so busy with her housekeeping and father with his business there never seems to be any time for that sort of thing even if there was it dont seem as if it would be easy to talk to them because weve never got into the way of it you know  poor mac was right there and expressed a want that many a boy and girl feels fathers and mothers are too absorbed in business and housekeeping to study their children and cherish that sweet and natural confidence which is a childs surest safeguard and a parents subtlest power so the young hearts hide trouble or temptation till the harm is done and mutual regret comes too late happy the boys and girls who tell all things freely to father or mother sure of pity help and pardon and thrice happy the parents who out of their own experience and by their own virtues can teach and uplift the souls for which they are responsible  this longing stirred in the hearts of rose and mac and by a natural impulse both turned to dr alec for in this queer world of ours fatherly and motherly hearts often beat warm and wise in the breasts of bachelor uncles and maiden aunts and it is my private opinion that these worthy creatures are a beautiful provision of nature for the cherishing of other peoples children they certainly get great comfort out of it and receive much innocent affection that otherwise would be lost  dr alec was one of these and his big heart had room for every one of the eight cousins especially orphaned rose and afflicted mac so when the boy uttered that unconscious reproach to his parents and rose added with a sigh it must be beautiful to have a mother the good doctor yearned over them and shutting his book with a decided slam said in that cordial voice of his  now look here children you just come and tell me all your worries and with gods help ill settle them for you that is what im here for i believe and it will be a great happiness to me if you can trust me  we can uncle and we will both answered with a heartiness that gratified him much  good now school is dismissed and i advise you to go and refresh your 600000000 air cells by a brisk run in the garden come again whenever you like mac and well teach you all we can about your works as you call them so you can keep them running smoothly  well come sir much obliged and the class in physiology went out to walk  mac did come again glad to find something he could study in spite of his weak eyes and learned much that was of more value than anything his school had ever taught him  of course the other lads made great fun of the whole thing and plagued dr alecs students half out of their lives but they kept on persistently and one day something happened which made the other fellows behave themselves for ever after  it was a holiday and rose up in her room thought she heard the voices of her cousins so she ran down to welcome them but found no one there  never mind they will be here soon and then well have a frolic she said to herself and thinking she had been mistaken she went into the study to wait she was lounging over the table looking at a map when an odd noise caught her ear a gentle tapping somewhere and following the sound it seemed to come from the inside of the long case in which the skeleton lived when not professionally engaged this case stood upright in a niche between two bookcases at the back of the room a darkish corner where brother bones as the boys would call him was out of the way  as rose stood looking in that direction and wondering if a rat had got shut in the door of the case swung slowly open and with a great start she saw a bony arm lifted and a bony finger beckon to her for a minute she was frightened and ran to the study door with a fluttering heart but just as she touched the handle a queer stifled sort of giggle made her stop short and turn red with anger she paused an instant to collect herself and then went softly toward the bony beckoner a nearer look revealed black threads tied to the arm and fingers the ends of threads disappearing through holes bored in the back of the case peeping into the dark recess she also caught sight of the tip of an elbow covered with a rough gray cloth which she knew very well  quick as a flash she understood the joke her fear vanished and with a wicked smile she whipped out her scissors cut the threads and the bony arm dropped with a rattle before she could say come out charlie and let my skeleton alone a sudden irruption of boys all in a high state of tickle proclaimed to the hidden rogue that his joke was a failure  i told him not to do it because it might give you a start explained archie emerging from the closet  i had a smelling bottle all ready if she fainted away added steve popping up from behind the great chair  its too bad of you not to squawk and run we depended on it its such fun to howl after you said will and geordie rolling out from under the sofa in a promiscuous heap  you are getting altogether too strongminded rose most girls would have been in a jolly twitter to see this old fellow waggling his finger at them complained charlie squeezing out from his tight quarters dusty and disgusted  im used to your pranks now so im always on the watch and prepared but i wont have brother bones made fun of i know uncle wouldnt like it so please dont began rose just as dr alec came in and seeing the state of the case at a glance he said quietly  hear how i got that skeleton and then im sure you will treat it with respect  the boys settled down at once on any article of furniture that was nearest and listened dutifully  years ago when i was in the hospital a poor fellow was brought there with a rare and very painful disease there was no hope for him but we did our best and he was so grateful that when he died he left us his body that we might discover the mysteries of his complaint and so be able to help others afflicted in the same way it did do good and his brave patience made us remember him long after he was gone he thought i had been kind to him and said to a fellowstudent of mine tell the doctor i lave him me bones for ive nothing else in the wide world and ill nos be wanting em at all at all when the great pain hat kilt me entirely so that is how they came to be mine and why ive kept them carefully for though only a poor ignorant fellow mike nolan did what he could to help others and prove his gratitude to those who tried to help him  as dr alec paused archie closed the door of the case as respectfully as if the mummy of an egyptian king was inside will and geordie looked solemnly at one another evidently much impressed and charlie pensively remarked from the coalhod where he sat  ive often heard of a skeleton in the house but i think few people have one as useful and as interesting as ours    chapter 20under the mistletoe  rose made phebe promise that she would bring her stocking into the bower as she called her pretty room on christmas morning because that first delicious rummage loses half its charm if two little nightcaps at least do not meet over the treasures and two happy voices oh and ah together  so when rose opened her eyes that day they fell upon faithful phebe rolled up in a shawl sitting on the rug before a blazing fire with her untouched stocking laid beside her  merry christmas cried the little mistress smiling gaily  merry christmas answered the little maid so heartily that it did one good to hear her  bring the stockings right away phebe and lets see what weve got said rose sitting up among the pillows and looking as eager as a child  a pair of long knobby hose were laid out upon the coverlet and their contents examined with delight though each knew every blessed thing that had been put into the others stocking  never mind what they were it is evident that they were quite satisfactory for as rose leaned back she said with a luxurious sigh of satisfaction now i believe ive got everything in the world that i want and phebe answered smiling over a lapful of treasures this is the most splendid christmas i ever had since i was born then she added with an important air  do wish for something else because i happen to know of two more presents outside the door this minute  oh me what richness cried rose much excited i used to wish for a pair of glass slippers like cinderellas but as i cant have them i really dont know what to ask for  phebe clapped her hands as she skipped off the bed and ran to the door saying merrily one of them is for your feet anyway i dont know what youll say to the other but i think its elegant  so did rose when a shining pair of skates and a fine sled appeared  uncle sent those i know he did and now i see them i remember that i did want to skate and coast isnt it a beauty see they fit nicely and sitting on the new sled rose tried a skate on her little bare foot while phebe stood by admiring the pretty tableau  now we must hurry and get dressed for there is a deal to do today and i want to get through in time to try my sled before dinner  gracious me and i ought to be dusting my parlors this blessed minute and mistress and maid separated with such happy faces that anyone would have known what day it was without being told  birnam wood has come to dunsinane rosy said dr alec as he left the breakfast table to open the door for a procession of holly hemlock and cedar boughs that came marching up the steps  snowballs and merry christmases flew about pretty briskly for several minutes then all fell to work trimming the old house for the family always dined together there on that day  i rode miles and mileses as ben says to get this fine bit and im going to hang it there as the last touch to the rigamadooning said charlie as he fastened a dull green branch to the chandelier in the front parlor  it isnt very pretty said rose who was trimming the chimneypiece with glossy holly sprays  never mind that its mistletoe and anyone who stands under it will get kissed whether they like it or not nows your time ladies answered the saucy prince keeping his place and looking sentimentally at the girls who retired precipitately from the dangerous spot  you wont catch me said rose with great dignity  see if i dont  ive got my eye on phebe observed will in a patronising tone that made them all laugh  bless the dear i shant mind it a bit answered phebe with such a maternal air that wills budding gallantry was chilled to death  oh the mistletoe bough sang rose  oh the mistletoe bough echoed all the boys and the teasing ended in the plaintive ballad they all liked so well  there was plenty of time to try the new skates before dinner and then rose took her first lesson on the little bay which seemed to have frozen over for that express purpose she found tumbling down and getting up again warm work for a time but with six boys to teach her she managed at last to stand alone and satisfied with that success she refreshed herself with a dozen grand coasts on the amazon as her sled was called  ah that fatal colour it breaks my heart to see it croaked aunt myra as rose came down a little late with cheeks almost as ruddy as the holly berries on the wall and every curl as smooth as phebes careful hands could make it  im glad to see that alec allows the poor child to make herself pretty in spite of his absurd notions added aunt clara taking infinite satisfaction in the fact that roses blue silk dress had three frills on it  shes a very intelligent child and has a nice little manner of her own observed aunt jane with unusual affability for rose had just handed mac a screen to guard his eyes from the brilliant fire  if i had a daughter like that to show my jem when he gets home i should be a very proud and happy woman thought aunt jessie and then reproached herself for not being perfectly satisfied with her four brave lads  aunt plenty was too absorbed in the dinner to have an eye for anything else if she had not been she would have seen what an effect her new cap produced upon the boys the good lady owned that she did love a dressy cap and on this occasion her head gear was magnificent for the towering structure of lace was adorned with buff ribbons to such an extent that it looked as if a flock of yellow butterflies had settled on her dear old head when she trotted about the rooms the ruches quivered the little bows all stood erect and the streamers waved in the breeze so comically that it was absolutely necessary for archie to smother the brats in the curtains till they had had their first laugh out  uncle mac had brought fun see to dinner and it was a mercy he did for the elder lads found a vent for their merriment in joking the young chinaman on his improved appearance he was in american costume now with a cropped head and spoke remarkably good english after six months at school but for all that his yellow face and beady eyes made a curious contrast to the blonde campbells all about him will called him the typhoon meaning tycoon and the name stuck to him to his great disgust  aunt peace was brought down and set in the chair of state at table for she never failed to join the family on this day and sat smiling at them all like an embodiment of peace on earth uncle alec said as he took his place beside her while uncle mac supported aunt plenty at the other end  i ate hardly any breakfast and ive done everything i know to make myself extra hungry but i really dont think i can eat straight through unless i burst my buttons off whispered geordie to will as he surveyed the bounteous stores before him with a hopeless sigh  a fellow never knows what he can do till he tries answered will attacking his heapedup plate with an evident intention of doing his duty like a man  everybody knows what a christmas dinner is so we need waste no words in describing this one but hasten at once to tell what happened at the end of it the end by the way was so long in coming that the gas was lighted before dessert was over for a snow flurry had come on and the wintry daylight faded fast but that only made it all the jollier in the warm bright rooms full of happy souls everyone was very merry but archie seemed particularly uplifted so much so that charlie confided to rose that he was afraid the chief had been at the decanters  rose indignantly denied the insinuation for when healths were drunk in the good oldfashioned way to suit the elders she had observed that aunt jessies boys filled their glasses with water and had done the same herself in spite of the princes jokes about the rosy  but archie certainly was unusually excited and when someone remembered that it was the anniversary of uncle jems wedding and wished he was there to make a speech his son electrified the family by trying to do it for him it was rather incoherent and flowery as maiden speeches are apt to be but the end was considered superb for turning to his mother with a queer little choke in his voice he said that she deserved to be blessed with peace and plenty to be crowned with roses and ladslove and to receive the cargo of happiness sailing home to her in spite of wind or tide to add another jem to the family jewels  that allusion to the captain now on his return trip made mrs jessie sob in her napkin and set the boys cheering then as if that was not sensation enough archie suddenly dashed out of the room as if he had lost his wits  too bashful to stay and be praised began charlie excusing the peculiarities of his chief as in duty bound  phebe beckoned to him i saw her cried rose staring hard at the door  is it more presents coming asked jamie just as his brother reappeared looking more excited than ever  yes a present for mother and here it is roared archie flinging wide the door to let in a tall man who cried out  wheres my little woman the first kiss for her then the rest may come on as fast as they like  before the words were out of his mouth mrs jessie was halfhidden under his rough greatcoat and four boys were prancing about him clamouring for their turn  of course there was a joyful tumult for a time during which rose slipped into the window recess and watched what went on as if it were a chapter in a christmas story it was good to see bluff uncle jem look proudly at his tall son and fondly hug the little ones it was better still to see him shake his brothers hands as if he would never leave off and kiss all the sisters in a way that made even solemn aunt myra brighten up for a minute but it was best of all to see him finally established in grandfathers chair with his little woman beside him his three youngest boys in his lap and archie hovering over him like a largesized cherub that really was as charlie said a landscape to do ones heart good  all hearty and all here thank god said captain jem in the first pause that came as he looked about him with a grateful face  all but rose answered loyal little jamie remembering the absent  faith i forgot the child where is georges little girl asked the captain who had not seen her since she was a baby  youd better say alecs great girl said uncle mac who professed to be madly jealous of his brother  here i am sir and rose appeared from behind the curtains looking as if she had rather have stayed there  saint george germain how the mite has grown cried captain jem as he tumbled the boys out of his lap and rose to greet the tall girl like a gentleman as he was but somehow when he shook her hand it looked so small in his big one and her face reminded him so strongly of his dead brother that he was not satisfied with so cold a welcome and with a sudden softening of the keen eyes he took her up in his arms whispering with a rough cheek against her smooth one  god bless you child forgive me if i forgot you for a minute and be sure that not one of your kinsfolk is happier to see you here than uncle jem  that made it all right and when he set her down roses face was so bright it was evident that some spell had been used to banish the feeling of neglect that had kept her moping behind the curtain so long  that everyone sat round and heard all about the voyage home how the captain had set his heart on getting there in time to keep christmas how everything had conspired to thwart his plan and how at the very last minute he had managed to do it and had sent a telegram to archie bidding him keep the secret and be ready for his father at any moment for the ship got into another port and he might be late  then archie told how that telegram had burnt in his pocket all dinnertime how he had to take phebe into his confidence and how clever she was to keep the captain back till the speech was over and he could come in with effect  the elders would have sat and talked all the evening but the young folks were bent on having their usual christmas frolic so after an hour of pleasant chat they began to get restless and having consulted together in dumb show they devised a way to very effectually break up the family council  steve vanished and sooner than the boys imagined dandy could get himself up the skirl of the bagpipe was heard in the hall and the bonny piper came to lead clan campbell to the revel  draw it mild stevie my man ye play unco weel but ye mak a most infernal din cried uncle jem with his hands over his ears for this accomplishment was new to him and took him all aback as he expressed it  so steve droned out a highland reel as softly as he could and the boys danced it to a circle of admiring relations captain jem was a true sailor however and could not stand idle while anything lively was going on so when the pipers breath gave out he cut a splendid pigeonwing into the middle of the hall saying who can dance a fore and after and waiting for no reply began to whistle the air so invitingly that mrs jessie set to him laughing like a girl rose and charlie took their places behind and away went the four with a spirit and skill that inspired all the rest to cut in as fast as they could  that was a grand beginning and they had many another dance before anyone would own they were tired even fun see distinguished himself with aunt plenty whom he greatly admired as the stoutest lady in the company plumpness being considered a beauty in his country the merry old soul professed herself immensely flattered by his admiration and the boys declared she set her cap at him else he would never have dared to catch her under the mistletoe and rising on the tips of his own toes gallantly salute her fat cheek  how they all laughed at her astonishment and how funs little black eyes twinkled over this exploit charlie put him up to it and charlie was so bent on catching rose that he laid all sorts of pitfalls for her and bribed the other lads to help him but rose was wideawake and escaped all his snares professing great contempt for such foolish customs poor phebe did not fare so well and archie was the only one who took a base advantage of her as she stood innocently offering tea to aunt myra whom she happened to meet just under the fatal bough if his fathers arrival had not rather upset him i doubt if the dignified chief would have done it for he apologized at once in the handsomest manner and caught the tray that nearly dropped from phebes hands  jamie boldly invited all the ladies to come and salute him and as for uncle jem he behaved as if the entire room was a grove of mistletoe uncle alec slyly laid a bit of it on aunt peaces cap and then softly kissed her which little joke seemed to please her very much for she liked to have part in all the home pastimes and alec was her favourite nephew  charlie alone failed to catch his shy bird and the oftener she escaped the more determined he was to ensnare her when every other wile had been tried in vain he got archie to propose a game with forfeits  i understand that dodge thought rose and was on her guard so carefully that not one among the pile soon collected belonged to her  now let us redeem them and play something else said will quite unconscious of the deeplylaid plots all about him  one more round and then we will answered the prince who had now baited his trap anew  just as the question came to rose jamies voice was heard in the hall crying distressfully oh come quick quick rose started up missed the question and was greeted with a general cry of forfeit forfeit in which the little traitor came to join  now ive got her thought the young rascal exulting in his funloving soul  now im lost thought rose as she gave up her pincushion with a sternly defiant look that would have daunted anyone but the reckless prince in fact it made even him think twice and resolve to let rose off easy she had been so clever  heres a very pretty pawn and what shall be done to redeem it asked steve holding the pincushion over charlies head for he had insisted on being judge and kept that for the last  fine or superfine  super  hum well she shall take old mac under the mistletoe and kiss him prettily wont he be mad though and this bad boy chuckled over the discomfort he had caused two harmless beings  there was an impressive pause among the young folks in their corner for they all knew that mac would be mad since he hated nonsense of this sort and had gone to talk with the elders when the game began at this moment he was standing before the fire listening to a discussion between his uncles and his father looking as wise as a young owl and blissfully unconscious of the plots against him  charlie expected that rose would say i wont therefore he was rather astonished not to say gratified when after a look at the victim she laughed suddenly and going up to the group of gentlemen drew her uncle mac under the mistletoe and surprised him with a hearty kiss  thank you my dear said the innocent gentleman looking much pleased at the unexpected honour  oh come thats not fair began charlie but rose cut him short by saying as she made him a fine courtesy  you said old mac and though it was very disrespectful i did it that was your last chance sir and youve lost it  he certainly had for as he spoke rose pulled down the mistletoe and threw it into the fire while the boys jeered at the crestfallen prince and exalted quickwitted rose to the skies  whats the joke asked young mac waked out of a brown study by the laughter in which the elders joined  but there was a regular shout when the matter having been explained to him mac took a meditative stare at rose through his goggles and said in a philosophical tone well i dont think i should have minded much if she had done it  that tickled the lads immensely and nothing but the appearance of a slight refection would have induced them to stop chaffing the poor worm who could not see anything funny in the beautiful resignation he had shown on this trying occasion  soon after this the discovery of jamie curled up in the sofa corner as sound asleep as a dormouse suggested the propriety of going home and a general move was made  they were all standing about the hall lingering over the goodnights when the sound of a voice softly singing sweet home made them pause and listen it was phebe poor little phebe who never had a home never knew the love of father or mother brother or sister who stood all alone in the wide world yet was not sad nor afraid but took her bits of happiness gratefully and sung over her work without a thought of discontent  i fancy the happy family standing there together remembered this and felt the beauty of it for when the solitary voice came to the burden of its song other voices took it up and finished it so sweetly that the old house seemed to echo the word home in the ears of both the orphan girls who had just spent their first christmas under its hospitable roof    chapter 21a scare  brother alec you surely dont mean to allow that child to go out such a bitter cold day as this said mrs myra looking into the study where the doctor sat reading his paper one february morning  why not if a delicate invalid like yourself can bear it surely my hearty girl can especially as she is dressed for cold weather answered dr alec with provoking confidence  but you have no idea how sharp the wind is i am chilled to the very marrow of my bones answered aunt myra chafing the end of her purple nose with her sombre glove  i dont doubt it maam if you will wear crape and silk instead of fur and flannel rosy goes out in all weathers and will be none the worse for an hours brisk skating  well i warn you that you are trifling with the childs health and depending too much on the seeming improvement she has made this year she is a delicate creature for all that and will drop away suddenly at the first serious attack as her poor mother did croaked aunt myra with a despondent wag of the big bonnet  ill risk it answered dr alec knitting his brows as he always did when any allusion was made to that other rose  mark my words you will repent it and with that awful prophecy aunt myra departed like a black shadow  now it must be confessed that among the doctors failings and he had his share was a very masculine dislike of advice which was thrust upon him unasked he always listened with respect to the greataunts and often consulted mrs jessie but the other three ladies tried his patience sorely by constant warnings complaints and counsels aunt myra was an especial trial and he always turned contrary the moment she began to talk he could not help it and often laughed about it with comic frankness here now was a sample of it for he had just been thinking that rose had better defer her run till the wind went down and the sun was warmer but aunt myra spoke and he could not resist the temptation to make light of her advice and let rose brave the cold he had no fear of its harming her for she went out every day and it was a great satisfaction to him to see her run down the avenue a minute afterward with her skates on her arm looking like a rosyfaced esquimaux in her sealskin suit as she smiled at aunt myra stalking along as solemnly as a crow  i hope the child wont stay out long for this wind is enough to chill the marrow in younger bones than myras thought dr alec half an hour later as he drove toward the city to see the few patients he had consented to take for old acquaintance sake  the thought returned several times that morning for it was truly a bitter day and in spite of his bearskin coat the doctor shivered but he had great faith in roses good sense and it never occurred to him that she was making a little casabianca of herself with the difference of freezing instead of burning at her post  you see mac had made an appointment to meet her at a certain spot and have a grand skating bout as soon as the few lessons he was allowed were over she had promised to wait for him and did so with a faithfulness that cost her dear because mac forgot his appointment when the lessons were done and became absorbed in a chemical experiment till a general combustion of gases drove him out of his laboratory then he suddenly remembered rose and would gladly have hurried away to her but his mother forbade his going out for the sharp wind would hurt his eyes  she will wait and wait mother for she always keeps her word and i told her to hold on till i came explained mac with visions of a shivering little figure watching on the windy hilltop  of course your uncle wont let her go out such a day as this if he does she will have the sense to come here for you or to go home again when you dont appear said aunt jane returning to her watts on the mind  i wish steve would just cut up and see if shes there since i cant go began mac anxiously  steve wont stir a peg thank you hes got his own toes to thaw out and wants his dinner answered dandy just in from school and wrestling impatiently with his boots  so mac resigned himself and rose waited dutifully till dinnertime assured her that her waiting was in vain she had done her best to keep warm had skated till she was tired and hot then stood watching others till she was chilled tried to get up a glow again by trotting up and down the road but failed to do so and finally cuddled disconsolately under a pinetree to wait and watch when she at length started for home she was benumbed with cold and could hardly make her way against the wind that buffeted the frostbitten rose most unmercifully  dr alec was basking in the warmth of the study fire after his drive when the sound of a stifled sob made him hurry to the door and look anxiously into the hall rose lay in a shivering bunch near the register with her things half off wringing her hands and trying not to cry with the pain returning warmth brought to her halffrozen fingers  my darling what is it and uncle alec had her in his arms in a minute  mac didnt come i cant get warm the fire makes me ache and with a long shiver rose burst out crying while her teeth chattered and her poor little nose was so blue it made ones heart ache to see it  in less time than it takes to tell it dr alec had her on the sofa rolled up in the bearskin coat with phebe rubbing her cold feet while he rubbed the aching hands and aunt plenty made a comfortable hot drink and aunt peace sent down her own footwarmer and embroidered blanket for the dear  full of remorseful tenderness uncle alec worked over his new patient till she declared she was all right again he would not let her get up to dinner but fed her himself and then forgot his own while he sat watching her fall into a drowse for aunt plentys cordial made her sleepy  she lay so several hours for the drowse deepened into a heavy sleep and uncle alec still at his post saw with growing anxiety that a feverish colour began to burn in her cheeks that her breathing was quick and uneven and now and then she gave a little moan as if in pain suddenly she woke up with a start and seeing aunt plenty bending over her put out her arms like a sick child saying wearily  please could i go to bed  the best place for you deary take her right up alec ive got the hot water ready and after a nice bath she shall have a cup of my sage tea and be rolled up in blankets to sleep off her cold answered the old lady cheerily as she bustled away to give orders  are you in pain darling asked uncle alec as he carried her up  my side aches when i breathe and i feel stiff and queer but it isnt bad so dont be troubled uncle whispered rose with a little hot hand against his cheek  but the poor doctor did look troubled and had cause to do so for just then rose tried to laugh at dolly charging into the room with a warmingpan but could not for the sharp pain took her breath away and made her cry out  pleurisy sighed aunt plenty from the depths of the bathtub  pewmonia groaned dolly burrowing among the bedclothes with the longhandled pan as if bent on fishing up that treacherous disease  oh is it bad asked phebe nearly dropping a pail of hot water in her dismay for she knew nothing of sickness and dollys suggestion had a peculiarly dreadful sound to her  hush ordered the doctor in a tone that silenced all further predictions and made everyone work with a will  make her as comfortable as you can and when she is in her little bed ill come and say goodnight he added when the bath was ready and the blankets browning nicely before the fire  then he went away to talk quite cheerfully to aunt peace about its being only a chill after which he tramped up and down the hall pulling his beard and knitting his brows sure signs of great inward perturbation  i thought it would be too good luck to get through the year without a downfall confound my perversity why couldnt i take myras advice and keep rose at home its not fair that the poor child should suffer for my sinful overconfidence she shall not suffer for it pneumonia indeed i defy it and he shook his fist in the ugly face of an indian idol that happened to be before him as if that particularly hideous god had some spite against his own little goddess  in spite of his defiance his heart sunk when he saw rose again for the pain was worse and the bath and blankets the warmingpan and pipinghot sage tea were all in vain for several hours there was no rest for the poor child and all manner of gloomy forebodings haunted the minds of those who hovered about her with faces full of the tenderest anxiety  in the midst of the worst paroxysm charlie came to leave a message from his mother and was met by phebe coming despondently downstairs with a mustard plaster that had brought no relief  what the dickens is the matter you look as dismal as a tombstone he said as she held up her hand to stop his lively whistling  miss rose is dreadful sick  the deuce she is  dont swear mr charlie she really is and its mr macs fault and phebe told the sad tale in a few sharp words for she felt at war with the entire race of boys at that moment  ill give it to him make your mind easy about that said charlie with an ominous doubling up of his fist but rose isnt dangerously ill is she he added anxiously as aunt plenty was seen to trot across the upper hall shaking a bottle violently as she went  oh but she is though the doctor dont say much but he dont call it a chill any more its pleurisy now and im so afraid it will be pewmonia tomorrow answered phebe with a despairing glance at the plaster  charlie exploded into a stifled laugh at the new pronunciation of pneumonia to phebes great indignation  how can you have the heart to do it and she in such horrid pain hark to that and then laugh if you darst she said with a tragic gesture and her black eyes full of fire  charlie listened and heard little moans that went to his heart and made his face as sober as phebes o uncle please stop the pain and let me rest a minute dont tell the boys i wasnt brave i try to bear it but its so sharp i cant help crying  neither could charlie when he heard the broken voice say that but boylike he wouldnt own it and said pettishly as he rubbed his sleeve across his eyes  dont hold that confounded thing right under my nose the mustard makes my eyes smart  dont see how it can when it hasnt any more strength in it than meal the doctor said so and im going to get some better began phebe not a bit ashamed of the great tears that were bedewing the condemned plaster  ill go and charlie was off like a shot glad of an excuse to get out of sight for a few minutes  when he came back all inconvenient emotion had been disposed of and having delivered a box of the hottest mustard procurable for money he departed to blow up mac that being his next duty in his opinion he did it so energetically and thoroughly that the poor worm was cast into the depths of remorseful despair and went to bed that evening feeling that he was an outcast from among men and bore the mark of cain upon his brow  thanks to the skill of the doctor and the devotion of his helpers rose grew easier about midnight and all hoped that the worst was over phebe was making tea by the study fire for the doctor had forgotten to eat and drink since rose was ill and aunt plenty insisted on his having a good cordial dish of tea after his exertions a tap on the window startled phebe and looking up she saw a face peering in she was not afraid for a second look showed her that it was neither ghost nor burglar but mac looking pale and wild in the wintry moonlight  come and let a fellow in he said in a low tone and when he stood in the hall he clutched phebes arm whispering gruffly how is rose  thanks be to goodness shes better answered phebe with a smile that was like broad sunshine to the poor lads anxious heart  and she will be all right again tomorrow  oh dear no dolly says shes sure to have rheumatic fever if she dont have noomonia answered phebe careful to pronounce the word rightly this time  down went macs face and remorse began to gnaw at him again as he gave a great sigh and said doubtfully  i suppose i couldnt see her  of course not at this time of night when we want her to go to sleep  mac opened his mouth to say something more when a sneeze came upon him unawares and a loud ah rash hoo awoke the echoes of the quiet house  why didnt you stop it said phebe reproachfully i dare say youve waked her up  didnt know it was coming just my luck groaned mac turning to go before his unfortunate presence did more harm  but a voice from the stairhead called softly mac come up rose wants to see you  up he went and found his uncle waiting for him  what brings you here at this hour my boy asked the doctor in a whisper  charlie said it was all my fault and if she died id killed her i couldnt sleep so i came to see how she was and no one knows it but steve he said with such a troubled face and voice that the doctor had not the heart to blame him  before he could say anything more a feeble voice called mac and with a hasty stay a minute just to please her and then slip away for i want her to sleep the doctor led him into the room  the face on the pillow looked very pale and childish and the smile that welcomed mac was very faint for rose was spent with pain yet could not rest till she had said a word of comfort to her cousin  i knew your funny sneeze and i guessed that you came to see how i did though it is very late dont be worried im better now and it is my fault i was ill not yours for i neednt have been so silly as to wait in the cold just because i said i would  mac hastened to explain to load himself with reproaches and to beg her not to die on any account for charlies lecture had made a deep impression on the poor boys mind  i didnt know there was any danger of my dying and rose looked up at him with a solemn expression in her great eyes  oh i hope not but people do sometimes go suddenly you know and i couldnt rest till id asked you to forgive me faltered mac thinking that rose looked very like an angel already with the golden hair loose on the pillow and the meekness of suffering on her little white face  i dont think i shall die uncle wont let me but if i do remember i forgave you  she looked at him with a tender light in her eyes and seeing how pathetic his dumb grief was she added softly drawing his head down i wouldnt kiss you under the mistletoe but i will now for i want you to be sure i do forgive and love you just the same  that quite upset poor mac he could only murmur his thanks and get out of the room as fast as possible to grope his way to the couch at the far end of the hall and lie there till he fell asleep worn out with trying not to make a baby of himself    chapter 22something to do  whatever danger there might have been from the effects of that sudden chill it was soon over though of course aunt myra refused to believe it and dr alec cherished his girl with redoubled vigilance and tenderness for months afterward rose quite enjoyed being sick because as soon as the pain ended the fun began and for a week or two she led the life of a little princess secluded in the bower while every one served amused and watched over her in the most delightful manner but the doctor was called away to see an old friend who was dangerously ill and then rose felt like a young bird deprived of its mothers sheltering wing especially on one afternoon when the aunts were taking their naps and the house was very still within while snow fell softly without  ill go and hunt up phebe she is always nice and busy and likes to have me help her if dolly is out of the way we can make caramels and surprise the boys when they come rose said to herself as she threw down her book and felt ready for society of some sort  she took the precaution to peep through the slide before she entered the kitchen for dolly allowed no messing when she was round but the coast was clear and no one but phebe appeared sitting at the table with her head on her arms apparently asleep rose was just about to wake her with a boo when she lifted her head dried her wet eyes with her blue apron and fell to work with a resolute face on something she was evidently much interested in rose could not make out what it was and her curiosity was greatly excited for phebe was writing with a sputtering pen on some bits of brown paper apparently copying something from a little book  i must know what the dear thing is about and why she cried and then set her lips tight and went to work with all her might thought rose forgetting all about the caramels and going round to the door she entered the kitchen saying pleasantly  phebe i want something to do cant you let me help you about anything or shall i be in the way  oh dear no miss i always love to have you round when things are tidy what would you like to do answered phebe opening a drawer as if about to sweep her own affairs out of sight but rose stopped her exclaiming like a curious child  let me see what is it i wont tell if youd rather not have dolly know  im only trying to study a bit but im so stupid i dont get on much answered the girl reluctantly permitting her little mistress to examine the poor contrivances she was trying to work with  a broken slate that had blown off the roof an inch or two of pencil an old almanac for a reader several bits of brown or yellow paper ironed smoothly and sewn together for a copybook and the copies sundry receipts written in aunt plentys neat hand these with a small bottle of ink and a rusty pen made up phebes outfit and it was little wonder that she did not get on in spite of the patient persistence that dried the desponding tears and drove along the sputtering pen with a will  you may laugh if you want to miss rose i know my things are queer and thats why i hide em but i dont mind since youve found me out and i aint a bit ashamed except of being so backward at my age said phebe humbly though her cheeks grew redder as she washed out some crooked capitals with a tear or two not yet dried upon the slate  laugh at you i feel more like crying to think what a selfish girl i am to have loads of books and things and never remember to give you some why didnt you come and ask me and not go struggling along alone in this way it was very wrong of you phebe and ill never forgive you if you do so again answered rose with one hand on phebes shoulder while the other gently turned the leaves of the poor little copybook  i didnt like to ask for anything more when you are so good to me all the time miss dear began phebe looking up with grateful eyes  o you proud thing just as if it wasnt fun to give away and i had the best of it now see here ive got a plan and you mustnt say no or i shall scold i want something to do and im going to teach you all i know it wont take long and rose laughed as she put her arm around phebes neck and patted the smooth dark head with the kind little hand that so loved to give  it would be just heavenly and phebes face shone at the mere idea but fell again as she added wistfully only im afraid i ought not to let you do it miss rose it will take time and maybe the doctor wouldnt like it  he didnt want me to study much but he never said a word about teaching and i dont believe he will mind a bit anyway we can try it till he comes so pack up your things and go right to my room and well begin this very day id truly like to do it and well have nice times see if we dont cried rose eagerly  it was a pretty sight to see phebe bundle her humble outfit into her apron and spring up as if the desire of her heart had suddenly been made a happy fact to her it was a still prettier sight to see rose run gaily on before smiling like a good fairy as she beckoned to the other singing as she went      the way into my parlour is up a winding stair      and many are the curious things ill show you when youre there      will you will you walk in phebe dear  oh wont i answered phebe fervently adding as they entered the bower you are the dearest spider that ever was and im the happiest fly  im going to be very strict so sit down in that chair and dont say a word till school is ready to open ordered rose delighted with the prospect of such a useful and pleasant something to do  so phebe sat demurely in her place while her new teacher laid forth books and slates a pretty inkstand and a little globe hastily tore a bit off her big sponge sharpened pencils with more energy than skill and when all was ready gave a prance of satisfaction that set the pupil laughing  now the school is open and i shall hear you read so that i may know in which class to put you miss moore began rose with great dignity as she laid a book before her scholar and sat down in the easy chair with a long rule in her hand  phebe did pretty well only tripping now and then over a hard word and pronouncing identical identickle in a sober way that tickled rose though never a smile betrayed her the spelling lesson which followed was rather discouraging phebes ideas of geography were very vague and grammar was nowhere though the pupil protested that she tried so hard to talk nice like educated folks that dolly called her a stuckup piece who didnt know her place  dollys an old goose so dont you mind her for she will say nater vittles and doos as long as she lives and insist that they are right you do talk very nicely phebe ive observed it and grammar will help you and show you some things are right and others aint are not i mean added rose correcting herself and feeling that she must mind her own parts of speech if she was to serve as an example for phebe  when the arithmetic came the little teacher was surprised to find her scholar quicker in some things than herself for phebe had worked away at the columns in the butchers and bakers books till she could add so quickly and correctly that rose was amazed and felt that in this branch the pupil would soon excel the teacher if she kept on at the same pace her praise cheered phebe immensely and they went bravely on both getting so interested that time flew unheeded till aunt plenty appeared exclaiming as she stared at the two heads bent over one slate  bless my heart what is going on now  school aunty im teaching phebe and its great fun cried rose looking up with a bright face  but phebes was brighter though she added with a wistful look  maybe i ought to have asked leave first only when miss rose proposed this i was so happy i forgot to shall i stop maam  of course not child im glad to see you fond of your book and to find rose helping you along my blessed mother used to sit at work with her maids about her teaching them many a useful thing in the good old fashion thats gone by now only dont neglect your work dear or let the books interfere with the duties  as aunt plenty spoke with her kind old face beaming approvingly upon the girls phebe glanced at the clock saw that it pointed to five knew that dolly would soon be down expecting to find preparations for supper under way and hastily dropping her pencil she jumped up saying  please can i go ill clear up after ive done my chores  school is dismissed answered rose and with a grateful thank you heaps and heaps phebe ran away singing the multiplication table as she set the tea ditto  that was the way it began and for a week the class of one went on with great pleasure and profit to all concerned for the pupil proved a bright one and came to her lessons as to a feast while the young teacher did her best to be worthy the high opinion held of her for phebe firmly believed that miss rose knew everything in the way of learning  of course the lads found out what was going on and chaffed the girls about the seminary as they called the new enterprise but they thought it a good thing on the whole kindly offered to give lessons in greek and latin gratis and decided among themselves that rose was a little trump to give the phebebird such a capital boost  rose herself had some doubts as to how it would strike her uncle and concocted a wheedlesome speech which should at once convince him that it was the most useful wholesome and delightful plan ever devised but she got no chance to deliver her address for dr alec came upon her so unexpectedly that it went out of her head entirely she was sitting on the floor in the library poring over a big book laid open in her lap and knew nothing of the longdesired arrival till two large warm hands met under her chin and gently turned her head back so that someone could kiss her heartily on either cheek while a fatherly voice said half reproachfully why is my girl brooding over a dusty encyclopedia when she ought to be running to meet the old gentleman who couldnt get on another minute without her  o uncle im so glad and so sorry why didnt you let us know what time youd be here or call out the minute you came havent i been homesick for you and now im so happy to have you back i could hug your dear old curly head off cried rose as the encyclopedia went down with a bang and she up with a spring that carried her into dr alecs arms to be kept there in the sort of embrace a man gives to the dearest creature the world holds for him  presently he was in his easy chair with rose upon his knee smiling up in his face and talking as fast as her tongue could go while he watched her with an expression of supreme content as he stroked the smooth round cheek or held the little hand in his rejoicing to see how rosy was the one how plump and strong the other  have you had a good time did you save the poor lady arent you glad to be home again with your girl to torment you  yes to all those questions now tell me what youve been at little sinner aunty plen says you want to consult me about some new and remarkable project which you have dared to start in my absence  she didnt tell you i hope  not a word more expect that you were rather doubtful how id take it and so wanted to fess yourself and get round me as you always try to do though you dont often succeed now then own up and take the consequences  so rose told about her school in her pretty earnest way dwelling on phebes hunger for knowledge and the delight it was to help her adding with a wise nod  and it helps me too uncle for she is so quick and eager i have to do my best or she will get ahead of me in some things today now she had the word cotton in a lesson and asked all about it and i was ashamed to find i really knew so little that i could only say that it was a plant that grew down south in a kind of a pod and was made into cloth thats what i was reading up when you came and tomorrow i shall tell her all about it and indigo too so you see it teaches me also and is as good as a general review of what ive learned in a pleasanter way than going over it alone  you artful little baggage thats the way you expect to get round me is it thats not studying i suppose  no sir its teaching and please i like it much better than having a good time by myself besides you know i adopted phebe and promised to be a sister to her so i am bound to keep my word am i not answered rose looking both anxious and resolute as she waited for her sentence  dr alec was evidently already won for rose had described the old slate and brown paper copybook with pathetic effect and the excellent man had not only decided to send phebe to school long before the story was done but reproached himself for forgetting his duty to one little girl in his love for another so when rose tried to look meek and failed utterly he laughed and pinched her cheek and answered in that genial way which adds such warmth and grace to any favour  i havent the slightest objection in the world in fact i was beginning to think i might let you go at your books again moderately since you are so well and this is an excellent way to try your powers phebe is a brave bright lass and shall have a fair chance in the world if we can give it to her so that if she ever finds her friends they need not be ashamed of her  i think she has found some already began rose eagerly  hey what has anyone turned up since ive been gone asked dr alec quickly for it was a firm belief in the family that phebe would prove to be somebody sooner or later  no her best friend turned up when you came home uncle answered rose with an approving pat adding gratefully i cant half thank you for being so good to my girl but she will because i know she is going to make a woman to be proud of shes so strong and true and loving  bless your dear heart i havent begun to do anything yet more shame to me but im going at it now and as soon as she gets on a bit she shall go to school as long as she likes how will that do for a beginning  it will be just heavenly as phebe says for it is the wish of her life to get lots of schooling and she will be too happy when i tell her may i please it will be so lovely to see the dear thing open her big eyes and clap her hands at the splendid news  no one shall have a finger in this nice little pie you shall do it all yourself only dont go too fast or make too many castles in the air my dear for time and patience must go into this pie of ours if it is to turn out well  yes uncle only when it is opened wont the birds begin to sing laughed rose taking a turn about the room as a vent for the joyful emotions that made her eyes shine all of a sudden she stopped and asked soberly  if phebe goes to school who will do her work im willing if i can  come here and ill tell you a secret dollys bones are getting so troublesome and her dear old temper so bad that the aunts have decided to pension her off and let her go and live with her daughter who has married very well i saw her this week and shed like to have her mother come so in the spring we shall have a grand change and get a new cook and chambergirl if any can be found to suit our honoured relatives  oh me how can i ever get on without phebe couldnt she stay just so i could see her id pay her board rather than have her go im so fond of her  how dr alec laughed at that proposal and how satisfied rose was when he explained that phebe was still to be her maid with no duties except such as she could easily perform between schoolhours  she is a proud creature for all her humble ways and even from us would not take a favour if she did not earn it somewhere so this arrangement makes it all square and comfortable you see and she will pay for the schooling by curling these goldilocks a dozen times a day if you let her  your plans are always so wise and kind thats why they work so well i suppose and why people let you do what you like with them i really dont see how other girls get along without an uncle alec answered rose with a sigh of pity for those who had missed so great a blessing  when phebe was told the splendid news she did not stand on her head with rapture as charlie prophesied she would but took it quietly because it was such a happy thing she had no words big and beautiful enough to thank them in she said but every hour of her day was brightened by this granted wish and dedicated to the service of those who gave it  her heart was so full of content that if overflowed in music and the sweet voice singing all about the house gave thanks so blithely that no other words were needed her willing feet were never tired of taking steps for those who had smoothed her way her skilful hands were always busy in some labour of love for them and on the face fast growing in comeliness there was an almost womanly expression of devotion which proved how well phebe had already learned one of lifes great lessons gratitude    chapter 23peacemaking  steve i want you to tell me something said rose to dandy who was making faces at himself in the glass while he waited for an answer to the note he brought from his mother to aunt plenty  praps i will and praps i wont what is it  havent arch and charlie quarrelled  dare say we fellows are always having little rows you know i do believe a sty is coming on my starboard eye and steve affected to be absorbed in a survey of his yellow lashes  no that wont do i want to know all about it for im sure something more serious than a little row is the matter come please tell me stenie theres a dear  botheration you dont want me to turn telltale do you growled steve pulling his topknot as he always did when perplexed  yes i do was roses decided answer for she saw from his manner that she was right and determined to have the secret out of him if coaxing would do it i dont wish you to tell things to everyone of course but to me you may and you must because i have a right to know you boys need somebody to look after you and im going to do it for girls are nice peacemakers and know how to manage people uncle said so and he is never wrong  steve was about to indulge in a derisive hoot at the idea of her looking after them but a sudden thought restrained him and suggested a way in which he could satisfy rose and better himself at the same time  what will you give me if ill tell you every bit about it he asked with a sudden red in his cheeks and an uneasy look in his eyes for he was half ashamed of the proposition  what do you want and rose looked up rather surprised at his question  id like to borrow some money i shouldnt think of asking you only mac never has a cent since hes set up his old chemical shop where hell blow himself to bits some day and you and uncle will have the fun of putting him together again and steve tried to look as if the idea amused him  ill lend it to you with pleasure so tell away said rose bound to get at the secret  evidently much relieved by the promise steve set his topknot cheerfully erect again and briefly stated the case  as you say its all right to tell you but dont let the boys know i blabbed or prince will take my head off you see archie dont like some of the fellows charlie goes with and cuts em that makes prince mad and he holds on just to plague arch so they dont speak to one another if they can help it and thats the row  are those boys bad asked rose anxiously  guess not only rather wild they are older than our fellows but they like prince hes such a jolly boy sings so well dances jigs and breakdowns you know and plays any game thats going he beat morse at billiards and thats something to brag of for morse thinks he knows everything i saw the match and it was great fun  steve got quite excited over the prowess of charlie whom he admired immensely and tried to imitate rose did not know half the danger of such gifts and tastes as charlies but felt instinctively that something must be wrong if archie disapproved  if prince likes any billiardplaying boy better than archie i dont think much of his sense she said severely  of course he doesnt but you see charlie and arch are both as proud as they can be and wont give in i suppose arch is right but i dont blame charlie a bit for liking to be with the others sometimes they are such a jolly set and steve shook his head morally even while his eye twinkled over the memory of some of the exploits of the jolly set  oh dear me sighed rose i dont see what i can do about it but i wish the boys would make up for prince cant come to any harm with archie hes so good and sensible  thats the trouble arch preaches and prince wont stand it he told arch he was a prig and a parson and arch told him he wasnt a gentleman my boots werent they both mad though i thought for a minute theyd pitch into one another and have it out wish they had and not gone stalking round stiff and glum ever since mac and i settle our rows with a bat or so over the head and then we are all right  rose couldnt help laughing as steve sparred away at a fat sofapillow to illustrate his meaning and having given it several scientific whacks he pulled down his cuffs and smiled upon her with benign pity for her feminine ignorance of this summary way of settling a quarrel  what droll things boys are she said with a mixture of admiration and perplexity in her face which steve accepted as a compliment to his sex  were a pretty clever invention miss and you cant get on without us he answered with his nose in the air then taking a sudden plunge into business he added how about that bit of money you were going to lend me ive told now you pay up  of course i will how much do you want and rose pulled out her purse  could you spare five dollars i want to pay a little debt of honour that is rather pressing and steve put on a mannish air that was comical to see  arent all debts honourable asked innocent rose  yes of course but this is a bet i made and it ought to be settled up at once began steve finding it awkward to explain  oh dont bet its not right and i know your father wouldnt like it promise you wont do so again please promise and rose held fast the hand into which she had just put the money  well i wont its worried me a good deal but i was joked into it much obliged cousin im all right now and steve departed hastily  having decided to be a peacemaker rose waited for an opportunity and very soon it came  she was spending the day with aunt clara who had been entertaining some young guests and invited rose to meet them for she thought it high time her niece conquered her bashfulness and saw a little of society dinner was over and everyone had gone aunt clara was resting before going out to an evening party and rose was waiting for charlie to come and take her home  she sat alone in the elegant drawingroom feeling particularly nice and pretty for she had her best frock on a pair of gold bands her aunt had just given her and a tearose bud in her sash like the beautiful miss van tassel whom everyone admired she had spread out her little skirts to the best advantage and leaning back in a luxurious chair sat admiring her own feet in new slippers with rosettes almost as big as dahlias presently charlie came lounging in looking rather sleepy and queer rose thought on seeing her however he roused up and said with a smile that ended in a gape  i thought you were with mother so i took forty winks after i got those girls off now im at your service rosamunda whenever you like  you look as if your head ached if it does dont mind me im not afraid to run home alone its so early answered rose observing the flushed cheeks and heavy eyes of her cousin  i think i see myself letting you do it champagne always makes my headache but the air will set me up  why do you drink it then asked rose anxiously  cant help it when im host now dont you begin to lecture ive had enough of archies oldfashioned notions and i dont want any more  charlies tone was decidedly cross and his whole manner so unlike his usual merry goodnature that rose felt crushed and answered meekly  i wasnt going to lecture only when people like other people they cant bear to see them suffer pain  that brought charlie round at once for roses lips trembled a little though she tried to hide it by smelling the flower she pulled from her sash  im a regular bear and i beg your pardon for being so cross rosy he said in the old frank way that was so winning  i wish youd beg archies too and be good friends again you never were cross when he was your chum rose said looking up at him as he bent toward her from the low chimneypiece where he had been leaning his elbows  in an instant he stood as stiff and straight as a ramrod and the heavy eyes kindled with an angry spark as he said in his high and mighty manner  youd better not meddle with what you dont understand cousin  but i do understand and it troubles me very much to see you so cold and stiff to one another you always used to be together and now you hardly speak you are so ready to beg my pardon i dont see why you cant beg archies if you are in the wrong  im not this was so short and sharp that rose started and charlie added in a calmer but still very haughty tone a gentleman always begs pardon when he has been rude to a lady but one man doesnt apologize to another man who has insulted him  oh my heart what a pepperpot thought rose and hoping to make him laugh she added slyly i was not talking about men but boys and one of them a prince who ought to set a good example to his subjects  but charlie would not relent and tried to turn the subject by saying gravely as he unfastened the little gold ring from his watchguard  ive broken my word so i want to give this back and free you from the bargain im sorry but i think it a foolish promise and dont intend to keep it choose a pair of earrings to suit yourself as my forfeit you have a right to wear them now  no i can only wear one and that is no use for archie will keep his word im sure rose was so mortified and grieved at this downfall of her hopes that she spoke sharply and would not take the ring the deserter offered her  he shrugged his shoulders and threw it into her lap trying to look cool and careless but failing entirely for he was ashamed of himself and out of sorts generally rose wanted to cry but pride would not let her and being very angry she relieved herself by talk instead of tears looking pale and excited she rose out of her chair cast away the ring and said in a voice that she vainly tried to keep steady  you are not at all the boy i thought you were and i dont respect you one bit ive tried to help you be good but you wont let me and i shall not try any more you talk a great deal about being a gentleman but you are not for youve broken your word and i can never trust you again i dont wish you to go home with me id rather have mary goodnight  and with that last dreadful blow rose walked out of the room leaving charlie as much astonished as if one of his pet pigeons had flown in his face and pecked at him she was so seldom angry that when her temper did get the better of her it made a deep impression on the lads for it was generally a righteous sort of indignation at some injustice or wrongdoing not childish passion  her little thunderstorm cleared off in a sob or two as she put on her things in the entrycloset and when she emerged she looked the brighter for the shower a hasty goodnight to aunt clara now under the hands of the hairdresser and then she crept down to find mary the maid but mary was out so was the man and rose slipped away by the backdoor flattering herself that she had escaped the awkwardness of having charlie for escort  there she was mistaken however for the gate had hardly closed behind her when a wellknown tramp was heard and the prince was beside her saying in a tone of penitent politeness that banished roses wrath like magic  you neednt speak to me if you dont choose but i must see you safely home cousin  she turned at once put out her hand and answered heartily  i was the cross one please forgive me and lets be friends again  now that was better than a dozen sermons on the beauty of forgiveness and did charlie more good for it showed him how sweet humility was and proved that rose practised as she preached  he shook the hand warmly then drew it through his arm and said as if anxious to recover the good opinion with the loss of which he had been threatened  look here rosy ive put the ring back and im going to try again but you dont know how hard it is to stand being laughed at  yes i do ariadne plagues me every time i see her because i dont wear earrings after all the trouble i had getting ready for them  ah but her twaddle isnt half as bad as the chaffing i get it takes a deal of pluck to hold out when you are told you are tied to an apron string and all that sort of thing sighed charlie  i thought you had a deal of pluck as you call it the boys all say you are the bravest of the seven said rose  so i am about some things but i cannot bear to be laughed at  it is hard but if one is right wont that make it easier  not to me it might to a pious parson like arch  please dont call him names i guess he has what is called moral courage and you physical courage uncle explained the difference to me and moral is the best though often it doesnt look so said rose thoughtfully  charlie didnt like that and answered quickly i dont believe hed stand it any better than i do if he had those fellows at him  perhaps thats why he keeps out of their way and wants you to  rose had him there and charlie felt it but would not give in just yet though he was going fast for somehow in the dark he seemed to see things clearer than in the light and found it very easy to be confidential when it was only rose  if he was my brother now hed have some right to interfere began charlie in an injured tone  i wish he was cried rose  so do i answered charlie and then they both laughed at his inconsistency  the laugh did them good and when prince spoke again it was in a different tone pensive not proud nor perverse  you see its hard upon me that i have no brothers and sisters the others are better off and neednt go abroad for chums if they dont like i am all alone and id be thankful even for a little sister  rose thought that very pathetic and overlooking the uncomplimentary word even in that last sentence she said with a timid sort of earnestness that conquered her cousin at once  play i was a little sister i know im silly but perhaps im better than nothing and id dearly love to do it  so should i and we will for you are not silly my dear but a very sensible girl we all think and im proud to have you for a sister there now and charlie looked down at the curly head bobbing along beside him with real affection in his face  rose gave a skip of pleasure and laid one sealskin mitten over the other on his arm as she said happily  thats so nice of you now you neednt be lonely any more and ill try to fill archies place till he comes back for i know he will as soon as you let him  well i dont mind telling you that while he was my mate i never missed brothers and sisters or wanted anyone else but since he cast me off ill be hanged if i dont feel as forlorn as old crusoe before friday turned up  this burst of confidence confirmed rose in her purpose of winning charlies mentor back to him but she said no more contented to have done so well they parted excellent friends and prince went home wondering why a fellow didnt mind saying things to a girl or woman which they would die before theyd own to another fellow  rose also had some sage reflections upon the subject and fell asleep thinking that there were a great many curious things in this world and feeling that she was beginning to find out some of them  next day she trudged up the hill to see archie and having told him as much as she thought best about her talk with charlie begged him to forget and forgive  ive been thinking that perhaps i ought to though i am in the right im no end fond of charlie and hes the besthearted lad alive but he cant say no and that will play the mischief with him if he does not take care said archie in his grave kind way  while father was home i was very busy with him so prince got into a set i dont like they try to be fast and think its manly and they flatter him and lead him on to do all sorts of things play for money and bet and loaf about i hate to have him do so and tried to stop it but went to work the wrong way so we got into a mess  he is all ready to make up if you dont say much for he owned to me he was wrong but i dont think he will own it to you in words began rose  i dont care for that if hell just drop those rowdies and come back ill hold my tongue and not preach i wonder if he owes those fellows money and so doesnt like to break off till he can pay it i hope not but dont dare to ask though perhaps steve knows hes always after prince mores the pity and archie looked anxious  i think steve does know for he talked about debts of honour the day i gave him there rose stopped short and turned scarlet  but archie ordered her to fess and had the whole story in five minutes for none dared disobey the chief he completed her affliction by putting a fivedollar bill into her pocket by main force looking both indignant and resolute as he said  never do so again but send steve to me if he is afraid to go to his father charlie had nothing to do with that he wouldnt borrow a penny of a girl dont think it but thats the harm he does steve who adores him and tries to be like him in all things dont say a word ill make it all right and no one shall blame you  oh me i always make trouble by trying to help and then letting out the wrong thing sighed rose much depressed by her slip of the tongue  archie comforted her with the novel remark that it was always best to tell the truth and made her quite cheerful by promising to heal the breach with charlie as soon as possible  he kept his word so well that the very next afternoon as rose looked out of the window she beheld the joyful spectacle of archie and prince coming up the avenue arminarm as of old talking away as if to make up for the unhappy silence of the past weeks  rose dropped her work hurried to the door and opening it wide stood there smiling down upon them so happily that the faces of the lads brightened as they ran up the steps eager to show that all was well with them  heres our little peacemaker said archie shaking hands with vigour  but charlie added with a look that made rose very proud and happy and my little sister    chapter 24which  uncle i have discovered what girls are made for said rose the day after the reconciliation of archie and the prince  well my dear what is it asked dr alec who was planking the deck as he called his daily promenade up and down the hall  to take care of boys answered rose quite beaming with satisfaction as she spoke phebe laughed when i told her and said she thought girls had better learn to take care of themselves first but thats because she hasnt got seven boycousins as i have  she is right nevertheless rosy and so are you for the two things go together and in helping seven lads you are unconsciously doing much to improve one lass said dr alec stopping to nod and smile at the brightfaced figure resting on the old bamboo chair after a lively game of battledore and shuttlecock in place of a run which a storm prevented  am i im glad of that but really uncle i do feel as if i must take care of the boys for they come to me in all sorts of troubles and ask advice and i like it so much only i dont always know what to do and im going to consult you privately and then surprise them with my wisdom  all right my dear whats the first worry i see you have something on your little mind so come and tell uncle  rose put her arm in his and pacing to and fro told him all about charlie asking what she could do to keep him straight and be a real sister to him  could you make up your mind to go and stay with aunt clara a month asked the doctor when she ended  yes sir but i shouldnt like it do you really want me to go  the best cure for charlie is a daily dose of rose water or rose and water or rose and water will you go and see that he takes it laughed dr alec  you mean that if im there and try to make it pleasant he will stay at home and keep out of mischief  exactly  but could i make it pleasant he would want the boys  no danger but hed have the boys for they swarm after you like bees after their queen havent you found that out  aunt plen often says they never used to be here half so much before i came but i never thought i made the difference it seemed so natural to have them round  little modesty doesnt know what a magnet she is but she will find it out some day and the doctor softly stroked the cheek that had grown rosy with pleasure at the thought of being so much loved now you see if i move the magnet to aunt claras the lads will go there as sure as iron to steel and charlie will be so happy at home he wont care for these mischievous mates of his i hope added the doctor well knowing how hard it was to wean a seventeenyearold boy from his first taste of what is called seeing life which alas often ends in seeing death  ill go uncle right away aunt clara is always asking me and will be glad to get me i shall have to dress and dine late and see lots of company and be very fashionable but ill try not to let it hurt me and if i get in a puzzle or worried about anything i can run to you answered rose goodwill conquering timidity  so it was decided and without saying much about the real reason for this visit rose was transplanted to aunt claras feeling that she had a work to do and very eager to do it well  dr alec was right about the bees for the boys did follow their queen and astonished mrs clara by their sudden assiduity in making calls dropping in to dinner and getting up evening frolics charlie was a devoted host and tried to show his gratitude by being very kind to his little sister for he guessed why she came and his heart was touched by her artless endeavours to help him be good  rose often longed to be back in the old house with the simpler pleasures and more useful duties of the life there but having made up her mind in spite of phebe that girls were made to take care of boys here motherly little soul found much to enjoy in the new task she had undertaken  it was a pretty sight to see the one earnest sweetfaced girl among the flock of tall lads trying to understand to help and please them with a patient affection that worked many a small miracle unperceived slang rough manners and careless habits were banished or bettered by the presence of a little gentlewoman and all the manly virtues cropping up were encouraged by the hearty admiration bestowed upon them by one whose good opinion all valued more than they confessed while rose tried to imitate the good qualities she praised in them to put away her girlish vanities and fears to be strong and just and frank and brave as well as modest kind and beautiful  this trial worked so well that when the month was over mac and steve demanded a visit in their turn and rose went feeling that she would like to hear grim aunt jane say as aunt clara did at parting i wish i could keep you all my life dear  after mac and steve had had their turn archie and company bore her away for some weeks and with them she was so happy she felt as if she would like to stay for ever if she could have uncle alec also  of course aunt myra could not be neglected and with secret despair rose went to the mausoleum as the boys called her gloomy abode fortunately she was very near home and dr alec dropped in so often that her visit was far less dismal than she expected between them they actually made aunt myra laugh heartily more than once and rose did her so much good by letting in the sunshine singing about the silent house cooking wholesome messes and amusing the old lady with funny little lectures on physiology that she forgot to take her pills and gave up mums elixir because she slept so well after the long walks and drives she was beguiled into taking that she needed no narcotic  so the winter flew rapidly away and it was may before rose was fairly settled again at home they called her the monthly rose because she had spent a month with each of the aunts and left such pleasant memories of bloom and fragrance behind her that all wanted the family flower back again  dr alec rejoiced greatly over his recovered treasure but as the time drew near when his year of experiment ended he had many a secret fear that rose might like to make her home for the next twelve month with aunt jessie or even aunt clara for charlies sake he said nothing but waited with much anxiety for the day when the matter should be decided and while he waited he did his best to finish as far as possible the task he had begun so well  rose was very happy now being out nearly all day enjoying the beautiful awakening of the world for spring came bright and early as if anxious to do its part the old horsechestnuts budded round her windows green things sprung up like magic in the garden under her hands hardy flowers bloomed as fast as they could the birds sang blithely overhead and every day a chorus of pleasant voices cried good morning cousin isnt it jolly weather  no one remembered the date of the eventful conversation which resulted in the doctors experiment no one but himself at least so when the aunts were invited to tea one saturday they came quite unsuspiciously and were all sitting together having a social chat when brother alec entered with two photographs in his hand  do you remember that he said showing one to aunt clara who happened to be nearest  yes indeed it is very like her when she came quite her sad unchildlike expression and thin little face with the big dark eyes  the picture was passed round and all agreed that it was very like rose a year ago this point being settled the doctor showed the second picture which was received with great approbation and pronounced a charming likeness  it certainly was and a striking contrast to the first one for it was a blooming smiling face full of girlish spirit and health with no sign of melancholy though the soft eyes were thoughtful and the lines about the lips betrayed a sensitive nature  dr alec set both photographs on the chimneypiece and falling back a step or two surveyed them with infinite satisfaction for several minutes then wheeled round saying briefly as he pointed to the two faces  time is up how do you think my experiment has succeeded ladies  bless me so it is cried aunt plenty dropping a stitch in her surprise  beautifully dear answered aunt peace smiling entire approval  she certainly has improved but appearances are deceitful and she had no constitution to build upon croaked aunt myra  i am willing to allow that as far as mere health goes the experiment is a success graciously observed aunt jane unable to forget roses kindness to her mac  so am i and ill go farther for i really do believe alec has done wonders for the child she will be a beauty in two or three years added aunt clara feeling that she could say nothing better than that  i always knew he would succeed and im so glad you all allow it for he deserves more credit than you know and more praise than he will ever get cried aunt jessie clapping her hands with an enthusiasm that caused jamies little red stocking to wave like a triumphal banner in the air  dr alec made them a splendid bow looking much gratified and then said soberly  thank you now the question is shall i go on for this is only the beginning none of you know the hindrances ive had the mistakes ive made the study ive given the case and the anxiety ive often felt sister myra is right is one thing rose is a delicate creature quick to flourish in the sunshine and as quick to droop without it she has no special weakness but inherits her mothers sensitive nature and needs the wisest tenderest care to keep a very ardent little soul from wearing out a finely organised little body i think i have found the right treatment and with you to help me i believe we may build up a lovely and a noble woman who will be a pride and comfort to us all  there dr alec stopped to get his breath for he had spoken very earnestly and his voice got a little husky over the last words a gentle murmur from the aunts seemed to encourage him and he went on with an engaging smile for the good man was slyly trying to win all the ladies to vote for him when the time came  now i dont wish to be selfish or arbitrary because i am her guardian and i shall leave rose free to choose for herself we all want her and if she likes to make her home with any of you rather than with me she shall do so in fact i encouraged her visits last winter that she might see what we can all offer her and judge where she will be happiest is not that the fairest way will you agree to abide by her choice as i do  yes we will said all the aunts in quite a flutter of excitement at the prospect of having rose for a whole year  good she will be here directly and then we will settle the question for another year a most important year mind you for she has got a good start and will blossom rapidly now if all goes well with her so i beg of you dont undo my work but deal very wisely and gently with my little girl for if any harm come to her i think it would break my heart  as he spoke dr alec turned his back abruptly and affected to be examining the pictures again but the aunts understood how dear the child was to the solitary man who had loved her mother years ago and who now found his happiness in cherishing the little rose who was so like her the good ladies nodded and sighed and telegraphed to one another that none of them would complain if not chosen or ever try to rob brother alec of his hearts delight as the boys called rose  just then a pleasant sound of happy voices came up from the garden and smiles broke out on all serious faces dr alec turned at once saying as he threw back his head there she is now for it  the cousins had been amaying and soon came flocking in laden with the spoils  here is our bonny scotch rose with all her thorns about her said dr alec surveying her with unusual pride and tenderness as she went to show aunt peace her basket full of early flowers fresh leaves and curious lichens  leave your clutter in the hall boys and sit quietly down if you choose to stop here for we are busy said aunt plenty shaking her finger at the turbulent clan who were bubbling over with the jollity born of spring sunshine and healthy exercise  of course we choose to stay wouldnt miss our saturday high tea for anything said the chief as he restored order among his men with a nod a word and an occasional shake  what is up a courtmartial asked charlie looking at the assembled ladies with affected awe and real curiosity for these faces betrayed that some interesting business was afloat  dr alec explained in a few words which he made as brief and calm as he could but the effect was exciting nevertheless for each of the lads began at once to bribe entice and wheedle our cousin to choose his home  you really ought to come to us for mothers sake as a relish you know for she must be perfectly satiated with boys began archie using the strongest argument he could think of at the moment  oh do well never slam or bounce at you or call you fraid cat if you only will besought geordie and will distorting their countenances in the attempt to smile with overpowering sweetness  and ill always wash my hands fore i touch you and you shall be my dolly cause pokeys gone away and ill love you hard cried jamie clinging to her with his chubby face full of affection  brothers and sister ought to live together especially when the brother needs some one to make home pleasant for him added charlie with the wheedlesome tone and look that rose always found so difficult to resist  you had her longest and its our turn now mac needs her more than you do prince for shes the light of his eyes he says come rose choose us and ill never use the musky pomade you hate again as long as i live said steve with his most killing air as he offered this noble sacrifice  mac peered wistfully over his goggles saying in an unusually wideawake and earnest way   do cousin then we can study chemistry together my experiments dont blow up very often now and the gases arent at all bad when you get used to them  rose meantime had stood quite still with the flowers dropping from her hands as her eyes went from one eager face to another while smiles rippled over her own at the various enticements offered her during the laugh that followed macs handsome proposition she looked at her uncle whose eyes were fixed on her with an expression of love and longing that went to her heart  ah yes she thought he wants me most ive often longed to give him something that he wished for very much and now i can  so when at a sudden gesture from aunt peace silence fell rose said slowly with a pretty colour in her cheeks and a beseeching look about the room as if asking pardon of the boys  its very hard to choose when everybody is so fond of me therefore i think id better go to the one who seems to need me most  no dear the one you love the best and will be happiest with said dr alec quickly as a doleful sniff from aunt myra and a murmur of my sainted caroline made rose pause and look that way  take time cousin dont be in a hurry to make up your mind and remember codlins your friend added charlie hopeful still  i dont want any time i know who i love best who im happiest with and i choose uncle will he have me cried rose in a tone that produced a sympathetic thrill among the hearers it was so full of tender confidence and love  if she really had any doubt the look in dr alecs face banished it without a word as he opened wide his arms and she ran into them feeling that home was there  no one spoke for a minute but there were signs of emotion among the aunts which warned the boys to bestir themselves before the waterworks began to play so they took hands and began to prance about uncle and niece singing with sudden inspiration the nursery rhyme      ring around a rosy  of course that put an end to all sentiment and rose emerged laughing from dr alecs bosom with the mark of a waistcoat button nicely imprinted on her left cheek he saw it and said with a merry kiss that half effaced it this is my ewe lamb and i have set my mark on her so no one can steal her away  that tickled the boys and they set up a shout of      uncle had a little lamb  but rose hushed the noise by slipping into the circle and making them dance prettily like lads and lasses round a maypole while phebe coming in with fresh water for the flowers began to twitter chirp and coo as if all the birds of the air had come to join in the spring revel of the eight cousins
